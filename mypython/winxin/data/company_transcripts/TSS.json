[Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Shawn Roberts, Senior Director of TSYS Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Shawn Roberts", "Thank you, Nicole, and welcome, everyone. We will begin this evening's call with opening comments by TSYS Chairman and CEO, Troy Woods, followed by TSYS CFO, Paul Todd reviewing the fourth quarter and full year 2016 highlights and consolidated financials as well as our 2017 guidance.", "Troy and Paul will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of this slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental schedules are available on our website at investors.TSYS.com. After Troy and Paul's remarks, we'll open the call up for Q&A. And I will remind everyone that while participating in the Q&A, you will have the opportunity to ask one question and one follow-up before being put back into the queue.", "I'll now call your attention to the fact that we will be making some forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS' actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in TSYS' reports filed with the SEC, including its 2015 annual report on Form 10-K.", "We will also discuss items that do not conform to GAAP. We reconcile those measures to GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation, and in the supplemental schedules to the press release.", "At this point, I'll turn the call over to Troy Woods.", "Troy Woods", "Thank you, Shawn. Good afternoon and Happy New Year. The TSYS team members across our global footprint have delivered another outstanding performance for the fourth quarter and for all of 2016. Some of the highlights and callouts for the fourth quarter were record-setting transactions, authorizations and volumes, performing with operational excellence during the holiday shopping period, repurchasing 500,000 shares of stock. Reducing our debt an additional $100 million, and expanding our adjusted operating margins in all four segments on a constant currency basis.", "Also during the quarter, we were able to settle the TCPA litigation matter regarding CPAY in our merchant segment and also entered settlement negotiations with the FTC regarding the complaint against NetSpend. As a result of the CPAY settlement and the ongoing FTC negotiations, we incurred a non-recurring charge of $19.5 million during the fourth quarter. While admitting no wrongdoing, we felt that these two actions were in our best interest to put behind us so we could focus on moving forward.", "For the full year of 2016, we increased our adjusted earnings per share by 14.5%. We increased our corporate adjusted operating margin by 144 basis points. This is the second straight year-over-year margin expansion and our largest margin in eight years. We exceeded our one-year transfers to expense synergy target of $5 million in the first eight months. We reduced our debt by $400 million over the past three quarters, and we generated in excess of $575 million in free cash flow. A new record for our Company.", "I will address a few additional items across our enterprise, and then ask Paul to provide additional financial highlights. First in our North American and International issuer segments. As you know, we announced last month that Bill Pruett, Senior Executive Vice President and President of our North America segment, will be retiring from TSYS effective April 1. I have known and worked with Bill for over 40 years, and he has made an enormous contribution to TSYS over his tenure.", "I cannot think of anyone who has had a greater impact on this Company, our team members and our clients than Bill. We will certainly miss Bill and wish him much rest and relaxation in his retirement.", "But before he rides off into the sunset, we have asked Bill to assist us over the next few months in combining our North America and International issuer segments into one new reporting segment, Issuer Solutions. Over the past 12 to 15 months, we have brought together our technology, conversions and product teams of these two segments as we solve synergies and efficiencies.", "We continue to believe that there are additional advantages that we can leverage by combining the remainder of the two segments, while continuing to manage our client relationships at the local level. Effective with Bill's retirement, Gaylon Jowers, currently Senior EVP and President of International, will assume the role of President Issuer Solutions.", "Also in conjunction with Gaylon's promotion and Bill's retirement, Kelley Knutson, Executive Vice President International, will assume the role of President International. And Allen Pettis, Executive Vice President North America, has been promoted to President North America. Gaylon, Kelley and Allen are all seasoned improvement executives, and I'm very confident that they will continue to perform at the highest levels in their new roles and new responsibilities.", "We have very good momentum in our issuing business as we move into 2017. Our customer base is strong and stable. Our customers continue to aggressively market credit and debit cards, as evidenced by our customers adding over 41 million net traditional accounts to our platforms in 2016.", "Now let's turn our attention to our Merchant segment. This Thursday will mark the first anniversary of the announcement of our acquisition of TransFirst, the largest acquisition in our history that doubled the size of our Merchant business. It has been nine months since the closing of the acquisition, and we are pleased that the integration work and synergy goals remain solidly on track.", "And while the integration work continues, we remain relentlessly focused on growing the business. In 2016 on a pro forma basis, our direct organic revenue grew 8.4% on volume growth of 6%. We believe that our robust distribution network, product set, channel diversification and fast-growing integrated channel will continue to allow us to grow this segment in the 7% to 9% range.", "On the leadership front, we have made significant progress with respect to identifying our next President of the Merchant segment and we should be in a position to make an announcement in the next few weeks. And finally, I would like to make a few comments about NetSpend.", "Now that we have certainty around the new CFPB rules and the prepaid industry, we're focused on new product launches and execution. We were able to sign several new and renewed contracts during the quarter with key partners like PayPal, 7-11, Giant Eagle and Liberty Tax.", "Over the past few quarters, we've mentioned the importance of product innovation to our prepaid growth story and diversification plans. Our small business prepaid product has now fully launched for sole proprietors, and is available in 7-11, select Office Depot stores and online.", "The NetSpend team also continues to work toward the launch of our new demand deposit account product in 2017 for customers who desire a bank account. We are very excited about serving these new audiences, as we seek to grow our spend volume beyond the $28.7 billion level in 2016.", "When the CFPB rules became final, our largest distribution partner informed us that they would be introducing a demand deposit account program to help expand their product offering. Although NetSpend has enjoyed exclusivity on all GPR products with this partner, there were no such provisions for demand deposit accounts.", "To serve this new product need and secure the long-term relationship with one of our largest distribution partners, we have entered into negotiations with this partner with respect to their demand deposit account business. It is anticipated that certain commission concessions will be made to secure this new business. The revenue and margin guidance that we are providing for 2017 includes these anticipated changes. With strong growth, execution, key partnership wins and product innovation, we remain optimistic about the long-term outlook for our prepaid and self-banking businesses.", "All in all, it was solid execution and performance by all team members in the fourth quarter and throughout 2016. With the economy on the upswing, the health of the financial sector improving and the continued secular trend of cash payments moving to electronic payments, we see another great opportunity to deliver double-digit earnings growth in 2017.", "I'll now ask Paul Todd to provide additional detailed financial information on our quarter, the year and review our guidance for 2017. Paul?", "Paul Todd", "Thank you, Troy, and I'd like to reiterate how pleased we are with the quarter's performance and our full-year results. I will cover our consolidated and segment performance and 2017 outlook starting with slide 6. Fourth-quarter total and net revenues were up 57.9% and 21.8% respectively from last year. Full-year 2016 total revenues increased 50% from 2015 with a net revenues increasing 21.7%. Non-GAAP adjusted EPS increased 24.5% for the quarter and 14.5% for the year to $2.81.", "Adjusted EBITDA increased 36.7% in 4Q, as we crossed the billion-dollar mark on full-year adjusted EBITDA to $1.04 billion, an increase of 24.8%. The 33.9% adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was up 369 basis points and yearly adjusted EBITDA margin was 34.2%, up 84 basis points. The second straight year of expanding adjusted EBITDA margins.", "Free cash flow increased 81.7% for the quarter, the third straight quarter of double-digit free cash flow growth. Free cash flow for the year was $575.3 million, up 45% and slightly above the high end of our revised expectation range of $550 million to $570 million as we were able to yield more from our TransFirst acquisition related tax benefits. We expect our free cash flow for 2017 to be in the $580 million to $610 million range.", "Before I get into the segment results, I want to comment further on the two legal expense items that Troy mentioned regarding Central Payment and the FTC matter which we incurred in the fourth quarter that are not included in our adjusted segment operating results but contributed to the reduction to our GAAP EPS for the quarter.", "First, is on Central Payment, where we have settled the TCPA litigation we disclosed in our third-quarter 10-Q for $6.5 million without admitting any wrongdoing in order to avoid the costs associated with protracted litigation. The settlement agreement has received preliminary court approval, and we currently expect final approval before the end of the second quarter.", "Second, as you know, during the quarter, we disclosed that NetSpend was subject to a complaint filed by the FTC alleging that certain NetSpend marketing materials were deceptive. While NetSpend does not admit any wrongdoing, it has decided to enter into settlement discussions in an effort to avoid the costs associated with protracted litigation. We incurred a charge of $13 million to GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter in connection with the settlement discussions.", "Moving to our segment results starting on slide 8 in North America. First on growth, the segment grew net revenue 1.4% for the quarter and 5.1% for the year. There have been several moving parts in our North America growth story over the past two years that will begin to mute out in 2017. For example, if you remove the prepaid processing and EMV related net revenue in both periods for the fourth quarter, the segment net revenue quarterly increase of 1.4% would increase to the 4% to 5% growth range.", "Next on margin, quarterly segment margin of 38.5% was up 384 basis points and full-year margin of 38.8% was an increase of 143 basis points. The second straight year of margin expansion for the segment. Finally on 2017 outlook for North America. While we will be reporting this segment combined with our International segment as part of our new Issuer Solutions segment in 2017, on a standalone basis, we expect net revenue growth to be in the previously communicated 5% to 7% range. And the business to perform in that range on a quarterly basis in 2017 with the exception of the first quarter, which we expect to be in the 3% to 5% growth range due to some one-time items in the first quarter of 2016 that we will be comparing against. And on margin for 2017, we would expect it to expand by approximately 100 basis points on a standalone basis.", "Now on to International on slide 9, first on growth. As has been the case all year, our International business has continued to grow constant currency revenue at a faster pace than we had expected. Fourth-quarter reported net revenue was down 11.6%, but up 6.2% constant currency. Yearly reported revenue was down 5.3%, but up 6.7% constant currency.", "On margin, the 19.7% reported quarterly margin is down due to currency, but is up year over year constant currency. The reported yearly margin of 18.1% is roughly flat, but up constant currency. And we have achieved our operational margin expansion goals for the year. On 2017 outlook for International. While we will report this in our Issuer Solutions segment in 2017, on a standalone basis, we expect a constant currency growth rate in the 5% to 7% range with a segment margin improvement of 100 plus basis point constant currency.", "Looking at China. While we do not include the financial performance of CUP data in our International segment results, our CUP data JV continued is double-digit growth and expanded its market presence in the Chinese card processing market.", "Finally on the outlook for our new Issuer Solutions segment. We expect net revenue growth to be in the 5% to 7% range constant currency, and we expect the current pro forma adjusted segment operating margin that is in the 34% to 35% range to expand by 100 plus basis points in 2017. We have a schedule in our press release showing the recapped 2015 and 2016 results as if the Issuer Solutions segment had been in place.", "Now onto slide 10 and our Merchant segment. On growth, net revenue grew 108.1% for the quarter and 89.5% for the year. We grew our direct business organically in the 7% to 9% range for the year, driven in part by our integrated channel which grew in the strong double-digits in the quarter and represents approximately 30% of our direct business.", "On margin, segment margin was 34.9% for the quarter, up 780 basis points. The yearly margin increased more than 250 basis points to 34.2%. On 2017 outlook, we expect Merchant net revenue to grow in the 7% to 9% range organically after Q1 when we lap the TransFirst acquisition. We also expect 2017 margin to expand by approximately 50 basis points.", "I would like to share with you that we are in discussions to purchase an additional 10% of the Central Payment joint venture next month, bringing our ownership to 85%. CPAY continues to deliver strong double-digit growth to our direct business, and we are excited about owning more of the joint venture.", "Now on to NetSpend on slide 11, first on growth. Net revenue grew 11.5% for the quarter, ahead of our expectations and marking the 20th consecutive quarter of double-digit net revenue growth. For the year, net revenue grew to 14.3%. On margin, fourth-quarter segment margin increased 182 basis points to 21.7% and full-year margin increased 42 basis points to 24.2%.", "Finally on outlook for NetSpend, our expectation right now is for 2017 net revenue growth to be in the 3% to 5% range for the year. Excluding the negative impact of the CFPB rules, the growth rate would be in the range of 6% to 8%. We have mentioned over the past few quarters that we expect NetSpend's growth to slow somewhat on a core organic basis as the prepaid market matures. And some of our past growth initiatives, particularly the Western Union, Brinks, Paychex and Walmart normalize. We also expect to see some delay and other affects in our tax volumes this year from the recent tax legislation affecting refund timing that has recently been in the press.", "Finally, on the margin outlook, we expect the segment margin to be in the 19% to 21% range for the full year of 2017, with the lower margin profile in the back half of the year as the CFPB effects impacts our third and fourth quarters among other effects.", "This 19% to 21% range includes the previously communicated expected impact of the CFPB rules, the anticipated modification of selected distribution partner relationships to include our new demand deposit account and other expected impacts of investments in the NetSpend business. As I detailed on our last call, our expectations for this year and next during this transitory period at NetSpend are based on assumptions around many factors that could positively or negatively affect our performance.", "Now I want to move to our full-year consolidated guidance on slide 14. Before I get into the numbers, I want to highlight that we will be moving to diluted EPS for this 2017 guidance and results commentary this year. The impact of this move decreases our adjusted EPS by roughly $0.01, but we wanted to go ahead and make this move as it is more comparative to our industry peers.", "Now onto the key highlights regarding our guidance. We expect total revenue to be in the range of $4.75 billion to $4.85 billion, a growth rate range of 14% to 16%. We expect net revenue to be the range of $3.275 billion to $3.375 billion, a growth rate range of 8% to 11%.", "We expect GAAP EPS to be in the range of $2.14 to $2.21, a growth rate range of 23% to 28%. And we expect our adjusted diluted EPS to be in the $3.05 to $3.15 range, a growth rate range of 9% to 12% based on 185 million diluted shares outstanding.", "This is inclusive of approximately $0.03 of negative currency impact. Also as mentioned, there is $0.01 of negative impact related to our basic to diluted share transition, and we expect our effective tax rate to be in the 33% to 34% range. Finally, I want to wrap up with three key takeaways from today's call. First on performance, all of our segments hit or exceeded their revenue growth goals for the quarter and year and expanded their margins on a constant currency basis, allowing for our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin to expand by 84 basis points for the year, our second consecutive year of such expansion.", "We expect this consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin to again increase by approximately 50 basis points in 2017. Clearly, our margin expansion plans are working.", "Second, our consolidated guidance growth range on revenue and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS points to another year of outstanding performance. I want to reiterate that our adjusted diluted EPS guidance includes $0.03 anticipated negative currency impact. Also our 2017 adjusted diluted EPS is $0.01 lower than adjusted EPS.", "Finally, we are rapidly improving our capital position, with $400 million of deleveraging over the last three quarters in 2016. Allowing for some small repurchase activity in the quarter, while our goal of reducing debt for 2017 remains on target.", "In all, we couldn't be more pleased with how our diversified payments company performed in 2016, and how that strength of diversification positions us for 2017. And with that, we will open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays.", "Darrin Peller", "I just want to touch base first on the North America segment. The growth in traditional accounts on file, we have now seen 9% plus for a couple of quarters in a row. Obviously that is pretty strong. Once you anniversary the Rush Card Green Dot coming off the business. Can you just comment on the real profile? 5% to 7% North America is pretty strong. What is happening in the business? Is there any new addition of accounts? Is that all just organic off the same existing clients and sustainability to that? Thanks.", "Paul Todd", "Yes, Darrin. Why don't I start off and then I'll turn it over to Troy and he may have some things to add. I will say as it relates to the fourth quarter accounts on file growth, as I commented earlier, we had a lot of moving parts in the fourth quarter, but when you start adjusting those out, the growth rate of revenue starts in getting closer to that accounts on file growth rate.", "I would also say that as you look forward to our expected account on file growth rate in 2017, it has a tighter correlation to the 5% to 7% revenue growth that we are expecting for the business. And then finally, I would say that obviously as we have gotten more diversified in our offering in our Issuer Solutions segment, that correlation can move depending on business mix. So I think we're going to see a tighter correlation next year, and we had those items in the third and fourth quarter that grew some differential there.", "Darrin Peller", "And just one quick follow up on the NetSpend side of the business. I think you said 6% to 8% outlook for the business excluding the CFPB impacts. I'm just a little surprised. Typically, you've been double-digit growth. What do you really attribute the deceleration to? Can you give us a little more color? Is it just -- I think you said anniversarying some of the big partnerships you've had. Still it seems like the underlying drivers of your business continue to work very well.", "Paul Todd", "Sure, Darrin. I think there's three things that play here on that 6% to 8% before the CFPB impact. One is, and I commented on this in our last call around a maturing market. And so we are seeing some market maturing, and we had expected in the third quarter for there to be some deceleration in the sequential quarter growth rate between the third quarter and the fourth quarter, and it actually held relatively constant. But we have that overall industry growth rate and there's been some stuff in the press here recently about that as well.", "We also have some as our direct channel has really lapped the field over the last several years around their growth rate. We do have some saturation on some of the marketing that we are doing there.", "We want to make sure we are always spending our marketing to get the kind of requisite return that we see, and so there is some maturation there that we're pivoting around. And then the final thing is there is some uncertainty on this tax season, and we want to see that play out. So those would be the three things that I would point to as support for the 6% to 8%.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Timothy Willi of Wells Fargo.", "Timothy Willi", "My first question was on North America issuer services. And I guess as you think about North America, and I guess your read from your salesforce and your conversations around the tone of bank issuers with what appears to be right now a favorable backdrop for earnings and potentially regulation. Do you sense that there are more opportunities to see banks get more aggressive and more growth initiatives around their card issuing businesses than probably we've seen in the last couple of years, particularly as they were preparing and then rolling out EMV?", "Troy Woods", "And I'll take that and Paul can certainly add to it on the back end if he has anything. Yes, I think in the conversations that we're having during our quarterly business reviews, I don't think there's any doubt that the 05's are feeling much more healthier than they were a few quarters ago. I mentioned that in my opening remarks. We have seen now two straight quarters of roughly 10 million accounts a quarter being added to our system on a combined basis in North America and International.", "We still don't see any reason why we cannot on an organic basis continue to grow new accounts in the 6% to 9% range each year, so, yes, they feel good. It is one of the largest ROA businesses inside an FI as a credit card business. So they are feeling getting pretty good, we are feeling pretty good and that is why we feel pretty good about the numbers that we have shared with you today going forward.", "Timothy Willi", "And then my follow up was tied into issuing, but also Merchant. Could you just talk a bit about -- I know you have had some more focus over the last couple of years around the card issuing business and going downstream to smaller regionals and community type banks. And TransFirst had a very good business around partnerships and referral partnerships with those same types of institutions. Can you just talk about the card issuing business downstream, but to the extent that you can also tie in the cross-selling opportunity with Merchant if that makes sense?", "Troy Woods", "Yes, you are right. Several years ago, Tim, as you well remember, we talked about moving more downstream and we also talked a lot about focusing on what we call at that time the start overs and the do overs. And I think we have been extremely successful in the regional bank space with those that got back into the credit card business like Regents Bank and others. I think with respect to going downmarket, I would say that has been a mixed bag of success. We primarily lean on some of our other customers to go sign up those banks, and us on the back end doing the processing. I think as it relates to cross sell, Pam, you may want to touch on that a little bit from a Merchant perspective.", "Pam Joseph", "Yes, we have had invitation to go talk to some of our regional card issuers about their merchant processing businesses. Again, we are focused on contracts and contract expiration dates, so at this point we don't have anything to report from a standpoint of any wins. But we are in dialogue with them, and will continue to work with them and hopefully at some point when one of them is up for renewal we will have an opportunity there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "So the question is for the proposed issuer processing segment. Can you comment on the process of bringing together the two pieces you mentioned, investments you're making, from a systems perspective? Should there not be associated synergies from processing, IT, lower G&A and things like that? So can you size and discuss the timing of those potentially also?", "Troy Woods", "As I indicated in my prepared remarks, over the past 12 to 15 months, we have looked at these two businesses. There are a lot of similarities in these two businesses. Clearly, there are some differences, geography being of course the largest.", "But over that 12 to 15 month period, we have already combined the technology sides of the business which were separate. All of our implementation services groups, which sometimes refer to as conversions. And then when we hired Karim Ahmad to come in and head up global product, as we talked about a couple of quarters ago, at that time we also took the advantage of combining issuer product under one leader.", "So we've be thinking about this now for some time, and as I said earlier, we do think there are still some advantages around some additional back office functions, some operational functions, that we can take advantage of as we continue to seek more efficiencies and synergies. We will continue to run the businesses at the local level. Anything we can do that makes sense for the end customer to consolidate, that's what we'll do, and of course bringing it under one executive leader.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Okay. I was hoping actually if you could size some of those forward synergies, but we can take that off-line. The other question I had, Troy, is, you guys used to give a fairly tight $0.03, $0.04 range for your guidance. It moved to a wider $0.07 range, more like a $0.10 range this year. Fundamentally, is this indicative of lower levels of visibility, higher fluctuations? Are you just being more conservative with the wide range, and what does $3.05 mean from an assumption perspective versus $3.15? Can you comment on that?", "Paul Todd", "We obviously have gotten to a higher number as it relates to the overall adjusted diluted EPS number, and so with that higher number, obviously you've got a lot more moving parts that are going there. So I think that's obviously a factor. As I mentioned earlier, we have several things that are going on in the business this year. And then finally I think that if you looked at us relative to peers, that range certainly is commensurate with what peers in the processing industry or payments industry are doing. So I would point to those three factors, nothing really more.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Georgios Mihalos of Cowen.", "Georgios Mihalos", "Thank you and thanks for all the color on the new segment, guys, that's very helpful. So I think I will start off on the prepaid side. I just want to make sure, the change with your large customer which I think is a large cash checker, that will have no impact on 2017 revenue but have an impact on margins? Then should we be thinking that will bring the margin down on a standalone basis somewhere around 2% to 3%? Is that the right way to think about it?", "Troy Woods", "I will take the front end of that, Georgios. Yes, that is exactly correct. As I think Paul indicated earlier, there is some degradation for the revenue, it is all on the margin side. As for the ongoing margin of the two -- .", "Paul Todd", "Yes, I think, Georgios, at this stage, since it's not finalized we wouldn't comment on a specific margin impact to one customer. But as I mentioned earlier, the margin expectations for the business have the three factors that I outlined, the CFPB impact we've communicated before, this impact, as well as some other investments in the business.", "Georgios Mihalos", "Okay. And then maybe just going to the International segment, which obviously on a constant currency basis was very strong. I think you said again margins would have expanded year over year had it not been for FX. So is it that the margin impact, and I think revenue was down 5 points when we do the adjustment or a little bit more than that, but if we look at margins, would they have been about 25% then on a year-over-year basis compared to the 24.5%?", "Paul Todd", "I think if you looked at the contribution margin of that, it would be higher as a percent there. And we break that out into supplemental schedule as it relates to the currency margin impact. And as I talked about for next year, there is about 60 basis points roughly of revenue growth clippage that we get on currency and about $0.03. And that is the commensurate margin impact for currency in our 2017 outlook as it was in our 2016 effect.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Davie Koning of Baird.", "Dave Koning", "I guess my first question is just in the Merchant segment, I think a while ago when you made the acquisition of TransFirst transfers you mentioned $15 million or so of synergies. And I think you said that won't really come on much until 2017, if I remember right. My question is if those all fall in 2017, if that is correct, that alone would be 150 basis points of margin improvement and you've guided to about 50 basis points of margin improvement. So maybe just walk through the synergy expectations around transfers.", "Paul Todd", "Sure, David. At the time, we communicated $5 million in the first 12 months, $15 million in 2017 and then $25 million in the third year. And essentially, we have beat the $5 million target that Troy mentioned earlier. So you essentially almost cut the year-over-year margin improvement in roughly half from just related to that synergy on an isolated basis.", "So the approximately 50 basis points, it could be higher than that, but the approximately 50 basis points that we have outlined is reflective of a higher run rate of synergies that we have embedded in the 2016 actuals and then slightly exceeding the estimation that we had made at the time of the acquisition for 2017.", "Dave Koning", "And then just the follow up, along the same lines in the Merchant segment, how fast are transfers standalone and TSYS standalone growing? Is it pretty close? I'm just wondering, Q4 and even into Q1 and I know after that they will be all blended together.", "Paul Todd", "Sure, David. They are growing at a very close rate. So we said at the time when we brought these two businesses together there were two great dynamics about the financial aspects of the business. They've had similar net margins, and the growth rates were relatively similar. So that has held true in both our 2016 results, and also in our 2017 results. And as evidenced by the fact that we are in that 7% to 9% range organically for 2016, and also in that 7% to 9% organic range in 2017.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brett Huff of Stephens.", "Brett Huff", "My question is on the -- can you just remind us of the various headwinds came in and impacted your revenue growth in 2016, and how those might roll forward into 2017? So specifically, EMV and then the two prepaid card contracts I think are the two big ones, but if there is others that would be great to just make sure we understand what the underlying growth last year and now in 2017 would be.", "Paul Todd", "Sure. On in North America basis, I highlighted those two impacts rather discreetly in this fourth quarter. Because I said that while we reported 1.4% for North America quarterly revenue, if you took out the two items, the EMV specifically related and prepaid from both quarters and compare, that put us in the 4% to 5% growth range. So that gives you a feel for what that -- at least on this quarterly basis.", "And you will recall that the EMV was really just a third and the fourth quarter impact primarily where we saw that surge, and we're clearly seeing it in the fourth quarter with our output and managed services actually decreasing on a year-over-year basis. So those would be the two things that we would highlight.", "As I said earlier, the only really outstanding comparative challenge that we have in 2017, the two one-time items that we had in first quarter of 2016 that we are comparing against. If you take those out, you get back to a 5% to 7% first-quarter expected growth range. So those would be the things on the North America side.", "And then on International, which will all be together on our new Issuer Solutions segment, we or course had the 100 plus basis points of currency headwinds that we had. And as I commented, we are expecting that to be roughly around 60 or so basis points in 2017.", "Brett Huff", "Okay. And my second question is, you had commented I think that the guidance that you've given for the year accommodates or contemplates any big renewals that are coming up. Can you articulate those renewals for us and just remind us who or how many or how large those are, particularly in the new combined issuing segment, but if there is others that we should be paying attention to?", "Troy Woods", "Well we've indicated before, we do have one of our large issuers and have their contract up for renewal toward the end of 2017. We have another one on the International side, one of our top-20 customers that we are working on.", "And then third, I guess I would just call out again the fact that we are in negotiation with a very large partner of ours on the NetSpend side negotiating a contract with respect to demand deposit accounts. But all of that is baked into the guidance, the revenue and earnings guidance, that we have provided.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.", "Bryan Keane", "Just a follow up on that, Troy, do those contract renewals that happened in the end of 2017, will that have an impact or some negative impact in 2018 as usually you get maybe more volume for a lower price?", "Paul Todd", "Brian, we have all that baked in. So the estimated impacts of all those are baked in to, certainly on the issuer side, they're baked into the 5% to 7%. So we've baked in the expected impact of all the renewals that are underway.", "Bryan Keane", "Okay. And in 2018 and beyond, that is just the normal course of business, so that's also in the 5% to 7%. That's what you're saying?", "Troy Woods", "I think the key point again, Brian, as we've said before, we've telegraphed to you the 5% to 7% in 2017 and 2018. We are stopping short of beyond, we don't need to go there yet.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Kwok of KBW.", "Steven Kwok", "Just first question just around the tax return issue, is that going to impact the full year or is it going to impact the first quarter? And if it's the first quarter, how should we think about that?", "Troy Woods", "I think, Steven, time will tell. But right now of course with the passage of the PATH Act, it is clearly going to delay some returns going out for certain individual early filers. I think we will just have to see how that picks back us, is it just a pure timing issue or not. And we really won't know a lot about that until really toward the end of the first quarter. Paul, I don't know if you want to add to that?", "Steven Kwok", "Okay. And then second question was around the free cash flow, you've mentioned $580 million to $610 million next year. How should we think about from a use of capital perspective, how much are you going to use to pay down debt? And then does your guidance contemplate buying back shares?", "Paul Todd", "Sure, Steven. So we obviously have our remaining $400 million of deleveraging that is part of our deleveraging plan of the $800 million. So that will be one of the first uses of the free cash flow; obviously our dividend stays at the similar level.", "I mentioned earlier around the Central Payments, the additional purchase of the 10% related to Central Payments. And so the guidance does not include any anticipated share repurchase. Just like we did in 2016 to the degree that all of those prior commitments are made and there is excess free cash flow you can see us with some type of repurchase, but nothing of any sizable nature and the guidance doesn't reflect any repurchase activity.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from [indiscernible] of Evercore ISI.", "David Togut", "Thanks, David Togut with Evercore ISI. A question on the regulatory front, CFPB and FTC obviously have been very active in your businesses. With the new administration in place indicating an intention to reduce regulation quite significantly, how will this impact the way you run your businesses?", "Troy Woods", "Hey, David, Troy. I will take that. Certainly we are following just like anybody else about some of the dialogue and narrative going on in Washington about less regulations. I think it is way too early for us to try to comment on what it might mean to our business.", "We've clearly looked at it, we look at what they're talking about doing perhaps around Dodd Frank, around maybe Durbin, around other issues. I think we'll just have to see how some of that plays over the course of the following months before we can really begin to take it into consideration for our business.", "David Togut", "Understood. Just as a quick follow up, given the outperformance on TransFirst synergies, what particular areas accounted for the outperformance above the $5 million target that you had for 2016?", "Troy Woods", "I think a couple of things. On some of our operations, we adapted some of those integrations a little bit faster than we thought. We're also from a people standpoint, we've consolidated some of those operations as well, faster. We still have a few more to go in the next couple of months. But probably more than anything it's been around getting to those synergies faster than originally anticipated.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.", "Jason Kupferberg", "So just on the 2017 guidance, is there anything in the free cash flow part of the guidance for the potential payout of the two settlements, the $20 million or so in aggregate you talked about? And is there anything in the 2017 P&L guidance, or how much is in the 2017 P&L guidance for the additional 10% of CPAY that it sounds like you're going to buy?", "Paul Todd", "Yes, Jason. So as it relates to the free cash flow guidance, that is inclusive of the settlement payouts. And as it relates to guidance, it is inclusive of the additional purchase of Central Payments, the additional 10%.", "Jason Kupferberg", "How much revenue is that worth?", "Paul Todd", "It's not any revenue because we consolidated today. So it's not added into revenue and it's de minimis on the EPS side. It is slightly additive, but it's relatively small.", "Jason Kupferberg", "Okay. And then just any more specifics on the integrated channel growth at Merchant? I know you mentioned double digits. Should we think of that as the 10% to 12% range, and is that the same kind of range you would expect for 2017?", "Paul Todd", "So it is higher double digits. It's in the high double digits, so 10% to 12% would be too low. It's in the high double digits, and we expect that kind of growth going forward.", "Jason Kupferberg", "We are seeing actually some very good opportunities. Our integrators include a number of healthcare integrators, and we are seeing very, very good growth there and good opportunity to sign their merchants and locations that are downstream.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Larry Berlin of First Analysis.", "Larry Berlin", "Evening, guys. Just a quick question, post-acquisition and merger with TransFirst, how has the turnover on employees below the top levels and the turnover of customers been compared to your expectations?", "Pam Joseph", "Actually, we've had very good retention of customers. There was a large bank partner that left before we bought transfers, then that has come off as the system over the course of this year. But other than that, we have had very good retention of customers.", "They do again focus on smaller banks and smaller merchants in a lot of our segments, and those performed very well and we haven't had any significant attrition. As well as at the management level, we have had duplication across all of our senior managers and group managers in the business, and we have targeted some reduction as part of our synergies.", "But most of what you have seen has been because we have chosen those folks to take a severance and leave the organization. so I feel good about the business, and I feel very good about the senior management and the talent that we have retained and that we have on board.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer.", "Glenn Greene", "So last quarter, you gave us some clarity on the CFPB issue related to NetSpend. And so a couple aspects related to that I just want to get an update on. The new product pipeline and your assumptions within 2017 related to that new product revenue, and also just a clarification of the drag in the back half of 2017 related to the new CFPB rules. And what's the continued drag that we should be assuming going to 2018? I'm just trying to get that into context with the new frame of growth for the NetSpend business.", "Paul Todd", "Sure, Glenn. So we had communicated $0.06 to $0.08 of EPS drag in 2017, and we still expect that drag to occur in that range. $20 million to $25 million was the revenue drag, and we are expecting that drag to be the right range for 2017. And it is really primarily a fourth quarter, although some of the compliance-related spending starts in the third quarter. So that is all in tact.", "If you recall, we had an additional similar drag in -- our expectation was 2018 an additional $0.05 to $0.07 of drag, and that was net of our mitigation, or our business expansion strategies that we had around the additional products. And all of that is still in tact with how we sit right now. But as I said earlier we're we are going to need to let things play out in 2017. Our DDA product to get launch, to see adoption rates, so on and so forth to comment on that further, but right now the commentary we gave around that in our last call is still in tact.", "Glenn Greene", "Okay, so status quo on that all else equal. And then just a quick number thing, I don't know if you gave it, but the like for like TransFirst growth in the quarter meaning if you had it a year ago. What did TransFirst look like from a growth perspective?", "Paul Todd", "I think we didn't give that. We basically said for the year, like for like TransFirst grew in that 7% to 9% range.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Davis of Stifel.", "John Davis", "I also just wanted another quick follow up on TransFirst. I think when the deal was announced you expected $400 million of revenue or so in 2016, did that -- where did you end up versus that initial estimate? And then I've got a follow up after that, thanks.", "Paul Todd", "So we didn't explicitly call out the additive number in 2016, I think that is more of an annualized impact. But if you look at it roughly, $125 million a quarter or around that range, that is relatively close. And if you look and you see the impact what we've had over the last three quarters and relative to what we had in the first quarter of 2017, you look that year-over-year growth rate, that is relatively commensurate.", "John Davis", "Okay. And then quickly, just touch a little bit on capital allocation. I appreciated the first half of this year is likely to continue deleveraging, but as you approach the second half of 2017 I think you will get to a point where you could potentially look at M&A or buybacks.", "So maybe, Troy, if you could just address what areas of your business you might like to look for any potential targets? And as you look at the overall business, what would you like to have? And that would be helpful, thanks.", "Troy Woods", "Sure, John. As we've indicated on several occasions before that we feel like we are playing where we want to play, issuer processing, merchant acquiring and prepaid self-banking. So I don't really see us clearly in the future playing in a fourth segment, if you will, or adding a fourth leg to the stool.", "As is relates to those three, we'll continually look at opportunistic opportunities. It could be a product play on the issuing side. We'll continue to look at opportunities that may come up in both NetSpend and the Merchant business.", "But as Paul indicated earlier, we are going to continue to be very focused on deleveraging the balance sheet back to what we've committed to do to take us probably through the year 2017. So that will be our primary focus for the rest of this year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from James Schneider of Goldman Sachs.", "James Schneider", "You guided to both the North America and the International segments to do roughly the same amount of growth, the 5% to 7% range as for the whole segment. Can you maybe give us a sense about which of those you have greater confidence in in terms of being able to deliver upside? And can you give us a little bit of a sense of how much you expect of value-added services to contribute to that?", "Paul Todd", "Jim, I will start off, and if Troy wants to add anything to it. I wouldn't necessarily comment on which we have more upside. We are comfortable with both of those businesses growing at 5% to 7% on a constant currency basis. I would mention that as I think we called out on our last call that we are having an improving pipeline on our International side, and we've had a much more stabilization of comparative factors. So as I said earlier, we are expecting that 5% to 7% growth to be very consistent from a quarterly basis in that range as we look to 2017. So both businesses have gotten to a good organic growth range on a constant currency basis and we're pleased that when you combine them together we are also expecting that 100 plus basis points margin expansion on both of them.", "James Schneider", "And just on the value-added services contribution, you expect?", "Paul Todd", "Value-added services for 2017, we're expecting -- we have been -- that has moved around a little bit But when you look at that, it also gets back more into a normalized range. The first quarter we've got some comparative challenges with some custom programming that we did in the first quarter of 2016, but outside of that. If you look really, our volume based and our non-volume based, both of those and being in that 5% to 7% range generally speaking on both a yearly basis but also a quarterly basis.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matthew O'Neill of Autonomous Research.", "Matthew O'Neill", "One quick follow up on the Merchant segment. You mentioned on a pro forma basis direct organic revenues grew 8.4% versus of volume of 6%. So I was just wondering how you could parse that between pricing and mix? And maybe more broadly, just the competitive backdrop from a pricing perspective with respect to attrition and the stickiness of some of the newer integrated offerings. I will leave it there, thanks.", "Troy Woods", "Matthew, we really don't provide the details on the componentry of our pricing and the mix of that, so I will leave it at that. I think when you think about the pricing in the marketplace, clearly I don't think it's really any different. It's competitive. As Pam indicated earlier, we have not lost any customers since we have made the acquisition since TSYS has owned TransFirst. We signed free agent [indiscernible] this last quarter. We signed three new very substantial healthcare partners, and also signed up a new healthcare partner that is going to be a very impactful new start up. So it is always competitive. Price is important, but I think product set and service is also equally important. So we feel good about the opportunity to grow it in 2017.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Shawn Roberts for any closing remarks.", "Shawn Roberts", "Thank you. We don't really have any closing remarks. We appreciate everybody's time and participating in the call, and look forward to talking to you in the future at different investor events. Thanks a lot, and have a good evening.", "Operator", "The conference has now concluded.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Shawn Roberts, Senior Director of Investor Relations.", "Shawn Roberts", "Thank you, Amy, and welcome, everyone. On the call today, our Chairman and CEO, Troy Woods, will begin with his opening remarks; our CFO, Paul Todd, will provide business highlights on our four segments, and then review our consolidated financials. After that we'll open the call up for Q&A.", "I'd like to now remind everyone that those participating in the Q&A that after you ask your second question, you will be placed back into the queue. It will be the same as we operated the call on last year, I mean last quarter. ", "I'd like to now call your attention to the fact that we'll be making some forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS' actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in TSYS' reports filed with the SEC.", "I'd like to now introduce TSYS Chairman and CEO, Troy Woods.", "Troy Woods", "Thank you, Shawn. And welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Before we get started with our business review, I would like to take a few minutes and recognize Ken Tye, our Senior Executive Vice President and CIO who will be retiring at the end of September after 44 years of service to TSYS. During Ken\u2019s tenure, he has been instrumental in leading and delivering almost all of the technological advancements that TSYS has made.", "He was responsible for leading the team that built TS2, considered the industry\u2019s most technologically advanced payment processing system in the market today, with more than 40% of the credit card from the United States processed on the platform.", "Most recently, Ken had led the surround team to create a more open, technology environment to power TSYS\u2019s next generation of digital innovation and consumer servicing. As I have said on several occasions, Ken possesses that rare and unique ability to leverage his technical acumen with sound business strategy and we are indebted to Ken for his service and for the role he has played in positioning TSYS as one of the most respected Fin Tech companies in the payments industry. We wish Ken Tye and his family all the best in his retirement.", "Moving on to our second quarter business review, once again TSYS exceeded expectations delivering an exceptionally strong performance for the second quarter. From a macro perspective, the U.S. economy experienced a nice healthy balance after a lacklustre first quarter, the benefits from lower unemployment, wage increases and lower gas prices fuelled spending and an improved outlook. These positives suggest the U.S. economy is returning to a slow and steady growth trajectory and consumer fundamentals still appear favourable.", "The momentum seen in the United States economy is counter balanced somewhat by the headwinds from abroad with weakening currencies in many of the countries where we do business and the unpredictability and volatility of some markets. But all in the end we see mid tail winds benefiting our customers. And as I have mentioned in the past when TSYS\u2019s class perform well, we perform well also.", "Our analysis indicates that our clients and their respective issuing businesses have grown faster than the industry average. This is directly co-related to the exceptionally strong growth in transactions, authorizations, volumes and account on file growth that we\u2019ve produced for the second quarter. Let me mention a few high level enterprise highlights worthy of calling out.", "Total revenues for the quarter were $692.7 million, an increase of 15.1%. Revenues before reimbursable items for the quarter were $622.1 million, an increase of 15.6%.", "Our consolidated organic revenue grew 13.7% year-to-date. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.58, an increase of 29%. Also during the quarter, we repurchased 700,000 shares bringing our year-to-date total to 2.2 million shares for a total spend of $83.5 million, coupled with our dividends 36.9 million, we returned $120.4 million to our shareholders for the first two quarters, which represents 74.2% of our available free cash flow.", "On the recognition front, during the quarter TSYS was again recognised by Visa for superior service quality in the area of issuer processing authorisations. We received a 2014 Visa Service Quality Performance Award for both assured transaction rates and transaction response time.", "In 2014, TSYS processed 12.2 billion issuer authorisations globally, an average of more than 33.6 million authorizations each day and at our peak approximately 1100 authorizations per second. While this honour is not a first for TSYS, it does highlight our commitment to superior operational performance and continued improvement across our business.", "Turning to the topline highlights for the quarter for our four operating segments. Let\u2019s begin with North America, which delivered another credibly stellar performance for the quarter. As expected, a number of our key metrics significantly benefitted from the first quarter Bank of America conversion. But even excluding the impact of this conversion, we performed well in all metrics delivering a better than expected performance.", "We had the largest revenue for the North America segment in our history exceeding two previous high watermarks seen over the past couple of quarters. We have the largest adjusted operating income for a segment in TSYS\u2019s history. The North America segment produced the fourth straight quarter of record setting transaction volumes of 4.04 billion up 49.9%.", "Total accounts on file grew to 677.5 million, up 32.8%. Our traditional accounts on file, which exclude prepaid single use commercial and student loan accounts grew 46.3% to 405.4 million.", "Excluding the impact of conversions on our account growth, our traditional account on file growth rate was up 10.4% the eight straight quarter of low-to-mid double digit growth and traditional accounts on file.", "The North America organic growth rate for the quarter was 23.1% and the segment produced an operating margin of 37.7% up 147 basis points over the second quarter of 2014. We successfully signed contract extensions with three of our top 15 clients during the quarter, including Bank of America and are proud of the previously announced extensions with INVEX and U.S. banks.", "Now let\u2019s move to the international segment. We experienced better than expected year-over-year constant currency revenue growth at 9.4%. A number of our European clients are outperforming the market and we are certainly benefitting from those. This combined with an increased demand for our managed service offerings and the impact of new client\u2019s growth has resulted in a strong second quarter for the segment.", "As we continue to pivot our focus to revenue growth as well as maintaining solid operating margins, we are generating increased activity across our business development pipeline. We signed an LOI for a well known global brand U.K. launch for early 2016 and we are in late stage contract negotiations with a sizeable entity which we hope to conclude later this year.", "Additionally, we are working on other late stage RFPs which look encouraging and our new business pipeline is stronger than it has been in the years. With deployments of our Tokenization solution for Apple Pay issuers in the United States well underway, we were delighted to announce our support of the launch of Apple Pay in the U.K. with two of our major issuers.", "Our Tokenization solution which is part of our broader digital engagement strategy provides the highest level of privacy and security to issuers, merchants and consumers as the Apple Pay rollout continues and other mobile players leverage the existing payments ecosystem and the shift to digital payments.", "Our support of Apple Pay as well as other digital initiatives put TSYS in a leadership role in the digitization of payments. Another news across Europe, the European Union has now ratified the cap for credit and debit card interchange and these caps will be in place by the end of this year. No doubt this will have a negative impact on our issuers overall revenue streams.", "But by working closely with our European clients, we see some related upside opportunities only around [ph] specifically we see significant interest from our clients for new initiatives and projects which will assist them in replacing lost interchange income through new account transaction fees, innovation and new product offerings.", "Additionally, we are supporting alternative instalment and lending solutions and one time virtual accounts and we are actively presenting these opportunities as increased revenue streams or issuers.", "And lastly, there is an advancing trend towards supplier consolidation, with increased demand for services from strategic partners and this is a definite positive for TSYS. Overall, the second quarter showed encouraging signs of growth recovery across our international footprint.", "In the merchant segment, again this quarter we experienced strong organic growth in our direct business of 16%. This was the result of increased volumes and the rollout of new products. As expected, the quarterly decline of our indirect business continues to stabilize and was flat year-over-year. However, as we reported last quarter, we anticipate that the third quarter will face pressure for year-over-year comparison purposes.", "In the second quarter we announced the enablement of full service payment processing with OptBlue, the small merchant acquiring program from American Express. This new program allows our small and mid size merchants to affordably except American Express Card transactions in the same way they accept other major network card grants.", "We have enabled our direct merchant customers and a significant number of our indirect clients to offer the OptBlue program to merchant non-acceptors and new merchants. We expect this initiative to continue for the second half of the year.", "Also of note in the second quarter, Utah\u2019s second largest credit union selected ProPay to offer its member innovative sales service one payment options using their smart devices, yet another step in our digital services innovation.", "As I discussed last quarter, EMV readiness and communication remain top of line for our acquirers, ISOs, borrowers and merchants as we near the October deadline on account of credit card fraud liability shifts from the issuers to the merchants whose terminals are not EMV enabled.", "To better assist our merchant communities; during the quarter we announced a partnership with PAX Technology to jointly deliver a solution to simplify the EMV certification process for merchants and developers. This solution decouples payments reducing PCI scope from the point of sale, therefore taking much of the guess work out of EMV certification.", "As a point of reference, there are two steps to enable EMV at the point of sale. One, we must ensure that the terminals are capable of accepting chip cards and two; software must be enabled on the terminals to allow them to accept the chip cards.", "We will continue to communicate, educate and deliver new tools to assist in this migration as we expect significant traction for EMV certification in the third quarter.", "Now let\u2019s turn our attention to NetSpend. NetSpend delivered another solid performance for the second quarter. Revenue growth of 21.2% year-over-year represents the 14th consecutive quarter of double digit growth. This is the largest revenue quarterly growth for NetSpend since the third quarter of 2013.", "Overall, we had 5.5 billion in gross dollar volume or spend on our cards up 19.5% over the same quarter last year. We also exited the quarter with 3.9 million active cards. This is the first time we have reached 3.9 million active cards outside of the tax season and it is important to note that over 48% of these cards are enrolled in direct deposit.", "We have continued our strategy to diversify our issuing bank relationships signing a new agreement during the quarter with Republic bank. Additionally, we signed a 5-year extension to continue our relationship with MetaBank a NetSpend partner for nearly 10 years.", "One of the most significant business development wins in the quarter was the expansion of our role model relationship to sale of a NetSpend card in more than 1100 Walmart money centers. We are thrilled with this opportunity to partner with Walmart, to deliver banking solutions to consumers where they shop and through the brands they trust.", "Additionally, NetSpend and Ingo Money, Inc. a digital payments company focused on account funding announced they will partner to enable card holders to receive immediate access to funds from approved checks the iOS and Android devices. All-in-all it was another great performance by NetSpend.", "In summary, double digit revenue growth, gross segment margin expansion, improving business development pipelines and increased consumer confidence in spending provide us with a springboard that should allow us to finish the year strong.", "These metrics and tailwinds also provide us with a confidence to increase our guidance for total revenue before reimbursable, total revenue and adjusted EPS for the year and Paul will provide additional details on our improved guidance in a few minutes.", "Our leadership team continues to execute at a very high level and they will continue to laser focussed on our clients, the businesses we serve, our valued shareholders and ofcourse our 10,000 strong dedicated team members.", "I now would like to turn the program over to Paul Todd who will provide additional detailed financial information. Paul?", "Paul Todd", "Thank you, Troy. And I want to reemphasize how pleased we were with the second quarter performance of our company, both on an individual segment level and on a consolidated basis. The organic growth strength that we saw in the first quarter across all of our segments continued in the second quarter and positions us well as we execute during the second half of the year.", "With that, I want to start reviewing the numbers beginning on slide six. For the quarter, TSYS delivered a mid-teen organic revenue growth picture over the second quarter of 2014 with total revenues growing 15.1% to $692.7 million and revenue before reimbursables growing 15.6% to $622.1 million.", "On a year to-date basis the growth picture is similar with total revenues increasing 13.4% from year to-date levels in 2014 and year to-date revenue before reimburables increasing 13.7% from last year levels through June.", "Second quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 20.9% to $206.5 million, an increase of $35.6 million and our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 140 basis points in the quarter from last year to 33.2% reflecting positive operating leverage across our businesses.", "I commented on our last call that we still expect our adjusted EBITDA margin for the year to increase from 2014 level by 100 to a 150 basis points and based on our second quarter performance and our forecast for the remaining part of the year that 100 to 150 basis points EBITDA margin expansion is still our expectation for full year 2015.", "On adjusted EPS from continuing operations, the $0.58 of second quarter, adjusted EPS represents 29% increase from second quarter levels of last year and the $1.11 year to-date adjusted EPS produces an increase of 34.6%.", "I will speak more about the drivers of this adjusted EPS growth, but given we had no acquisitions during the quarter, it is clear that the organic revenue growth of our businesses with their respective operating leverage advantages coupled with success from our capital allocation strategy with a key drivers of this EPS growth.", "I want to make a few comments on the consolidated highlight starting on slide seven. This is now our second straight quarter of double digit organic revenue growth and our adjusted operating income of $165.5 million represent a 23.3% increase from the second quarter of 2014.", "Also, we saw 170 basis points adjusted operating income margin expansion during the quarter to 26.6% -- from 24.9% in the second quarter of 2014. Troy mentioned earlier about the volume gains in the respective all time highs on several metrics that helped fuel this results.", "Our long-term strategy is to drive results with growth across our segments that produces a balanced revenue mix. And the chart on slide seven shows that our second quarter result continued to deliver against that strategic goal.", "I will now cover the outstanding North America segment results starting on slide eight. As Troy already alluded to, we\u2019re seeing truly historic results from this segment certainly due to the large conversion in Q1, but the headline continues to be organic growth and performance.", "You can see that revenue before reimbursables was up 23.1% for the quarter to $287.2 million versus the second quarter of last year, which is the largest in North America\u2019s history excluding a one-time termination fee paid in the fourth quarter of 2006.", "The segment also yielded $108.4 million of adjusted operating income for the quarter which is also the largest in its history. The $54 million increase in second quarter revenue from 2Q of 2014 was driven by the conversion activities previously referenced and overall very strong organic growth from existing clients.", "The business also increased its adjusted operating margin by 147 basis points to 37.7% as compared to 36.3% in the second quarter of last year. You can see the obvious impact of the large conversion in the first quarter had on segments account on file search driving that 32.8% to 677.5 million accounts.", "As a reminder, when we refer to traditional accounts on file in this segment we exclude prepaid government services, student loan and commercial card single use accounts because these have a distinctly different correlation to revenue. Our traditional accounts on file grew 46.3% in the quarter to 405.4 million accounts, a historic level in this segment.", "As Troy mentioned, total cardholder transactions for the quarter were up 49.9%, the fourth straight quarter of record setting transaction volumes and same client cardholder transactions were up 11.8% for the quarter.", "So while we seen record setting results for the North America segment the quarterly growth comparisons to last year will become less dramatic as we anniversary some of the conversions from last year and UniRush leaves as we mentioned on our last call. However, we do expect this business now to achieve more of an upper teen level of year-over-year growth on revenue from the mid-teen level we had previously expected.", "Now turning to slide nine, I will now discuss our international segments results for the quarter. The key highlight for international is better than expected, constant currency revenue growth coupled with an expanding adjusted segment operating income margin that is consistent with the margin improvement plans of the segment.", "Segment revenue for the quarter was $83.9 million, down 1% on a reported basis, but up 9.4% on a constant currency basis. This constant currency revenue growth was partially driven by the new clients that we boarded over the last 12 months and better than expected organic growth in the rest of the business.", "Following on from the successful Virgin Money migration at the end of Q1, in Q2 we converted a 400,000 account on file portfolio with the UK Bank and we continue to work on further conversions to go live over the next 12 to 18 months. So we have two dynamics occurring in international on the revenue front. One with better than expected new business volume, and two, better than expected core business growth.", "While we do not expect to see similar constant currency revenue growth rate of 9.4% for this segment for the rest of the year. We do now expect to see segment to deliver a low single digit constant currency growth rate which is better than our previous expectations of a roughly flat year for revenue on a constant currency basis.", "Obviously this segment has been primarily focused on margin expansion for the past several quarters and the 15.9% reported adjusted segment operating margin within line with our plans as we continue towards the full year target of 18%.", "On the volume front, accounts on file grew $11.6 million or 18.5% compared to the same quarter of last year over half of which was due to new clients. We now process a segment record 73.9 million accounts on file.", "However as I\u2019ve done before I would like to emphasize that most of the growth is in the commercial card and single use accounts and we continue to experience significant growth in the debt portfolios we process and our growth in Brazil within the high teen double-digit growth rate as we continue to see great growth from that region.", "Now I\u2019ll discuss on merchant segments performance starting on slide 10. The key highlight on the merchant segment is organic growth. For the second quarter overall segment revenue before reimbursables increased 8.8% which is the largest quarterly revenue growth in eight quarters and a 330 basis points increase in sequential quarter growth in segment revenue.", "The 16% increase in direct revenue coupled with a flat indirect revenue picture allows for this result and it was the first quarter of non-contracting revenue in our indirect segment since the first quarter of 2012.", "Part of our strategic plan has been to reduce the contraction of the indirect business and its effect on the overall segment performance. And while we don\u2019t believe that we are fully past revenue contraction in our indirect business. The second quarter\u2019s performance shows the impact when revenue contraction does not occur from the indirect side.", "Based on the year to-date performance and our forecast for the remaining part of the year we now expect merchant segment revenue to grow in the mid single digits for the full year, up slightly from our previously communicated rate of low single digit.", "We do still face more challenged year-over-year growth comparisons in the third quarter in this segment due to some one-time items in Q3 of last year which we previously communicated.", "As it relates to volume, the segments volume growth was driven by another strong quarter of SBS sales volume growth of 10%, POS transaction growth of over 8%, excluding the deconverted accounts and the benefit of new products.", "We\u2019re continue to be pleased with the traction we\u2019re gaining in our integrated software vendors having signed 12 ISPs year to-date, and as we signed these ISPs this channel continues to grow as a strong source for new merchants in line with our previously stated estimate of 15% to 20% of new boards in our TSYS merchant solutions business coming from this channel.", "Now I want to discuss the NetSpend performance starting on slide 11 where the key highlight for this segment is the better than expected organic revenue growth of just over 21% for the quarter which is the highest quarterly revenue growth since the third quarter of 2013.", "This was a combination of several factors including a strong finish to the 2015 tax season. Growth in direct deposit active cards of over 17%, growth in gross dollar volume of over 19% and the continued success in maturing the new relationships we launched in 2014 including Brinks, Western Union, Paychex and Walmart.", "We were pleased to exist the second quarter of 2015 with approximately 3.9 million active cards and adding approximately 700 distributing locations and employers to our distribution network bringing the total to almost 89,000.", "As Troy mentioned we signed public bank and new issuing bank relationship and signed a five-year extension to agreement with MetaBank a partner for 10 years further diversifying our issuer bank relationship.", "NetSpend delivered strong Q2 revenue and contribution margin grow to the most diverse set of acquisition channel in the prepaid industry. This quarter marked NetSpend\u2019s 14 consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth with a 21.2% year-over-year increase to $141.6 million total revenue for the quarter.", "Revenue growth was strong both in total and by acquisition channel with three of our four distribution channels delivering double-digit year-over-year revenue growth for the second quarter in a row.", "We continue to see a meaningful contribution to our year-over-year revenue growth driven by the new lead relationships that were launched in 2014. Q2, 2015 adjusted segment operating margin, up 25.7% is down slightly from the 26.3% in Q2 of 2014.", "We continue to invest in our new partner relationships in the case up to a year after launch to achieve a mature portfolio of direct deposit cards associated with the key partnership. We believe our revenue growth for this segment to be slightly higher than the growth rates we saw in 2014 and expected to be in the mid to high teens rate.", "We still expect the margin to contract some from 2014 levels largely due investments we\u2019re making in the business to support new relationships, launch new products and features and make other investments in the business.", "Leaving NetSpend and moving to the consolidated level again you can see on slide 12 how each of our segments margins contributed to our overall adjusted operating margin of 25.6%, up 170 basis points from last year\u2019s 2Q level.", "Also I want to state that this slide provides a bridge between the adjusted segment operating income for each of our segments and our consolidated adjusted operating income. We provide this because our segments report their results on an adjusted segment operating income basis, which excludes amortization of acquisition intangible, M&A expenses, corporate admin and stock-based comp.", "As it relates to our cash position, turning to slide 14, we ended the quarter at $349 million in cash up $21 million from the end of the first quarter. We had $53 million of CapEx for the quarter of which about 24% or $12 million was related to property and equipment, 52% or $28 million was related to contract acquisition costs including conversion activity in signing incentives with the remaining 24% or $13 million related to internally developed and licensed software.", "As Troy mentioned we spent $29 million during the quarter on share repurchases as we repurchase 7,000 shares in the quarter. Our shares outstanding at the end of June are $183.7 million with the average basic weighted shares outstanding at a $183.8 million on a quarter to-date basis and $184.2 million on a year to-date basis.", "On cash flow on slide 15 we show our trailing 12 months of cash flow strength and I want to point out that our free cash flow for the quarter was $73.8 million. Based on the first six months cash flow performance we continue to believe that our annual free cash flow estimate of $420 million to $440 million for 2015 is still valid.", "Although it\u2019s demonstrated in TSYS\u2019s history cash will not flow in a linear manner on a quarterly basis. On taxes, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.7% and we continue to expect that our overall effective tax rate for the year will be in the 32% to 34% range based on our current plans and to be closer to the middle of that range.", "And finally on guidance, given the better than expected performance during the second quarter as well as some strengthening in our expectations for the remaining part of the year we are revising our full year total revenue guidance from the previous 7% to 9% growth range to a 9% to 11% growth range.", "We\u2019re revising our revenue before reimbursables guidance from the 8% to 10% growth range to the 10% to 12% range and we are revising our full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations from the previous 12% to 14% growth range to a 15% to 17% growth range resulting in a $2.25 to $2.29 range.", "This range does not include any affects of potential stock buybacks in the second half of the year. I will point out this increase of $0.06 in our guidance range is also reflective of the second quarter buyback activity and improved currency headwind assumption of about a half the level we had assumed coming out of the first quarter for the remaining part of the year, and the revised improved outlook across our businesses that I commented on when reviewing each of our segments among other things.", "Finally, I want to quickly summarize with two primary callouts that I think are key takeaways from today. The first callout is organic revenue growth. I mentioned this topic on several of our last call, but the organic growth momentum of the company actually accelerated from first quarter levels to the second quarter levels and was one of the strongest organic revenue growth quarters in the recent history of the company.", "And while this is not something we expect to continue it is evidence that we are executing on our strategic plan, growing our presence in payments and strengthening the financial position of the company.", "The second callout is on the evolving nature that TSYS\u2019s is playing in payments. The second quarter was further evidence of the type of payments platforms that is being built at TSYS. One that is unique in its composition, growth dynamics and strategic position in the payments ecosystem.", "We showed an all time high of 677.5 million accounts on file in our North America segment and another all time high of 73.9 million accounts in our international segment. This account base coupled with the growing strategic footprint that NetSpend is building demonstrated by their GDV and cross channel deliver of account volume growth and the improved organic and product growth in our merchant segment show that our payments platform base is strategically growing and is poised for more potential payments volume.", "We intend to further leverage the space and we\u2019re proud to be in the position we are in today. We\u2019re confident on our vision, our strategy and our team members to execute these strategies. It\u2019s a team whose tireless work each day makes TSYS a strong company and we thank them for all their efforts which enabled us to deliver these second results.", "And with that, we will open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session ", "Operator", "We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder each person will be allow to ask two questions. Once you have asked your second question you will be placed back in to the main conference. Our first question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays.", "Darrin Peller", "Thanks, guys. Nice job on the quarter on the first half. Just actually I want to start off with overall revenue guidance. Look it\u2019s great to see the increase to 10% to 12% year-over-year growth, just when we look at the 13.5% year-over-year revenue growth rate in the first half I guess it\u2019s just a little difficult to understand why there will be a material deceleration from the first half given you won\u2019t really anniversary delay [ph] until early 2016 and we\u2019re obviously seeing some sustainable signs of acceleration at NetSpend and potentially even the other segments. So if you could just comment on that first?", "Paul Todd", "Sure, Darrin, this is Paul. We got really kind of two dynamics that play there. One is as Troy and I both I think commented on in the third and fourth quarter we do have some comparison challenges certainly on our merchant business in the third quarter and specially on the international side on the fourth quarter related to some one-time. So the comparison challenges in the back half of the year are going to be more challenging but also point out that in the first half of the year we did have some favourable kind of comparison as you go back to the first half of 2014 specifically as it relates to merchant and NetSpend and so that does not produce the same kind of results when you look at the second half of the year, and so those two dynamics, so the key drivers there.", "Darrin Peller", "Okay. Is there any chance you can quantify that little bit in terms of the impact from some of those when you said we\u2019re kind of onetime items in the second half last year and how that impact growth for us?", "Paul Todd", "I think the best way Darrin that I would respond to that would be to kind of look at the trending last year and if you go back and you look at kind of the trending of where that occurred in the commentary we made around both in the third quarter as well as in the fourth quarter and look at the trends and kind of see what kind of delta was there. I think that would be the best way to kind of point to the quantification of what those items would be.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matt Lipton at Autonomous Research.", "Matt Lipton", "Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to ask about the organic growth especially in North America, can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing from your issuer partners in the U.S. credit market. Are we seeing any resurgent in some of your accounts seems that they\u2019re still back in your prime and subprime, those accounts that were parts of the system after financial crisis?", "Troy Woods", "Hey, Matt, Troy. I wouldn\u2019t know that we would absolutely know that from being purchased out coming back in. What we\u2019ve indicated in the past and what I said in my prepared remarks that our analysis shows that our top issuers are performing better than the market as a whole. When you look the stable of accounts that we have both North America and international they are opening and putting on accounts which takes a while to become active, but they are performing better than the average when you look at the Visa and MasterCard numbers for a particular quarter. So, as I indicated we are benefiting from the uplift of \u2013 I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s really anymore I can add to it.", "Matt Lipton", "That\u2019s fine. And then on international the new European revs [ph] that are going to start to really way on issuers and European Union around there interchange pricing. Does that change their economic that all that might make them want to think about outsourcing the business someone like TSYS? Thank you.", "Troy Woods", "Well, it\u2019s a good question. Thank you. Yes, it clearly changes their economics. We\u2019ve seen reports just as you probably seen reports Matt that the interchange legislation if you will from the European Union between credit and debit, is maybe somewhere between 5 billion and 6 billion euro of revenue impact, negative revenue impact. So clearly bottom line, it\u2019s a huge impact. But as I indicated in my prepared remarks one of the things that we are seeing among others that I\u2019ve mentioned is looking at our prospect if you will that many of them are looking to consolidate strategically to strategic suppliers. And as I indicated that is a definite positive for us. So we do see some silver lining if you will.", "Operator", "The next question is from Bryan Keane at Deutsche Bank,", "Troy Woods", "Hey, Bryan.", "Bryan Keane", "Hey, guys, congrats on these super results, definitely robust year. So my question is one international just on accounts on file up 18.5% year-over-year and yet constant currency revenue growth has been up 5% in the first and now 9.4% in the second. I just want to make sure I understand why that drops back down if you\u2019re guiding to low singles that almost \u2013 we almost have to be negative in the back half. I just want to make sure understand the puts and takes there?", "Paul Todd", "Yes, sure, Bryan. This is Paul. Two things there, one I\u2019d comment around this fourth quarter comparison that\u2019s challenging as it relates to the international segment. And then as it relates to accounts on file specifically as I talked about we\u2019ve got single use commercial card accounts on file that are driver there that as I\u2019ve commented doesn\u2019t have near the kind of correlation to revenue that are kind of traditional accounts on file. But we look at our traditional accounts on file growth to be in kind of the high single digit range that\u2019s much more correlated to the revenue growth that we\u2019re seeing, so two effects there, the account on file growth being driven by singe use commercial card and also some debit card growth there and then also this challenging comparison year-over-year in the fourth quarter.", "Bryan Keane", "Is there anything particular in the fourth quarter or is just that the growth rate was 5.7%, so was higher or is there some one time revenue that evaporates on a year-over-year comparison?", "Paul Todd", "Yes. That\u2019s right Bryan. If you recall back in the fourth quarter of last year we did have some one time revenue that was specifically called out and so obviously that doesn\u2019t repeat itself in the fourth quarter of this year and then provides for that challenging year-over-year comparison.", "Operator", "Our next question is from James Friedman at SIG.", "James Friedman", "Hi. And thanks for taking my questions. Troy in your prepared remarks you talked a little bit about the balance between margin and growth on the international front, if you can elaborate on that further. And I guess I\u2019ll ask my second one upfront as well. In the instance of Visa and Visa Europe to consolidate to merge, any conjecture as to how that may impact if at all the issuer business in Europe? Thank you.", "Troy Woods", "Thank you, Jamey [ph]. As to the balance on growth and margin you asked about, yes, I did cover that in my prepared remarks and for several quarters now we have commented on that we are pivoting the shift in the international segment to get more aggressive for growth. And as we\u2019ve indicated last quarter, this is not growth for growth\u2019s sake. I think I\u2019ve said something last quarter like we\u2019ve seen that movie before. And so through the efforts of the leadership of the International Group, Kelly and Galen and team they\u2019ve revamp the sales organization. They have changed their lot of their compensations structures with respect to new business.", "And as I indicated that we are seeing a business development pipeline, one of the more robust pipelines that we\u2019ve seen in several years from business development. Now with all that said, not for a minute if we\u2019re going to take our eye off the margin. We still stand behind our margin improvement. We still stand behind the 18 plus percent goal that we\u2019ve set for all of 2015. So that\u2019s the balance. We want to get back, I think the last two quarters to a large degree of demonstrated that 5 plus percent in 1Q and 9.4% on the second Q on a constant currency basis and so we feel good about our pivoting if you will to growth again.", "And then the second question, I\u2019m sorry, around the possibility of Visa Europe and Visa Inc [ph] coming together do we see that as any kind of impact to us and/or our issuers? I think its best that only speak from a TSYS\u2019s perspective and I think from TSYS\u2019s perspective no. We have a great relationship with both organizations, so I wouldn\u2019t see anything of any significant changing for us.", "Operator", "The next question is from Jason Kupferberg at Jefferies.", "Jason Kupferberg", "Thanks guys. I just want to start with the question on North America obviously terrific numbers here. As we start to conceptualized next year, I know it\u2019s premature to give guidance but you\u2019re going to have the mother of all comparisons next year. And I just wanted to get a general sense based on the pipeline that you still see in North America directionally do you still that the business can grow next year?", "Paul Todd", "Sure, Jason, this is Paul. I think \u2013 we talked a little bit about this at our Analyst Day as it relates to what that growth rate looks like for the North America business on more of a go forward basis and you\u2019re right obviously we wouldn\u2019t comment on anything as it relates to 2016 specifically, but I will say that the core organic growth picture of the business has strengthened, I think the comments I had used in that meeting was maybe around a mid-single digit to maybe a high single digit, maybe growth range probably being closer to the mid single digit, growth range at being kind of a generic guide as we look at what the growth dynamics of that North America business look like on more of a longer term basis.", "But I think, I also said at the time and its still true, we want to make sure that these larger conversions have had time to see then that the base kind of resets at a certain level and then we are able to see the dynamics play to be able to kind of talk of what more of that longer term growth rate for that business looks like but that would be the comments that we provide around it.", "Jason Kupferberg", "Okay. And just curious on the free cash flow outlook, I know that didn\u2019t change for the year despite the increase in the earnings guidance, any particular driver?", "Paul Todd", "So I think it \u2013 yeah as it relates to that, Troy obviously commented on the extensions that we had with several of our customers which added to our capital expenditures as it relates to client incentives which we are thrilled to do. We always like that to see that we are extending significant agreements, and so I think that we\u2019ll continue to kind of watch the dynamics there as it plays through and right now we\u2019re still comfortable with the 420 million to 440 million range of free cash flow.", "Operator", "The next question is from Timothy Willi at Wells Fargo.", "Timothy Willi", "Thanks and good afternoon. Had a question on NetSpend and then one on International, but first on NetSpend. Could you talk about \u2013 you talked about margins and discretionary investment sort of factoring into that for the remaining outlook or I guess for the year, but within the various channels there are different margin profiles whether it\u2019s direct partner etcetera. If you think about those channels and the respective sort of top line dynamics, any way we should think about one of those over the next 12 to 18 months you know ramping up that might not be as obvious because of discretionary investments you are doing right now, but something within the direct or the partner that should kick in at some point or is it actually doing quite well but just not as evident but what become more visible?", "Paul Todd", "Tim, this is Paul. I wouldn\u2019t call that anything specifically as it relates to anything in any specific channel that would be worthy of calling out. As I talked about earlier, we are seeing kind of strong growth in really all the channel relative to our initial expectations and certainly as I said we saw double digit growth in three of the four channels.", "And so, we obviously have this new business that we signed last year that\u2019s continuing to season as it relates to the spend that we are talking about, that I related to as it related to the contraction in the margin, you know that\u2019s around in products that we\u2019re coming out.", "We talked a little bit about that also at our last analyst day, our marketing as it relates to some of these new products and then just overall kind of infrastructure related expenditures that has been needed as it relates to facilitate the growth that we\u2019ve had. So nothing more than that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brett Huff at Stephens Inc.", "Brett Huff", "Good afternoon, can you hear me okay?", "Troy Woods", "Yes, hey Brett.", "Brett Huff", "Hey guys, how are you. Two questions, one is when we think about the margins for some of the big banks that you signed recently on the issuing side in North America, how are those margins trending versus your original expectations and can you give us a sense of was there more add on services that folks are using that maybe you anticipated?", "Paul Todd", "Yes Brett so specifically as it relates to the new clients and the margins expectations around those you know we don\u2019t really comment on anything as it relates to any specific new clients there. We\u2019ve been very pleased with the results overall of the original expectations and where the new clients have come in at.", "And I think as it relates to just the overall margin story for North America, obviously scale produces operating leverage and operating leverage delivers the margin and so we\u2019re seeing some of that benefit not specifically tied to any client, but just on an overall basis and so you know we are pleased with the results that we have of the clients that have come on board and without speaking of them specifically there is kind of the mixed spectrum as it relates to whose is using which products you know and that picture we look forward as it relates to our forecasting of kind of who\u2019s going to use what.", "Brett Huff", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And a follow up is can you just walk us through again, you\u2019ve mentioned that some of the increase the $0.06 increase in guidance in the mid points partially due to a little bit less severe Forex headwind, then you said one other item as well, can you just detail those again on what your prior assumption was and what the assumption is now? Thanks for the time.", "Paul Todd", "Sure, Brett. So as I talked about we were kind of three different dynamics there. One was, we had lesser currency headwinds and you will recall on our last call I said several cents so roughly half that level now and so there is about a penny and a half or so of improvement as it relates to that.", "And then the rest would be related to the stock buyback impact that we got in the second quarter for the stock purchases that we made in the second quarter that obviously weren\u2019t in the guidance that we talked about last time, and then the rest would be operational performance. I would also point out that as I talked about the tax rate moving to more in the middle of the range is also something I point out as a positive.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Smitti [ph] at Morgan Stanley.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yes, thank you. First question is on the merchant services business, the indirect segment stabilised after declining many quarters in a row. Can you talk about you know the \u2013 what led you to be able to achieve these results and I know you said that stabilization will likely by unachievable for the rest of the year, but what are some of the puts and takes that could allow numbers to come in better than expected in that segment?", "Troy Woods", "Thank you, Smitti. A couple of things really on the indirect side one is, one or two of our indirect customers we anniversaried during the last quarter so that certainly is somewhat of a boost. But the biggest by far that we have talked about for many many quarters is the stabilization of the large de-converting a client that we have talked about forever which is the [Indiscernible] business. ", "And so as we\u2019ve indicated in the past this business is beginning to tail off towards the end of its economic life if you will and that was a really big boost to help the second quarter. We saw it in the first quarter as well and it\u2019s continued to level off in 2Q. So those were the two main drivers.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Got it. And on the NetSpend business you mentioned that you are expanding to 1100 financial centers in Walmart. Can you talk about the potential, you know did that occur by the beginning of the quarter or by the end of the quarter and where are the opportunities to you know go into more locations of Walmart?", "Troy Woods", "Well again that\u2019s the financial centers Smitti. So that\u2019s the 11 [ph] financial centers. I don\u2019t think every Walmart that we\u2019ve rolled out the NetSpend card has a financial center. But we did rolled it out in more early of the second quarter sometime in April. So it\u2019s just beginning to take over.", "Operator", "The next question is from James Schneider at Goldman Sachs.", "James Schneider", "Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. I guess first of all just to follow on the NetSpend question. Can you maybe talk about you know some of the drivers that have led this sustained outperformance in that segment and can you just specifically state whether the he partnerships with Paychex and Western Union and Brinks are really making material dent in the numbers and if they are not those then some of the other factors might be causing that?", "Troy Woods", "Sure Jim. So as it relates to the drivers on the NetSpend increased performance, I would speak of two things. One obviously, there was a stronger tax season and even some effects coming outside of tax season that continued on. Just overall volume growth as I talked about is cross channel growth that we\u2019ve seen is clearly the tail wind and then as it relates to the new business, the new businesses the Paychex ,Western Union, Brinks and then most likely this Walmart are adding what I call growth is now registering and so it\u2019s now becoming more significant and as that gets momentum behind it we continue to spend related toward it. We are going to continue to be pleased I think with the added growth nature of those new relationships.", "James Schneider", "That\u2019s helpful, thanks. And then one of merchant if I could. You have talked before about your desire to do an M&A transaction to you knows potentially acquire something to augment the growth in that segment. Can you maybe talk about whether that\u2019s still the case and at this point whether you see how you view kind of the pricing of the assets in the market and whether that\u2019s more or less attractive to you than it was before as an option?", "Troy Woods", "Jim, Troy. Yes we still look at that as an attractive opportunity in that segment. We haven\u2019t changed from that at all. When you talk about price points not really anything I can add to that, some better than others, we all are watching of course what\u2019s happening with some of the proposed IPOs in this space around merchants, so you can begin to get some sense of price point there but we continue to look as we said on many occasions we have our criteria. We look at that criteria extensively and to some degree that\u2019s one of the reasons we have not pulled any triggers. We haven\u2019t found anything that fits all the criteria we\u2019re looking for. That\u2019s actionable. So we\u2019ll continue to keep our eyes open, but it is something we are continually interested in.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Togut at Evercore ISI.", "Mike Landau", "Hi, this is Mike Landau in for David Togut. Can you provide an update on the EBIT margin impact and timing of your European data center consolidations and customer relationships rationalizations?", "Troy Woods", "I\u2019m sorry, Mike. Did you say consolidation of European data centers?", "Mike Landau", "That\u2019s right.", "Troy Woods", "We have not had any European data center consolidations that I\u2019m aware that we talked about\u2026", "Mike Landau", "I\u2019m also confused. I\u2019ll just continue on with my follow up then. Can you offer an update on the timing size of the previously announced international segment conversions occurring later this year?", "Troy Woods", "Well we had one in the second quarter, we haven\u2019t named that, but I think we\u2019ve given you some sense of what that sizes. That came off fine. Now that\u2019s behind us. I don\u2019t really have in front of me what that conversion schedule may look like for the rest of the year, I think we\u2019ve indicated over the next 18 months or so how many we might have in the conversion pipeline almost 3 million accounts, is that accurate.", "Paul Todd", "Well I think we\u2019ve commented that there\u2019s two or three customers that over the next 12 to 18 months that we\u2019re looking to convert and you know as Troy said that follows on the 400,000 account portfolio that we brought on in the second quarter. And as Troy mentioned, I think the pipeline, the developed and the business development pipeline has strengthened and so we\u2019re going to continue to be harvesting that pipeline and also you know highlight that the organic growth of that account on file as I mentioned earlier that kind of high single digit of traditional accounts on file growth is a strengthening metric as well as it relates to international.", "So all of those dynamics are a play and Mike just one other thing, I think you might have been referring to platform consolidations on the international side instead of maybe data center consolidations and they have the international team is part of the margin expansion program have had several platform consolidations, those are on track and we\u2019ve hit against those deadlines and we\u2019re seeing the results of it in the margin expansion that we saw here in the second quarter.", "Operator", "This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Shawn Roberts, Senior Director of Investor Relations for any closing remarks.", "Shawn Roberts", "Thanks, Amy. We\u2019d like to tell everybody we appreciate you participating in our call and if you have any questions, any follow-ups feel free to give me a call at any time.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the TSYS Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded today, October 25, 2011. Thank you. I would like to introduce Mr. Shawn Roberts, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Shawn Roberts", "Thank you, Casey, and welcome, everyone. On the call today, our Chairman and CEO, Phil Tomlinson, will provide highlights of the third quarter 2011 and then turn it over to Jim Lipham, our CFO, who's going to review the financials. After that, we'll open it up to question-and-answer.", "I'd like to now call your attention to the fact that we'll be making forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS' actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in TSYS' reports filed with the SEC.", "At this time, I'd like to introduce TSYS CEO, Phil Tomlinson.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Thank you, Shawn, and good evening, everybody. We are certainly excited to report another quarter of positive results in really virtually every category.", "I hope you've had a chance to read our release and the details that back it up. Total revenues grew 6.1% over the last year and earnings per share were up 30.6% for the quarter.", "Total cardholder transactions, which is a real measure of our health, increased 12.7% in the third quarter, which is the seventh consecutive quarter of growth and the fourth straight quarter with double-digit growth.", "Our accounts on file ended at 392 million, and they were up 10%. And if you include prepaid accounts, the total was up 15.7%. Both very, very good numbers for TSYS. With these results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we've raised our revenue net income EPS guidance for the full year. ", "Our operational improvements were certainly helped by very resilient card market, increased number of transactions and account growth from our conversion -- our sales and conversion pipeline. Improved operations, lower effective tax rates and our share repurchase saw our outlook for 2011 improve our net income to 11% to 12% range, and for EPS to the 14% to 15% range, an increase of $0.05 a share.", "My confidence in the card market was certainly reinforced this quarter with our organic revenue growth year-to-date of 5% in our North America segment and 7.5% in our international segment. While not back to the levels we once saw, North America's organic growth is over 2x higher than it was where we -- well, when I say it was, where we were a year ago at this time.", "As an update on our conversion pipeline, we have  about 12.5 million accounts scheduled to migrate over to our systems over the next 12 to 18 months. That we'll net out. We've got a couple of things we're going to lose, nothing big, but I think it nets out to about 9 million accounts total.", "As you -- I'm sure you probably have seen the 8-K we issued on October 6 regarding the renewal of the Capital One business, which we have talked about earlier. This renewal extends our relationship out until 2017. It calls for TSYS to continue providing processing services for the Cap One North American portfolio of consumer and small business credit card accounts. And it's no surprise to you, according to the 2011 Nielsen report, Cap One is the fourth largest card issuer in the U.S. both by volume and outstandings. We're certainly delighted to have this long-term contract renewal. We have an excellent relationship with Cap One, and they're obviously one of our largest clients.", "Regarding any concerns relative to the pricing pressure, I can assure you that the renewal is in line with the range of price compression that we deal with in other large contract renewal. And we feel very good about where we're at with Cap One.", "I'd like to move on to just some highlights in North America. In June, we converted the accounts of Simmons First National Bank in the Sony retail portfolio, which was acquired by Cap One. We also added the Citi consumer portfolio acquired by CIBC and converted Silverton Bank to our TPS, our Total Programming Solutions that we have talked about for the past year. Just some highlights. ", "And on the international side, we added debit card processing at the Bank of Ireland. This program is now fully underway, and the first debit cards will be in the market in late 2011. We are happy to note that we completed the conversions for Swisscard and the Italian group, Cedacri. And we have a few other conversions in Germany and the Netherlands scheduled for the remaining months of this year. But as you know, with the holiday season coming up, with the -- the time frame to get any more conversions plugged into 2011 is pretty short. Very, very few people would be interested in doing any kind of work like that after the Thanksgiving holidays.", "I want to bring you up-to-date on Carrefour. It is scheduled for the final phase. We told you this last time. I just wanted to verify it. That should come in, in the mid part of the first quarter of 2012. We are certainly still looking for additional relationships or prospecting for new customers in Brazil, and that's key to our long-term plans in Brazil. We had good strong transaction -- overall transaction growth internationally at 11.7%, and our same client transaction growth was at 7.8%.", "On the Merchant Services side, we met at the October deadline for the technical releases, which are part of the Durbin rule changes. And we're readying our systems for the 2012 date. Clearly, Durbin is a focus for anyone in the acquiring business and -- although we don't see the Durbin changes as having a meaningful impact on us financially. Transaction growth, excluding BAMS, was up 4% on the merchant side. We continue to be focused on driving value for our shareholders, and as you probably have read in our release, today our Board approved a 42.9%  dividend increase, which takes our quarterly share dividend from $0.07 a quarter to $0.10 a quarter.", "As you're aware, we haven't had an increase in our dividend in 5 years now. We believe this certainly demonstrates our ongoing confidence in our long-term strength of our business and the -- and at the same time, rewards our shareholders. We also purchased 2.2 million shares of TSYS stock through our stock buyback program for the quarter for a total spend of $37.2 million. This brings our year-to-date total to 4.2 million shares at a cost of $72.9 million.", "In addition to that, we've spent another $40.6 million in dividends for the year. We started 2011 with $394.8 million in cash on hand on our balance sheet. We've generated $297.7 million from operations year-to-date. We spent $64 million on capital items, $209 million on acquisitions, $113 million on our shareholders and $25.4 million on debt and other repayments, leaving us with cash on hand of $281 million at the end of this quarter. ", "Our continued strategic focus remains on deploying our capital in ways that most benefit the long-term operations of TSYS, which certainly, in turn, creates long-term benefits in shareholder -- to shareholders and shareholder value.", "With that, I'm going to turn it over to Jim Lipham, who has a lot of details about this great quarter that he's going to go through, and then we'll open it up to questions, and then I'll close out very quickly. Jimmy?", "James B. Lipham", "Thank you, Phil. I'll try not to cover some of the things that Phil said. But I would like to say that this is the first quarter in quite a while where we have not had a comparable quarter with a termination fee in it. So we are glad to have that. And as you can see, North America really did drive the growth this quarter.", "Before we get into the slides, again, I want to reiterate the equity and income line on the P&L. As you can see, year-to-date, it's got about a 71% growth in it. That's that CUP data that I've talked about last quarter. But we've got a timeline item that's going to flush out here in December, or in this fourth quarter and this thing, CUP, will be up about 19%. So just bear with us. There's a timing item that will correct that discrepancy there.", "With that, I'd like to get started with the Slide 6. And it's the P&Ls for the quarter and year-to-date. First of all, on the quarter, as Phil mentioned, revenues were up 6.1%, and revenues before reimbursables was up 7.4%. Just a great quarter with increased volumes, we had good growth in GP Net, CTA was about $5 million, our merchant business up 4.8%. The fraud business, production services, everything was up a little bit and it just contributed to a good growth quarter.", "If you look at operating income, we're up 2.9%. We did have about $9.1 million worth of one-time items that hit during this quarter. And I'll talk about those as we go through here. But without those, our operating income would have been up 14.4%. So would've been a real good growth.", "Operating margin, we're at 20.8%. Without those one-time items, it would've been 23.1%, which was pretty a good growth quarter for us there in our margin.", "When you look at the income from continuing ops, we're up 24.6% at $58 million. One of the big items there is income tax. Our effective rate for the quarter was 29.4%, compared to 36.5% last year. And this is the results of the recording of some discrete items in this quarter. And we do expect, as you look at the right-hand side on year-to-date, we'll be up about 31% to 32% for the year. And our effective tax rate would be that. And -- but it was a good quarter there. ", "Phil mentioned cardholder transactions up 12.7% at $2.2 billion. So it's just a great quarter. On the right side of the year-to-date, it's up $59 million in revenues at 4.6 million (sic) [4.6%]. Without the termination fee in 2010, those -- that revenue number would be up 7.4%,  and then revenues before reimbursables would have been up 9.4%. ", "Big items for the year, 9-month CTAs about $17 million. TSYS, our Total Merchant Services in Omaha was about $32.8 million and then TSYS Merchant Services Atlanta created about another $6 million. So those are the big items. Brazil is in here for about $4 million of revenue.", "Operating income was down 2.4% there. Again, if you add that termination fee out of 2010, you'd be up 13%. And so we still would have been growth in our operating income.", "Total transactions at 6,300,000,000, up 13.3% year-over-year. Just continuing to have outstanding growth. We've mentioned, our EBIT on a year-to-date basis was $358 million, it's up 10.2% over 2010. And our margin is still around 31.6%.", "Organic revenue growth, on a combined basis, was 4.4%. So that's improving as we go through each quarter.", "If you flip over to Slide 7, you'll see kind of a graph of how we got the 6% growth in our revenue numbers, internal growth contributing 4.1%, new class added 2.6%, and acquisitions, another 3.6%, and then currency at 1.5%. The combined 11.8% growth there is -- obviously, is offset with that 2% loss business, and termination fees represented about 3.1%. So that's what brought it back down to the 6%. But then again, some good growth in year-to-date revenues.", "On Slide 8, Phil mentioned the growth in the accounts on file. Each category is showing growth for the quarter. And we did have the big growth in the account on file numbers for prepaid at 47.7%. And I had mentioned before how about 6% of these accounts are active and the revenues off of prepaid represent about a 4.9% of our domestic revenues. So we need to keep that in mind. But overall, to have a 10% growth on everything, consumer and commercial, is good growth there in our account on file numbers, and is indicative of what we continue to see during the third quarter that we saw through the first half of the year, so good growth there.", "On the North America segment, the story there is good, strong organic growth. Revenues are up $12.4 million at $243 million, and revenues, excluding reimbursables at $206 million are up $13.2 million. And this is pretty much the same. Organic revenue growth of 5% for this segment. And it's just in general, good growth in transactions and authorizations and the account on file.", "Operating income at $68 million. Expenses were actually down $2.2 million. So we just had that outstanding quarter for margin improvement for North America, as you can see at 33% for excluding reimbursables and 27.9%. Both of these were up about 500 -- a little over 500 basis points year-over-year. So just outstanding growth there. And then you see the transaction numbers Phil mentioned earlier, good double-digit growth in both the same client and cardholders transactions total.", "On Slide 10 is the international segment. Favorable currency of $4.9 million. Revenues were up $14.6; million, or 17.1%. New client revenues, strong organic revenue growth of 7.5% on the international created this growth. And when you get down to the operating income, we're actually at $8.3 million.  It's down $4 million from where it was last year.", "And this has got our margins at the 8% level. The big items there, headcount is up 276 people or roughly $3.5 million of the $4 million drop. And then we have some processing there during this quarter that helped create the rest of the drop. Without those 2 items, or without the one-time charge on the processing, we would be at 10% on our margin growth there for operating margin.", "So a one-time item cost us a little bit there. And we do expect in the fourth quarter to see the margins in international a little north of 10%. So we should be back to there and looking to continue  to improve those margins.", "Transaction growth, still good. Total card transactions are up double-digit, 11.7%, whereas our same client transactions is up 7.8%. But overall, just a good quarter there. Currency added $4.8 million. As I said, the expense side of the house got $5.4 million added, so it decreased our operating income about $600,000 there.", "On Slide 11, we've got our merchant segment. TermNet was a big deal there. Revenues are actually down a little bit, really, 1.8%. And revenues before reimbursables are down 1.9%. TSYS Acquiring was down about $1 million, mainly the result of deconvergence and price compressions, which we have talked about before with the Flying J and Subway and Merchant e. ", "TSYS Merchant Services is also down about $4 million. It was mainly due to a one-time revenue true up of about $4 million that pertained to 2010. And we have that as a one-time item in the merchant segment that really penalized the margins for the quarter, whereas if you excluded that one-time adjustment, those margins would be almost 1% ahead of where they have been. The 22.3% would be 25.7%, and then the 29.4% would be 34%. Both of those are about 1% higher than they were last quarter.", "Anyway, on the $93 million revenues before reimbursables, 61% of that is transaction-driven through TSYS Acquiring point-of-sale business. And their volumes were actually up. If you excluded the deconverted class, they were up 5.4%. And so that's at least good growth, same clients, so to speak, POS business.", "The other 39% of the direct merchant ownership, and that's dollar [ph] volume-driven, and it's the part of TSYS of Omaha, TSYS Merchant Services of Omaha and this volume is showing an increase of 10.8% over the third quarter of last year. So it's good growth there.", "And I mentioned the margins being down. But without the one-time adjustment, they would've been in line with where they should be.", "On Slide 12, we'll look at the cash flow. We, again, had a good cash flow this quarter, with $98.4 million from operations and about $78 million in free cash flow. Year-to-date, Phil mentioned, cash flow from operations is $297.7 million, and then we also had free cash flow was up $68 million, close to $69 million at $233 million.", "We continue to generate good cash with evident $473 million in cash from operating activities on a trailing 12-month basis of $407 million. We will see a pickup there in that as we go in the fourth quarter. If you remember last year in the fourth quarter of 2010, we had some capital expenditures of roughly $64 million that came in that quarter that we won't have this year. So that should improve that cash flow for the year on a trailing 12-month basis.", "Phil talked about the money that we spend. You do see cash up there, pending cash for the quarter at $281 million. So we have spent our cash wisely, I think, this year on both shareholder return, as well as some good acquisitions for the company's growth.", "On Slide 13, it's just our revised guidance. As you can see, we continue to have a good growth that we saw through the second quarter. We did have some one-time items that were hitting us in the third quarter that we were able to overcome because of this continued growth. And so we have ended up changing our revenues now to 4% to 5%, up from 2.4% and -- or 2% to 4 %. And then the revenues from reimbursable items, we raised from 5% to 6% growth, up from 3% to 5% that we had previously.", "So overall, earnings per share, $1.14 to $1.15, compared to our original guidance of $1.09 and $1.11. So when you take a look at our share repurchase, this accounted for about $0.015 on our earnings per share growth and the tax number is picked up another $0.03, and then CUP has added about $0.015. So if you take those 3 together, that's pretty much the $0.05 that we raised our earnings guidance up to $1.15.", "So with that, Phil, I'll turn it back over to you.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Thanks, Jimmy. Case -- I mean, Case, can I just open it up to questions now, if we can.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Glenn Fodor with Morgan Stanley.", "Glenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I missed some of the beginning comments on Capital One, so pardon me if any of these is repetitive. But I get the sense that pricing is nothing surprising versus other large renewals. But when you look at the final terms of the contract, can you give us any other color on what were the big swing factors versus your expectations, if any? And were there any changes to the terms and conditions that are worth calling out?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, we wouldn't -- we would never go into any details. I mean, the -- we're very happy with it. I don't think there were any major changes. There's was a lot of discussion 5 years ago that they had the option to license a software. That obviously, I mean, never came up. It's still there. And we feel like as long as we can do them a good job, keep them happy, and we have a great relationship with them. And I think we are certainly, hopefully, we're exceeding their expectations as that's the plan here every day. But, Glenn, we didn't really give a lot of details, when I was talking about it with the opening. There's not a lot of details of that we could give. But we're very happy to have this behind us. It's something that everybody knew is out there. I think it's a great endorsement. And we -- they're just a great client.", "Glenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. Well the message is clear it was a good renewal for you, so congratulations.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "It's a very good renewal for us, and we're thrilled about it.", "Glenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Very good. That just -- okay, so that's a large customer. Just switching to the small ones, if I could, for a minute. Could you just give us an update on your efforts to penetrate small bank market? I mean, there's obviously a lot of tension there. Given the potential share gains they could see as consumers maybe...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Yes. We have several things going there. I talked a little about TPS, a win we had there, we also are starting to talk to a lot of people that historically had been in the card issuing business and had sold out. And we're starting to see more and more people, more and more banks looking at the idea of getting back into the card issuing business. And I certainly think that we'll win more than our share -- our fair share there. We feel good about the ones that we're talking to today, and we're hopeful that we can bring those to closure and go public with them.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "I guess, my first question is just, obviously given the macro considerations and concerns out there, maybe just a little bit more color on the prospecting pipeline, not the conversion pipeline, but new deal activity and what you may be seeing in terms of sales cycle trends.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, I don't know that it's a sales cycle -- you've heard me say for years that the sales cycle in this business is pretty extended. We think it's anywhere on average from 6 months to 18 months. But I do think that, and I think I said this last quarter, that for the first time in several years, the U.S. market seems to be opening up a bit. The U.S. market went dark for a couple of years there, and we continue to do pretty well in the international side. And you may have heard where I talked about we've converted Swisscard and Cedacri, and we're very pleased with that. But I think our prospect pipeline is probably about as good as it's ever been.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "So -- but you're basically -- you're haven't -- you're not seeing any impact from the macro environment and the uncertainty out there, and people aren't holding back on making decisions is what it sounds like.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I think people are starting to make some decisions. I think people are starting to step out and talk to folks like us. And that's why I say I think our prospect pipeline is probably about as a as good as it's ever been. Obviously, you've got to close all those deals, and we'll certainly, I believe, close our fair share of them. But I mean, we're talking to people today that we have been trying to talk to you for a long time, and we're actually getting some traction on some of that, at least, in the talking phases. And which to me means that people are starting to feel at least somewhat more positive about where this economy is at. It's days like today that it just want -- make you want to pull your hair out.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Clearly, a lot of volatility.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "There's a lot of volatility in the market. But I think you have to look at this transaction business that we were talking about. If you look at First Data spend trend numbers or Global's numbers or our numbers, the -- it's very positive all the way around. And so we're starting to become much more optimistic about where this marketplace is going.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Maybe a different direction of question, as it relates to Durbin. And obviously, it's very recent that the rate changes went into effect. But are you detecting any sort of change in behavior and I'm kind of thinking potentially a shift in volume more toward credit away from debit or any change in behavior by your customers?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, we haven't seen it yet. Obviously, we're less than a month into this. There's been a lot of discussion, a lot of politics around it. But I still think people are going to continue, our banks will continue to issue debit cards. I think consumers like the debit card. I think sure, there's going to some folks that get really mad about fees. But the truth is, fees are a way of life, and you can -- some people will move their accounts. But I don't see debit card going away. And I do think that if you stop and you really think about the credit card product in many ways, it's -- you could say it's superior. I mean, it -- you can do about anything you want to do with a credit card, and it has some great protection there. But I don't -- I think the fact that people are just starting to spend a little bit again is the part that's encouraging to me. But I don't see the debit card going anywhere. I think it's -- the debit card is here to stay. We may have a bubble here in the near future that -- but I would be very surprised personally to see it happen.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays Capital.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just a quick question on the capital structure first, and really, the buybacks. I think you've bought back about 4 million shares, so far year-to-date. And I know you just increased the dividend, which is nice to see. Just when you think about the opportunity, though, I think your authorization still allows for something to the tune of about 8 million shares.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "That's right.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "You have $280 million of cash on the balance sheet now. And I think you have about something to the tune about -- what is it, $180 million of debt?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "That's right.", "James B. Lipham", "Right.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And we know you generate a healthy cash flow, and I think it's going up now, given what you just said about next quarter having less CapEx than last year. So obviously, there seems to be a significant  amount of opportunities. And I think you also, second quarter, had to hold off, given a potential deal that you were thinking about, at least. So your total buybacks, I would have thought would have been a little more significant during the quarter. Can you just comment on some of the opportunity and plans that you see in place and your thought process around capital return?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Sure. We have had -- we've had some opportunities this year, and we still have several opportunities. But they don't always pan out like you like for them to. We do have $280 million, I mean, in cash. Obviously, we have to operate this company. It's not like all that is available for -- to use for repurchase program. We still have some gas on the current program that we have today out there, the current repurchase program. I think unless something comes to fruition here fairly quickly, you'll probably see us back in the market. I mean, we thought it was time on the dividend payment to kind of raise our dividend, at least to the average of what the S&P 500 is, which is a little over [ph] 2%. We feel good about that. We have always said, Darrin, that we had rather add business to the books as opposed to buying stock back. We have, over the last year, I think we've spent about $113 million buying stock back. We have also, and Jimmy can give you the numbers, I don't have them right in front of me, but we spent an awful lot of money on other things -- well, I think I do have them, we can find that, but we spent well over $250 million or so.", "James B. Lipham", "$169 million on FNMS, TermNet was $39 million,  $72.9 million was share repurchase.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "So we -- what' s the total of that now, Jim? $240 million?", "James B. Lipham", "Yes, $240 million.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "So we have not been bashful in spending money. We have these operations scattered around the world, where a lot of that cash is we have in places like England and Japan. And we just need to run day-to-day operations there and serving the U.S. But we're looking at that every day, Darrin. And we're going to be aggressive. We think our operations are in good shape. We think our software packages are in great shape. We feel good about where we're at. And as the opportunities come along, we will jump back in the buyback market. We're pretty proud of what we bought back, frankly.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I think your guidance suggests 182 million shares for the year, which I think would probably correlate to about another 2 million shares or so for the fourth quarter. I mean, is that just a placeholder? I mean, do you think there's a possibility you could do more than? And then also...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I thought it was 190 million shares where we're at.", "James B. Lipham", "192 million.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Yes, 192 million.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "We thought you said 180...", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Maybe you meant to say 190 million.", "James B. Lipham", "Okay, call that 190 million [indiscernible].", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I thought he said 182 million.", "James B. Lipham", "I did too.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "So 192 million is -- is that just a placeholder or is that a -- should we actually think that there's a $2 million share buyback to be expected there in the quarter?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "That's the average about a year, Darrin.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Right. But I thought it just worked out to about $2 million for the quarter in all, when you do the math but maybe they...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "No, it don't work out just that way, but I think it won't affect the average that much.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Last question for me on the accounts on file, when you look at the growth, I mean, it was pretty healthy on the consumer credit side. And on the Commercial side, which obviously is, from what I understand, I mean, is a nice, nice area to grow. I mean, I think the profitability on those cards is obviously much higher than private label.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "They just have so much more activity.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Right. So what I was just really trying to figure out was when -- get you give us a sense of sort of going forward, how much more do those types of cards and that kind of growth on consumer and commercial positively impact the business then say a private label card would impact?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, I think they're substantial. I mean, I don't have the number in front of me. But if you look at, as an example, if you look at your typical Visa, MasterCards, you typically run a credit line of $1,800 to $2,500. On a commercial card, it's higher than that. And if you look at a retail card, it's probably $500 to $1,000. And the fact that you can take a consumer Visa, MasterCard or commercial card and use them virtually everywhere you can buy anything, and a private label card is pretty restricted as to what you can buy and where you can use it. And so it's just the utility of the card is just totally different. And so the transactions -- the highest transactions are on commercial cards and you go to consumer cards and then you -- way down the scale is a private label-type card.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "All right. Just last question for me and then -- on the Capital One renegotiation, I mean, I know there's probably not much you can comment on this, but as much as you can, I mean, were -- was HSBC at least part of the discussion around the negotiation process?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, I can't get into the any of that. I mean, obviously, that deal has not closed, and we've -- it's just not something that we're willing to talk about.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens Inc.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "First of all, just quick question. Jim or Phil, can you go through the one-time items again? And what I heard was, Jim, I think, that overall, there was $9 million or so in one-time items?", "James B. Lipham", "Correct.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Can you just detail those for me again? I apologize.", "James B. Lipham", "Yes. We had about a $4.1 million revenue adjustment on the merchant segment for FNMS, which pertained to 2010. We had about a $3.5 million incentive pickup. As our earnings continue to grow, we had to catch up our incentive plans during the third quarter. And that was about $3.5 million. And then we had a processing error in international about $1.5 million.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "And so all-in, I mean, when I do that math, that added -- that would have added $0.02 or $0.03 to the EPS, is that the math that you're doing?", "James B. Lipham", "Correct.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Okay, so that's thing #1. That's helpful. And then second of all, another just technical question. On the CUP Data, you said that for the year, you expect 19% year-over-year growth in that line all-in?", "James B. Lipham", "It'd be a little bit small all-in because Mexico's in the plan also. But the CUP itself has got an 18% to 19% growth, it looks where they're going to go and finish this year over last year.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So directionally, that would be correct.", "James B. Lipham", "Yes, correct.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "So we can kind of use that as a directional. Okay, that's fair. And on the free cash, I think you said it was $78 million this quarter. If you just multiply that by 4, you get something north of $300 million. And as I recall at the Analyst Day, the sort of longer-term guidance you gave of how much free cash you thought you could make over the next couple of years implied something between $250 million and $275 million. And I just -- I'm trying to square those 2 numbers. Any thoughts on that?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I think it's going to go closer to like $275 million, $300 million as we go forward.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "And what changed between then and now?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Fourth quarter of last year, we had very little free cash flow generated because of the capital expenditures we had of about $64 million, which was a customer signing incentive, as well as some software we purchased. We won't have that again this year. Once that fourth quarter of 2010 anniversaries, which it will this quarter, you'll see a big pickup in our free cash flow.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then the, the last -- just last question. When you think about the accounts on file that you said coming. And I think Phil, you said gross 12.5% by that year, ended 12% that are contractually obligated, net about 9%. Is that right?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "That's right.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Of that, call it, 9% are most of those not prepaid? Meaning, they're the better, more highly profitable cards?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Correct.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, I guess, my last question is when you think about your margins for '12, is there any step function of cost that we should see? Anything that will hurt the incremental margins that you guys have historically enjoyed, which have been very good? Is there any you guys see right now on the horizon that will change things as we look into '12?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I don't think so.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Phil, your comments about the prospect pipeline got me excited. You said that it's good as it ever has been. I guess the question...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I'm glad to see someone else is excited about something these days.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "No, I'm excited. But, the big but is when can you get it across the finish line? I mean, can we see something by the end of this calendar of an actual deal, big deal signing? Or is it going to take a little longer?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I'd get shot if I answer that thing right now. There's just no way to give that a guess. I'd love to say there's something that could get signed. But truth is, when we get to Thanksgiving, this business sort of shuts down and everybody goes into the holiday mode and not much business gets done, except transactions.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "But it sounds like in that prospect pipeline, people are looking at the decision very seriously to outsource. So it...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Yes. I think we have a lot of people that are looking at that. And as I say, even in the U.S., which truthfully, in '09 and '10 and part of '11, just was like pulling the shades down. I mean, there was just nobody home.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And what's driving that, especially in the U.S.? Is that just more regulation and higher cost and people are realizing...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Part of it, I mean, we just finished more regulation with Durbin. We went through the CARD Act. We've had big regulation very similar to the CARD Act in Canada and the U.K. So there's lots and lots of money being spent on the regulatory environment. And I think people are feeling marketing pressures from not only, I mean, from our customers who have a lot of flexibility on what they can do. And I think, again, we're starting to see people who think it's a good idea to be in this business again. We went through a period where it was not the coolest thing to do, was to be in the credit card business. It's starting to be a -- in vogue again, and that can't be anything but good for us.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And just my last question. What's the -- or how is the existing client base spending on value added services? I mean, are you seeing an uptick in interest in those products?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, I think we're seeing some of the volume that we had lost starting to come back. I mean, we actually have people who shut products down because they were just looking for anything to cut expenses. We're starting -- they have good products. They had products that people want to use, that people need to manage these portfolios. But during the most difficult and the darkest days, we saw people shut down products that we had never seen before. And so we're seeing some of that. I don't know that anybody's buying any more than they have historically. But certainly, we're seeing some customers come back, which is a very positive thing for us.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "So I wanted to ask you a question about the international margins. I know you guys have talked about it last quarter and said that you felt you could get back to the mid-teens range by, I think, Q3 of next year, once the big conversions are done, you'll start layering some revenue on top of the investments that you've made there, and getting some operating leverage. So I wanted to see if that's still your expectation based on how you see some of these conversions playing out?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I think that's still our expectations. I mean, I hope to tell you that we've signed some massive customer in Europe or somewhere, and we're going to spend a little money. But as we see it right now, those are our expectations. We feel good about where we're at. We feel good about these conversions that we're making progress with. And so we're not backing off that.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, good to know. And Phil, you always have a good kind of underlying gut feeling for where your business is going. I remember back at the Analyst Meeting in May, when you and I were talking, and you definitely had some more spring in your step, but you just felt better about what your clients were telling you and what your pipeline look at. And here we are a couple of quarters later, and you guys are raising numbers. So I wanted to try and tap into that crystal ball a little bit, I guess. As you start to think about 2012, and I know you guys can't offer official guidance just yet. But just what's your qualitative sense on the underlying growth potential of the business? Maybe if you can contrast that or compare it with how you were thinking about 2011 when you were sitting on the Q3 call this time last year?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, this time last year and the year before, I really thought all my hair was going to fall out. And most of it has, apparently. But I mean, the economic problems are not over. I mean, I've always felt that we've been in this thing so long that people are having -- a lot of people are having a hard time being optimistic about the sun coming up tomorrow. I'm not having that problem. I think we've got an awful lot to be optimistic about. But we still got some issues that we have to address. We've got some headwinds that we're going to have to deal with, most of which we have certainly talked to you guys about on several occasions. But we do -- I mean, we -- some good things will happen, some bluebird events will happen, and those, we're not talking about bluebird events, those are things like some of the acquisitions that our Canadian banks have made recently. That business moves to us. That's a very, very good thing for us. And it allows us to leverage our operations here in a very strong way. So I'm feeling pretty good about next year. I mean, I wish I could say it was a slam dunk. I certainly don't believe that. If what we're seeing is a trend, and again, if you look at the transaction numbers that First Data puts out or Global puts out, that we put out, it's starting to feel better. And I don't know what's going to happen with this holiday season. And I think the conventional wisdom is maybe a 2% increase, I hope we do that. I think that'll be good for everybody. I really hope we can do more. But at least we're not looking at a negative number, as we have for a couple of years there. So I mean, I don't have a crystal ball, but it's feeling a whole lot better than it did in '08 and '09 and '10.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And just last one for me, going back to the accounts on file. The government vertical, I think, was up over 21% here in Q3, which I think is, by far, the best growth you've seen at least this year or year-to-date. Was there any single program or two that you would call out there as driving the growth? And are those cards, for the most part, active cards?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "No, it's just a good business. I mean, I don't...", "James B. Lipham", "About 6 million accounts.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Jimmy said it's about 6 million accounts. But I mean, that's turned out to be a very good business for us, and we want it to grow more. But we're feeling good about that. But I don't think there was any one special thing that happened that I'm aware of anyway.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of Roman Leal with Goldman Sachs.", "Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "First, I wanted to follow-up on the growth in commercial and consumer credit. It seemed that the growth was really strong this quarter. Can you give us a little more color on what drove that? Was that mostly existing clients or new clients brought on board this quarter?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Most of it is existing clients who have just gotten more aggressive. Now we -- I don't think we added a commercial client. As a matter of fact, I'm sure we didn't add a commercial client. It's just really all organic. We have added some consumer clients and certainly that's positive, but nothing huge.", "Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, good to know. And in terms of consumer or even just, I guess, on the credit side, if you look at what you see in North America and international, are there any big differences there in terms of the type of customers that issuers are looking for? Is it mostly affluent internationally like in North America? Or are you seeing a little bit more kind of diversity in the credits spectrum here?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "We're seeing it across the board and everything I'm reading, we're seeing -- I mean, what I'm reading is not only certainly affluent, but even down to some sub-prime issuance. There are some pundits out there that believes the more affluent segment is driving the growth. I wish I knew how to figure that out. It would be helpful.", "Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Interesting. And then the last one on prepaid. I think you said that the active -- the percentage of that portfolio that's active is about 6%. I wonder, is that a pretty stable number? Or does it vary a lot? And obviously, any trends in the pickup of activity there?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "That's a pretty accurate number. We haven't seen anything that make us believe it's -- there's anything really different this quarter than in past quarters.", "Listen, I'll close this thing out. And we appreciate your questions, and thank you for being on the phone with us. We are feeling more positive. We know that we all feel struggles that we continue to see in the financial and credit markets. And really, almost daily economic gyrations occurring in Europe, and we're certainly in Europe. And today, again, as I said earlier, is a good example of that. I know one thing that we believe, and that is that electronic payments is an important part of the global economy. And I think it's going to continue to be a real mainstream, and be a key part of both the developed and emerging markets. ", "We continue to see solicitations increasing. I hope you see that. These solicitations offer a lot of new products and options from issuers that really are directed at trying to figure out how to get folks to use their cards even more. It's a product that has great, great utility. ", "We have great confidence in our team, and our team is better today than it has ever been in history. And we think we've got good strategies in place to get us through the future here. We'll continue to be successful in meeting these challenges. And we strongly believe that better days are ahead, not only for TSYS, but for our industry in general. ", "I want to thank you for your interest in TSYS and your time this evening on this call. And if you have any additional questions, like I told you before, Shawn Roberts is available 24 hours a day, 24 by 7, you've got his number. And he's looking to hear from you. ", "So again, thanks for being with us today, and we look forward to chatting with you as time goes by. Bye bye.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

(NYSE:TSS)", "Q3 2006 Earnings Call", "October 18, 2006 8:30 am ET", "Executives", "Phil Tomlinson - CEO", "Jim Lipham \u2013 CFO", "Analysts", "Tony Wible \u2013 Citigroup", "Greg Smith \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Tim Willi \u2013 AG Edwards", "Greg Moyer \u2013 Soleil Securities", "Paul Bartolai - Credit Suisse", "Roger Smith \u2013 Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Tony Davis - Ryan Beck", "Operator", "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the TSYS third quarter 2006 earnings conference call.  (Operator Instructions)  It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Phil Tomlinson. Sir, the floor is yours.", " Phil Tomlinson", "Thank you, Michelle and good morning to everyone on the phone. Before I get started, I wanted to call your attention to the fact that we'll be making forward-looking statements about future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS' actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth in our reports filed with the SEC. ", "We are very excited about our third quarter. In the first nine months of 2006, we really met and in a lot of ways exceeded our expectations. For the third quarter, EPS increased 13% to $0.28 per share. Total revenues increased 4.7% to $441.8 million; and for the first nine months our earnings per share increased 12% to $0.82.  Total revenues increased 8.5% to $1.283 billion. ", "On another positive note, we also announced that we increased our 2006 and 2007 earnings guidance. We now expect to have earnings growth in the 26% to 28% range versus the 21% to 23% range that we had given you at the first of the year; and a decline in the earnings growth in the range of 9% to 7% versus a decline of 16% to 14% for 2007. So I think you can see that we're making good progress on our plan to deal with the loss of a couple of very large customers. We think it's impressive considering the challenges we faced with those losses and the size of those losses. ", "We take a lot of pride in telling you that we've had a very productive and successful quarter with the conversion of several new large, core portfolios and the positive moves we've experienced in some of our international markets. I'm proud to report that we have now have moved, as of last weekend, the majority of Capital One\u2019s portfolio to TS2 and have had a very successful conversion of approximately 46 million accounts. There are several more million accounts that will be converted in the first quarter of 2007. ", "In addition, we've also converted, very recently, Banco Popular out of Puerto Rico; Toronto Dominion,  and Crosstown Traders, which is a retail card based out of the Charming Shoppes Group; and also, the branded cards of a major retail client that we've chatted about before. All of that is done. ", "Obviously on the negative side of the scale, the Bank of America, at least as far as we know, their deconversion is scheduled to begin tomorrow. ", "Some highlights for the quarter as we have mentioned before, we continue to expand with our global footprint with the acquisition of Card Tech Limited, now known as TSYS Card Tech. It gives us a great reach that we have not previously had. We're now serving 76 countries worldwide. This acquisition enables us to support financial institutions of all sizes and complexity in a lot of countries it would have taken us years to gain entry into. ", "We also increased our equity interest in China Union Pay, cut data to 44.5%. We really do believe that the Chinese market is on the verge of explosion. It's going to be a great market to be in long term. I think we're starting to see some activity as a result of the 2008 Olympics that will be held in Beijing. We believe that's going to push the Chinese market to be more aggressive, particularly on the merchant side of this business which will help the cardholder side. ", "TSYS Acquiring Solutions also announced a deal with Discover Financial Services and they plan to integrate the Discover Network Card acceptance into the offering for our merchant acquirers and the ISOs, or the independent sales organizations. Our objective is to offer our clients the ability to include the Discover Network brand across its product suite, along obviously with Visa and MasterCard. Full support for Discover products will be available on our systems including integrated merchant billing, reporting, statements, servicing, settlement processing, and exception and chargeback management. ", "We also several weeks ago announced our first processing deal with a card issuer in Japan. As you have heard me talk about in years past, we've been in Japan a little over five years now and we have had no success in breaking the code, if you will, for the processing market. We now think we have done that. We will offer a new multi-function co-branded Visa card offered by Toyota Finance and Nikko Cordial Securities. ", "If I could take just a second and talk to you about this. Toyota will issue the Visa Platinum cards for Nikko Securities. The Nikko is one of Japan's largest security companies. The card will be linked to the customer's brokerage account and it will facilitate the cash access to the domestic ATMs and purchase transactions in Japan. Given the fact that many Nikko Cordial customers hold accounts in more than two currencies, cardholders can settle with a Yen-based account for domestic transactions and the U.S.-dollar based account also for overseas transactions. And when I see overseas, I am talking about outside of Japan. ", "We're excited about this and we do think that it really is sort of like getting the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval. We think it's a real break in the Japanese market. Japan is the third-largest card market in the world and we see a lot of opportunities there. We are determined that we will be successful in that market long-term. ", "We've also just recently announced an agreement with United Cinemas in Japan and will process the Cinema gift card, which is a prepaid card that can be used in the theater, in the ticket offices of the theater and museum shops. So stay tuned for more and more happening Japan. ", "We think we had a very good quarter from a financial perspective. We had some surprises that Jimmy Lipham is going to talk about. I'm going to turn it over to Jim Lipham, our CFO now, for more details. ", "Jim Lipham", "Thank you, Phil. I would like to direct everyone to the highlight page of the P&L that we sent out with the press release. I'll try to cover some of these large changes that you see, or one-time items that Phil has talked about. ", "First of all, in the electronic payment processing revenue line, it is our core business, it was up 3.5% for the quarter and 6% for the year. As you know, most of the increase came for both of these from the additional customers that we added last year in the Chase, the Fleet business with BofA, Fifth Third, ABN AMRO and the like. We also added 25 million accounts during the quarter with Toronto Dominion being a large one there; and a large retailer that we're still not disclosing the name of. We had 25 million accounts for the quarter, obviously that offset the loss of the Sears revenue. We also picked up Card Tech and recorded for the full quarter about $6 million in revenue there. ", "Our internal growth in accounts were solid again, with a growth rate of around 11.56%. Our accounts on file are 400 million at the end of the quarter, we're down 30 million from a year ago and that's the result, obviously, of the deconversion of Sears; around 85 million accounts. We have made up quite a bit of that loss. ", "International, when we look at the revenue, it increased $18 million for the quarter, $29 million for the year-to-date. The revenues generated in Mexico are continuing to show good growth, as well as Europe. We're very excited about that. I mentioned Card Tech, it is in that international arena for $6 million both for the quarter and year-to-date. ", "The revenues in Europe mainly were impacted positively by the currency translation adjustment during the quarter of about $1.5 million and on an annual basis we're still being negatively impacted by about $2.5 million. ", "As Phil mentioned in the release, we announced two relationships in Japan with Toyota Finance and United Cinemas. We continue to see good solid growth from our international clients, and also part of our story for '07 is the growth and revenues we're anticipating there. ", "Year-to-date, our value-added service revenues grew 15%, 10% from '06 to '05. Still showing double-digit growth there. In terms of our volumes, our quarterly comparisons to the third quarter of '05 are impacted by the anniversary of Chase who converted last year, during the beginning of the third quarter. We saw our authorizations grow close to 9% for the quarter and 19% year-to-date. ", "Our transaction growth was 6% for the quarter and 18% year-to-date. That equates to total authorizations in the nine-month period of about 6.6 billion and transactions around 7.3 billion for the year. ", "With the completed conversion that Phil mentioned on capital this month, we are expecting these volumes to return back on a quarter basis to double-digit growth levels again. ", "We'll drop down to the merchant services line, this of course was vital. They're down when compared to last year. The decrease mainly comes from the closing of the POS terminal business in San Diego we had mentioned previously. If you remember, it's about a $4 million decrease in revenues, but there was no margin in this business to speak of. It was just a decrease in revenue, but it also helped our operating income. ", "They are also experiencing a little reduction in reselling of the Visa and Amdex products. In the third quarter of '05, we also had about $5 million one-time termination fees associated with Hartland leaving, Citi leaving on the back end of South Trust. So the third quarter of '05 was positively impacted by that $5 million. ", "TSYS Acquiring Solutions front-end transaction volumes for the third quarter grew 16% and for the year 14.6%. Very good growth, and as Phil mentioned they did announce plans to put the Discover Network card acceptance into their line of services at the acquirers and the ISO organizations. ", "I might mention also that Vital during the quarter signed five new start-up clients, and that's very positive also. Sequentially the revenues in Vital are stabilized. I think going forward we can expect the revenues from the merchant services to stay in the same dollar range for the near term. ", "TSYS Acquiring, they continue to focus on making the business as efficient as possible and growing earnings through expanded product offerings and continued expense controls. They've made a lot of progress this quarter with lower telecom rates, lower inventory costs, lower bad debt charges. They redid their contract with TNS and got some lower rates. So the operating margin for the quarter, when you compare it back to last year, was up to 26% this year over 19% operating profit margin last year. So we're very pleased with the direction that TSYS Acquiring is headed and we continue to expect great things out of them. ", "We\u2019ll drop down to the other services. Revenue for the third quarter increased 3%, $1 million. We've had some increases there in all of our lines of business, TDM as well as ESC. Loyalty, we did experience under this Capital One contract a decrease in revenues for the quarter where we reclassed close to $6 million in pass-through revenues, and that will continue. The revenues from reimbursable items, they're up 25% for the quarter and 18% year-to-date. We've talked about that being the postage and now the reimbursable items that are associated with the attorney and court costs at TDM. ", "So total revenues for the third quarter increased 5%, as Phil said. Excluding reimbursables, we were relatively flat. The growth in new clients and services helped offset the decrease of the loss of revenues associated with Sears. ", "As we continue down the page, talking about expenses, our expense growth in employment was up 15%. Very unusual, obviously for the quarter. We expect that to drop back to the 5% range of growth in the fourth quarter. But any way for the quarter, we had the adoption of the 123 R for fair value of stock options; that resulted in about a $5 million increase year-over-year in expense. We also had normal merit increases and the acquisition of Card Tech. We added about $3 million there in employment expenses. But on a sequential basis, employment expenses are up approximately $19 million. Contributing to the sequential growth outside of the merit increases and Card Tech, we also had increases in contract labor, which we use in our call center business. ", "Then as a result of our revised earnings estimates from the original plan, we subsequently revised our at-risk estimates or performance-based incentives and that includes our 401K, profit sharing, annual bonuses. These increases, we booked nine-twelfths of them during the quarter, it was about $8 million that will be considered a one-time or catch-up expense here in the third quarter. ", "During the quarter we also made plans for the closure of our Jacksonville office, which required us to book around $1.5 million in severance pay and termination benefits. That's scheduled to close in November and that's roughly 74 people. ", "So this year we've made a concerted effort to make efficient use of people and redeploy resources. Our headcount at the end of September is approximately 80 people, down from where it was in December of last year. Excluding the employees gained through Card Tech which was around 204 people, we're down approximately 120 people. I mentioned the Jacksonville office, that will also reduce our headcount 70-plus in November. ", "If we drop down to the equipment category, it's actually down 2% to $76 million. During the year, as you know, we've added leased equipment and software expense to meet the necessary capacity we would have to have for the bringing on of Capital One and continuing to process Bank of America and Chase. We were, this quarter, operating at our highest production capacity in our history.", "As you recall, some of our software licenses are on the process and capacity or MIPS arrangements where we amortize based on the units of production method. When these deconversions are scheduled this month, our future MIPS will decline, resulting in a decrease of software amortization for the periods. I'll make mention here that in this fourth quarter you will see a pick-up of our normal occupancy and equipment expense as we prepare to charge off a piece of software that we will no longer be using. It's going to be roughly around a $10 million pick-up in the fourth quarter and expense above what level you see it at right now. But that will be a great benefit for us as we won't have expenses as we go into '07, and that's also a part of our guidance for '07. ", "Other expenses decreased 23%, $16.2 million. The main driver there for the decrease relate to the decrease in transaction delivery services at TSYS Acquiring, which I mentioned before, and the treatment of court costs as reimbursable items at Total Debt Management, that's about $1.2 million for the quarter. ", "Sequentially, other expenses decreased $6.8 million. The main drivers still being the delivery services and we had some decreased errors during the quarter from where we were in the second quarter. When you exclude the reimbursables, our operating profit margin for the third quarter of '06 and '05 are both at 21%. For the first nine months, our operating profit margin is 22.6%. We still expect at year end it will be around 25.3% in profit margin after we take on the big termination fee of Bank of America. ", "Other income increased 1.8 for the third quarter and 6.3 year-to-date. We have increased amounts of cash during this year and obviously with the higher rates we picked up more interest income than we had originally forecasted or thought we would have.", "Income taxes, I know it\u2019s a concern, it\u2019s down roughly 6% to 8%. The effective tax rate for the quarter ended at 29.4% compared to 36% last year. For the first 9 months, our effective tax rate was 32.8% compared to 35.3% in '05. ", "As our business has continued to develop in the European Union region, it was desirable for us to create a structure that mirrors our growth this that region and facilitate future expansion. The statutory structure provides us with marketing and personnel hiring advantages when compared to the branch operation we originally had, as well as provides us with certain U.S. and U.K. tax benefits. ", "So in the third quarter of '06, we completed the restructuring from a branch office to the new structure and as a result of the U.K. restructuring we had an adjustment to previously established tax reserves that no longer required were required under the new structure and it was a pick-up of about $5.6 million. ", "We do anticipate our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 34% and for '07 it will grow back to 35% to 36% range, somewhere in-between there. ", "So the net income for the quarter is up 13% or $7 million. As Phil mentioned we had earnings per share of $0.28 for the quarter and $0. 82 year-to-date. ", "With that I'd like to ask you to move forward to the balance sheet just to make a few comments there about major changes. The cash is at $295.5 million and it has increased $18 million since December. We've had the acquisition of Card Tech and the increased investment in CUP Data as well as it shows the increase in our goodwill and our equity investment. Those are the major changes there; as you can see, we have been amortizing software quite rapidly and that's showing a big decrease. ", "On the cash flow page, if you turn there, we had a significant contribution to cash from operating activities, $231.5 million. So we're continuing to show good growth there. We invested $21 million in property and equipment, mainly in hardware; and $23 million in software, $9 million for purchased and of course $14 million for developed. We don't anticipate any major capital expenditures by the end of the year and expect to stay in the range of $60 million to $70 million for '06. ", "During the quarter we used around $75 million to acquire TSYS Card Tech and the additional interest in CUP Data. We also used close to $22 million to repurchase 1.1 million shares of stock under our share repurchase plan. That leaves us with about 900,000 shares remaining to be acquired. Of course, we paid dividends of 13.8. So if you look at our free cash flow analysis for the year, it stands around $69 million. ", "In summary, from the operations with a continued focus on controlling expenses and redeploying headcount, we believe we're on target to make our revised '06 earnings forecast of 26% to 28%. With that, I'd like to give you a little bit of support behind our '07 guidance as to why it increased. We're still in the midst of our budget and process for '07, but we felt it was necessary to raise the guidance for '07 as a result of these cost savings being generated in '06 and that are expected to carry over into '07. ", "We believe the savings generated during '06 of managing headcount will have a significant impact on '07 as these savings will be experienced for the entire year. Our headcount totals in '07 will be flat with the headcount totals we anticipate to end this year with. ", "We're also anticipating savings between $30 million to $40 million in occupancy costs in '07 as a result of reducing the processing capacity. The anticipated cost savings, combined with the expected growth in Europe, the expected growth in TSYS Acquiring solutions all contribute to the new guidance for '07.", "With that, Phil, I'll turn it back over to you. ", " Phil Tomlinson", "Thank you, Jimmy. Now I'd like to just open it up for questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Tony Wible \u2013 Citigroup.", " Tony Wible \u2013 Citigroup", "Good morning, guys. A couple of questions.  That growth that you're looking for in Europe, the acceleration that you're now seeing, what's driving that outside of just foreign exchange? Because it looks to be a little bit more material.", "Secondly I had a question on Bank of America, just given that we're right ahead of the holiday season is there any chance that they're going to delay?  It sounds like you're actually pretty confident that it's going to start relatively soon.", "Jim Lipham", "From the growth in Europe, Tony, what we're seeing there is just good internal growth and they are actively engaged in some new customer agreements. So we're seeing some good prospects there.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Tony, on the Bank of America side, our belief is that they will start this conversion tomorrow and it's going to take several days to get it done; but we fully expect that to happen, and we would be surprised -- we'd be surprised, but delighted, if they delayed but we don't expect that.", " Tony Wible \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay, great.  Just a housekeeping question on Chase.  Is it still too early to break out what you would anticipate for the timing of a Chase move to in-house and the revenue and operating income?  ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, it's too early on the revenue and operating income, but the timing we think is in the July/August/September timeframe, 2007.  Sometime in that timeframe is what we're talking about.", " Tony Wible \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay, great.  Thank you very much guys.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thank you.  ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Greg Smith \u2013 Merrill Lynch.", " Greg Smith \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "The software write-off you talked about that's going to happen, can you just explain exactly what that's coming from, and then what's the annualized savings from that specifically you're expecting in '07?", "Jim Lipham", "Greg, it's a piece of software that we're replacing with another product from IBM that's going to save us roughly $10 million in '07, and that's really the $10 million that's accelerated here into the fourth quarter.  ", " Greg Smith \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Then with MasterCard now public, Visa talking about going public, I am just wondering what your guys' reaction is.  Has MasterCard been treating you any differently?  Are there any new threats or frankly opportunities you anticipate from the change in their ownership structures?", " Phil Tomlinson", "Well, I don't think they've been treating us any differently.  Obviously we've had a very close relationship, particularly with Visa and MasterCard, but you know, we were business partners with VISA, with Vital for ten years  I think there are some opportunities for us, and we have discussed a few of those opportunities, but I think these guys are starting to get their sea legs now, and it is no surprise to anybody the news about Visa.", "We get a lot of questions about whether they will compete with us or not.  I do not expect that to happen, but I think we can do more together in a commercial sense, as time goes forward. There is nothing imminent there and we are not having any serious conversations at this point.", " Greg Smith \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Okay, and then just one last question.  Fidelity National formerly Certegy announced the win with DB&T.  It seems outside of their core.  Do you see them as a bigger competitive threat?", "Jim Lipham", "Well certainly they are a competitor.  We competed with Certegy for years.  As you know, they own them.  I mean, I think what they have been trying to do is leverage their larger relationships  particularly on the mortgage processing side. I think we are going to have to keep a very close eye on those guys.  They are smart folks and we treat them as a very aggressive competitor.Operator", "Your next question comes from Tim Willi \u2013 AG Edwards. ", " Tim Willi \u2013 AG Edwards", "A couple of quick questions here.  First of all, Jim could you just restate the annual occupancy savings you would expect in '07?  I could not write fast enough to get that down.", "Jim Lipham", "It is going to be in the $30 million to $45 million range.", " Tim Willi \u2013 AG Edwards", "Second is, I just wanted to clarify that this about $10 million of software that you expect to write off in 4Q, is that included in your guidance of 26% to 28% growth?", "Jim Lipham", "Yes it is.", " Tim Willi \u2013 AG Edwards", "A related question to Greg's about customer losses.  First Data announced a big contract with Barclay\u2019s.  Does that impact anything that you are doing with them right now?", " Phil Tomlinson", "We don\u2019t think it impacts anything right now and certainly we think, as we understood it that was for their international processing. International, it was really for their partnership programs.  We continue to do a lot of work Barclay\u2019s.  I think we are optimistic that we will do more work with Barclay\u2019s.  There are still a lot of opportunities there.", " Tim Willi \u2013 AG Edwards", "Just a last question, sort of a two-part one, but could you first maybe characterize domestic pipelines?  Whether that be just an aggregate or sorted between prepaid, retail and consumer?  Also, could you just give us an update on TSYS Acquiring and where it is at in terms of getting ready to be rolled out in the European market?", "Jim Lipham", "Well, I do not have those pipeline numbers here, I should have gotten it from our board meeting that we had yesterday, but we have some strong letters of intent that we have not announced yet and we will try to work on our pipeline.  I thought about that this morning, because we usually talk about pipelines. But on the international side, we have \u2013 ", " Phil Tomlinson", "Have we announced this? ", "Jim Lipham", "I was about to get myself in trouble.  We think we're very close to announcing a merchant processing contract in Europe which will be our very first one, so we're excited about that.  But I would say within the next six to 12 months you should look for some success, particularly in the European arena on the merchant side.", " Tim Willi \u2013 AG Edwards", "Just back to the domestic pipelines, I understand that you don't have any info in front of you, but is there a way, Phil that you might be able to characterize if it's more traditional Visa/MasterCard driven pipelines or is it more in the prepaid and the retail card space?", " Phil Tomlinson", "I'm looking at it here.  Today our domestic pipeline is about 14 million accounts.", "Jim Lipham", "That's after the Capital One that we just finished.", " Tim Willi \u2013 AG Edwards", "That's before the strong letters of intent that you mentioned?", " Phil Tomlinson", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paul Bartolai - Credit Suisse.", "Paul Bartolai - Credit Suisse", "First question is on the TSYS Acquiring business.  Could you give us some sense given the transaction growth and where revenue growth was adjusted for the one-time factors, just what you are seeing on the pricing front and if that's changing at all?", " Phil Tomlinson", "I think the pricing, frankly, has remained fairly stable.  We have, over the last 18 months we've renegotiated all of the large contracts and feel good about where we are there.  Obviously that is a price-driven market from the merchant side of the house and I think that will always be under pressure; but from the processing side we believe it's stable.  ", "Paul Bartolai - Credit Suisse", "It looks like the contract acquisition costs have been increasing steadily the past few quarters.  Are you seeing anything different in the competitive environment or the terms that are needed to sign new business?", " Phil Tomlinson", "I was trying to think on the contract acquisition costs, I guess the prepaid stuff with Capital One, Banco Popular was a new customer we brought on and then the Cap One.  So it was related to new conversions.", "Paul Bartolai - Credit Suisse", "And you're not seeing anything different in terms of what you need to do to sign new business or the terms?", " Phil Tomlinson", "You're talking about like upfront payments and that sort of thing?  No.  Now we certainly wouldn't be surprised if that were to happen, but we have not seen any increase there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Greg Moyer \u2013 Soleil Securities.", " Greg Moyer \u2013 Soleil Securities", "One question, more of an overview question on the single Euro payment area initiative.  Visa just discussed that they're going to leave their European entity alone because they feel political issues in terms of an American company competing for new processing contracts there and taking jobs from European companies could have posed a significant risk to their ability to grow in the markets.  I'm wondering if you're approaching things any differently or if you view those risks as serious or not?", " Phil Tomlinson", "That has not been a big issue to date.  We obviously process all of our European business out of the U.K.  Obviously there's a lot of nationalism in Europe and people are very sensitive about jobs but at this point, we just haven't run into that as big issue.  I mean it's an issue; it's an issue in the States.  It's an issue everywhere you go.  But I don't think that we've run into and feel like it's a more serious issue in Europe than it is anywhere else.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Roger Smith \u2013 Fox-Pitt Kelton. ", " Roger Smith \u2013 Fox-Pitt Kelton", "I just have a couple of questions really on the expenses here.  Did you say that the compensation expense in the third quarter was $5 million higher because of the FAS 123 R? And is that really not going to be recurring going forward and that really brings you down to that 135 or 134 range that you're implying for the fourth quarter?  ", "Jim Lipham", "The 123 R was compared to last year, the $5 million was.  It will go forward.", " Roger Smith \u2013 Fox-Pitt Kelton", "So then it looks like were going to have a sequential decline by about $5 million from the third quarter to the fourth quarter.  Is that primarily the temporary workers that you talked about?  ", "Jim Lipham", "Well it's that and we booked nine-twelfths of those benefits during the third quarter.  Jacksonville was a write-off in the third quarter.", " Roger Smith \u2013 Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Then on the occupancy and expense, you said it was going to be down $30 million to $45 million.  Is that primarily going to be just the change in amortization or is there really some kind of real cost that's going down there as well?", "Jim Lipham", "The change in the amortization will be about half of it and then you'll have another change due to this software we're writing off here in the fourth quarter.", " Roger Smith \u2013 Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Lastly on the other expense line, it looked like it was down nicely in the quarter and you talked about that being due to Vital.  Is that a run rate number that we can look at going forward?", "Jim Lipham", "Right now we're looking at their profit margins to mirror TSYS now and in the 24%  to 25% range as we go forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tony Davis - Ryan Beck.", "Tony Davis - Ryan Beck", "A couple things, versus the current run rate at TSYS Acquiring, any comment or call you can give us on the impact of the Discover agreement here?  I presume that should have a salutatory impact on their margins.", " Phil Tomlinson", "I don't think we can give you any numbers on it Tony, just common sense tells us it's going to increase transactions and that's got to be good for the Acquiring company and TSYS.  ", "Tony Davis - Ryan Beck", "Another thing you did last year, I believe Phil, was you had a write off of DoubleByte software investment.  I wonder if you can comment on the impact of that treatment in terms of margins for the business in Japan versus the domestic business.", " Phil Tomlinson", "I'm not quite sure how to answer that, but obviously we were wrote the $10 million off on DoubleByte, we had just decided that we probably got ahead of ourselves trying to write that software and it was inadequate for what we ultimately found ourselves doing.  We have figured out a better, more unique way to do it in Japan that is not nearly as expensive.  Frankly, we think we can do a lot of the Asian processing, if you will out, of Columbus, Georgia if we can get past the cultural issues.  We've been able to do that to this point.  ", "We are very excited about what's happened in Japan with Toyota and Nikko. I mean we were the only people in Japan that can do this dual currency product.  They're very excited about it.  As a result our discussions with other issuers have picked up.  Again it's a very unique market.  Nobody wants to be first and now we have someone who has gone first and it takes the pressure off of the decision an awful lot.  ", "So I think that we found the Japanese to be very difficult and tough negotiators but at the end of the day they understand that we need a fair margin, and we believe we've gotten that.   Obviously those margins would increase dramatically if we were processing about half the Japanese market.", "Tony Davis - Ryan Beck", "All right.  Finally, Phil, I sense incrementally much more optimism about Europe post-Card Tech.  Can you give us any color in terms of market response to this, let's say more easily adoptable product set than TS2?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, I think it's been a very positive response in the marketplace.  The Card Tech customers, while somewhat surprised, are very optimistic about what has happened.  The people who work at Card Tech, we are very, very impressed with them as we told you last time.  ", "Any large international bank that's doing business in Europe, they are also trying to go into these emerging and developing countries.  It certainly allows us to go into those countries with them very quickly.  But it's not just in Europe.  I mean we've got customers in Africa now and in the Middle East, in the former Soviet satellites.  It\u2019s really all over the world and I think it's going to help us culturally.  I think it's going to help us become a global company more easily.  It's been good for us as a company in helping us understand that there's a lot of this world that we don't really understand.  So we've had a very good response out of that.  Frankly it's been better than what we had expected.", "By the way, it's a great product on top of that.  As we told you last time it's not only a card-processing product; it's a merchant processing product, it's a debit card processing product.  So it gives us a lot of opportunities that we didn't have prior to that acquisition.", "Operator", "Sir, there appear to be no further questions in the queue.  Do you have any closing comments you'd like to finish with?", " Phil Tomlinson", "Well, yes I would like to just say thank you for showing your interest this morning.  It means an awful lot to us.  This is a business that is changing every day, I think we\u2019re continuing to make good progress, not only in our core business but with our affiliates. Our loyalty company is booming right now. Our product, our GUI front-end profit product is working incredibly well; it\u2019s with several of our very largest customers. So a lot of things are starting to come together. ", "We\u2019re bracing for a big holiday season, we\u2019re ready to go and we\u2019ll continue to sell into all these markets and are very optimistic about our future. So, we look forward to chatting with you in January and talking about 2006 and 2007 beyond.

We'll open the floor for your questions or comments following the presentation. ", "It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Phil Tomlinson. Sir, the floor is yours. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thank you, Anthony, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. We are very excited about our report, and look forward to chatting with you. As usual, before I get started, I wanted to call your attention to the fact that we will be making forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS. These statements involve risks and uncertainties. So, any factors that could cause TSYS's actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in our reports filed with the SEC. ", "I\u2019ll tell you we are feeling pretty good today, we sort of feel like the kid who has pulled a rabbit out of the hat. We really think we've made great, great progress, and we are awfully proud of what our people have been able to accomplish. And we are going to get right into that. ", "Obviously, there has been lot of buzz in the industry about what's going on in First Data and Metavante, and we've been quietly settling down here going about our business. We believe that our results were outstanding. As you saw the revenues before reimbursables increased 4.3%, compared to 2006 quarter one. ", "And if you look at it both Sears and Bank of America were included in quarter one '06, and over $50 million in core revenues went away from the first quarter of '07 as a result of losing those two clients. ", "We've replaced that lost revenue in new business and really strong internal growth. Speaking of internal growth, it was over 12%. Net income was an all time record setting $57.3 million, up, 13.7%. ", "Our operating margins before reimbursable revenues increased from 21.8 to 24.9 quarter-over-quarter. And as we told you in our last conference call, we expect these margins to be in the 25% to 26% range for '07. ", "Our diluted earnings per share increased 13.9% to $0.29 a share in the first quarter of '07, compared to $0.26 in the first quarter of '06. ", "From March 31, '06, through March 31, '07, we added over 132 million new accounts internally and from new clients. We also generated this quarter $67 million new cash. As you know, we have been really counting on our international growth as said, and international revenues grew 47% in the quarter. ", "I think it's just incredibly impressive to note that on a non-GAAP pro forma basis, net income for the year should increase in the 20% to 22% range, up from our previous guidance of 14% to 17%. And on a GAAP basis we have improved net income guidance from minus 3% to a new guidance range of flat to a plus 2%. ", "Back in May of 2006, our best guess here were the problems that we were dealing with, that we would be down 17% to 15% as I recall. And we have made up all of that difference and more. ", "I think these results, if somebody had suggested this to me six months ago, nine months ago, I would have said, it is impossible. It's a result of our team working on revenue growth and expense control. And I think this just is a great indicator of how truly resilient TSYS is. ", "We had some nice highlights for the quarter. We signed agreements to provide merchant processing solutions for Clearent and National Processing. And as you know, National Processing was formally the Iron Triangle Payment Solutions. ", "We renewed merchant processing agreements with Sage Payment Solutions and Moneris Solutions for their U.S. portfolio. We signed Norway's largest financial services group the DnB NOR Bank certainly in Norway. We are going to manage their fast growing portfolio. They have plans to really grow and we're very excited about it. And that is a Card Tech opportunity by the way. And they will be among the first to implement SEPA compliant technology, which we think is going to be a real plus for us long-term. ", "We also resigned Spira de M\u00e9xico to another long-term contract. And as you know they are one of Mexico's largest private label companies or retailers. ", "And last but certainly not least we completed the final phase of the Cap One conversion. ", "We are absolutely thrilled about the improvement in our 2007 guidance, and again think it is a great indicator of our business and financial strength in what we can do when pushed, and have to do it when we feel good about what we've been able to accomplish. ", "And with that I'm going to turn it over to Jim Lipham, our Chief Financial Officer who is going to give you a lot more details. ", "Jim Lipham", "Thank you, Phil. I'd ask that you look at the income statement that was attached to the press release, and I'll go down and talk about the various line items there and try to give you a little color for them. ", "As we look at the first line, electronic payment process and as you know that's our core process in service line, also includes now our license and arrangements. But this number was up 4.1% for the quarter and that's $9.1 million. Phil mentioned the first quarter of last year and the $50 million of revenues that was associated with the two de-conversions and if you backed that out on a pro forma basis quarter-to-quarter would have been 34.6% just outstanding growth. But our revenue growth is fueled by initial internal growth its 12.3%. We also had new business that includes acquisition that added about 20% of the growth. ", "Account on file numbers are about 17 or 7 million accounts below prior year, which is really good considering the loss of over 132 million accounts from those two large customers. We also saw good growth in the quarter from our transactions, they were up 10% to $2.5 billion and authorizations were up 12% to $2.3 billion. ", "In the International revenue, Phil mentioned is up 47%, as [$209.4] million for the quarter showing very strong growth as well as including the revenue generated by our TSYS Card Tech that was about $8 million of total revenue. International revenues, also specifically Europe, was positively impacted by the currency translation adjustments and that's about $5 million pick there. ", "Value added services continue to grow at about $2.7 million up or 5.25%. And for the quarter, they represented 12.76% of our total revenues including reimbursable. So, it continues to grow, as a part of our total revenues. And we're just doing a real good job there. ", "Merchant services next line item, obviously is down when compared to last year and the decrease in the comparison is a result of the two large de-conversions, that went on last year along with continued weakness in the TSYS, POS systems business, VTMS and this is as you know was a plan to shut down that went on to last year, started in the first quarter, and it has continued to drill down, and has less impact now in this quarter. ", "As you remember, this being a low margin, so it has an effect to really improve our margins, as we get out of that business. But it does have a negative impact on the revenue. We also are experiencing in TSYS Acquiring some price compression, as you know, we renewed three of the top five class last year, and then three more of the top 20, and all that was done during '06. But these price compressions and loss revenues are being offset somewhat by internal growth. Our planning and transaction volumes during the quarter were up 15%, equates to about 7% growth in revenues. ", "For the quarter, the internal growth was $4 million, sequentially revenues were down 7% and really we anniversary those de-conversions and the price concessions, which will be late this year, revenue growth will be restrained. But on a positive note, when you look at TSYS Acquiring, the operating income for the first quarter was $12 million, a 19% increase over the first quarter of '06. And as Phil mentioned, it clearly shows what a great job the team is doing in controlling the expenses, after these de-conversions of last year. ", "Our operating margins in TSYS Acquiring, when you exclude reimbursable items have increased to 21.8% for the first quarter, compared to 17% in the same period last year. And we in TSYS Acquiring are continuing to work with our clients to develop these new products such as merchant cash advance and contact-less payments and gift cards and we feel like the ancillary service that they offer will be a good thing for us going forward. ", "We'll get back to our other services; you see the first quarter increased 18.5% or $8.2 million. Half of this increase is a result of the new joint venture with Dimension Data in Europe, which we call TSYS Managed Services. ", "ESC, our Loyalty Company, in Atlanta. They made up another 25% of this memorable growth in their redemption business and their new loyalty platform. ", "The remainder of the increase came from a product called profit, as more customers have signed up on that. So, a lot of this came from the diversification of Capital One as they\u2019ve come on board. ", "Revenues for reimbursable items as you can see they were up 3.9%. And this is primarily the result of the treatment of the core cost as of reimbursable item as a result of the renegotiated contract last year that went on with total debt management. ", "So, total revenues for the first quarter up 4.2% and the increase as I mentioned before included about a $5.1 million currency translation favorable effect for us. As we go down to the expense side, we look at salaries first; they were up 15.8% or $19 million for the quarter. And this is a result of the acquisition of TSYS Card Tech and TSYS Managed Services. They added approximately $6.6 million additional employment expense. Europe\u2019s rapid growth in revenues also impacted employment cost by another $3.7 million. In the U.S. we've had reduction in capitalized salaries and contractors, which added another $6.7 million of this growth. ", "But on a sequential quarter basis employment expenses were down approximately $1 million. When you look at our headcount at the end of March, it\u2019s approximately 187 people more than it was in March of '06. But when you exclude the employees associated with Card Tech and Managed Services, we are down approximately 137 people since March of '06. The relocation of our prepaid Manhattan office is on schedule, and scheduled to be completed during the third quarter of '07. And we continue to review our allocation of people resources to ensure we are managing this important resource effectively. ", "Our occupancy and equipment cost is down 12.2% to $66 million. We did book a onetime adjustment in Europe for a VAT tax benefit that came in as $2.3 million. We also experienced decreases in software amortization on mid based software and also lower equipment main expense as we lost those de-convergence last year of Sears and BOA. ", "Other Expense category decreased 15.8 for the first quarter. A large part of this was attributable to lower transaction delivery cost at TSYS Acquiring. We also had the reclassification of other expenses such as quarter calls to reimbursement, which is contingent. And we also had lower TS2 conversion amortization as a result of the BOA de-conversion. So, all of that contributed to that decrease. ", "Excluding reimbursable our operating profit margin for the quarter as Phil mentioned is 24.93% up from 21.8% in the first quarter of '06. And we do expect our margins for the year to remain in the 24-26 range. ", "Other income coming down the page is increased $3.2 million for the first quarter. There again, with that increased amount of cash available to invest and that\u2019s combined with increases in short-term rates, which has caused this increase. Income taxes for the quarter increased 40%, the effective tax rate jumped to 37.9% compared to 33.4% for last year. This is a direct result of a one-time adjustment that we had to reserve, for potential loss of certain state income tax credits that were previously taken. We otherwise anticipate our effective tax rate to again be in the 36% range. ", "Net income for the quarter increased 13.7% or $6.9 million. Earnings per share increased to $0.29, up 13.9% over the $0.26 for last year. We excluded the income tax adjustment that we had to book. Net income would have been up 18.2% and earnings per share would have been up $0.30 a share, just an outstanding quarter. ", "Now, we'd like to flip over to the balance sheet and just cover a couple of items there. Unrestricted cash is $44.2 million; it increased $33 million since December '06. We now have approximately $2.15 of cash per share outstanding. ", "We revised our analysis of the intangibles in the quarter for the Card Tech acquisition and made some adjustments there for the goodwill and acquisition intangibles, and those are the big changes there for the balance sheet. ", "On the cash flow statement, you all know that significant contribution, cash generated from operating activities were $66 million and we do continue to generate a significant amount of cash to fund investing and financing activities. ", "We invested $17 million in property and equipment, that\u2019s mainly a production equipment and processing hardware. And then we invested about $6.9 million in software, $3.9 million of it being purchased, and $3 million developed. And we also paid dividends of $13.8 million during the quarter. ", "In our free cash flow analysis, free cash flow ended at $35.2 million for the quarter. Just an outstanding quarter, good growth in cash. ", "Phil, I turn it back over to you. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thanks Jim. And if you think you hear a train, you do. We have a train trussel over the river behind us. It goes by about this time everyday, and he is convinced he is going to blow his horn to let us know he is coming this way. ", "I hope you'll agree that our ship has turned around and headed in the right direction. And we are dealing with issues and showing strong results. Again I am very proud of what we've been able to do. And I wanted to open it up Anthony, for the Q&A session now if you will. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen the floor is open for questions. (Operator Instructions). The first question comes from Adam Frisch. Your line is live. ", "Adam Frisch - UBS Warburg", "Good afternoon guys. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Good afternoon Adam, how are you. ", "Adam Frisch - UBS Warburg", "I am doing okay, thanks. You got the B-team with you today. Just wanted to ask you about the operating margins in the first quarter, a few things I wanted to ask you about., One; were there any one-time things in there that aren't sustainable, because you are right around 25% in the quarter, and that's what you are forecasting for the year. So what I wanted to know if there was anything in first quarter that was, maybe not recurring, where in the second, third or fourth we might see some volatility or bounce? ", "Jim Lipham", "Adam this is Jim. The big item that we had is one time would be the tax refund, we had about $2.8 million, it came in from Europe. ", "Adam Frisch - UBS Warburg", "Is that in the operating margin line or would that be below the line? ", "Jim Lipham", "That's in operating line. ", "Adam Frisch - UBS Warburg", "That's in the operating line. Okay. But that's about it; everything else was kind of recurring from just doing your thing? ", "Jim Lipham", "That's right. ", "Adam Frisch - UBS Warburg", "Okay. The 25% for the year, any seasonality in there that we should expect? In the past couple of years, I didn't really know this pattern, because you have some one-times moving in and out. But, do you expect it to fall in any material ways in any quarter during the year? ", "Jim Lipham", "It's pretty flat through the year. ", "Adam Frisch - UBS Warburg", "Pretty flat through the year, okay. ", "Jim Lipham", "It will get a little bit better probably in the fourth quarter. ", "Adam Frisch - UBS Warburg", "Okay. ", "Jim Lipham", "When volumes pick up and those kind of things. ", "Adam Frisch - UBS Warburg", "Right. Okay. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "So Adam, encourage your wife to use our card. ", "Adam Frisch - UBS Warburg", "I don't need to do that. I'll try that though, just for you though. On the sales pipeline, I know you guys said you have pretty robust outlook out there. You replaced a lot of business that you lost last year. When can we see this kind of deals coming and where are they coming? Is it from the MBNA side or is it just from international or describe where that comes from? ", "Jim Lipham", "It's pretty interesting, we are talking to a lot of big players and we are talking to a lot of smaller dealers. We are doing a good job of cross-selling value-added. The core processing pipeline as far as prospects is getting better by the day. Our loyalty business is getting stronger by the day. International is very hot. We are picking up some pace in Mexico. We are not doing much in Latin America. If you recall, we opened up an office in Brazil and we think that's just a good investment and we believe that long-term we will make some progress there. ", "China UnionPay, or Cut Data is on target. As we've said many times before that's a three to five year deal. We are continuing to win with banks there. We think we're doing well there. There is going to be a very controlled rollout of credit cards in China, we believe. ", "Adam Frisch - UBS Warburg", "Right ", "Jim Lipham", "They are not going to allow just a mass issuance of cards like we have done in years past in the US. So, I'm going to have to say that we feel pretty good about our prospects and as I said earlier, and they seem to be to be picking up. ", "Adam Frisch - UBS Warburg", "Okay. ", "Jim Lipham", "At least the discussion activity is picking up. ", "Adam Frisch - UBS Warburg", "Okay. Couple more here. Just on the merchant processing side, lot going on there. Wanted to just get an update, if you could on your platform? Is it robust enough to go after some of the bank alliances that may shake out as a result of what's going on in First Data? And then also how you view the ISO channel right now? ", "Jim Lipham", "I certainly think that our software is more than robust enough. And certainly, I think any time, there is confusion in the marketplace, opportunities will present themselves. The ISO channel has always been under pressure. The alliances have been there long time and it's always hard to break up something that has been there and in place for a long time. But, certainly that's part of our job and that's what we try to do and we'll continue to try to win in that marketplace. ", "When it comes to, you talked about ISO, is we've had a couple of announcements this week. I think we may have another small announcement tomorrow or late tonight, I'm not sure. Again, activity is picking up. We are feeling more positive about really every segment of our business today then we have in long-term. ", "Adam Frisch - UBS Warburg", "Okay. If I can just ask squeeze in one last one, your performance so far and having digested all of the one-time deconversion, that kind of stuff last year, I think is nothing short to remarkable, but there's a lot of one timers card at '07, which makes me think that if we look to '08, maybe we get a better sense of where you think you are going to be in terms of growth and margin so forth, one things settled down a little bit. I know its early, I know it hasn't broken 40 degrees yet here in New York this year, but what are you guys thinking about '08 at this point in time? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well Adam, there is a still in bloom here, so I would even suggest to you that '08 would, we are still trying to get over the shock of '05 and '06. So, as I said we are feeling good about our future, but I wouldn't even take a guess at '08 at this point. ", "Adam Frisch - UBS Warburg", "Okay. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "When last time I did that, the folks in this room almost ran me out of town on rail. ", "Adam Frisch - UBS Warburg", "Alright. Well, its worth a shot, but I think the faster we can get visibility on that I think the better it will be for the multiple and so forth and bigger multiple on higher numbers might work for that but like you said. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Right. ", "Adam Frisch - UBS Warburg", "Thanks guys, congrats again. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tony Wible. Your line is live. ", "Tony Wible - Citigroup", "If we could probably talk a little bit about SEPA nice to see that win that you guys had what kind of time line would you anticipate seeing more SEPA related deal? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, I think probably anything on a go forward basis it has got to include SEPA capability or SEPA functionality. And we have, we are talking to a lot of different people in a lot of different countries in that part of the world and that's one of the things. I think and I have said this before, but anytime you have change whether it would be regulatory or ownership or anything else, anytime associations or government put in change. It's probably good for us because it causes people to look at their options. And we think that is part of the process for SEPA. ", "Tony Wible - Citigroup", "Would you see some of those opportunities on just the card side or do you see more opportunity on the merchant side? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, we are seeing it in both. Obviously, we tend to be a little more card focused in Europe today. But we certainly would like to be more aggressive in the merchant business in Europe, as time goes forward. With Card Tech, we do have a platform that will operate in that part of the world, and many other parts of the world, as the matter of fact. We just have not gone to the point with that platform or we have not sold it, going to the point where we sold it to anyone to roll it out yet. But rest assured, we are working on that. ", "Tony Wible - Citigroup", "Alright. I have a question on guidance, we are not reaching as far as '08, as we get towards the potential J.P. Morgan Chase conversion. What would you anticipate reimbursable is kind of moving down to as a percentage of revenue? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Give us a second on that one. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Tony, I don't have that. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Alright, dandy with me, but I would be guessing if had to play a number on you, right now. ", "Tony Wible - Citigroup", "Alright, I will just throw out one last question, and I will jump off, the store value business is going on very well. Do you think high level of that, what's driving some of the growth there? And anything you see on the legislative front that could help continue to drive that business? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, we think it's a big market, and we've got some great clients there, two or three very aggressive ones and now again we are moving that. We've done very well in Europe. We've signed a couple of deals in Japan. It's still a market that we are learning to operate in. We've got to learn how to operate on a low cost basis in that marketplace. And we're also learning where the market is. We have not been really successful in selling to financial institutions. We've been more successful in selling to other companies, if you will for different types of products. But we think there is 84 million, 85 million unbanked people in this country. There is a huge market for that. We still are bullish about the prepaid business. So, I think we feel like though in order for us to really be a market leader, we're going to need some more time. ", "Tony Wible - Citigroup", "Alright. Okay, great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Next question is from Robert Dodd. Your line is live. ", "Robert Dodd - Morgan, Keegan & Company", "Hi, guys. Just looking at the expenses going forward, I mean what do you expect to do in terms of the cost cutting you talk about? I mean is it further attrition of headcount or do you expect amortization of step down again when we get through Chase or can you give us an idea what particularly you're looking now? ", "Jim Lipham", "Rob, it's Jim. What we are looking at going forward is you will have some step down when Chase leaves obviously in the equipment side of the house. We are anticipating our headcount to remain relatively flat through the rest of the year. And so you have pickups there as you compare back to prior years of the prior year numbers for both of those items. ", "Robert Dodd - Morgan, Keegan & Company", "Okay. And then on China, we obviously we've got some if you want to call regulatory deadlines or whatever for the card issuers in July. Are you picking up anything about a potential for a more open market in the second half of the year there. I mean are these regulatory pressures inhibiting decisions in the near-term when we could see a more of a pick up later in the year? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "We are not seeing that right now, Robert. I mean we have people in China, and Jim Lipham is on our board over there. We're not seeing it yet. But, we do think it's going to be and I think the key in the meantime is we've got to pick up these banks and I forget the number, but I think through our partnership with CUP we've signed 30 banks today. ", "Jim Lipham", "About 29. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "29. ", "Robert Dodd - Morgan, Keegan & Company", "Okay. Thanks. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Parker, your line is live. ", "David Parker - Merrill Lynch", "Good afternoon, everyone. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Hi, David. ", "David Parker - Merrill Lynch", "I just was wondering if you can give us an update on the situation with Synovus. We continue to hear speculation that they might be looking at options but, just wondering if you're hearing anything or staying in touch with them? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Probably they own 81%. So, I promise you we stay in touch with them. But I would suggest that, you listen to their call next week. That\u2019s a decision that they are going to have to make and certainly I don\u2019t know of any changes at this point. ", "David Parker - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Good, and then on the CapEx number it was little bit higher this quarter than normal you talked about spending more on production equipment. Is that a run rate that we should expect in the next few quarters, or is that just a hiccup this quarter? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "That was a hiccup this quarter for some production equipment in the card area. It won't continue that way. ", "David Parker - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. And then with Vital or your merchant acquiring business has pricing compression been more severe than you originally expected when you first closed that acquisition or acquired the percentage of the business from Visa? Has it been more difficult to renew some of these contracts or what's driving some of the weakness there? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, I think what Jimmy talked about some of the business that we have, when we got out of the terminal business. But I think the merchant business has always been hypercompetitive, and I think it will continue to be so. It's just like the card business, and we've got to learn to better operate on economies of scale, and in doing things smarter. But we still feel good about that business, and we've got some prospects in that business that could significantly change, what we do at Total Acquiring Services. But I do think that there is tremendous pricing pressure there, and I think its getting worse. ", "David Parker - Merrill Lynch", "Did you know what its trending at approximately? Historically it has been 3% to 5%. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "I'd just say, I'd be guessing it. We would have to ask Bob. ", "David Parker - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great, thank you. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Nancy Bush. Your line is live. ", "Nancy Bush - Ryan, Beck & Co.", "Hi guys, how are you?

", "Nancy Bush - Ryan, Beck & Co.", "Phil, you made some initial comments about the changes in the industry and they have been fairly dramatic for Metavante and then First Data, etcetera. Can you just give us your anecdotal, what are people in the industry saying about this, what are your customers', saying about this? The ownership of companies by venture capital funds, private equity investors has not always been entirely beneficent let's put it that way. And I'm just wondering what the feedback has been? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, like I said earlier, it has created some consternation and some worry on people's parts, and which is probably a good thing for TSYS or of some of the other competitors. ", "The fact of matter is, they are going to have an awful lot of debt to deal with. And I never underestimate those guys. They've been a very strong competitor for many years. And I think they'll continue to do that. ", "There is a lot of speculation out there about whether they will be able to hold that company together and I don't know honestly. There would be some difficult decisions. I think it certainly has been a really hot topic of discussion, not only the First Data transaction, but the Metavante transaction as well. ", "Both were pretty unusual for our industry, and we had heard rumors about First Data or a lot of rumors have been floating around about First Data, and so I don't think we were too surprised. But, in some ways I was just shocked when I heard it on Bloomberg, coming in to work that morning. ", "And I wish I had a crystal ball and knew what was going to happen. We're sitting here trying to figure out the best route for us to go and this has probably made it a little bit more difficult in some ways. But, hopefully there will be some opportunities as a result of this and that's about all we can hope for. ", "Nancy Bush - Ryan, Beck & Co.", "How has it made it more difficult for Synovus and you guys to make that decision? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "I don't know that it is made that any more difficult. ", "Nancy Bush - Ryan, Beck & Co.", "Okay. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "I think you would have to ask Richard that, Nancy. But, I think we've been trying to get the resolved and it has always been a hard question. We've been partners since 1974 and I would think it would be hard to give up 30%, 35% of your net earnings. But, I am sure he will address that next week. ", "Nancy Bush - Ryan, Beck & Co.", "Also in the in the internal growth that you saw from first quarter, which has been quite remarkable, and then 20% growth coming from new customers. Can you, I know it's very hard to track \"market share\", particularly in your business where it kind of moves around. But, is picking up market share in the business part of this or is that basically an untrackable number? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, we try to track market share. But part of it you probably get close on branded cards, but when you start talking about private-label cards, it's really, virtually impossible. We think of the Visa and MasterCard market, we are probably 40% right now in the US. I wouldn't even venture a guess outside the US, but we know in Canada, for example, we are little over 40% market share. ", "Nancy Bush - Ryan, Beck & Co.", "Okay. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "That's down in some ways. They had a low percentage of active accounts, they had a lot of accounts, and of course you are fully familiar with the Banc of America portfolio. ", "Nancy Bush - Ryan, Beck & Co.", "Also I would just ask about Europe. Your growth that you are experiencing in Europe right now. What is the best products geography, whatever in Europe that you are experiencing right now? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, I still think that you are going to see a lot of growth in the UK area, and I think you'll see some good things come out this year there. We seem to have hit a real niche market over in The Netherlands, in Norway and I'm not sure there's a term for that part of the world. It's not coming to mind right now. ", "Nancy Bush - Ryan, Beck & Co.", "Top North? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Is it Benelux? Anyway, we seem to be doing well there. We would certainly like to do better in Spain and we would like to be in Italy and I think you will see us heading into those countries. We think there is awful lot of opportunities there. It's just every time you go into a new country it's just difficult. Because, you've got to gear up forward, you've got to spend money and every country is different. So, I mean we think we've got a pretty good plan put together for Europe. We are doing very well in the UK. ", "Nancy Bush - Ryan, Beck & Co.", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "We have a follow up coming from Tony Wible. Your line is live. ", "Tony Wible - Citigroup", "Can you see, Jim, if you had the answer on reimbursables? ", "Jim Lipham", "I do. We knew you were going to come back on that Tony. The first quarter Tony, we were high on a little bit, we were about 20% of revenues on the reimbursables and this was mainly due to some card specials and things that we did for Banc of America. ", "But what you will see going forward is that we are being hovering around the mere 18.5% of revenue total for reimbursables. And then, when Chase leaves, we are not doing their statements and cards so it has very little impact on our reimbursable number. ", "Tony Wible - Citigroup", "Great. And the other question I had on the strategic front is, it seems like you guys have gotten a lot of strategic equations, but can you spend little time talking about what you could potentially look to acquire. Is there anything out there that you feel is more compelling? I know in the past you guys have talked about analytic, you have also talked about broad-based processing, is there any particular area that you feel is retreating right now? ", "Jim Lipham", "Well, I don't think our plan has changed much there. We certainly would be in broad-based processing. We would be interested in the merchants, the acquiring business. We have started our own consulting group, now and it's up to about 45 people and is doing very well. We have greatly enhanced our analytical abilities. We still think, there's a nice little niche market there for us. Does it make sense for us to look at some acquisitions in Latin America or Europe, it probably does and US. ", "Tony Wible - Citigroup", "And would most of the considered kind of small tuck-ins or is your appetite a little bit larger? ", "Jim Lipham", "I think our appetite is a little larger. ", "Tony Wible - Citigroup", "Okay. Any one of those particular areas you find more intriguing now because of I guess the industry backdrop? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "No, not off the top of my head. Obviously, there are a few companies out there that could be of immediate help. But a lot of that goes right along with this, with the spin question. We've got a pretty good bank row stacked away now, and so we can make a pretty decent sized acquisition. ", "Tony Wible - Citigroup", "Alright. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Nothing is imminent. ", "Tony Wible - Citigroup", "Alright, but its still in the front of your mind? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Yeah, we'd love to be able to do more. ", "Tony Wible - Citigroup", "Okay. Thank you very much. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, there appear to be no further questions in the queue. Do you have any closing comments you would like to finish with? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "I would just like to tell you that thank you for being with us. We are committed to be the best in the business. We are trying very hard everyday to be there. I think you can see that we have a great passion for this, and I think we've built up some very strong momentum. And we appreciate your support and if you have any questions don't hesitate to call Shawn, and we'll get the answers up for you. And we appreciate your attention and being on the call with us and we wish you nothing but success. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

(NYSE:TSS)   Q2 2007 Earnings Call  July 24, 2007  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Phil Tomlinson, Chairman & CEO ", " Jim Lipham - CFO ", "Analysts", "Glenn Waldorf - UBS ", " Tony Wible - Citigroup ", " David Charles ", " Tony Davis - Ryan, Beck & Co. ", " Paul Badulak - Credit Suisse ", " David Parker - Merrill Lynch ", " Glenn Greene - CIBC World Markets ", " Glenn Waldorf - UBS ", " Roger Smith - Fox-Pitt Kelton ", "Operator", "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the TSYS Second Quarter 2007 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and we will open the floor for your questions and comments following the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Phil Tomlinson, Chairman and CEO. Sir, the floor is yours. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thank you, Kate. Good morning and welcome to everybody on the line to our second quarter earnings call. As I do every time, or as we do every time, I need to go through this Safe Harbor and I want to call your attention to the fact that we'll be making forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS. ", "These statements involve risk and uncertainties; factors that could cause TSYS\u2019s actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in TSYS\u2019s reports filed with the SEC. ", "And it\u2019s a really exciting morning, and many of you may have already seen the 8 AM Synovus press release and 8:15 TSYS press release that was there this morning. And if you haven\u2019t, I want to kind of go over what\u2019s going on there. ", "Synovus which 80.8% of our outstanding stock will ask its Board of Directors to consider whether to distribute its ownership interest in TSYS to Synovus shareholders in a spin-off transactions. ", "Synovus will also ask its Board to appoint a Special Committee of independent Synovus Directors to make recommendation regarding the spin-off. In light of the expected consideration of this matter by the Synovus Special Committee, the TSYS Board of Directors will form a Special Committee of independent TSYS Directors to consider the terms of any proposed spin-off by Synovus of its ownership interest in TSYS. ", "Now, for obvious reasons, we are not going to make any further comment or answer any additional questions about this issue until the Synovus Board has announced a decision, and I think we would, we would do the wrong thing if we didn't focus on the great quarter that we, that we've had. ", "So, now to the real business at hand, I think the second quarter was another great performance that we can be very proud of. As you saw in the earnings release yesterday, we continue to expect to achieve our previously announced net income growth guidance in the 20% to 22% range on a non-GAAP basis, and 0% to/or flat and up to 2% on a GAAP basis, which, again, we think we've really done a great job with that to get to that point. ", "I just cannot overstate how pleased we are with our team's ability to manage expenses, increase this organic revenue growth and continue exceeding expectations in general. In addition to that, our prospect pipeline continues to pick-up speed at a fast rate. ", "All of this has resulted in the expansion of our operating margin, which I think, we told you last quarter we felt like we would be in the 24 to 26 range and then at the end of six months, 25.7%, which is in today's world, is very impressive. ", "We've been asked by a few investors, and particularly several of you over the last month or so, about the additional card production business that we're doing for Banc of America. We didn't do a press release and thought maybe that the conference call might be the best way to clear that up. ", "In January of this year, we did begin the production of debit and commercial cards for Banc of America, which is, as you know the largest debit issuer in the U.S. I really believe that this agreement shows that even after the loss of the consumer portfolio in late 2006, that Banc of America continues to have strong confidence in TSYS, as well as continues to add new business. And they certainly are very, very important customer to TSYS. ", "Some of the financial highlights this quarter; net income increased 14.4% in the second quarter as compared to the second quarter of '06. Revenues before reimbursables increased 6.2 in the second quarter of '07 compared to the second quarter of '06. Operating income was up 13.2% as compared quarter-to-quarter and operating income was up 16% for the first six months of the year. ", "Our diluted earnings per share increased 14.5% to $0.33 in the second quarter of '07 compared to $0.29 in the second quarter of '06. The internal revenue growth rate, or what we term, our term is called organic growth, increased to 12% in the second quarter, which is one of the real keys and has been a key for us over the past 25 years or so. ", "I think these numbers are rather amazing when you consider the trauma that we have gone through in 2006 and what we've had to do to be able to get to where we are today. We had some big highlights, particularly with some new things that we've done, new business-wise. ", "You've all heard a lot about the new Wal-Mart money card. It's issued by GE and reloaded through Green Dot's national reloading network and there's been a lot of speculation about who processes that and that is processed by TSYS. ", "This product was first offered, or first piloted in November of 2006 and will be available in 2600 Wal-Mart Stores by the end of July. I think this launch of this product could change the face of the prepaid industry. It is a huge event. ", "Another thing that we are very, very proud of is very recently we were awarded the 2007 global card processor of the year, by cards international and VRL Knowledge Bank. I think it's a great acknowledgment of the continued progress and quality that TSYS is making around the world. ", "Moving on to China, in China, Cup Data began processing through Huaxia Bank and of course that's spelled a little differently than it looks, than it sounds. This is one of China's largest nationwide banks. Cup Data now provides processing services for three of the four largest issuing banks in China that use outsource suppliers. We continue to be very encouraged about the long-term future prospects in China. ", "Moving on to the UK, TSYS and Norwich Union launch a new prepaid Rewards card in the UK. Then TSYS Card Tech in London launched a new card management program with existing clients in Qatar, with Qatar National Bank and the Commercial Bank Of Qatar. And those are the first and second largest banks respectively in assets in that country. ", "They are using our Marquise Software Prime, which is really one of the key reasons that we have bought, that we acquired Card Tech. We believe we've got a real diamond in the rough with Card Tech. This thing is going to pay off for many, many years to come. ", "We also signed a couple of really nice merchant processing agreements with mPay, which is a gateway in the bank core bank and we renewed some good business with merchant management systems. ", "On the international side, we continue to perform well and as you know, that's one of our real areas of focus. We were up 42% for the quarter and 44.3% for the first six months. And a lot of that is being driven by Card Tech, but our core or traditional card service business is very strong. ", "Our prepaid business continues to be very active in Europe in particular. Our value-added products have continued to be a solid contributor. Value-added increased 10.7% in the second quarter compared to second quarter last year, and we continue to improve our ability to sell more products to already existing clients. ", "Moving on to TSYS acquiring solutions, I hope that you do not getting that static that we are getting back here, but I'll keep going. I am pleased to report that the acquiring solutions had a good quarter on a sequential basis. Revenues increased 6.2% in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. This was mainly due to increase in transaction volume. Jim Lipham's going to give you a lot more color on that in just a minute. ", "We've got a lot going on, TSYS acquiring, and I'm very optimistic about the long-term revenue growth and we think good things are on the horizon. With that, I'm going turn it over to Jim Lipham, our Chief Financial Officer, who is going to give you a lot more financial details. Jimmy? ", "Jim Lipham", "Thank you, Phil. I've asked everyone, if you would, look at the P&L that was included in the press release and I'll try to add some comments about the various reporting lines there. First of all, looking at electronic payment process and services, that includes our, mainly our core processor services, as well as our license and arrangements, which we have at Card Tech. ", "This revenue line item's up, as Phil said 5.4% at $12.5 million for the quarter and then again, 4.8% for the year, or $21.6 million. This is especially good growth when you consider the loss of over $53 million that was in the second quarter of '06, then $103.6 million year-to-date, all this being associated with the loss of the two large customers last year. ", "On a pro forma basis, taking these revenues out of the second quarter of '06 and year-to-date, you would see the growth in our revenues and they are around 36%, both for the quarter and year-to-date. Our revenue growth has been fueled as we mentioned by internal growth, which continues to grow around 12%. ", "We've had also in the new business area, as well as acquisitions, we've added another 14.9% of additional growth. Our account on file numbers at the end of the quarter are 439 million and this is 73 million above the prior year, which is very good, considering the loss of the 51 million accounts from large customers after the second quarter of '06. ", "New clients have come on Board. They have added 105.5 million accounts. This is accounts not only in the consumer side, but retail, gift card have had some healthcare accounts, so very good growth in accounts. Internal growth from our other customers have added about 33.1 million accounts, and like we mentioned before, we converted 59.1 million accounts. ", "We've seen good growth in our transactions. They are up 12.9% for the quarter and 11.5% year-to-date, total for about $5.3 billion transactions year-to-date number. Authorizations also showing good growth, up 13.8% for the quarter and up 12.9% year-to-date. International revenues, as Phil mentioned, when you look at those after reimbursable, they increased $28.8 million, or 42% for the quarter and 58.2% or 44.3% for the first six months. ", "The increase is as a result of good growth in our European business and revenues associated with our international acquisitions. This is mainly Card Tech, as Phil mentioned before. International revenues, specifically those from Europe, they were positively impacted by the CTA, or currency translation adjustments for the quarter to the tune of about $4.1 million and then for the six months, at $9.2 million. ", "There again, that does include reimbursables. Our value-added service revenues, they grew $8.6 million, or 8% in '07 over '06 and for the year that represented 13% of our total revenues, including reimbursables, so it's still showing the good growth, or good percentage of our total revenues. On the dropdown on the merchant services line, we're down when compared to last year. ", "TSYS acquiring revenues decreased $1.9 million for the quarter and $6 million on a year-over-year basis. Large part of the decrease for the quarter is the result of reclassifying certain revenue items of approximately $1.2 million in '07, as reimbursables, when you care back to '06. These reimbursables are re-classed reimbursables is for a fee that we were not being assessed in '06 that we are in '07 and leave the revenues out to reimbursables. ", "But Phil mentioned earlier sequentially our revenues increased for the quarter over first quarter 5.9%, or 6%. And mainly this is due because of the transaction volumes over the first, for the quarter, over the first quarters, which -- the first quarter, historically is the lowest quarter of transaction volumes historically. ", "On a year-to-date basis, the decrease of 6 million is a result of two large deconversions. We've talked before about Heartland and Cert Gee. We've reclassified 1.4 million in 2007 revenues as reimbursable items, which I mentioned. And then we continue to have weakness in our TSYS POS systems and services, which is the terminal business that we mentioned before, and it does have a very low profit margin, but it continues to slow and weak. ", "We've had comprised compressions from the renewal of three of our top five customers, as well as three more of our top 20 during '06. These revenue losses are being somewhat offset by the internal growth in our existing acquiring class. And this is evidenced by a growth in front-end transaction volumes during the quarter of 13.7%, and for the year, 14.5. We did have internal growth from current business during the quarter of about $5 million. ", "Until we anniversary these deconversions and price concessions, which will be late this year, revenue growth will continue to be restrained. We anticipate TSYS acquiring revenues to stabilize and see some growth sequentially between the quarters for the rest of '07. TSYS acquiring operating income for the second quarter of 07 was 16.2 million, a 9.7% increase over the second quarter of '06. This clearly shows what a great job our team is doing in controlling these expenses after these deconversions of last year. ", "Operating margins, excluding reimbursables, have increased to 27.8% in the second quarter of '07 compared to 24.5% for the same period last year. So acquiring -- continues to develop new products, including enhanced merchant statement capabilities, contact those payments and give cards and we're anticipating their revenues to sequentially, as I have said before, continue to grow quarter-over-quarter. ", "We return back to the consolidated revenue and look at the other services in line for the second quarter, increased 23.1%, or $10.3 million. Approximately 60% of the increase is a result of the new joint venture with Data Dimensions in Europe, this is a TSYS managed services, EMEA, and we own, if you remember, 55% of the -- this is constant of business and it\u2019s doing very well. ", "ESC, our loyalty company, makes up another 33% of this growth and it's mainly attributable to growth in the redemption business and the new loyalty platform. And the remainder of the increase in this category came from our growth and profit product, as more customers have signed on to this product. ", "I might mention here also, that our -- we've seen good growth in our loyalty income. Its total revenues are up 41% there. TSYS prepaid, seeing some good growth. Our revenues there year-over-year are up 26.6%. So, we're seeing good growth in those areas. ", "Revenues for reimbursable items have increased 11.2% for the quarter and is primarily as a result of the Phase II fees for TSYS acquiring and the treatment of court costs as a reimbursable items, as a result of the trend associated with renegotiated contract and total debt management. Total revenues for the second quarter increased 7.2% and 5.7% for the first six months of the year. ", "As we look down the page at the expense lines, few comments there. Our expense growth in employment was 20.8%, or $25.1 million for the quarter. As a result of the acquisitions of TSYS Card Tech and TSYS Managed Services, we had approximately $8.3 million of additional employment expenses. Europe's big growth has impacted employment costs by another $5.2 million, as they increased head count by about 100 people over last year. ", "We had a reduction in our capitalized salaries and contractor costs around another $7 million, which is less development going on. And on a sequential quarter basis, employment expenses are up approximately $5 million. Our head count at the end of June is approximately 6773 people that\u2019s 231 people more than it was in June of '06. ", "When you exclude the employees who were associated with Card Tech and Managed Services, we\u2019re actually down 216 people from June of '06. The relocation of our prepaid Manhattan, New York office is on schedule and is to be completed during this third quarter of \u201807 and we continue to look at our allocation of people resources to assure we're properly managing this resource effectively. ", "Drop down to occupancy and equipment, we are decreased 10.2% for the quarter, $7.8 million and is down to $67.9 million. We continue to experience a decrease in software amortization on MIP\u2019s-based software and we also continue to get good reduction in our equipment and rent expense with the renegotiation of our leases on hardware. ", "The other expense category is to 11.7% for the quarter. A large part of that being attributable to the lower transaction delivery cost that TSS is acquiring. We\u2019re also -- the reclassification of other expenses, court costs, reimbursables and then again, we've had lower TS2 conversion amortization since the loss of the big customer last year. ", "When you exclude reimbursables, our operating profit margin for the quarter was 26.3% and as Phil mentioned before, we do expect our margins to continue to stay in that range of 24% to 26% as we finish out the year. Our other income increased $2 million over the second quarter, both of '06. The increase amounts -- the cash available to invest, as we continue to show good growth there and we've had increases in our short-term interest rates also. ", "Income taxes for the quarter, they are up 14.3%. Effective tax rate for the quarter is 35.3% compared to 35.5% for last year. Our effective tax rate is slightly lower this quarter and we otherwise our effective tax rate to be around 36% for the year. What's attributing to that, if you remember, the first quarter we had the FIN 48 adjustment that caused our rate to jump up to 38% for that quarter. ", "Net income for the quarter, as Phil said, up 14.4%, or $8.3 million. Earnings per share at $0.33, and up 14.7% over the 29% for the second quarter of last year. Overall, a great second quarter and a great first half of the year. I would ask if you would to flip to the balance sheet and I'll make just a few comments there and then on the cash flow. ", "Unrestricted cash at $452.2 million obviously increased $63.1 million since December of '06. We now have approximately $2.29 of cash per share. We revised also our analysis of intangibles for the 2006 Card Tech acquisition and it caused the changes to be in the good will and the acquisition intangibles. Outside of that, that's pretty much the major changes on the balance sheet. ", "Look at the cash flow statement, you'll note our significant contribution in cash generated from operating activities of $120 million for the first six months, and we continue to generate a significant amount of cash for investing in financing activities. We did invest $21.4 million in property and equipment, which is mainly hardware, and $12.3 million in software, which is broke up about $4.8 million purchased, $7.5 million of that's been developed software. ", "And we also paid $27.6 million in dividends so far this year. In our free cash flow analysis that number now is $76.3 million year to date. With that, I wanted to add one more comment. I know there's some questions about Chase and I wanted to make a few statements there. As you know, they have elected to migrate the consumer portfolio in-house, and go under a perpetual license with a modified version of TS 2, with a six-year payment term. ", "So they will discontinue the processing agreement at the end of July, I believe it's July 28, and in accordance with original schedule and then they will start licensing the profits of software in the third quarter of '07. We mentioned before the revenues associated with the licensing arrangement are much lower than the revenues associated with the processing arrangement, but the impact of the consolidated results of operations is not significant, as we have planned and implemented during the year, a pairing down of resources dedicated to the consumer portfolio through employee attrition and redeployment, as well as, through equipment lease expirations. ", "As we go forward, we'll continue to support Chase in processing this commercial portfolio. On our projected net income for '07, and when you compare that back to '06, our revenue -- our net income from Chase is up 5.7% year-over-year. ", "And with that, Phil, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to you. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thank you, Jimmy. As you can feel and hear, that we have an awful lot going on, and we are certainly pleased with our first six months, and we certainly expect to close out 2007 in good fashion. ", "With that, I'm going to open it up to questions, Kate, if you will, but please remember, we're not going take any questions on this announcement. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from at Adam Fritsch. Please announce your affiliation, and then pose your question. ", "Glenn Waldorf - UBS", "Actually it's Glenn Waldorf from UBS. Congratulations on another great quarter. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thanks, Glenn. ", "Glenn Waldorf - UBS", "Talking about the pipeline, you said it's picking up. I was wondering if you could characterize the make up of it. For example, between banks, non-banks, small banks, large banks, and/or -- how has this makeup changed versus how it's historically looked? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "I think it's, I can't say that I'm, I feel any real difference. Obviously we -- there is certainly more activity on an international basis. The -- I think the, obviously the news in the market with, the LBO\u2019s, First Data, Alliance Data, would create some, if nothing else, consternation among those -- among those client bases. ", "But what we are -- we are very, very encouraged by what we're seeing today. But it's -- Glenn, it's -- what we're seeing is across the Board. It's not only in the card holder business; it's in the merchant side of the house. Even with our value added products such as profit, we're seeing a lot of activity where people want to pick up that product and, we\u2019ve -- they think they can save themselves a lot of money and evident and provide a higher level of service. ", "It just gives us a lot of encouragement. Now, I'm I don't mean to imply that we have some massive announcement that's coming soon because I don't think that's the case. But we are moving forward and we are doing good with, perhaps our current clients and certainly prospects around the world. ", "And I wouldn't want this, Huaxia bank in China to go unnoticed. That is a really big win for us, that's a top 10 bank. We think we're picking up speed in China, there's still not a lot of activity going on in Japan. But we're very encouraged in China; we're very encouraged in Europe. We have some good things going in Canada, and we have a lot going on in the U.S. Not really anything to speak of in South America. ", "Glenn Waldorf - UBS", "Great. And then, while we're on the China subject, appears that CUP has been working on expanding its ownership base, bringing in more investors. Can you talk about how you see that impacting you, and perhaps the China card market overall? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, we are very close with CUP and CUP data, and we are, we feel good about the moves that they are making. They are trying to expand their footprint, and we think as that happens, that's going to be long-term, that's going to be good for TSYS. ", "Glenn Waldorf - UBS", "Okay, great. Thank you very much. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thank you, Glenn. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Tony Wible. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question. ", "Tony Wible - Citigroup", "Morning. I have a few for you guys. I was curious if you could talk about the Canadian market. It's doing quite well, and I was just curious what's driving a lot of that performance in the portfolio. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, our, you know, we have, we have a pretty large market share in Canada and so we are certainly very involved in Canada. I think that, you know, from what we can see, their economy's doing well, they have certainly always been a big debit market. We, you know, as you know, we signed -- Dominion last year, late last year. We converted them late last year. ", "That was a big win for us. There's a couple more up there we would certainly love to talk to and we love the Canadian market. You know, I hope nobody takes this wrong, but we just think it's certainly a much more civilized market than the U.S. is and they are just fun people to do business with. They are good business people, but -- and I think that they are really getting into the card business. ", "I mean chip and pen is coming. All of them are sort of pulling together on, in that area, and they are pretty excited about what's going on in that market up there. I, I can't really tell you anything specific that would make you feel good about that, but overall, they are just a very enthusiastic group of issuers. ", "Tony Wible - Citigroup", "Right, and if we look at the international part of the business in whole, how big do you think that business can be in three years, and what are the key catalysts for growth that you're looking for? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Our goal is by the end of 2010, that it will be 30%, 35% of our business. That's up from -- that would be up from 17%, 18%. Obviously the keys would be some, some -- to win some, some big clients, not only in the U.K., but on the, on the mainland of Europe. You know, we, we're watching this ABN Amro issue, that's ongoing, RBS is our largest customer in Europe. We do a lot of business with Barkley. ", "We don't know how that's going to turn out. We hope that we'll win in that transaction. That's the one thing that we always worry about, is consolidation. But, you know, we think at some point we'll be able to take merchant processing to Europe and to other parts of the world. We have, we have done a much better job of having a full array of services, as you recall last year we announced this joint venture with Dimension Data. ", "It puts us in a lot more businesses than we've been in previously, and it was an area that after continued conversations with a lot of European customers, that we felt like we had to have that span of products in order to be successful long-term and we've done that. I mean our plan is to, is to move into the countries that we would like to be in a big way, would be Spain, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, all up through there. ", "We're a very optimistic group and certainly if things pop up in other places then, we'll certainly go after them. We think there will be some more consolidation of processors in that marketplace. You've seen several of them fall already. You know, we would like to play in that arena, if possible. I mean we, we really have been disappointed in what has happened in Japan so far, as -- when it relates to, as to being accessible in signing car issuers there, we've got a very good merchant business there. ", "We've done well in prepaid there. We've done a little processing with Toyota, Nikko Cordial, but just haven't been able to hook the big one and we'll certainly continue to try there. As I just said earlier, we just have not been able to grab that brass ring in South America for a lot of different reasons, and we have opened an office recently in Brazil. You know, there's two or three countries that you would really like to be in South America and certainly Brazil is by far the largest. ", "We are very encouraged by what's going on in Europe and in the U.K. right now. A lot of discussions, a lot of prospects, and we think we're going to win more than our share. So international is going to continue to be a huge push at TSYS. We think it is one of the real high growth areas that, we're going to be after over the next three to five years, and beyond that. ", "Tony Wible - Citigroup", "Thank you. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "I don't know I can tell you a lot more beyond that. ", "Tony Wible - Citigroup", "No, that was really helpful. I guess this last question acts on a little bit to that, but also more broadly speaking. As we think about M&A and strategic considerations, when did you know you have a lot of opportunities ahead of you, covered a lot of ground even on your international question. ", "What kind of size deal would you feel comfortable doing at this point? Are you looking at still small maybe tuck-in acquisitions, or would you be looking at larger deals that put you in a new area? ", "Jim Lipham", "Well, I think at this point, we're looking for smaller deals. I mean, you know, we've got a lot of cash sitting there. But basically we're in the cash acquisition business, and so that's what we're looking for, something that makes sense, and, there's some deals out there to be made. It's just like Card Tech. ", "I mean as I said earlier, this Card Tech thing is turning out to be better than what we had hoped, and you'll be seeing some announcements coming out of that area. I mean we had the one out of Qatar this month, but there's some others in the works. ", "They are not huge, but they get us into countries and they get us into banks very quickly and in some ways, it's much easier to take that Prime software into these emerging and developing countries than it is to take TS2, which is just this massive software that is really built for large issuers. So we're very excited about what's going on with Card Tech and think it's a real, really, a real add-on to TSYS. ", "Tony Wible - Citigroup", "Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it. ", "Jim Lipham", "Thank you, Tony. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Charles (ph). Please announce your affiliation. Then pose your question. ", "David Charles", "All right, good morning. ", "Jim Lipham", "Hey, David. ", "David Charles", "Couple of things, some terrific results this quarter. I just wanted to clarify after all these quarters. The 12% internal revenue growth, organic growth, is that just from your installed base of clients, or does that include your installed base growth plus new clients and excluding acquisitions? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "It's just the installed base, David. ", "David Charles", "Okay. ", "Jim Lipham", "It's sort of like same-store sales. ", "David Charles", "Got you, so arguably, internal growth, if we could find that, is everything excluding acquisitions, because even higher than 12%. Can you give a little more color or granularity on what's driving such strong growth on your installed bases is it internal Card account growth is it value-added services? You know, that's just a tremendous figure in this kind of credit environment. ", "Jim Lipham", "I think you answered your own question. I mean there's a lot of new products coming out. I mean when you think about the fact that we, we added that loyalty business, which is turning out that's going to be a really good add for us. It was a little tuck-in acquisition and they have come along very nicely. ", "I mean as an example, with that business, I mean they -- I'm not going to go into the clients that use them, but I mean we've added -- I say we've added, four or five of our very largest clients have signed up for TSYS loyalty. I mean it is a -- you know, it's a big number. ", "Profit, I talked to you about earlier. Profit is one of the neatest systems in the world, we believe, and you've heard me say a couple of years ago that frankly at some point I think we could sell it to people other than the bank card industry and I still feel that way, but we're really trying to focus on our customer base. It is a really neat product. I think people are still excited about the card business. ", "David Charles", "Are you\u2026 ", "Jim Lipham", "Obviously the, you know, just new services, the numbers there -- can I tell them this number? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Yeah, that's fine. ", "Jim Lipham", "New services in 2007 is right at $30 million, and new services includes all those things that I was talking about earlier and a few more. But it's, kind of a neat way to do business. People just keep buying product from you. ", "David Charles", "Got it. Are you able to quantify or, get a sense for what potential drag in the second half just be subprime environment might be? ", "Jim Lipham", "Well, again we worry about consolidations. We worry about the economy in general, particularly housing. I mean if the consumer gets in trouble with housing, we haven't seen a lot of that yet and we haven't heard a lot from our customers on that issue, but we know there's some -- it's going to some degree. ", "Our business is sort of -- and I hate to use the R word, but it's almost recession-proof. We've gone through, in the past 30 years, several downturns in the economy and our business really never has been badly hurt in the process. So, we're keeping our fingers crossed that folks will stay positive about the economy and what's going on. We do worry about our legislation and what the politicians might have on their mind and that's always something that everyone in this business needs to be worried about. ", "David Charles", "Got it. Last question. Can you talk a little more about the prepaid business in general? Obviously the Wal-Mart product is a significant milestone, but just in terms of the, card economics, the processing economics of prepaid versus a traditional consumer credit card and perhaps a little more color on how all these various parties, including Green Dot, who is really loading these, split up the fees, because it's still a little uncertain on the value chain here? ", "Jim Lipham", "Well, I am processing, I am not going to get into the Green Dot side or the GE side, but our processing of revenues, they would not be as high on a per account basis, or per transaction basis as a traditional credit card, at least at this point. ", "Now, we think that this market is, is on the verge of explosion. We think there will be a lot of consolidation in this market as far as the processors. There are a lot of people that are processors that are making their money on the breakage, if you will, from the gift cards and prepaid cards and breakage is nothing more than the money that is not used on the card and just sort of goes away. ", "So we, we're not in the breakage business, so you can rest assure order that. But we feel, we feel like this business is about to explode. We are working on some more deals that are household names that you would certainly recognize, and to date, it has not been a great business for us. ", "But we think as consolidation occurs, as these cards are more readily accepted as more branding occurs, that, 30% of this country is unbanked and we think this is a great way for people to get paid, to be able to manage their money, to be able to transfer money, and I think it's just going to take time. ", "I was talking to some people the other day and it took us about 20 years to get people to use a debit card, and I can remember talking about debit cards forever, that this was something that was, it was common and then when it got here, it was going to be big. ", "Everybody's got a debit card today. You're starting to see a prolipheration of prepaid cards. I think that when you see folks like Wal-Mart, who is the largest retailer in the world, issuing these cards and certainly you're going to see others issue them, it is a, it's a great way to get the consumer back in the stores and it certainly will help folks feel like that they've got a regular Visa and or MasterCard. ", "So it's a business whose time has come. As I say, we think there will be consolidation. I mean in today's world when you, we're dealing with regulators and PCI and Visa and MasterCard and we just don't think that there's a lot of people in the prepaid business, who in long-term will be able to stand all that pressure that comes along with doing business with banks or financial institutions and all of the requirements associated with that. ", "So, we think we're in a pretty good seat. Now, it is a profitable business. It's a business that we can make a lot of money in. I mean, obviously, this move from New York to Atlanta, Alfredo was not something that we originally planned and we had rather not have gone to that expense. ", "Once we get that behind us, it's going to help to streamline our business, but we are very optimistic about where this business is headed. Now, if it doesn't paying out, I've been so optimistic with our Board, if you see me get running off, it's probably over the prepaid business. ", "David Charles", "Got you. Very well. Thanks so much. I'll let others hop on. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question this morning is coming from Tony Davis. ", "Tony Davis - Ryan, Beck & Co", "Okay. Good morning, Phil, Jim. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Hey, Tony. How are you? ", "Tony Davis - Ryan, Beck & Co", "Good quarter. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thank you. ", "Tony Davis - Ryan, Beck & Co", "Just wondering if you could fill in a few numbers here. What, if you could define, what the Card Tech revenues were or what the growth in revenues were last quarter internationally, excluding them? And then secondly, on the merchant side, the percent of revenues, I guess, at that division, Phil, that are derived from contracts will be expiring over the next couple of years. ", "Jim Lipham", "Tony, this is Jim. And on Card Tech, their revenues for the quarter, including the reimbursables were about $9 million, year-to-date\u2019s about $18 million. ", "Tony Davis - Ryan, Beck & Co", "Okay. ", "Jim Lipham", "Vital -- excuse me, TSYS acquiring, I don't have that breakout here with me. ", "Tony Davis - Ryan, Beck & Co", "Okay. ", "Jim Lipham", "Or if contract renewals -- ", "Tony Davis - Ryan, Beck & Co", "Okay. We'll circle back. ", "Jim Lipham", "All right. ", "Tony Davis - Ryan, Beck & Co", "And Phil, you talked about transaction size. I wonder if you could give us a little bit more color of your thoughts on the M&A front, in terms of vertical or geographic markets that you're really actively considering here. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, I don't think that we're saying we've got anything imminent here, Tony. I mean, we'll continue to look for things that make sense for TSYS. Obviously, they\u2019ve got to be in our range of, our business range. As an example, we have really cranked up our healthcare efforts around here. There's a lot going on in the healthcare business. ", "We would like to do more in the merchant acquiring area. And I think our acquisitions will continue to be in the same range they\u2019ve been in the past years. ", "Tony Davis - Ryan, Beck & Co", "Okay. Jim, and one final question for you. ", "Jim Lipham", "Okay. ", "Tony Davis - Ryan, Beck & Co", "You had identified some expense savings a while back from reassignments, support, consolidation and things like that, and also hardware, software expense saves. Any more color on kind of where you are and all that? ", "Jim Lipham", "Tony, I guess where we are now is most of everything is in place. We do have some equipment benefits coming next year. The rest of it has to do with the attrition on our employee base and as we have said before, it's still -- today it\u2019s down 216 people year-over-year, and I'm just not sure how much more growth we\u2019ve got, or benefits we\u2019ve got as far as the head count reduction. But we do have a little bit more in equipment for '08 coming. ", "Tony Davis - Ryan, Beck & Co", "Okay. Thanks again. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thank you, Tony. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Paul Badulak. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question. ", "Paul Badulak - Credit Suisse", "Thanks. Paul Badulak from Credit Suisse. Just a follow-up on the margins. You guys have obviously done a pretty good job in taking the costs out and already are at the high end of your target range. And maybe you just answered this, but with already being at the high end of the range, any benefits that we'll see in the back half, or are you kind of through all the cost savings benefits, or just I guess any other color on things in the back half that might impact margins? ", "Jim Lipham", "Paul, in the back half of this year, I think everything is pretty much in place. I think you'll see margins in this quarter will probably be the highest as they were going to be all year and so, we'll see a little bit of comeback on that margin growth in the third and fourth quarter. ", "Paul Badulak - Credit Suisse", "Okay. And I mean, the chase moving in-house, I mean that should benefit margins, right? ", "Jim Lipham", "It will. ", "Paul Badulak - Credit Suisse", "Okay. And all the Chase stuff, revenue declines, that's already in the guidance? ", "Jim Lipham", "Yes, it is. ", "Paul Badulak - Credit Suisse", "Okay. And then just switching gears on TSYS acquiring, I mean the margins have been pretty impressive there, given the price competition you've seen. I mean any outlook on the margins in that business? Can you continue to maintain this level of margins given the pricing pressure you're seeing? ", "Jim Lipham", "I think we can hold those margins. A lot of it comes from the transaction delivery cost and that's in place. It's volume-driven and then we've seen a lot of I guess employee decrease, employment expense decrease. I think that will remain. ", "Paul Badulak - Credit Suisse", "Okay. And then on CUP data, you guys have seen some nice activity there. Have you guys given any sense of the size of that business and where you are in terms of margin in that business? Is there opportunities there to improve the processing and then take over that business? ", "Jim Lipham", "Well, we certainly think there are opportunities to improve. We just do not believe that the government is going to let the hard business expand or grow sort of out of control, if you will. ", "I think our growth there will be very methodical and very controlled and every day we learn more about how you do business in China and it's very different than the U.S. and really any other part of the world that we're in, but we, we feel very strongly that we'll look back in five years from now and think that's the smartest thing we've ever done. ", "We think there will be good long-term growth in China. It's one of those markets that you just cannot be in if you're in the card business. ", "Paul Badulak - Credit Suisse", "Great, thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Parker. Please announce your affiliation, and then post your question. ", "David Parker - Merrill Lynch", "Good morning. It's David Parker of Merrill Lynch. Just following up on the Chase deal, you announced the timing on the migration is this weekend. ", "Is this simply something that you can handover the service portion of this deal to Chase, or is there going to be a period of transition as you help them migrate over? Where we might see some additional revenue? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "It's pretty much, we've obviously been working on it together for months and months and months, but it's pretty much a transition over the weekend and certainly we will have for some period of time a group of people that is dedicated to helping make sure that that goes well. ", "We expect it to go well. I think they feel good about it and we feel good about it and I think it's been a grand partnership. And overtime we will have fewer and fewer people dedicated to that and certainly that number is down dramatically from what it was six months ago, but it's more of a, know, a data transfer. ", "David Parker - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. And then on the acquisition side, it looks like the E-Funds might have been a good fit for you guys. Did you have any interest in those assets? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, not, not really. We had looked at E-Funds a couple years ago and they were a little prouder of what they were doing that we were willing to write a check for, so we didn't, we didn't look at it, but we wish those guys nothing but the best. ", "David Parker - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Thank you, guys. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Glenn Greene. Please announce your affiliation. ", "Glenn Greene - CIBC World Markets", "Thank you, good morning. Just a couple quick questions, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on the Wal-Mart money card program, maybe highlights from the pilot and sort of any way to think about sort of your expectations as we sort of proceed through the next year? Then I have got a follow-up. ", "Jim Lipham", "I'm not sure we could give you a lot. We would probably prefer that you go to the owners for that. I mean, we are obviously just doing the processing, but we are excited about it. We, when you see something that big rollout into a business that has been okay, we think that is, that is a good for business. ", "And so, we're excited about that. We don't have any numbers yet. The pilot was pretty small really and the pilot took place over the holidays and, I'm just not at liberty to give you any details on it. ", "Glenn Greene - CIBC World Markets", "Probably fair to say you haven't baked much into your expectations for it this year or anything like that? ", "Jim Lipham", "That is correct. ", "Glenn Greene - CIBC World Markets", "Okay. And then have you quantified at all the adverse revenue impact sequentially from the J.P. Morgan situation? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "No. We have not quantified it publicly. ", "Glenn Greene", "Is that something you would do? ", "Jim Lipham", "Well, I think from our comments we made, that, the revenues are going to go down, but we didn't quantify that. And then we\u2019ve mentioned that the net income is going to be fairly insignificant. ", "Glenn Greene", "I'll leave it at that. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question today is a follow-up from Adam Fritsch. ", "Glenn Waldorf - UBS", "Hi, it's Glenn Waldorf again. Just looking at the top line, the inquiring solutions segment, you're talking about anniversarying those, the attrition effects and such throughout the rest of the year. So, if I were to model this here, we had a decline in revenues year-over-year a little over 2% in the second quarter. Would you say the third quarter would still be negative, and then we\u2019d reach a sort of positive comp by the fourth quarter? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Just trying to think if I had the third quarter. Now, I mentioned in the presentation that sequentially we'll see some growth in the third over the second, as well as, the fourth over the third, and thinking about year-over-year. I believe it's still -- it's still going to be positive in the third and the fourth quarter. ", "Glenn Waldorf - UBS", "Okay. Other than you alluded some of the other answers about, some consternation of customers at First Data and Alliance Data systems, given what's going on there. Can you talk about any opportunities those transactions may have created for you, or anything you're seeing in the market as a result of them? ", "Jim Lipham", "Glenn, we don't talk about active prospects, but I made that comment just -- you would think there would be certainly consternation about ownership of your processors and what will happen in an environment like that. It's sort of -- sort of new in a lot of respects. And certainly it's caused a lot of conversation in this industry. ", "Glenn Waldorf - UBS", "Okay, great. Thank you. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our next question today is coming from Roger Smith. Please announce your affiliation. Then pose your question. ", "Roger Smith - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Yes, it's Roger Smith from Fox-Pitt Kelton. I know there was a lot of questions on the M&A. I just want to go over a couple of quick things. You mentioned a lot of stuff that you wanted to get done in Europe and Spain and Italy and Germany and the Netherlands and as well in South America. ", "And, I just wanted to try and gauge what the acquisition availability is right now in terms of your capacity. And how much you could end up using in the next couple of years, and really kind of what would this timeframe sort of look like from an acquisition point of view? Is this something that we would think of as a 10-year plan or a 3-year plan? ", "Jim Lipham", "Roger, just off the top of my head, I\u2019d say we're looking at a, over the next five years, when you think about it, we've only been in the international business in a significant way for six years now and we've done, I think very well, and I think, we'll continue to do well. ", "But we have learned that doing business internationally is different and it's a -- I don't know this any harder, but it's certainly different and you have to -- you have to learn the way of the world, where you're at. When it comes to acquisitions, we -- if you think about it, we've never been very acquisitive. We've typically built from the ground up and signed one customer at a time, which is a wonderful way to do it, if at all possible. ", "And that\u2019s would certainly be our preference. We don't think that that is necessarily the way we're going to have to do it this next go around. So, I think we'll certainly be looking at what's available, in most every country that you could name, there are certainly people that could jump-start into that business. ", "What we have to be careful of is we don't buy something that just buries us with problems, and quality and is very difficult to manage to the standards that we have with our current customer base. And you see a lot of that with acquisitions. We want to be the absolute best at what we do and sometimes it's very, very difficult to take these small acquisitions -- I've told our Board in some ways it's almost like being in the adventure capital business. It's, you know, they just -- we have to bring them up to the standards that I talked about a minute ago in the prepaid business with PCI -- and SAS 70 and Sarbanes-Oxley and all of the things that we have to deal with. ", "When you start talking about all of that with these small companies that have never been exposed to it, their eyes just glaze over. So it's, it's a long, hard process. I think really we\u2019d like to do, you know, larger acquisitions and -- with folks who are established and understand all the things that you have to do to be really good at this business. ", "Roger Smith - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Great, and I mean at one point I think about a year ago you had talked about being able to do a billion dollars worth of acquisitions. Is that a number that I should still think about as a range of possibility? ", "Jim Limpham", "Yeah, I think it's possible. You know, if the right deal -- but I remember that and I just wondered if I had been drinking the night before or anything. I mean, I've got our general counsel over here looking at me kind of funny, but, yeah, we think we're going to have to be in the acquisition business and, and we are going to do it. We've got -- I mean it's a business, though, that we've got to learn and we've got to do well and it's -- for to us do a really big one like that, -- it's got to be something that we've really got to have bad obviously. ", "Roger Smith - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Great. Thanks a lot for your time. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thank you. Okay. With that, I think we're going to cut off the questions and let everybody go back to work. We really do appreciate you being on the phone this morning. Obviously there's an awful lot going on and I know you have probably got a lot of follow-up questions that you can call us, call or e-mail Shawn Robert. Shawn runs our Investor Relations department. His number is 706-644-6081. ", "Thank you for your interest. Thank you for bearing with us. If you haven't noticed, we are very excited about the progress we've made. When I step back and think that last May, I hosted an Investor Relations meeting in New York and told you that we would be down 15% to 17%, or 17% to 15%, I think it's rather incredible what our people have been able to accomplish and they have really done a great job and we haven't sacrificed quality. ", "This is still a great place to work and so we are very bullish on our future. Thank you for being with us. Thank you for your interest and thank you for your support.

At this time all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode. Wewill open the floor for your questions and comments following the presentation.", "It is now my pleasure to turn thefloor over to your host, Phil Tomlinson, Chairman and CEO. Sir, the floor isyours.", "Phil Tomlinson ", "Thank you, Danielle, and welcometo our third quarter earnings call. We are very excited about it. Obviously,before I get started, we wanted to call your attention to the fact that we willbe making forward-looking statements about the future operating results ofTSYS. These statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that couldcause TSYS actual results to differ materially from the forward-lookingstatements are set forth in our annual reports filed with the SEC.", "I want to open this call bysaying that we're not going to have any comments and we're not going to try toanswer any questions about the possible spin-off of TSYS. The process continuesand it will just continue on until a decision is announced, so that's all wewill have to say on that. We did have a grand quarter. I'm sitting here lookingat these numbers, I'm also sitting here looking outside and it's pouring withrain and we've gone through one of the worst droughts in the history of thispart of the country, so it is a good day all the way around. We have a lot ofpositive things to talk about today. Our results for the third quarter continueto show what hard work, dedication and commitment can do.", "Just a few numbers. Revenuesbefore reimbursables increased 4.9% for the quarter and 5.1% year-to-date. ", "Our net income increased by anamazing number of 26.7% for the quarter, and 18.3% year-to-date. ", "Operating income increased 26.2%for the quarter, and 19.2% year-to-date, up 300 basis points for the year --I'm sorry, I'm talking about operating margins. Operating margins year to dateincreased 300 basis points from 22.6% to 25.6%, which is rather incredible, wethink. ", "Diluted earnings per shareincreased 26.5%, to $0.35 for the quarter and 18.4% or $0.97 year-to-date. ", "Internal growth continues to hiton double digits for the quarter and year-to-date and Jim is going to talk moreabout that later.", "As you saw in the earningsrelease yesterday, we continue to expect to achieve our previously-announcedguidance for net income, which is 20% to 22% on the non-GAAP basis, and we'reon track to make our 0% to 2% increase on a GAAP basis. After some massivelosses last year. I can't overstate how pleased we are with our team's abilityto manage expenses, increase organic revenues, and continue exceedingexpectations as well as selling new business. ", "I also wanted to take a momentand talk about the Royal Bank of Scotlandand their win in acquiring ABN AMRO. As you may or may not know, we process forboth of those banks, and we believe it is a real positive for TSYS. Bank RBSgains a stronger international footprint with this deal, and we believe that wecan expand that relationship as time goes by.", "In last quarter's conferencecall, we talked a lot about competition in our sector and I wanted to sharewith you some of our highlights we had in the third quarter. One is, we havehooked up with Discover Financial and signed an issuer processing agreement,and we'll begin processing prepaid and credit card transactions on the DiscoverNetwork, which of course is a business unit of the Discover Financial Services,very similar to what we do with Visa and MasterCard. It just gives us anotheroutlet, another window into some business that we think we can win. ", "In the UK,our international business continues to impress us. We signed a long-termagreement with Nationwide, who is the world's largest building society. We'regoing to process the credit card portfolio and we're going to build, operateand manage a new customer care center in Coventry.That is a really big deal for us because we're really managing the entireprocess for them. As a result of that scope of services Nationwide, when it isall converted, will rank among our largest clients.", "We also had another internationalwin with Tinkoff Credit Systems, a Moscow-based consumer lending bank. ThroughCard Tech, we're going to supply its card management and authorization systems,and the bank that plans to become the first mono-line card issuer in Russiaand will focus exclusively on issuing credit cards. ", "Also back to the UK,we successfully launched a new money transfer card in the UKthrough Lloyd's. The new silver account from Lloyd's includes an innovativemoney transfer prepaid product, and it's primarily aimed at the growing numberof new immigrants living and working in UK.Commerce Bank in New Jerseyselected TSYS Collections and Recovery to manage its entire collections andrecovery inventory for the bank. This allows the bank to be much more efficientin working all of its delinquent and charged-off accounts including installmentaccounts, automobile loans and mortgages. This is somewhat of a new venture forus and we think there's a lot of great possibilities in this area for TSYS. Wealso announced a multi-year agreement to provide merchant processing servicesto Veracity Payment Solutions headquartered in Atlanta.They will offer a complete electronic payment processing service as well ascard acceptance consulting to businesses around the country.", "Talking about international, ourinternational business continues to perform extremely well and the thirdquarter is certainly no exception. International revenues increased 28% for thethird quarter and 38% year-to-date. We continue to be very pleased about whatis going on with TSYS Card Tech in the UKand the great opportunities that we expect from that server-based processingplatform. We're also, I think, making really good progress with our jointventure with CUP Data in China.The momentum is building, we continue to have client wins, and to-date, we havesigned 34 issuers in China.We have signed them or we have letters of intent with 34 different issuers fromtop five banks down to regional-type banks, so we're very excited about thelong-term prospects in China.", "Moving on to value-added, ourvalue-add products have continued to be a solid contributor. Revenues increased6.1% in the quarter and 7.4% year-to-date. One of the key strategies we havehere at TSYS is to be able to continue to sell new and current products intoour customer line-up. On the merchant side of the house, we're pleased toreport that TSYS Acquiring Solutions continued its outstanding operating margingains and its operating income increased 20% in the third quarter compared tothe same period last year. And we believe that they're starting to turn thecorner on revenue growth. Jim Lipham is going to give you some more color onthis in just a minute.", "Speaking of Jim, I want to goahead and turn it over to him to give you some real details about thesefinancials. Jimmy?", "Jim Lipham", "Thank you, Phil, and I'll askeveryone to focus on the income statement provided with the press release andI'll try to give you a little color on some of these numbers. Starting with thefirst one, the Electronic Payment Processing Services, obviously that's ourcore processing business and license, and it shows an increase in the quarterof 3.6% or up $8.4 million, and up 4.4% or $29.9 million year-to-date. This isespecially a good growth when you consider that for the quarter we lost $43million of revenue that was in the third quarter of last year, and over $157million year-to-date that was all associated with the deconversions since Juneof '06.", "On a pro forma basis, takingthese revenues out of the third quarter of '06, our quarter-over-quarter growthin revenue would be up over 27%, and then year-to-date would be up 35%.Outstanding growth. Our revenue growth really has been fueled a lot by ourinternal growth and as you saw, showing 15% for the quarter and year-to-date.And was changed from what we said last quarter, around 12%, has been theremoval of Chase out of our internal growth numbers. As you know, they tooktheir processing in-house during the quarter. But in addition to the internalgrowth, we had a new business that includes acquisitions added about 12.7% ofour additional growth for the quarter and then 16.6% year-to-date.", "Our account-on-file numbers aredown at 357 million. That's 43 million lower than they were prior year. The netdecrease as a result of the loss of 136 million accounts, mainly from these twolarge customers that we lost since the third quarter of '06. This decrease wasoffset by new clients that added about 71 million accounts, and then ourinternal growth added another 32 million on top of that. ", "Our volumes for the quarter, theywere significantly impacted by the deconversion of Chase's consumer portfolio.We saw our quarterly transactions drop down 12% to 2.2 billion, althoughyear-to-date they're still showing a positive number of being up 3.5% to 7.5billion. On the authorization side for the quarter we're down 13.1% to twobillion and year-to-date we're up 3.9%, or 6.8 billion.", "On the international front, Philmentioned it the revenues increased $23.2 million or 28% for the quarter, and$81.4 million, or 38% for the nine months. And this increase as a result ofvery strong growth across all of our geographical regions, as Canada,Mexico, Japan,Europe, and the revenues associated with theacquisitions we made internationally, such as TSYS Card Tech. As you know, wethought those guys were in our third quarter '06 numbers, but for theyear-to-date they're an additional $21 million more than last year in revenuecontribution. ", "The international revenues alsowere positively impacted, mainly from Europe, by the currencytranslation adjustment, when you consider for the quarter $4.3 million as CTAbenefit. This includes reimbursables and for the year-to-date is $13.5 million.Value-added services, which Phil talked about, grew $12 million or 7.4%. Andfor the year, they still represent around 13% of our total revenues and it'sbeen that way for some time now, so they\u2019re still a very good contributor toour operating income line.", "On the Merchant Services line yousee that revenues are flat for the quarter. When you look at -- and they'redown when you look as compared to prior year. But the main item in here is TSYSAcquiring and their revenues actually decreased $1.2 million for the quarterand $7.6 million year-to-date and the decrease is a result of two largedeconversions. We also had a reclass in '07 of revenues as reimbursable items.This is about $2.2 million and they will continue to have the weakness in thepoint-of-sale business that's been going on for over a year now. We also stillhave some price compressions we were suffering through here from therenegotiation of the contracts that we had at the end of '06. And these revenuelosses were somewhat offset by the internal growth that we're seeing from theTSYS Acquiring front-end transaction volumes. They're up for the quarter about8% and year-to-date, they're up about 11%.", "Internal growth from customersalso added about $4.6 million for the quarter. We are looking forward toanniversarying these deconversions that we had and the price concessions oflast year, and this all should be happening during this fourth quarter. Weanticipate, again, that the acquiring revenues will stabilize, and we'll seesome growth sequentially over the third quarter, and we fully expect TSYS Acquiringto get back to the historical revenue growth rates in 2008. ", "A good highlight of positive TSYSAcquiring's operating income for the third quarter, it was up $18.8 million, or19.9%, over the third quarter of '06. And this clearly shows what a great jobthe team's doing there controlling expenses after these deconversions.", "On a year-to-date operatingmargin, excluding reimbursables, it's increased to 27.3% in '07 compared to23.5%, almost 400 basis points improvement. When we go back to the consolidatedrevenue line and look at other services for the third quarter, they increased19.4%, or $8.6 million, and then year-to-date, we're up 20.4%, or $27 million. ", "Approximately 65% of thisincrease comes from the new joint venture, with Dimension Data in Europe,which is TSYS Managed Services, and as you know, we own 55% of that. That'sboth for the quarter and year-to-date. They represent that big of the increase.The rest of it comes from TSYS Royalty. They made up another 17% of thisgrowth, from their redemption business and on their new loyalty platform. ", "The remainder of the increasecame from growth in our products, such as Profit and Quickremit. There's somegood growth there.", "Reimbursable revenues, as we comedown, is kind of flat for the quarter and it is up 4.5% for the year. The mainaddition there as we mentioned earlier, is the reclass of TSYS Acquiring. Thisis really Phase II fees that we have to start reclassing as reimbursable itemsonce we acquired 100% of Vital. And then you\u2019ve still got the treatment of thecourt costs associated with a debt management business, where we are showingthat now as reimbursables. Total revenues for the third quarter increased 3.6%,and 5% for the first nine months of the year and that's good growth in revenueswhen you consider what we lost.", "As we go down we\u2019ll talk aboutexpenses a little bit. Our expense growth in employment was 4.2% or $5.8million for the quarter. Roughly $4.6 million of that growth came from theacquisition of TSYS Managed Services. For the year, we're up about $50 million,or 13.1%, and year-to-date you\u2019ve got Card Tech contributing about $10.8million of personnel costs and Managed Services is up $10.7 million. We've hadless capitalization due to contractors and salaries for development of about$16 million year-to-date and it's about $2 million less for the quarter.", "On a sequential quarter basis,employment expenses were down approximately $0.5 million dollars, which isgood. Our consolidated head count at the end of September is approximately6,770 people. It's about 13 people less than what it was in September of lastyear. And then, if you exclude the employees associated with TSYS ManagedServices, and Card Tech, that's about 340 more people that we would be downhere in our other operations. We did finish during the quarter the relocationof our Prepaid Manhattan office. We closed it down and moved those folks andthat operation down to Alpharetta. But we continue to look at the allocation ofour people resources and it's quite evident as we've gone through the year ofwhat we've done to manage this cost.", "Occupancy and equipment, expensedecreased 11.8% or $9.1 million, to $69 million in the third quarter, and it isdown 12.4% for the year, or $29 million. And both the quarter and year-to-date,we continue to experience this decrease in our software amortization orMIPS-based software and then lower equipment rent expense associated with ourscale-back. If you recall, in the third quarter of '06, last year, we wereoperating at the highest level of MIPS capacity in the history of our company,as we were preparing to convert sizable account portfolios while stillprocessing for Bank of America prior to their scheduled deconversion, so goodreductions there. The other expenses increased 2% for the quarter and decreased7% for the year. And a large part of this decrease is attributable to lowertransaction and delivery costs for TSYS Acquiring and reclassification of thecourt costs associated with TDM, along with lower conversion amortization onTS2.", "Looking at operating income, asPhil mentioned, it grew a healthy 26% for the quarter and 19% for the year.When you exclude reimbursables, our profit margin was 25.4% versus 21.1% for'06 very good improvement and then for the year-to-date at 25.6%, versus 22.6%.We do expect our margins to continue to remain in the range of 24% to 26% as wemove forward. ", "On the other income, it increased$3.6 million for the third quarter and we obviously had increased amounts ofcash available to invest, and they all have increased in the short-terminterest rates have contributed mainly to this increase, as you can see fromthe interest income line. ", "The effective tax rate for thequarter was 31% compared to 29% last year. We do anticipate our effective taxrate to be around 36%, when you consider prediscrete items and we have had somesettlements on some state tax issues and last year, I think we had a fewfederal tax issues that were settled, so that has caused our rate to come downa little bit. But we do expect the rate without these discrete items to stay in36%, or close to it. Net income for the quarter, it increased 26.7%, or $14.5million, and earnings per share, as Phil mentioned, $0.35, just an outstandingquarter and year-to-date, we're up 18.3%, outstanding.", "I want to mention a few things,if you'll flip over to where the balance sheet is and the cash flow statement.Balance sheet just highlights that our unrestricted cash now at the end ofSeptember is sitting at $592.8 million, and that increased about $203 millionsince December, and that's pretty good numbers and we now have approximately $3of cash per share. I will mention down in the liability section we did record anote payable of $67 million. It's a third-party loan that our Europeanoperations secured to help repay a loan that the parent had made to Europeback in the acquisition of Card Tech. ", "If you look at the cash flowstatement, you'll note our significant contribution in cash generated fromoperating activities at $247 million for the nine months so far. We continue togenerate a lot of cash. We invested $36 million if you go on down in ourproperty and equipment and it's mainly hardware, and then another $20 million,we put in software, and $8 million of it was purchased and about $12 million ofit was developed. And then we also continue to add dividend payments $41million. ", "And our free cash flow analysisit was at $170.2 million year-to-date and that's an increase of about 16.5%year-over-year. So, that was an overall outstanding quarter and year-to-datenumber. And Phil, I'll turn it back over to you.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thank you, Jim. Daniel if we can,we would like to go and open it up from questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions).And your first question is coming from David Scharf. Please announce youaffiliation, then pose your question.", "David Scharf - FTN Midwest Securities", "A couple of things. Phil, theinternal growth, which continues to accelerate, first, just in terms of themath that 15% figure, the acceleration from last quarter's 12%, and I think Q1is probably closer to 10%, is that primarily because Chase was pulled out ofthe calculation or are you, is seeing an acceleration of some other value-addedsales?", "Jim Lipham", "", "This is Jim, David. The bigchange was Chase coming out. We did have about -- I think it was around $4.7million of our CTA growth or profit from CTA that we took out, also. But themain difference is just Chase year-over-year revenues were down and that's whatcaused it.", "David Scharf - FTN Midwest Securities", "Okay. And any sense for how tothink about that internal growth figure had Chase still been in there? Sort ofcomparable to last quarter probably, or --?", "Jim Lipham", "Absolutely. It still would havebeen in the 12% range.", "David Scharf - FTN Midwest Securities", "Okay. And just a little help onmodeling. I know it has been touched on in the past, I guess, is thereobviously your card accounts now have been decreased this quarter to reflectthe Chase license contract. Any way to think about how to model that line item,just to plug it in there, what a good regular way revenue number is for thatsoftware license?", "Phil Tomlinson", "No, David, there's really not.", "David Scharf - FTN Midwest Securities", "Okay, we'll back into it.", "Phil Tomlinson", "I wish I could help you withthat, but I really can't.", "David Scharf - FTN Midwest Securities", "No problem. Secondly, there's anawfully big laundry list of international wins and achievements. I'm justtrying to get a sense, as we look out -- I know you haven't provided anyfinancial guidance for next year, but any sense of what the overall businessmix is going to look like, domestic versus international? And if you had toguess, looking out one year and two years?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, I don't think we areprepared to give that to you today. But we have said publicly on severaloccasions that by 2011, we want international to be 30%, 35% of our revenuebase, and today, I think it is in the 17%, 18% range.", "David Scharf - FTN Midwest Securities", "Okay, no change. I was justtrying to get a sense if you were looking at the pipeline and getting anyfeeling to that target may be accelerated?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, we're very optimistic aboutwhat is going on internationally. There's certainly a lot of activity. I thinkwe've built our credibility up in particularly Europewe're starting to build credibility. We've certainly had credibility in the UKand Scotlandand Ireland.But as we build credibility and as we continue to make sales calls, I think wewill be very successful in that part of the world. We did talk a little aboutwhat's going on in Chinaand the growth there. The actual accounts on file has been a very slow process,but I can tell you we're starting, I believe, to dominate that part of theworld as far as signing new issuers. They're all very small at this point.That's more of a debit society, though we believe that we'll take off and webelieve that, as we've said before, long term Chinawill be huge for us.", "We've had some luck in Japan.We have a letter of intent from a new issuer in Japan.I'm just not at liberty to tell you who that is today. It's not something -- orsomeone who's going to remove the needle dramatically, but it is an importantwin for us, and we're very excited about that. They're telling me now that ourinternational business year-to-date is after losing Sears, Sears B of A andChase is now up to 22%, so, we may have to raise our goal somewhat. But in Japan,it's been a slow-go, I think everybody that's entered into Japanin any sort of business has found it difficult to get out of the startingblocks. We're starting to see some movement there, but nothing dramatic.Nothing is going to make a real difference any time soon. So, we're veryexcited about Europe. We're very excited about the UK.We're very excited about China.", "We have some things going on in Indianow. We believe that we've got to be in India.It's certainly an emerging market, it will be a high-growth card market. So, wedon't have a lot going on in South America. We have justnot been very successful in South America, other than Central America. We've done well in Central America and Mexico.There still are a lot of great opportunities in the U.S.and Canadaavailable. Some really big pieces of business out there, and it's a long sellcycle.", "David Scharf - FTN Midwest Securities", "Got you.", "Phil Tomlinson", "I hope that cleared that up foryou.", "David Scharf - FTN Midwest Securities", "Yes, it does. And just as a quickfollow up on that, obviously we just got through sort of witnessing a 10 yearbattle with First Data for a lot of large domestic accounts. When I read downall of these bullet points of all of these international wins, what is thecompetitive landscape in a lot of these? Are you still bumping up against FDCin most of these situations?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Yeah, absolutely. They're still avery strong competitor and they certainly have not gone anywhere. We see themeverywhere we go, and most of the time, particularly in Europe,as to what would be the principal competitors, so we wish they'd go away, butthey won't. ", "David Scharf - FTN Midwest Securities", "Are there any other formidablecompetitors just geographically focused that are popping up or is it stillpretty much a duopoly around --?", "Phil Tomlinson", "No, there's some in Europethat we see, and obviously we've talked about what's going on with some ofthese national processors, if you will. For example, PolCard was the dominantplayer in Poland,they were acquired by First Data. There's still a lot of those types ofprocessors out there and that business is -- we think we can see continuedconsolidation in that part of the world.", "David Scharf - FTN Midwest Securities", "Okay. And lastly your questionson RBS and ABN AMRO, I wasn't quite sure how to interpret that, particularlywhen --?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Any time David, any time we haveconsolidation it scares us, because it can upset a great relationship justlike, Bank of Americas the latest example of us. We typically have been winnerson that, but we were certainly a loser on the Bank of America decision. We justsay it is a good thing for us because Royal Bank of Scotlandis a grand customer of ours, a great customer, and so is ABN AMRO. And as theycome together, we think that that will, -- as they have a larger footprintglobally, we think that's going to help us, also.", "David Scharf - FTN Midwest Securities", "Got you. Okay, I'll let othersget in. Thank you.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question iscoming from Paul Bartolai. Please announce your affiliation and pose yourquestion.", "Paul Bartolai - Credit Suisse", "Paul Bartolai from Credit Suisse.Good morning, guys.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Good morning.", "Paul Bartolai - Credit Suisse", "First question just on the JPMorgan contract, it sounds like you're not going to get a lot of detail onquantifying the impact, but maybe could you just give us the update on whenthat happened during the quarter and were there any one-time type of costs in there?Or were the margin results kind of a pretty normalized run rate we shouldexpect going forward?", "Jim Lipham", "During the quarter, Paul, Chaseleft and we did have some license fees, roughly about $3 million for thequarter. But all in total, we lost about $8 million in revenues from that shiftfrom them going in the house, to the license fee. So, I think going forward,you\u2019re obviously going to see better profit margins as we, just running fromthe license perspective, and we have built up for this all through the year, asyou've seen these margins improve.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Paul, that thing was planned outin every detail, so almost immediately, as they took the accounts in-house, thecomputers left, we had already reduced the staff, and we committed to -- forsome period of time to have a very small staff of people who are available toassist Chase and any time they need some help with issues or problems thatmight arise, but we just don't have a lot of overhead left on that.", "Paul Bartolai - Credit Suisse", "So, the net revenue loss is $8million in the quarter?", "Jim Lipham", "That's right.", "Paul Bartolai - Credit Suisse", "And was that basically the fullquarter of impact or is that --?", "Jim Lipham", "That's full quarter.", "Paul Bartolai - Credit Suisse", "Okay. So, as we look at the costside of things, there's obviously been a lot of moving parts the last couple ofquarters, but we roughly at a normalized right now, as a lot of thesedeconversion's done and a lot of the large conversion's done?", "Jim Lipham", "I think so. I think you'll seepretty much normal. I think when we looked at inform they were up sequentiallyabout $0.5 million for the quarter, and equipment will, once we anniversarysome of the stuff, it'll level out, and won't be showing such a big decrease asit has, and it just should be a little bit more normal.", "Paul Bartolai - Credit Suisse", "Okay, great. And then youmentioned the currency impact internationally, what was the acquisition impactfor the international business and overall?", "Jim Lipham", "I think we mentioned Card Techfor the year-to-date it was about $21 million, so I think if you take that andManaged Services for the nine-month period, about $30 million was the impact ofacquisitions.", "Paul Bartolai - Credit Suisse", "What about in 3Q because CardTech had fully anniversaried, right, for 3Q?", "Jim Lipham", "That's right. For 3Q that had.", "Paul Bartolai - Credit Suisse", "Okay, great. And then just toclarify on the tax rate. So, it was a little bit lower for 3Q, so are we stilllooking for roughly 36% in 4Q again?", "Jim Lipham", "Yes. We should be around 35.8%,somewhere around there, barring no more discrete items coming in play. Thisquarter we ended up with some state items that cleared up some audits outthrough '05, and we still have some things pending out there with some of theother states, but we don't have any indication that that'll happen any timesoon, so our regular rate will be around 35.8%.", "Paul Bartolai - Credit Suisse", "Okay, great. And then just lastquestion. Just curious to get a little bit more color on this money transferproduct that you launched with Lloyd's. Just curious how that's going to workand what type of role is TSYS going to play in that?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Paul, I'm not sure I can give youthe details. We can have someone call you with more details on that", "Paul Bartolai - Credit Suisse", "Okay, great.", "Phil Tomlinson", "It's just a processing agreementwith us.", "Paul Bartolai - Credit Suisse", "Okay, sounds good. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question iscoming from Adam Frist. Please announce your affiliation then pose yourquestion.", "Glen Fodder - UBS", "Hi. Actually it is [Glen Fodder]from UBS. Great quarter, guys.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thank you.", "Glen Fodder - UBS", "Just want to know if you couldprovide some color on how your merchant strategy has changed over the last fewquarters, if at all, given the changes in the industry landscape?", "Jim Lipham", "Glenn, this is Jim. On themerchants, obviously the strategy has been to enhance our product platform toadd some value to this back-end business. ", "On the front-end side of thehouse, we're seeing a lot of shift from dial transactions over to the SSL. ButI think TSYS Acquiring is focused on the ISO business and how to grow it. We'vesaid before in the past that some day we'd like to get into the Acquiring sideof the house, where we hadn't been before, and I think that's on their radarscreen to try to get there.", "Glen Fodder - UBS", "So, your strategy is pretty muchas it has been?", "Jim Lipham", "That's correct.", "Glen Fodder - UBS", "Okay. And then you said in '08 weexpect to get to a top-line growth that more in line with history, so I seehistory, because of acquisitions, everything a little -- growth rates are alittle choppy. Would that -- would we be looking at that by high single digitsor low double digits?", "Jim Lipham", "I would say mid, maybe in the 5%to 7% range, something like that.", "Glen Fodder - UBS", "Okay. Last question, are thereany large merchant contracts up for renewal in the next two years that weshould be thinking about, reflective of what--", "Phil Tomlinson", "You mean with us?", "Glen Fodder - UBS", "Of what happened in '06? Yes.", "Phil Tomlinson", "No.", "Glen Fodder - UBS", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question iscoming from Tony Wible. Please announce your affiliation then pose yourquestion.", "Tony Wible - Citigroup", "Hi, guys.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Hi, how are you?", "Tony Wible - Citigroup", "Good. I was hoping you could helpme out in sizing up Nationwide. You indicated 20 of your larger customers. Willit be breaking 10% or will it be close to 10% of rep?", "Phil Tomlinson", "No.", "Tony Wible - Citigroup", "Okay. And the guidance youprovided shows, I guess there's an implied drop in reimbursable items in thefourth quarter. What's behind that and are you seeing any issuers change someof their activities from the USas issues that they've seen on the mortgage side of their businesses?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Tony, on the reimbursable drop,the only thing that is dropping really is our postage, which was from thestatement being as we had the first part of the year and through the secondquarter, but that big decrease is there. The rest of it is still the courtcosts and attorney fees and then we had, like I mentioned, the Phase II feesthat we had to re-class on TSYS Acquiring.", "Tony Wible - Citigroup ", "Okay. Do you have any sense forthe organic originations that you get what percentage of those are frompreapproval credit products versus somebody proactively going to the bank to apply?", "Phil Tomlinson", "We really wouldn't have any ideaon that.", "Tony Wible - Citigroup", "Okay. Last question is on thehardware side, I guess you guys have done a great job being able to managecosts throughout these deconversions. Do you see any need to upgrade some ofthe infrastructure at some point as a result of some of the cost reductionsthat you've done?", "Phil Tomlinson", "I think that a year or so ago wetalked about building a western data center. I think that at some point youdon't see us do that, but we feel very good about where we're at,hardware-wise.", "Tony Wible - Citigroup", "And personnel?", "Phil Tomlinson", "And personnel, yes.", "Tony Wible - Citigroup", "Okay, great.

Good morning, guys. Just to tie thisaccount-on-file trend down, Phil, you lost 82 million since June and how manyactual accounts deconverted as part of the Morgan program? And then I wonder ifyou could give us any color on the size of the geographical composition of thepipeline?", "Phil Tomlinson", "I don't have any pipeline numbersin front of me right now, but I would say that we are down, right at 90 millionaccounts as a result of some of these de-conversions.", "Tony Davis - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay.", "Phil Tomlinson", "We've continued to add newbusiness, and it\u2019s probably 80, 90 million. You're right in that range.", "Tony Davis - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. And on another point here,the original goals that you had; I just wonder where you stand right now interms of the cumulative cost take-outs and the head count, either reduction orrealignment that you were looking at a year or so ago. Where are you in that process?Are there any more of these efficiency initiatives, Phil, that remain to beimplemented?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, I don't know that we haveany formal initiatives left. I think we've changed the way we do business here.We had to, and I think it was a very painful, but it has turned out to be avery positive change. We are in the budgeting process as we speak, andhopefully we'll have that done here in the very near future and have a betteroutlook for '08 in particular. But we'll continue to try to be as efficient aswe can. ", "You've heard me say before, inorder for us to be successful long term, we've got to be faster, better andcheaper.

When you've grown as much as we have over theyears, and then you've had some of this yo-yo effect for lack of a better term.We are looking forward to maybe a year or two where we can have some kind ofnormalcy and hope we can add some big numbers to that.

As thequarter progressed, have you seen any evidence over the last several weeks ofany softness in transaction authorization volumes that might be indicative of aretrenching consumer, and how do you feel heading into the seasonally strong,December quarter?", "Phil Tomlinson", "We feel very good. We don'treally keep up a lot with the dollar amount of transactions.

", "Phil Tomlinson", "Good morning. ", "David Parker - Merrill Lynch", "I just have some follow-ups tosome earlier questions. On the merchant acquiring business, are you stillfocused on moving that business internationally, or at this point are you justtrying to get past the de-conversions and the pricing compression that you'veseen on the domestic side?", "Phil Tomlinson", "We've got some things workinginternationally and we actually have announced PaySquare, about a month ago. Itmay have been 60 days ago, in Europe. We would certainlylike to do more there. The opportunities we just haven't been able to put themtogether yet, but our goal is still to be, particularly in Europe and the UK,in the processing business on the merchant side. It's a different business overthere than it is in the US,and frankly we have to make some inroads and build some relationships and it'sbeen a long sales cycle.", "David Parker - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then on Nationwide, youstated that it ranked among your largest clients. You also stated that itwasn't going to be a 10% customer. But can you talk about the scope of servicesthat you're going to be providing to that customer?", "Phil Tomlinson", "We're going to basically runtheir credit card center for them. So, it is pretty well everything. We'reactually building a center, as we speak, down in Coventryand we will be in the credit, collections and customer service business.", "David Parker - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then moving to yourvalue-added products; can you just talk about specifically what products aredoing well in that segment and which ones are not doing as well?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Sure, I think we can. Well, Ithink when you talk about that, Total Analytics is doing well, Advanced CardDelivery's doing well, Fraud Services is doing very well. The ones that are sortof flat would be our Scoring business.", "The Rewards business has dropped,primarily because of the loss of Bank of America and Sears and Chase. We'regoing to have to, it's going to take some time to make that back up. But wealso have had a lot of great help in those areas from Toronto-Dominion, CapOne, and Banco Popular. Profit is continuing to do well. We'll continue to addclients there. Our Loyalty business, we have a world-class product there, andwe're going to do very well there. It's a matter of being able to deliver whatwe can sell. At this point, we can sell more than we can deliver.", "We have some new products comingonline that we're not prepared to talk about but we're excited about them. So Iwould, most of this, anything being down is driven around the couple ofde-conversions that we had last year.", "David Parker - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. Thanks guys.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question iscoming from Glenn Greene. Please announce your affiliation then pose yourquestion.", "Glenn Greene - CIBC", "Thank you, CIBC. Good morning. Afew questions here and the first one is just on CUP Data. You sort ofarticulated a pretty good outlook there and a lot of signings and I know it'sreally early, but could you just sort of give us a view, if you sort of lookout two to three years how meaningful this is and just a real quick reminder ofsort of the structure of your JV?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well. As you know, CUP is sort ofthe, for lack of a better description. They have the Visa and MasterCard ofChina. And, if you want to issue cards in China,you have got to go through CUP and CUP Data is the data processing facilitythat is owned 55% or so. We own 45% of the joint venture. I can't recall thenumbers off the top of my head, but Chinais primarily a debit card country or issuing country right now.", "They do want to issue creditcards. We believe we're in a great position with CUP Data, because it lookslike most people are going to head towards CUP Data particularly the banks. As,I told you a few minutes ago, we've signed 34, I think our principal competitorhas signed one. So, we're feeling pretty good about where we are at. ", "I hope that before too long, wecan start making some announcements about who these organizations are becausethey are certainly names that you would recognize. They are big organizations. ", "We've also signed our firstissuing bank that is not Chinese based. We have a letter of intent from a verylarge bank it's not based in China.So, we believe that the growth will be very controlled.", "We will not have mass issuance oranything like that. It will be a very controlled process. I think they're stillin the process of building some infrastructure. We take a lot for granted inthe US and Canada,when it comes to credit bureaus and authorization systems that we have builtover the years. It makes it awfully easy to issue credit and issue cards and ina lot of these countries, such as China,all of that is not quite in place yet. But it's coming. So, we're veryoptimistic long-term about our prospects in China.", "Glenn Greene - CIBC", "All right. That's very helpful.Just real quickly, on J.P. Morgan; I just wanted to go back a little bit. Iwasn't sure what I heard, but it sounded like it was a $8 million net revenueimpact. But did you also say you picked up $3 million of software licenseswithin that net? I just wanted to confirm that number, or did I hear it wrong?", "Phil Tomlinson", "That's correct. I mean, there was$3 million license fee which made the net at $8 million.", "Glenn Greene - CIBC", "Okay. And then, just sort ofagain on a big picture view, sort of thinking about your operating marginprofile and I think you said it would stay in that 24% to 26% range, at leastthrough to near term. But given sort of your steady state of business, at leastit appears and are pretty good organic growth profile of ramping up a bunch ofnew contracts and pretty stable operating expense base, I would thinkintuitively that you've got pretty good potential for a margin ramp goingforward, as we go out a few quarters?", "Phil Tomlinson", "We would like to think so, butwe're certainly not saying that today. We're going to stick with our rangesthat we've put out there. We want to make sure this is not some anomaly.", "Glenn Greene - CIBC", "Okay. And then, are there any bigcontracts coming up for renewal that we should be aware of in the corebusiness?", "Phil Tomlinson", "No.", "Glenn Greene - CIBC", "All right, great. Thank you.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. (OperatorInstructions) Your next question is a follow up from [Glen Fodder]. Sir, yourline is live.", "Glen Fodder - UBS", "Hi, it's Glen Fodder from UBS,thanks for the follow up. Guys, you said in the past that your businessperformed well in economic downturns. Could you just go into a little bit moredetail on the \u2018how\u2019s and why\u2019s\u2019 of this dynamic? Because banks view their carddivisions as sacred cows, and don't cut back efforts or the ability tocross-sell products that a bank might not currently use, like fraud detectionor is it something else? Thanks.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Glenn, you almost answered it forus. It is the ability to use new value-added products like additional fraudprotection. But historically, what we've seen as times get difficult is peoplewill, in a lot of instances use their cards for more transactions, but lessdollars. So, the transactions help us obviously, the less dollars does not helpthe merchant community. It also creates an environment where banks or issuerswill tend to look at other options, ways to cut costs, ways to be moreefficient, and we see that we get calls during times like that where people mayhave been absolutely will never process with a third party as long as we livetill. When times get tough, maybe we have to look outside and see what's goingon out there and they take a look at us. And at many times, we're successfulwith that.", "Glen Fodder - UBS", "Okay. And, (inaudible) we talkabout this in more detail on the past calls, but could you just go into detailof what you're doing in the healthcare market? You alluded to it in the lastcall, and during the quarter we saw Microsoft roll out a healthcare database.So, it seems like there is a lot of heat around healthcare given that industryand couple of months here?", "Phil Tomlinson", "We've got some small initiativesin healthcare. I think you'll see some announcements coming from us in the nearfuture there. Basically, what we're trying to do, is pick a segment in thehealthcare business and that is what we can manage with a card, and whetherthat is the flexible benefits or several other things that you can do withcards. We are learning that business, as we speak. We have now hired anexecutive with deep, deep healthcare experience to come on board, and I thinkyou'll start seeing us make some announcements in the healthcare business. Itis not going to be anything big in the next year, I don't believe. Now, I'dlove to call the next quarterly call to tell you that we've signed somethingreally large, but we've signed a couple of small players. Not small players,but players who can help us get into this business and help us learn thisbusiness and we think, we can develop software as good as anybody in the world.So, it's a transaction driven business and we think we can do well at it.", "Glen Fodder - UBS", "Okay. Great. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your final question iscoming from David Scharf. Sir, your line is live.", "David Scharf - FTN Midwest Securities", "Hi, good morning. I just steppedoff; I apologize if this has been asked before. Can you just give a littlecolor on what is implied for the fourth quarter by the guidance? Because it istypically a seasonally strong quarter, and I guess the implication is for netincome to be sequentially down, which I--", "Phil Tomlinson", "David, if you will remember ourcomparable is a $69 million to $70 million termination fee that we received inthe fourth quarter last year and it's hard for us to make that up.", "David Scharf - FTN Midwest Securities", "No, no. I'm referring to sequentiallyfrom the quarter just completed from about -- the implication is we're goingfrom about $69 million to $60 million from Q3 to Q4. And I think that\u2026", "Jimmy Lipham", "Yes, David, if you looksequentially at our operating income from second to third you'll see, we\u2019repretty much in line with, I think, where most of the analysts had us. I thinkin the fourth quarter you should see pretty much the same. I would think thatif anything about being down at the bottom line might be in regards to theinterest and in regards to taxes.", "David Scharf - FTN Midwest Securities", "Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, listen, we appreciate youbeing with us today. I hope you can tell we're excited about our business andfeel really good about the third quarter performance and really where we'reheaded into the future. We feel like we're hitting on all cylinders here and wethink we're moving forward. So, stay with us. We appreciate your interest andif you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call us. Shawn Roberts, whoruns our investor relations department, you've got his number. Our salesefforts are going well. Our operations are running very efficiently. And as Isaid earlier, we're very optimistic about the future.

At this time all participants have been placed on a listen only mode and we will open the floor for your questions and comments following the presentation.  It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Shawn Roberts.  Sir, the floor is yours.", "Shawn Roberts", "", "Thank you, good morning, this is Shawn Roberts from TSYS investor relations.  Before we get started with the formal presentation, we\u2019d like to call your attention to the fact that we\u2019ll be making some forward looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS.  These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, factors that could cause TSYS\u2019 actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements are set forth in the TSYS reports filed with the SEC.  At this time I\u2019d like to turn it over to our Chairman and CEO Phil Tomlinson.", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Thank you Shawn and welcome everybody.  I hope everybody is in a great mood today after the big rally yesterday afternoon.  We want to talk about the fourth quarter and the year in general and give you our reports.  I hope you\u2019ve had a chance to read our press release.  We know with all these onetime issues, it can be a little complex but we\u2019re certain we can get through it today.", "Reflecting back on 2007, we think we\u2019ve got an awful lot to be proud of.  A lot of things that happened that I believe will change the long term D&A of TSYS in a very positive way.  Obviously the first and maybe the biggest in our history is the tax free spin of the 80% plus of Synovus Financial\u2019s ownership of TSYS.  We\u2019ve been asked and we\u2019ve talked about this options for what seems like 20 years and it\u2019s finally a reality.  ", "As you know one of the real drawbacks for potential investors over the years has been the lack of float creating limited liquidity as a result of that, a problem that really prevented larger investors from taking a position in TSYS over the years.  On January 1, we put another 160 million shares in public hands.  It increased our float over five times.  This transaction gives us a much greater flexibility with potential acquisitions and for the first time we have a real currency and have the ability to lever up our balance sheet.", "An added benefit is our ability to be more aggressive with our share repurchase program which we have in place.  I want to kind of close the chapter on the spin and as a part of that I\u2019d like to thank Richard Anthony and the Synovus management team for taking a long term view on TSYS and moving forward with that decision.  I strongly believe it was a right decision.", "Speaking about TSYS, I had a couple of highlights I want to go over for the year.  As you know our latest acquisition, TSYS Card Tech in London has had a wonderful year and we\u2019ve signed deals with DnB NorBank, the largest bank in Norway, Qatar National Bank in Qatar, Marfin Popular Bank, Hellenia Bank and Universal Bank all in Cyprus.  We also signed Tinkoff Credit Systems which is the first monoline in Russia.  Our TSYS Europe group announced a launch of a new rewards card program with Norwich Union and a prepaid card program with Lloyds TSB in London.", "We also signed a lot of other what we think are pretty significant gift card programs.  One of the big things that we announced in the UK in 2007 was the Nationwide deal.  Nationwide is the UK\u2019s largest building society, it\u2019s a turnkey deal, we\u2019re doing all of their work from soup to nuts, its credit collections, customer service, settlement and with that model it takes them from being certainly less than a top ten revenue client to a top ten revenue client and so I think you\u2019ll see us try and use that model more as we go forward.", "We continue to make good progress with our joint venture in China with China Union Paid Data.  If you\u2019ll recall we own 44.5% of that joint venture.  Our success rate on RFTs, the card processing over the past several years is nothing short of phenomenal.  I would say that we\u2019re winning eight or nine out of every ten that we look at.  We still believe that\u2019s a long term growth opportunity over the next three to five years but we do believe that long term China is going to be one of the places to be for the future and the other probably being India, which we have also entered into.", "We also extended our contract with Spirit de Mexico in Mexico City.  We are very excited and you\u2019ve heard me say before that Mexico is growing.  That was not the case over the past three or four years.  Our acquiring business renewed agreements with Sage Payment Solutions, [Manaris] Systems up in Canada, Merchant Management Systems, National Processing.  They also signed new deals with Clearnet [Impay], the Bankcorp Bank and we also signed a credit and recovery deal with Commerce Bank of New Jersey.", "I wanted to share a few financial results with you but the ones I\u2019m going to share with you and Jimmy will get into the non GAAP and GAAP numbers, but the ones I want to share are on a non GAAP basis and exclude the big termination fee that we had and the spin related operating expenses of $14 million in 2007.  Both of which we view as one time revenue and expense events.", "Total revenues came in at $1.8 billion for the year and $459 million for the fourth quarter, up 5% for both periods.  I think you need to factor in the fact that Chase took the processing in-house in July and we certainly do get a licensing fee from that software, but certainly that was something that we had preferred not happen.  Net income was $260 million for the year.  That\u2019s a 25% increase.  It was $67 million for the fourth quarter and that\u2019s a 56% increase on a non GAAP basis.", "Operating income came in at $368 million for the year.  That\u2019s a 25% increase and it came in at $93 million for the fourth quarter which is a 51% increase.  Basic EPS or earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.34 and $1.32 for the year which exceeded our forecast.  Internal or organic growth which we have talked about a lot over the years for 2007 was right at the 15% mark.  Now that Jimmy is going to have some interesting comments on that.", "You\u2019ll recall, we gave some early guidance prior to the startup of our road show which was around the first of December.  And as you saw in yesterday\u2019s earning\u2019s release, we raised our 2008 earnings guidance.  We expect that our total revenues will grow in the range of 7-9% in 2008 and we also expect net income and basic EPS to grow in the range of 7-9%, up from the previously announced 4-6%.  So we\u2019re very pleased with that.  ", "I can\u2019t overstate how pleased I am with our ability to control expenses and continue to grow organically which has resulted in the expansion of our operating margin which was 25.7% for the year.  Frankly and I want to brag on this a little bit here, the obstacles we had to overcome in 2007 which I think all of you are very familiar with, I believe it turned into a great year and our team has done a wonderful job of managing through those obstacles and winning through a very, very difficult time at TSYS.", "Just a few more comments on this international business.  Every year, since we\u2019ve really gotten serious about international, they continue to perform better and better and certainly 2007 was no exception.  Our international revenues increased 33% in 2007.  As I mentioned earlier we continue to be very excited about Card Tech and the many opportunities that we expect from that processing platform and that group of people.  I think our ownership has really helped with some credibility and helped to create a higher level of interest and enthusiasm and we certainly expect big things to happen there.", "I want to now turn it over to Jim Lipham, our CFO who will give you more financial details.  Jimmy.", "Jim Lipham", "", "Thank you Phil.  And as we go through these financial [overlay], our performance, I\u2019m going to be excluding the onetime spin related costs as we discuss some of these changes for the quarter and year to date.", "That Phil mentioned as you exclude the spin expenses in 2007 our earnings per share increased 5% to $1.32% [sic] for the year, which did exceed our earlier forecast.  [Unintelligible] by looking at the income statement then I\u2019ll [unintelligible] to these line items.   First of all the electronic payment processing services as you know is our core business with licensing arrangements also in that number.", "And as we compare this \u201907  year to date to \u201906, keep in mind that I am gonna also exclude the BofA termination fee of $65 million and the $2 million related amortization expense that we incurred in \u201906 as they deconverted.", "The first of all, electronic payment processin\u2019 without the fee was up 2.3% or $6 million for the quarter and 3.4% or $31 million for the year.  This is especially good growth when you consider the loss of over $37 million that was in the fourth quarter of \u201906 and the loss of $249 for the year that was associated with the deconversions that occurred since June of \u201906.  But our revenue growth has been fueled by first of all for the internal growth which Phil stated at 15% or the year.  It has dropped down to 14% for the quarter and as we go forward we still expect it to stay in double digits but probably will not maintain the 15% range as we go forward.", "That was a big contributor, in addition we had new business in the quarter that added 2% additional growth and then for the year the new business along with the acquisitions, we added another 12%.  Our account on file numbers are at 375 million today.  This is about 41 million lower than prior year.  The net decrease is a result of the loss of 105 million accounts from the two large customers that deconverted and we offset that by adding new clients of about 24 million and then the internal growth of our accounts added about 40 million more accounts.", "Our volumes for the quarter were significantly impacted by the conversion of Chase\u2019s consumer portfolio to their in-houses licensing arrangement.  We saw our transactions for the quarter drop 29.8% to $2 billion.  Year to date, transactions are down 5.8% to $9.5 billion and then quarter, authorizations are down 29.4% to 1[inaudible].83 billion and then year to date authorizations are down 5.5%, 8.65 billion.  ", "Also in these revenues, international revenue increased 19.2 million or 21% for the quarter and 100.6 [b]illion or 33% for the whole year of \u201907.  This increase is a result of very strong growth across all of our geographic regions and revenues also associated with our international acquisitions of which Phil mentioned Card Tech doing a wonderful job.  Their revenues in \u201907 are up $24 million more than they were in \u201906.  International revenues, specifically the revenues from Europe were positively impacted by a currency translation adjustment for the quarter and 2007.  The quarter being 4.3 million.  This includes reimbursables and 17.8 million for the year also includes reimbursables.", "Our value added service revenues grew 10 million or 4.5% for the year, \u201907 over \u201906.  They represent about 12.8% of our total revenues including reimbursables, still good growth there.  Merchant services, the next line, including reimbursables, they are up 2.8% for the quarter and 2.4% for the year.  [Unintelligible] revenues before reimbursables were down slightly for the quarter and for the year.", "For the quarter we dropped 2.1 million, this is mainly attributable to lower transaction growth we saw during the quarter as our volumes or transactions grew at 3% compared to about a 9% growth that we have for year to date.  But for the year we\u2019re down 9.2 million and this decrease is a result of several things.  First of all, we had four processing deconversions during this period that cost up about $13 million.  We had a re-class of about $3 million in revenues as reimbursable items that went through here.", "Weakness in our point of sale [teep] systems and services, we talked about before, amounted to about 6.4 million for the year.  And then we have these price concessions that we\u2019ve talked about before on the renewal of client contracts that cost us about 7.  All in all, this was offset somewhat by the internal growth that we saw as I mentioned before the 9% growth in volumes, it contributed about $21 million from the existing TSYS acquiring clients.", "We do anticipate that TSYS acquiring revenues to stabilize and we fully expect this year to get back to a strong revenue growth rate in \u201908 of between 7-9%.  TSYS acquiring\u2019s  operating income for the fourth quarter of 2007 was 17.2 million, a 1% increase over the fourth quarter of \u201906 and this is mainly due to we had a onetime billing adjustment in the fourth quarter of \u201906 of $1 million and if you restate for that we would be up about 7% on an operating income basis, fourth quarter over fourth quarter.", "For the year, operating income was 64 million an 11.6% increase over \u201906.  This again clearly shows the great job that these guys are doing out there controlling expenses and after the deconversions the challenges they faced last year.", "Operating margin, excluding reimbursable items have increased to 28% in \u201907 compared to 24% for the full year of \u201906.  TSYS acquiring is still showing the great service as they are availability also is up 99.99% for the entire fourth quarter.  ", "Returning back to consolidated revenue, other services revenue for the fourth quarter is 11.1% or 5.7 million and then year to date it increased 17.8% or 33 million.  Approximately 62% of this year to date growth for the quarter is a joint venture that Dimension Data, the TSYS managed services deal that we did, we hope it to 5% of it in Europe, about 62% of the year to date growth there came from there.", "Loyalty, our company in Atlanta, made up another 26% from its growth in its TLP platform new loyalty business and the remain of the increase came from growth in our profit product. ", "Reimbursable items increased 15.4% for the quarter and 7.1 for the year primarily as a result of the base two fees that we [fatisus] acquired had to be re-classed and the treatment of court costs that we\u2019ve talked before, our debt management company in Atlanta, the new contract where we had to switch some revenues into reimbursable items.", "Total revenues for the fourth quarter decreased 9% and increased 1% for the year.  As you recall, last year\u2019s fourth quarter included this onetime termination fee and as Phil mentioned before on a for proma [sic] basis, both the quarter and year to date total revenue lines would be up 5% on a pro forma basis.  ", "As we continue down the page I\u2019d like to make a few comments about our expenses.  The expense growth in employment up 3.1 or [inaudible] million for the quarter.  For the year that\u2019s $54.4 million or 10.4%.  Europe\u2019s, well really the biggest thing on the year to date is you got Card Tech in there and managed services on a full year basis and they contributed about a little over half of that growth of 54 million or 27 million.  Then Europe had continued rapid growth there, their employment costs increased about another 19 million and as they increased their head count by 89 people.", "Capitalized salaries and contractor expense increased 5.4% or [unintelligible] million for the quarter but they were down year over year 6.8 million as we did less in software development.  On a sixquential [sic] quarter basis, employment expenses are really basically flat, they\u2019re up about $789,000 and we think that\u2019s real good in holding that number.  Part of the reason that our expenses are up is the head count at the end of December, approximately 6,920 people, which is up about 172 people more than it was in December of \u201906.", "Our international base support services segment has experienced the largest increase, adding 485 people and not a lot of that has to do with the cost of the business.  This increase is somewhat offset by decreases in our other two segments, domestic based support services experienced a 4% decline or down 233 people, while our merchant acquiring services saw an 11% decline or 80 people when compared to last year.  Speaks well for how the margins have maintained where they are.", "On the next line item, equipment decreased 26.9% or 25 million to 67.8 million for the quarter and decreased 14.1% or 44.8 million for the year.  This decrease is a result of the lower software amortization [unintelligible] based software and lower equipment rent expense as we talked about during the year.", "Remember in the fourth quarter last year as a result of portfolio deconversions, we accelerated an $11 million amortization in prepaid maintenance write off related to this mainframe software operating system that was dedicated solely to the processing of the deconverted portfolios.", "We have a new line, spin related expenses and as you know as a result of the spin off from Synovus, we incurred expenses associated with advisory and legal services in connection with the spin assessment.  These costs also include the incremental fair value associated with converting Synovus stock options held by TSYS employees to TSYS options.  So we expect to incur some stock options expenses and a few spin related as we go into \u201908 and unwind these comingled processes.", "Other expenses are down 3.5% year over year for the fourth quarter and decreased 10.9% for the year.  A large part being attributable to the lower transaction delivery cost at TSYS acrquiring and the drop in transactions.  The reclassification of the court cost that we had for the reimbursables and then we had lower TS2 conversion amortization.", "So overall we get to operating income as we go through here, when I comments also will be excluding the BofA fee and spin expenses, so if you look at operating income it\u2019s showing down but if you do the pro forma numbers, it grew a healthy 54% for the quarter and 25% for the year.", "Excluding reimbursables, our operating profit margin for the quarter was 25.6 and 25.7 for the full year of \u201907 which is an increase of 422 basis points over the margin in \u201906 of 21.48.  As included in the 2008 guidance, we expect our margins to continue to remain in the range of 25-27%.  ", "EBITDA as Phil mentioned was 520 million on \u201907 or 9% increase over \u201906.  Our EBITDA margin in \u201907 was 36.38% and we expect that level to continue as we indicated in our guidance at the same rate.  Going forward we realize operating income and EBITDA metrics will be important in evaluating TSYS financial results and we\u2019ll continue to report on that for you and that\u2019s one of the reasons I guess when you look at net income growing at the same rate as our revenues, you got to remember on the forecast out in \u201908, we do have interest expense now instead of interest income and if we had not levered the company there that number would be up quite higher than the 7-9 on net income.", "Other income increased 9 million compared to \u201906 and there again that\u2019s a direct result of the cash we had available along with the short term interest rate increases we saw.  Effective tax rate for the quarter was huge at 48.1%.  Pre-discrete items the rate would have been 33.4, as you know we have some spin related costs that was directly tax related that caused that rate to jump up and you know last year our rate was 35.5.", "For the year, when you look at 2007, you see a 37.8% pre-discrete items and be 35.3 compared to the 33.8 we had last year in \u201906.  We do expect the tax rate as we go forward to remain around 36% pre-discrete items and just note that both years of \u201906 and \u201907 have been affected by our SN state discrete items settlements and impacted these rates.", "Pro forma net income for the quarter increased as we talked about 54% or 24 million to 67 million.  Pro forma earnings per share increased to $0.34 up 55% over the $0.22 per share for the fourth quarter of last year.  Year to date in earnings increased pro forma 25% or about 52 million and then the pro forma earnings per share as we talked about $1.32, up 25% over the $1.06 in \u201906. ", "We move to the balance sheet, I\u2019d like to make a comment or two there about the unrestricted cash is 211 million after paying the 600 million special dividend in connection with the spin and make mention we also closed our credit facility in December and we received 168 million loan and left about 252 million on a revolver that can be drawn down as needed.", "Credit facility does have a five year term and bears interest at LIBOR plus 60 basis points and we also entered into a loan agreement during the fourth quarter with IBM for $22 million payable over 39 months for the purchase of software.", "On the cash flow statement, you\u2019ll note a significant contribution there again in cash generated from operating activities of $334 million for the year as we continue to generate good cash for our funding of operations on it.  We invested 55 million in property and equipment, this is mainly in hardware and then we have 51 million in software which is 33 million of purchased software and 18 million developed.", "We also paid the 55 million in regular dividends so far this year and the special dividend of 600 million on December 31 of \u201907.  In our unlevered free cash flow analysis, free cash flow was 336.6 million compared to 319 in \u201906.  ", "Did want to make just a few comments on our guidance numbers that we submitted.  We will continue to provide the EBITDA numbers and income from operations and changes that occur affecting these key measures as we go forward, but on November 30 of \u201907 the guidance we had depreciation and amortization at 144 million for 2008 which we have increased now to 152 million.  This is primarily the result of the signing of the contract of the hardware and software purchased in December of \u201907.", "And then as we completed the budget process our operating expenses decreased over our November 30 guidance.  Increase in pro forma operating income by 9 million and our net income 6 [m]illion.  Our lower end of the revenues was also increased after the budget by 2 million and then again the spin expenses, they increased 2 million and that\u2019s primarily due to the final pricing on the Synovus options as they were converted to TSYS options.", "So with that Phil I will turn it back over to you.", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Thanks Jimmy, we\u2019d like to go ahead and open it up for the Q&A session now Jennifer.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "Thank you.

Phil I\u2019d like to start with maybe just some comments on sort of the overall market environment for many of your larger customers.  The internal growth in the mid teens was surprisingly strong last year and it sounds like you\u2019re still expecting double digits, but can you talk a little bit about what some of the largest issuers, particularly on the credit card side are saying in terms of expected account growth, what their appetite is for discretionary spending or spending on value added services because obviously there are a lot of headwinds out there in terms of the market environment for them.", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Well I think in some ways it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag.  We have several clients who have been splashed all over Wall St. and the American bankers that are having some difficulties but we believe that the vast majority of our clients are in pretty good shape.  Now I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that card delinquencies are going to rise.  Particularly as it relates to the mortgage crisis that we have been in and continue to be in.  But in some ways that almost helps us with some of these value added products that we have such as fraud and special collections and profit and this national attorney network through our total debt management.  ", "People want to do more authorizations as opposed to less, people want to use more of our total access which is our relational database system to try to manipulate the data and try to better determine who they think has real issues.  So there\u2019s a lot of positives.  We were frankly surprised at the 15%, we were delighted with it but you know historically that number has been lower than that.  We think it\u2019ll be in double digits but we certainly don\u2019t expect it to be in the 15% range again with the year starting out like it is today.  We do think that people will continue to issue credit cards.  ", "One of the great ways to deal with delinquencies is to help yourself grow through them.  The worst thing that you can do is just pull your horns in and do nothing.  Historically, at least, we have done pretty well through difficult financial times.  I mean we\u2019ll keep you plugged in on how this time is going, we had a good holiday season.  Excuse me, I\u2019m about to choke to death here.  Everybody here has been sick and I hope it\u2019s not hitting me.  But our numbers, our transaction numbers have held up well, we have a lot of products going out the door.  Our prospects are good.  ", "One positive thing, if there\u2019s anything positive about this type of environment is we typically will get more lookers if you will or interest in new sales because it\u2019s a great time for folks to kind of step back and review the bidding on what they\u2019re doing with processing.  Because they\u2019re just looking for better and more effective and less expensive ways of doing processing and we think we have some great alternatives there.  So while we are certainly not exciting about this economy that we\u2019re looking at and we were very hopeful, I mean I was encouraged yesterday afternoon to finally see some progress, we don\u2019t believe it\u2019s the end of the world.  ", "As a matter of fact, I told our local newspaper here the other day that it looks to me, excuse me, it looks to me like we have an awful lot of people thinking the glass is half empty and not enough people thinking the glass is half full.  I think that we think our glass is better than half full.  We\u2019re very optimistic and bullish about our position in this marketplace.  Excuse me, I\u2019m sorry, so we are, we\u2019re going to stay focused on our business, we love this business, we\u2019re excited about it but we\u2019re also very sensitive to our customers because obviously it is a tough time for financials and we want to help them get products out the door and we believe that they\u2019ll continue to push products out the door, new products.  And we are hoping that the folks who can afford those products will jump on them.", "David Scharf \u2013 JMP Securities", "Gotcha, when you look at your expectations for just organic growth in the existing accounts, the installed base, is it much more weighted towards value added products or are you actually assuming some net card account growth at your existing clients?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "I think we think we\u2019ll see some net new business come on board.  I mean it\u2019s really, David, a combination of all of that.  We\u2019ll add some new business.  We do believe the accounts on board today will continue to grow.  Albeit maybe not as fast of a pace as it has been, which you know last year was the 15%, but we do believe these value added products, it will be a very good year for value added products we believe.", "David Scharf \u2013 JMP Securities", "Okay.  I wonder if I could just shift to a couple of other areas.  One is on international, which it sounds like you know you\u2019ve been really picking up an awful lot of steam here both in terms of new accounts and win rates.  You know I was wondering, in terms of how we should think about more normalized operating margins in that reporting segment, realizing that a lot of moving pieces in different operations there, I mean the trend has been upward in recent years but boy quarter to quarter it\u2019s still all over the place.  You know maybe Jimmy could sort of address when there\u2019s certain normalizations of head count or investment spending and you know does this thing kind of stabilize around the 20% level?", "Jim Lipham", "", "I think, David, as we go into \u201908 we\u2019re still in the investment stage in several areas in international and so I think that your margins, you\u2019re going to continue to see for at least another year the low 20\u2019s, high 19\u2019s, low 20 area.", "But I do think that as we go forward with the growth and the new customers coming on board next year and Europe itself that we will pick up some margin improvement on the European operation itself.", "David Scharf \u2013 JMP Securities", "Okay and is the pricing on many of your newer deals in Europe still more favorable to what you see in the more mature domestic market?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "I think it\u2019s pretty competitive.  In Europe and around the world, I mean we\u2019ve still got some touch competitors out there and we don\u2019t have any slam dunks in this world we live in, we\u2019ve got to earn our stripes every day.  So I think you\u2019ll see it continue to be competitive at least for the short term.

When we think about TSYS\u2019 business model, how much of the \u201908 revenue would we think of as just that sort of recurring per account per month type charge as opposed to more variable revenue or tied to merchant dollar volume?", "Jim Lipham", "David, this is Jim, I think on \u201908 revenues, when you\u2019re talking about recurring, I assume you\u2019re talking about our growth on internal revenues which is the chart that we normally use with the 15% and as we talked about it\u2019s going to be a little less than that this coming year and I would say it\u2019s still going to be in the 10-12% range as we get towards year end.", "David Scharf \u2013 JMP Securities", "Maybe I\u2019ll rephrase it, I think what I\u2019m really thinking about Jim is your mix of revenue.  How much of the revenue you expect is truly a recurring per account per month charge regardless of transaction volumes, regardless of merchant dollar volumes?", "Jim Lipham", "", "I\u2019d say about 70% as you know a lot of our stuff is kind of bundled account pricing.

I was hoping you\u2019d just comment on what you\u2019ve seen that has changed in your business since you gave the previous guidance back in December and just to why you felt comfortable raising the earnings expectations for 2008?", "Jim Lipham", "", "The main reason David is that when we gave that guidance early when we went on the road we had not finished our budget process and we mentioned that at there that we were going to be coming back and hopefully improving it and we were able to do that.  I mean there was just some changes, you know we had some spend related items that went up on us but then again our operating costs went down from where we had anticipated as we tightened up on the budgets.  Improved net income and then again revenues were up slightly on the low end of our range.  It was more of a function of just getting back and getting finalized on the budget.", "David Parker \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "", "Okay and then with the [overlay].", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Can I add one thing there?  The three of the very top officers in this country were in this company were gone for really the first three weeks of December so we just didn\u2019t have a chance to, we had the budget and we thought it was in pretty good shape, but we knew it wasn\u2019t finalized, but we were just out of pocket for almost three weeks.  Go ahead.", "David Parker \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "", "Okay, thanks and then just in regards to the one time spin costs that are expected in 2008, how should we think about those hitting the P&L?  Do you expect most of them in the first quarter or are they going to be spread out throughout the year?", "Jim Lipham", "", "I think most of them will be in the first half.  ", "Phil Tomlinson ", "", "Because the majority has to do with the stock options and most of that will be worked out in the first half of the year and we\u2019re hoping to get, the biggest thing we got in the transition cost has to do with the joint payroll function that we run today with Synovus and we\u2019ll be working our way out of that during the year and pretty fast I hope.", "David Parker \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "", "Okay and then final question, just in regards to TSYS acquiring, you were expecting some stabilizations, I think you said in third quarter comments that you were expecting to see that potentially increase sequentially, I think that you mentioned transaction authorization volumes were lower than expected in that quarter.  What gives you comfort that we\u2019re actually going to get back to that high single digit growth rate in that business as we move into 2008?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "I guess, David, a little bit of that comment in the third quarter is they had a little more of this compression in pricing than I thought and also the volumes as I mentioned, they\u2019re at 3% when they\u2019ve been growing at a higher rate.  Now as we go forward we are anticipating the volumes form the transactions growing at 9% but we\u2019re hoping also that this new business which is going to come on board is going to cause the revenues year over year to grow at around 7-9%.  And so we\u2019re planning on some new growth as well as no more drops in the volumes from what you\u2019re seeing.", "David Parker \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "", "So what attributed to that slowdown to 3% growth in the fourth quarter?  Was it the deconversions or higher pricing pressure or some other issue?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Didn\u2019t have any real deconversions during the fourth quarter.

Congratulations on another good quarter.  I just got a quick question on US card issuing business.  Assuming a large part of market share games are behind this, many but not all of large banks have outsourced the processing, where is the next leg of growth coming from in the US?  Is it more cross selling to the big banks or is it new outsourcing opportunities to the smaller banks and do you have a sense of proportions, 50/50 from each?  Thanks.", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Well Glen it\u2019s really, it\u2019s all of those.  I mean we think there\u2019s an awful lot of opportunity out there with a midsized small banks, we have not even tried to, to date we have not really gotten serious about the credit union business, although we do have some very, very large credit unions, we have the largest in the world and we have several other large credit unions.  There are a lot of banks that still process in house.  A lot of the large banks and we think that frankly as I said earlier, times like we\u2019re experiencing right now are typically pretty good fertile hunting for us if you will, because people that are under lots of pressure tend to want to look around and see what their options are and you know you could name just any large bank that you wanted to name that doesn\u2019t process with us today. ", "We would think that they would be a candidate.  And we\u2019ll continue to do well in I think Canada, in Europe and as I\u2019ve said Mexico is growing, but you know think about credit unions, think about smaller medium banks, think about folks that are processing in-house and think about financials that are processing with our competitors.  I mean we don\u2019t have a 50% market share yet so we\u2019ve got a long way to go.  We\u2019ve only got, as best we can determine on a global basis, we\u2019ve only got about a 6% market share.", "Analyst for Adam Frisch \u2013 UBS", "", "Great, thanks.  Just turning to Europe, regarding the recent moves by the European Commission on Interchange Regulation and with the prospects of regulation over there where banks will presumably make lower returns on their card business, does this concern you when you think about the possibility of the impact on account growth or pressure and pushback on your fees to those banks?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Well I think that any new or additional regulation concerns us because you know, just like in the US, some of these Congressional hearings that you\u2019ve seen over the last year, all of that concerns us because you know we\u2019re all in this business together, one way or the other, whether we like it or not and certainly we don\u2019t like to see pricing regulations and we think that\u2019s what that is.  So it does concern us, we haven\u2019t seen any ill effects of it yet, it\u2019s not something that seems to be a life or death topic with folks that we\u2019re talking with right now.", "Analyst for Adam Frisch \u2013 UBS", "", "Okay and then a final question.  If you had to take this 15% organic growth, I mean I know that can vary from 15 or 12 or whatever, but let\u2019s just say it\u2019s 15, how would you proportion that between X percent is growth of the existing customers, the next percent is new customers brought on and then offset to that is you have customer attrition.  How would you sort of bucket that, proportion that 15% growth?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "David I think you might be misunderstanding the 15%.

First question just to clarify on the merchant segment.  You know you talk about the slowdown in transaction growth to 3% in the fourth quarter but it sounds like you\u2019re still comfortable with kind of high single digit growth for 2008.  Can you give us some color on what you\u2019re assuming, I mean are you kind of assuming that pricing and transactions stay at the 4Q level and some of the new stuff that\u2019s been signed gets you to 7 or 9% or what are you basically assuming for kind of the core business?", "Jim Lipham", "", "Paul, I think that\u2019s right, it\u2019s the level that we got in the fourth quarter.  We might have been a little bit ahead of ourselves on anniversary-ing these price concessions and the deconversions but that definitely will, the fourth quarter revenues will be a little more indicative going forward and we anticipate new business is going to make the revenues grow.", "Paul Bartolai \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "Okay and just on the pricing, was it new stuff that was signed or is it just this stuff that was still lapping from previous signings?", "Jim Lipham", "", "It was stuff that was lapping from previous signings, there was nothing new in the quarter.", "Paul Bartolai \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "And are there any big signings coming up, I mean do you expect to see any further compression on pricing going forward?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Well I don\u2019t know that we, I mean, you\u2019ve heard me say before that we\u2019re always under pricing pressure.  We do have some deals that are signed and we hope that these new clients will at some point let us announce it.  We have not converted them yet but we have factored that in and think we\u2019ll add additional clients as the year goes on.", "Paul Bartolai \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "Okay great, then looking at the payment processing segment.  Kind of a similar type of question there, I mean when we look at growth for \u201908, how much of this stuff that is already signed and just needs to be loaded up and how much is you just kind of assuming some level of new business signings and maybe just some comments on the backlog of what\u2019s to be loaded up this year.", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Paul I think for our \u201908 numbers, we didn\u2019t really, other than clients that we already know about, we didn\u2019t put anybody else in there, although we did put some stretch goals in for revenue growth.  So most of the growth is really from stretching what we have an increasing value added and this type of stuff, stuff we already got.", "Paul Bartolai \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "Okay great, then just a final question, on the spin related costs, is there some component of the \u201908 cost that is ongoing?", "Jim Lipham", "", "There will be a small part of it that will carry on through the end of the year \u201908 but after that it all should be washed out.", "Paul Bartolai \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "Okay great, thank you.", "Operator", "", "Thank you.  Your next question is coming from Glenn Greene, please state your affiliation and pose your question.", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "", "Thank you, good morning, my affiliation is Oppenheimer.  The first question goes back, it\u2019s similar to the first question but just want to get a little bit of clarify on the economic sensitivity of the business model within the payment processing business.  I mean isn\u2019t it predominately account per month based business model, transaction based, volume based, just a little bit of clarify there.  I have a view on it, I just want to hear it from you.", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "It certainly is not, we get paid the same thing Glenn for a $2.00 transaction as we do a $20,000 transaction so when you think about the economics, if people slow down buying what we worry about is they slow down the number of transactions.  We don\u2019t really, at least historically we have not seen transactions slow down an awful lot.  ", "They do slow down somewhat, but certainly the bottom does not drop out of transactions.  It may drop out of the dollar amount.  We also have some large deals that are priced on a bundled basis that we get the same price per account per active account per month regardless of whether they have a transaction or not.  And so it\u2019s kind of a combination of those two.  But none of it is based on [overlay] dollars spent.", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "", "Okay and what have you seen in previous cycles where the credit card environment, we\u2019re sort of seeing delinquencies and charge offs like you\u2019re hearing from a lot of the big issuers, what was sort of the impact on your business?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Well, again, I\u2019m speaking historically, it was not nearly as negative as you might think it would be and I think it\u2019s primarily because we are pricing on the transaction as opposed to the amount of transaction and even more so today than say 2001 or earlier recessions, is the fact that we have a lot of this bundle pricing.  In really good times we sort of dislike bundle pricing.  In times like we\u2019re experiencing right now, we think bundle pricing is probably going to be a positive for us.", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "", "Yup and then just a question on the stability of your book of business.  There\u2019s been a few of your sort of high profile customers potentially looking to sell their credit card portfolios and I\u2019m sure you know which names I\u2019m referring to, but just wanted a little bit of sense of what you\u2019re sort of thinking about that and what you might be able to tell us to get us comfortable with the stability of your book of business.", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Well I think you\u2019re absolutely right, we\u2019ve got a couple out there, private label deals that have at least announced they\u2019re considering it and we\u2019ve had all the appropriate conversations that you can have with a client like that.  We have great relationships, even if they do sell I think there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019ll continue to process it, but the fact of the matter is, that\u2019s the one thing that keeps us up at night and that\u2019s this consolidation, this merger and acquisition business with our clients.  ", "When we go back and we\u2019ve spent hours talking about the BofA deal, I mean, if you\u2019ll recall when we had just signed a new ten year agreement with Bank of America and seven months later they announce that they were going to leave us because of the MBNA deal.  Now we got paid a lot of money as a result but certainly it was not a good thing for TSYS.  Historically, we\u2019ve been a net winner on mergers and acquisitions but that is, when people say, Phil what keeps you up at night?  That is what keeps me up at night, that we worry about here.", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "", "And how have you sort of reflect a better factor that into your \u201908 expectations at this point?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Well it\u2019s not factored in because we don\u2019t know.  Certainly we have long term contracts with everybody you might be speaking about and we have penalties but again that\u2019s not what we were, if one of them does actually sell we\u2019re going to do our very best to retain that business and I think we have at least a 50% chance and I really think better of making that happen.  So much of it just depends on who buys.", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "", "Okay and then, just an easier question is, if you could just help me understand the strong retail account growth in the quarter, is there any big conversions that came on?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Yes, there was one.", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "", "Thank you.

Can you give us an idea on the pricing of turnkey, I mean are we looking at10% more or double and then also on that, kind of the economics of how that works if you go into a new market because obviously there\u2019s a lot of additional investment to do collections in a new market for example and can you give us a little bit more of a rundown on that offering?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Robert, a lot of it depends, I mean we don\u2019t have that right here in front of us.  Obviously the more services they subscribe to, like a Nationwide virtually has subscribed to everything or everything that I can think of.  We have other folks who have subscribed to pieces of it.  We have a fraud department here where we manage fraud for quite a few financials.  When you subscribe to everything, I mean obviously that number goes up dramatically but I do not have that here in front of us.", "Robert Dodd \u2013 Morgan, Keegan & Company", "", "And on the economics, I mean if you were to get for example a turnkey solution in say Australia, just picking a market, where you don\u2019t have a collections business today, I mean what effect would it have if any on margins with investments necessary in those new markets?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Well obviously you know we would process that hopefully all out of the US.  I mean we don\u2019t have a collection business today in the UK, but we certainly have the very good systems that work and basically we\u2019d have to hire the people in Australia unless they would allow us to do it in the US or the Philippines or India or somewhere like that.  The world has gotten so much smaller as you know so if we were, theoretically in a turnkey deal in Australia, we would want to process it out of the US, we\u2019d probably try to have a call center.  It would just depend on the economics of where the call center might be and where collections might be and all that.  It\u2019s pretty scattered around.", "Robert Dodd \u2013 Morgan, Keegan & Company", "", "Thank you, I might follow up with you on that later.  Secondly, on the slowdown at [vital] or TSYS acquiring or whatever I\u2019m supposed to call it now, was that a slowdown in transactions per merchant or was there any kind of reduction in new merchant activations in the quarter?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "You know I don\u2019t really have the detail on that Robert.  You know we still had some pretty good growth in the IP and the SSL virtual net products but [zow] transactions were really down about 10%.  So whether that\u2019s from, I don\u2019t know of any loss of merchants that we had so it\u2019s just a lower transaction volume.", "Robert Dodd \u2013 Morgan, Keegan & Company", "", "Okay, thank you and one final one if I can.  Obviously now you\u2019re going to be looking around perhaps more aggressively on the acquisition front.  Do you have any particular needs you\u2019re looking to fill and what are you seeing on acquisition multiples internationally which have got pretty inflated for a while.", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "That is one positive about this marketplace we have today is, at least in theory, the price of things will come down.  You know we\u2019ve talked a lot of times about ideas or strategies that we had in the M&A business and we\u2019ve got a board meeting next week and while we don\u2019t have anything that\u2019s imminent here, we certainly started looking at acquisitions in a different way because we do have dry powder, we do have the ability to go do some things that we have never been able to do in the past.  ", "We\u2019re not going to rush out and do something just to say we\u2019ve done something, we\u2019re certainly not going to try to buy everything that\u2019s not bolted down as people have in years past so I think you\u2019ll see us be very focused, very controlled, hopefully very smart about what we acquire.  You know obvious thing would be within our business, ways to enhance value at TSYS.", "Robert Dodd \u2013 Morgan, Keegan & Company", "", "Thank you.", "", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "I think Jen we\u2019re going to cut off the Q&A right now.  We know the market is opening and I\u2019d like to go into the concluding remarks.  Needless to say I think you can see that we\u2019re very bullish on our future.  We believe our fundamentals are stronger than ever.  The spin opens up a whole new world of opportunities.  It certainly improves our financial flexibility, it broadens our float and ownership structure.  We think it certainly unlocks value to the TSYS shareholders.  Certainly makes it a much more liquid stock.  We are very excited to have been added to the S&P 500.  ", "We are also excited to be rated triple B by S&P, so we\u2019re moving forward with all that.  I think we\u2019re a serious player in a global consumer and commercial credit business, without the credit risk.  We have long term contracts, we have blue chip clients, we have this rich organic growth that we\u2019ve talked about a lot.  We have a strong cash flow, have a very experienced and aggressive management team.  We have this expanding global reach that is getting bigger and better every day.  ", "Our vision is to be the leading provider of global payment services and we\u2019ve got to do three things strategically to do that.  We\u2019ve got to perfect the basics, and that\u2019s to continue getting better at our operations, continue to get better at the blocking and tackling in this business.  We\u2019ve got to continue to expand internationally, as I said earlier, we\u2019ve got about a 45% VISA Mastercard market share in the US today.  We think we\u2019ve got about a 6-7% global market share.  That\u2019s a long way to go.  And the third thing is we\u2019ve got to invest strategically just like we were talking to Robert a second ago.  We\u2019ve got to be smart about what we do.", "And we\u2019ve got to do three things tactically, we\u2019ve got to continue to do these three things tactically and we think we\u2019re very good at them and that is to be faster and better and cheaper at everything we do.  We just got to be there.  We believe we have the gold standard in technology but we still believe in order to be the leading provider on a global basis, we\u2019ve got to be faster, better and cheaper and that\u2019s our mantra.", "It is a volatile time, I talked about earlier, you know the glass being half empty or half full.  We do believe ours is more than half full and we are very excited about the future.  We appreciate you being with us this morning and thank you for your interest.", "Operator", "", "Thank you ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

(Operator Instructions).", "It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Shawn Roberts. Sir, the floor is yours.", "Shawn Robert", "Thank you. Good morning. This is Shawn Roberts from TSYS Investor Relations. Before we get started with the formal presentation, we'd like to call your attention to the fact that we will be making some forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS' actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in the TSYS reports filed with the SEC.", "At this time, I'd like to turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Philip Tomlinson.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thank you, Shawn, and welcome everybody. I hope everybody is in a great mood today after the big rally yesterday afternoon. We want to talk about the fourth quarter and year, in general, and give you our reports. I hope you've got a chance to read our press release. We know that with all the one-time issues it can be a little complex, but we are certain that we can get through it today.", "Reflecting back on 2007, we think we've got also lot to be proud of. A lot of things have happened and I believe will change the long-term D&A of TSYS in a very positive way. Obviously the first and maybe the biggest in our history is the tax rate spin of the 80% plus of Synovus Financial's ownership of TSYS. We've been asked and we've talked about these options what seems like 20 years and it's finally a reality.", "As you know, one of the real drawbacks for potential investors over the years has been a lack of float creating real limited liquidity as a result of that, a problem that really prevented larger investors from taking a position in TSYS over the years. On January 1st, we put another 160 million shares in public hand and actually increased float over five times. This transaction gives us a much greater flexibility with potential acquisitions and for the first time, we have a real currency and have the ability to lever up our balance sheet.", "An added benefit is our ability to be more aggressive with our share repurchase program which we have in place, and I want to kind of close the chapter on the spin and there is part of that, I would like to thank Richard Anthony and the Synovus management team for taking a long-term view on TSYS and moving forward with that decision. I strongly believe that was a right decision.", "Speaking about TSYS, I had a couple of highlights I want to go for the year. As you know, our latest acquisition TSYS Card Tech in London has had a wonderful year. And we've signed deals with DnB NORD Bank, the largest bank in Norway, Qatar National Bank and Marfin Popular Bank, [Linear Bank] and Universal Bank all in Cyprus. We also signed Tinkoff Credit Systems, which is the first monoline in Russia.", "Our TSYS Europe Group announced the launch of a new rewards card program with Norwich Union and prepaid card program with Lloyds TSB in London. We also signed a lot of other, what we think were pretty significant gift card programs. One of the big things that we announced in the UK in 2007 was the Nationwide deal. Nationwide is the UK's largest building society, is our turnkey deal. We are doing all of their work from soup to nuts as credit collections, customer service settlement. And with that model, it takes them being certainly less than a top ten revenue client to a top ten revenue client. So I think you will see us try to use that model more as we go forward.", "We continue to make good progress with our joint venture in China, with China UnionPay Data, if you will recall we own 44.5% of that joint venture. Our success rate on RFPs record processing over the past several years is nothing short of phenomenal. I would say that we are winning eight or nine items to every ten that we look at.", "We still believe that's a long-term growth opportunity over the next three to five years, but we do believe that long-term, China is going to be one of the places to be for the future, the other probably being India, which we have also entered into. We also extended our contract with Spirit de Mexico in Mexico City. We are very excited and you have heard me say before that Mexico is growing, that was not the case over the past three or four years. Our Acquiring business renewed agreements with Sage Payment Solutions, Moneris Systems up in Canada, Merchant Management Systems, National Processing, they also signed new deals with ClearNet, mPay, The Bancorp Bank and we also signed a credit and recovery deal with Commerce Bank in New Jersey.", "I want to share a few financials with you, but the ones I\u2019m going to share with you and Jimmy, you get into the non-GAAP and GAAP numbers, but the ones that I want share are a non-GAAP, on a non-GAAP basis and excludes the big termination fee that we had in the spin related operating expenses of $14 million in 2007, both of which we view as one time revenue in expense events.", "Total revenues came in at $1.8 billion for the year and $459 million for the fourth quarter up 5% for both periods. And I think you need to factor in the fact that Chase took the processing in-house in July and we certainly do get our licensing fee from this software, but certainly that was something that we had preferred not happened. Net income was $260 million for the year, that\u2019s a 25% increase, it was $67 million for the fourth quarter and that\u2019s a 56% increase on a non-GAAP basis.", "Operating income came in at $368 million for the year, that\u2019s a 25% increase and it came in at $93 million for the fourth quarter, which is a 51% increase. Basic EPS or earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.34 and $1.32 for the year, which exceeded our forecast. Internal or organic growth, which we talked about a lot over the years, for 2007 was right at the 15% mark. And I think Jimmy is going to have some interesting comments on that.", "If you recall, we gave some early guidance prior to the startup of our road show, which was around the 1st of December. And as you saw yesterday's earnings release, we raised our 2008 earnings guidance. We expect that our total revenue will grow in the range of 7% to 9% in 2008 and we also expect net income in basic EPS to grow in the range of 7% to 9%, up from the previously announced 4% to 6%. So, we are very pleased with that. I can't overstate how pleased I am with our ability to control expenses and continue to grow organically, which resulted in the expansion of our operating margin, which was 25.7% for the year.", "Frankly, and I want to brag on us a little bit here with the obstacles we had to overcome in 2007, which I think all of you are very familiar with, I believe it turned into a great year and our team has done a wonderful job of managing through those obstacles and wining though a very, very difficult time at TSYS.", "Just a few more comments on this international business, every year, since we've really gotten serious about international, they continue to perform better and better and certainly 2007 was no exception. Our international revenues increased 33% for 2007. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to be very excited about Card Tech and many opportunities that we expect from that processing platform and that group of people.", "I think our ownership has really helped with some credibility and helped to create a higher level of interest and enthusiasm and we certainly expect big things to happen there.", "I want to now turn it over to Jim Lipham our CFO who will give more financial details. Jimmy?", "Jim Lipham", "Thank you, Phil. And as we go through these financial (inaudible) our performance, I am going to be excluding the one-time spend related calls, as we discuss some of the changes for the quarter end here today. As Phil mentioned, as we exclude the spin expense in 2007, our earnings per share increased 5% to $1.32 percent for the year, which did exceed our earlier forecast.", "First of all I'll add, if look at the income statement and I will add some color to these line items, first of all the electronic payment process and services as you know is our core business with license and arrangements also in that number. And as we compare this '07 year-to-date to '06, keep in mind that I may also exclude the BOA termination fees at $65 million and the $2 million related amortization expense that we incurred in '06 as they will be converted.", "But first of all electronic payment process without the fee was up 2.3% or $6 million for the quarter and 3.4% or $31 million for the year. And this is a specially good growth, when you consider the loss of over $37 million that was in the fourth quarter of '06. And a loss of $249 million for the year that was associated with the de-conversions that occurred since June of '06.", "But our revenue growth has been fueled by, first of all for the internal growth, which Phil stated 15% for the year, it has dropped down to 14% for the quarter and as we go forward we still expected to stay in double-digits, but probably we will not maintain the 15% range as we go forward, but was a bit contributor. In addition we had new business in the quarter that added 2% additional growth and then for the year, the new business along with the acquisitions we added another 12%.", "Our [account on file] numbers are $375 million today. This is about $41 million lower than prior year. The net decrease is a result of the loss of an $105 million accounts from the two large customers that de-converted and offset that by new clients of about $24 million and then the internal growth of our accounts added about $40 million more accounts.", "Our volumes for the quarter were significantly impacted by the conversion of Chase's consumer portfolio to their in-house licensing arrangement. We saw our transactions for the quarter drop 29.8% to $2 billion. Year-to-date transactions are down 5.8% to $9.5 billion and in quarter, authorizations are down 29.4% to $183 billion and then the year-to-date authorizations are down 5.5%, $8.65 million.", "Also in these revenues international revenue increased $19.2 million or 21% for the quarter and a $100.6 million or 33% for the whole year of '07. This increase is a result of various strong growth across all of our geographic regions and run rate is also associated with our international acquisitions which Phil mentioned Card Tech doing a wonderful job, their revenues in '07 were up 24 million more than they were in '06.", "International revenues specifically the revenues from Europe was positively impacted by currency translation adjustment for the quarter and 2007, the quarter being $4.3 million. This includes reimbursable and $17.8 million for the year also includes reimbursables.", "Our value-added service revenues grew $10 million or 4.5% for the year '07 over '06. It represented about 12.8% of our total revenues including the reimbursables, still good growth there.", "Merchant Services, next line, including reimbursables, they are up 2.8% for the quarter and 2.4% for the year, and the revenues before reimbursables were down slightly for the quarter and for the year. For the quarter we dropped $2.1 million, this is mainly attributable to lower transaction growth we saw during the quarter as our transactions grew 3% compared to about a 9% growth that we have for year-to-date, but the year went down $9.2 million and this decrease is a result of several things.", "First of all, we had full process and de-conversions during this period that cost us about $13 million. We had a re-class of about $3 million of revenues as reimbursable items that went through here, witnessing our poor sale tip systems and services we talked about before, managed about $6.4 million for the year. And then we had the class concession that we've talked about before on the renewal of plant contracts that cost us about $7 million.", "All in all, this was offset somewhat by the internal growth that we saw, as I mentioned before, with 9% growth in volumes. It contributed about [$201] million to the listing of pieces acquiring class.", "We do anticipate TSYS acquired revenues to stabilize and fully expect this year to get back to a strong revenue growth rate in '08 of 27% to 29%.", "TSYS Acquiring's operating income for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $17.2 million, a 1% increase over the fourth quarter of '06, and this is mainly due to, we had one-time billing adjustment in the fourth quarter of '06 of a $1 million, and if you restate for that we would be up about 7% on an operating income basis fourth quarter over fourth quarter.", "For the year operating income was $64 million, an 11.6% increase over '06. This again clearly shows a great job that these guys are doing out there controlling expenses and after the de-conversions of challenges they faced last year.", "Operating margins, excluding reimbursable items, have increased to 28% in '07, compared to 24% for the full year '06. TSYS Acquiring is still showing a great service as their availability also is 99.99% for the entire fourth quarter.", "Returning back to consolidated revenue; Other Services, revenue for the fourth quarter is up 11.1% or $5.7 million and then year-to-date, it increased 17.8% or $33 million. Approximately 62% of this year-to-date growth for the quarter is joint venture that Dimension Data, the TCS Managed Services deal that we did, we own 55% of it in Europe, about 62% of the year-to-date growth came from them.", "Loyalty, our company in Atlanta made up another 26% from its growth in this TOP platform, new loyalty business, and remainder of the increase came from growth in our profit product. Reimbursable items increased 15.4% for the quarter and 7.1% for the year, primarily as a result of the [Base II] fees that TSYS acquired and had to be re-classed and the treatment of core accounts that we talked before our debt management company in Atlanta, the new contract where we had to put some revenues into reimbursable items.", "Total revenues for the fourth quarter decreased 9% and increased 1% for the year. As you recall last year's fourth quarter included this one-time termination fee and as Phil mentioned before pro forma basis, both the quarter and year-to-date total revenue lines would be up 5% on pro forma basis.", "As we continue down the page, I would like to make a few comments about our expenses. The expense growth and employment is up $3.1 million to $4.4 million for the quarter, for the year that's $54.4 million growth or 10.4%. Europe, we have really the biggest thing on the year-to-date is, you got Card Tech in there and managed services on a full year basis and they contributed about little over half of that growth of $54 million or $27 million.", "Then Europe had continued rapid growth there, employment cost increased about another $19 million and as they increased their headcount by 89 people. Catalog salaries and contract expense increased $5.4 million for the quarter, but they were down year-over-year $6.8 million as we did less in software development.", "Number six, sequential quarter basis, employment expenses are basically flat, they are up about $789,000 and we think that's real good and holding that number. Part of the reason now, expenses are up as the headcount at the end of December approximately 6,920 people which is up about 172 people more than it was in December of '06.", "Our international-based support services segment experienced a largest increase and 485 people and lot of that has to do with the call center business. This increase was somewhat offset by decreases in our other two segments, domestic based, support services experienced a 4% decline or down 233 people, while our merchant acquiring services saw an 11% decline or 80 people when compared to last year. I think it\u2019s well for how the margin was maintained where they are.", "On the next line office and equipment decreased 26.9% or $25 million to $67.8 million a quarter and decreased 14.1% or $44.8 million for the year. This decrease was a result of the lower software amortization in the MIPS based software and lower equipment rent expense as we talked about during the year. Remember the fourth quarter of last year as a result of portfolio de-conversions we accelerated $11 million amortization in prepaid maintenance write-off related to this mainframe operating system, software operating system that was dedicated solely to the processing of the de-converted portfolios.", "We have a new line spend related expenses and as you know as a result of the spin-off of Synovus we incurred expenses associated with advisory and legal services in connection with the spin assessment and these calls also include the incremental fair value associated with converting Synovus stock options held by TSYS employees to TSYS options. So we expect to incur some stock option expenses and few spend related as we go into '08 as and unwire this commingled processes.", "Other expenses were down 3.5% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and then decreased 10.9% for the year. A large part being a favorable gains over the lower transaction delivery cost TSYS acquiring and the drop in transactions. The reclassification of the cost, court cost that we had for the reimbursables and then we had lower TS2 conversion amortization.", "So overall we get to operating income as we go through here my comments will be excluding the BOA fee and spin expense. So, if you look at operating income is showing down, but if you do the pro forma numbers, we grew a healthy 54% for the quarter and 25% for the year.", "Excluding reimbursables our operating profit margin for the quarter was 25.6 and 25.7 for the full year of \u201907 which is an increase of 422 basis points over the margin in \u201906 of 21.48. As included in the 2008 guidance, we expect our margins to continue to remain in the range of 25% to 27%. EBITDA, as Phil mentioned was $520 million in \u201907 or 9% increase over \u201906. Our EBITDA margin in \u201907 was 36.38% and we expect that level to continue as we indicated in our guidance at the same rate.", "Going forward, we realize operating income and EBITDA metrics would be important in evaluating TSYS financial results we are continuing to report on that for you. And that\u2019s one of the reasons, I guess, when you look at net income growing at the same rate as our revenues, you got to remember on the forecast out in \u201908, we do have interest expanse now instead of interest income and if we had not levered the company there that number would be up quite higher than the [7 to 9] on net income.", "Other income increased $9 million compared to $6 million and again as a direct result of the cash we had available along with the short-term interest increases we saw. Effective tax rate for the quarter was huge at 48.1%, previous discrete item the rates would have been 33.4 as you know we have some spin related cost that were directly tax related, that calls that rate to jump up and last year our rate was 35.5. For the year, when you look at the 2007 you see a 37.8% pre discrete items would be 35.3 compared to 33.8 we had last year in '06.", "We do expect the tax rate as we go forward to remain around 36% pre-discrete item and just note that both years of '06 and '07 have been affected by our State discrete item settlement that impacted these rates.", "Pro forma net income for the quarter increased as we talked about, its 4% or $24 million to $67 million. Pro forma earning per share increased to $0.34 up 55% over the $0.22 per share for the fourth quarter of last year. Year-to-date the earnings increased pro forma 25% or about $52 million and then the pro forma earnings per shares we talked about $1.32, up 25% over the $1.06 in '06.", "We move to balance sheet. I'd like to make a comment there about the unrestricted cash is $211 million after paying the $600 million special dividend in connection with the spin. And like I mentioned we also closed our credit facility in December and we received $168 million loan and left about $252 million on revolver that can be drawn down as need.", "Credit facility does have a five-year term and bears interest at LIBOR plus 60 basis points and we also entered into a loan agreement during the fourth quarter with IBM for $22 million payable over 39 months for the purchase of software.", "On the cash flow statement, you will note significant contribution there again in cash generated from operating activities up $334 million for the year as we continue to generate good cash funding (inaudible). We invested $55 million in property and equipment, this is mainly in hardware. And then we have $51 million in software which is $33 million of purchase software and $18 million developed. We also paid $55 million in regular dividend so far this year and a special dividend of $600 million on December 31 of '07.", "In our unlevered free cash flow analysis, free cash flow was $336.6 million compared to $319 million in '06. I did want to make just a few comments on our guidance numbers that we submitted. We will continue to provide the EBITDA numbers and income from operations and changes that occurred affecting these key measures as we go forward.", "But on November 3rd of '07 guidance, we had depreciation and amortization at $144 million for 2008, which we have increased now to $152 million. This is primarily the result of the signing of contract of the hardware and software purchased in December of '07. And then as we completed the budget process, our operating expenses decreased over November 30th guidance, increase in pro forma operating income by $9 million and our net income by $6 million.", "Lowering end of the revenues was also increased after the budget about $2 million. And then again the spend expenses, they increased $2 million and that's primarily due to the final pricing on the Synovus options as they were converted to TSYS options.", "So with that Phil and I'll turn it back over to you and your comment.", "Shawn Roberts", "Thanks Jimmy, we would like go ahead and open it up for the Q&A session now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our first question is coming from David Scharf. Please state your affiliation, and then pose your question.", "David Scharf - JMP", "Hi, good morning. It's David from JMP. I would like to start with some comments on the overall market environment for many of your larger customers. The internal growth in the mid-teens was surprisingly strong last year, and it sounds like you're still expecting double-digits.", "But can you talk a little bit about some of the largest issuers, particularly in the credit card side. What are you saying in terms of expected account growth? What is their appetite for discretionary spending or spending on value-added services? Obviously, there are a lot of headwinds out there in terms of the market environment for them.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, I think in some ways it's a bit of a mixed bag. We have several clients who were splashed all over Wall Street and the American Banker, and that are having some difficulties. But we believe that the vast majority of our clients are in pretty good shape now. I don't think there's any question that card delinquencies are going to rise, particularly as it relates to the mortgage crisis that we have been in and continue to be in.", "But in some ways that almost helps us with some of these value-added products that we have, such as fraud and special collections, and profit. The national attorney network is a group of people who want to do more authorizations, as opposed to less, through our total debt management. People want to use more of our total access, which is our relational database system, to try to manipulate the data and try to better determine who they think has real issues. So, there's a lot of priority.", "We were, frankly, surprised at the 15%. We were delighted with it. But historically, that number has been lower than that. We think it would be in double-digits, but we certainly don't expect it to be in the 15% range again with the year starting out like it is today. We do think that people will continue to issue credit cards. The right way to deal with delinquencies is to help yourself grow through them.", "The worst thing that you can do is just pull your horns in and do nothing. Historically, at least, we have done pretty well through difficult financial times. I mean we'll keep you plugged in on how this time is going. We had a good holiday season. Our transactions numbers have held up well. We have a lot of products going out the door. Our prospects are good.", "One positive thing, if there is anything positive about this type of environment, is we typically will get more lookers, if you will, or interest in new sales. It's a great time for folks to kind of step back and review the bidding or what they're doing with the processing, because they're just looking for better and more effective and less expensive ways of doing processing, and we think we have some great alternatives there.", "While we are certainly not excited about this economy we're looking at, and we were very hopeful, I mean I was encouraged yesterday afternoon to finally see some progress, we'll believe it's the end of the world. As a matter of fact, I have told our local newspaper here the other day that it looks to me like we have an awful lot of people thinking the glass is half empty and not enough people thinking the glass is half full. I think that we think our glass is better than half full. We are very optimistic and bullish about our position in this marketplace.", "So we're going to stay focused on our business. We love this business. We're excited about it. But we are also very sensitive to our customers because, obviously, it is a tough time for financials. We will not help the products out the door, and we believe that they will continue to push products out the door, new products. We are hoping that the folks who can afford those products will jump on them.", "David Scharf - JMP", "Got you. When you look at your expectations for just organic growth in the existing counts, the installed base, is it much more weighted towards value-added products or you are actually assuming some net card account growth of your existing counts?", "Phil Tomlinson", "We think we will see some net new business come on Board, I mean, it's really a combination of all of that. We will ask a new business, we do believe that the accounts on board today will continue to grow. Albeit, may be not as fast of a pace as it has been, which last year was the 15%. But we do believe these value added products, it will be a very good year for value-added products we believe.", "David Scharf - JMP", "Great. I wonder if I can just shift to couple of other areas, one is on international and which is sounds like, you have been really picking up an awful lot of steam here both in terms of new accounts and win rates. You know, I was wondering in terms of how we should think about more normalized operating margins in that reporting segment realizing there are lot of moving pieces in different operations there, I mean, the trend has been upward in recent years but by quarter-to-quarter it is still all over the place, may be Jim you could sort of address, when there are certain normalizations or headcount or investment spending and this has been kind of stabilize around the 20% level?", "Phil Tomlinson", "I think David, as we go into '08, we are still in the investment stage in several areas in international and so I think that your margins, you all continue to see him for at least another year in the low 20s, high 19 and low 20 area. But I do think that as we go forward with the growth and the new customers coming on Board next year and Europe itself that we will pick up some margin improvement on the European operation itself.", "David Scharf - JMP", "Okay. And is the pricing on many of your newer deals in Europe still more favorable to what you see in the more matured domestic market?", "Phil Tomlinson", "I think it's pretty competitive in Europe and around the world. I mean, we've still got some tough competitors out there and we don't have any slam dunks in this world we live in, we've got our own stripes every day. So, I think, you can see it, you will see it continue to be competitive at least for the short-term. We would like to own it all, as you can imagine, but we haven't got that yet.", "David Scharf - JMP", "Got you. And lastly, I would like to just get a maybe an updated snapshot of how much of your revenue, we all to think about is being truly recurring and by that you are selling a lot of value-added services, the nationwide deal includes a lot of new services like collections and database and so forth more and more variable type revenue, when we think about thesis, business model, I mean, how much of the '08 revenue would we think of is just that sort of recurring per account per month type charge, as opposed to more variable revenue, or a tight merchant dollar line?", "Jim Lipham", "David, this is Jim. I think 2008 revenues, we are talking about recurring. We are talking about our growth on the internal revenues, which is the chart that we normally use with the 15%, and as we talked about, it is going to be a little less than that this coming year. I would say that it is still going to be in the 10% to 12% range, as we get towards the year-end.", "David Scharf - JMP", "Yeah. Maybe I'll be referring to that. I think, really what I'm taking about Jim is the sort of your mix of revenue, how much of the revenue you expect this is truly a sort of recurring per account, per month charge, regardless of transaction volumes, regardless of merchant dollar volume strength?", "Jim Lipham", "I would say about 70%, as we got, as you know a lot of our stuff is kind of bundled account pricing. So, it will be about 70%. That we had a minimum David.", "David Scharf - JMP", "Terrific, thank a lot guys.", "Jim Lipham", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from David Parker. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.", "David Parker - Merrill Lynch", "Good morning, it's David Parker from Merrill Lynch. I was hoping that you could comment on what you have seen that has changed your business, since you gave the previous guidance back in December, and just why you felt comfortable raising the earnings expectations for 2008?", "Phil Tomlinson", "The main reason David is that when we gave that guidance certainly when we went on the road, we had not finished our budget process and we mentioned that out there that we will going to be coming back, and hopefully proving it. We were able to do that, I mean, there was just some changes, and we had some spend related items that went up on us. But then again, our operating cost went down from where we had anticipated as we timed up on the budgets. Improved net income and then again revenues were up slightly on the low end of our range. As more of the function of just getting back and getting finalized on the budget.", "David Parker - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then\u2026", "Jim Lipham", "David, can I add one thing there?", "David Parker - Merrill Lynch", "Sure, go ahead.", "Jim Lipham", "The three of the very top officers in this company were gone for the first three weeks of December, so we just didn't have a chance to, we had the budget and we thought it was in pretty good shape, but we knew it wouldn't be finalized. But we're just out of pocket for almost three weeks. Go ahead.", "David Parker - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thanks. And then, just in regards to the one-time spin cost that are expected in 2008, how should we think about those hitting the P&L, should they, do you expect most of them in the first quarter or are they going to be spread out throughout the year?", "Phil Tomlinson", "I think, most of them to be in the first half as we, because of majority, I mean, it has to do with the stock options and most of that will be worked out in the first half of the year. And we're hoping to get out the biggest thing we've got in the transition cost has to do with the joint payroll function that we run today with Synovus. We have been working our way out of that during the year, pretty fast I hope.", "David Parker - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then final question just in regards to TCS acquiring, you're expecting some stabilizations, I think, you said in third quarter comments that you were expecting to see that potentially increase sequentially. Then we continue to see that you mentioned that transaction authorization volumes were lower than expected in that quarter. What gives you comfort that we're actually going to get back to that high single-digit growth rate in that business as we move into 2008?", "Phil Tomlinson", "I guess there's a little bit of that comment in the third quarter is that they had a little more of this compressional pricing and above. Also the volumes, as I've mentioned, are 3% and they've been growing at a higher rate. Now, as we go forward. We're anticipating that volumes from the transactions are growing at 9%, but we're also hoping that this new business, which is going to come on Board, is going to cause the revenues year-over-year to grow at around 7% to 9%. So, we're planning on some new growth, as well as no more drop in the volumes, which you're seeing.", "David Parker - Merrill Lynch", "So, what attributed to that slowdown, 2%, 3% growth in the fourth quarter? Was it the D conversions or just a higher pricing pressure or some other you are seeing?", "Phil Tomlinson", "You know it's a real D conversion during the fourth quarter. From last year, we had most of them pretty much completed, but it could be the market or the volumes that they saw were just a little less during the fourth quarter.", "David Parker - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from Adam Frisch. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.", "Glenn Waldorf", "Hi, it's actually [Glenn Waldorf]. Congratulations on another good quarter. I just got a good question on U.S. card issuing business. Assuming a large part of market share gains are behind us, many but not all of large banks have outsourced the processing. Where is the next leg of growth coming from in the U.S.? I mean, is it more cross selling to big banks or is it new outsourcing opportunities to the smaller banks, and do you have a sense of proportions, 50/50 from each? Thanks.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, Glenn, it's really, I mean, it's some of those. I mean, we think there is an awful lot of opportunity out there with the mid-sized small banks. We have not even tried to -- today we have not really gotten serious about the credit union business, although, we do have some very, very large credit unions. We have the largest in the world, and we have several other large credit unions.", "There own a lot of banks, and it's still processed in-house at a lot of the large banks. Frankly, as I said earlier, we think times like we experienced right now are typically pretty good, pretty fertile hunting for us if you will because people, who are under lot of pressure tend to, want to look around and see what their options are, and you could name just any large bank that you wanted to name that done process with us today. We would think that they would be a candidate.", "And we will continue to do well in, I think, Canada and Europe and as I said, Mexico is growing but think about credit unions, think about small or medium banks, think about folks that our processing in house, and think about financial their processing with our competitors. I mean, we don't have a 50% market share yet, so we have got a long way to go. We have only got, as best we can determine on a global basis. We have only got about a 6% market share.", "Glenn Waldorf", "Great, thanks. Just turning to Europe, regarding the recent moves by the European Commission on interchange regulation and with the prospects of regulation over there, where banks will presumably make lower returns on the card business. Is this concerning when you think about the possibility of the impact on account growth or pressure, and pushback on your fees for those banks.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, I think that any new or additional regulation concerns us because just like in the U.S. some of these congressional hearings that you have seen over the last year, all of that concerns us because we all are in this business together one way another, whether we like it or not and certainly, we don't like to see pricing regulations. So, we think, yes what that is. So it does concern us. We haven't seen any ill effects of it yet. It is not something that it seems to be a life or death topic with both we are talking with right now.", "Glenn Waldorf", "Okay. And a final question. If you had to take this 15% organic growth, I mean like it vary from 15 or 12, both, so say it's 15. How would you proportion that between x percent is growth of the existing customers. The next certain percent is new customers brought on and then offset to that is, your customer attrition. How would you sort of bucket that, proportion of that 15% growth?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Glenn, I think you maybe misunderstanding the 15%. When we talk about organic growth, you should look at it very much like the retailers call same-store sales.", "Glenn Waldorf", "Okay.", "Phil Tomlinson", "In other words, it's a new business that we signed this year is not included in that.", "Glenn Waldorf", "Understood. Okay. Thanks. Fair enough. I appreciate it.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from Paul Bartolai. Please state your affiliation and pose your question.", "Paul Bartolai - Credit Suisse", "Yes, good morning. This is Paul from Credit Suisse. First question, just to clarify on the merchant segment, you talked about the slowdown in transaction growth to 3% in the fourth quarter. But sounds like you are still comfortable with kind of high single-digit growth for 2008. Can you give us some color on what you are assuming, I mean you kind of assuming that the pricing in transactions stay at the 4Q level and some of the new stuff that's been signed get to 7% or 9%? What are you basically assuming for the core business?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Paul, I think that's why this is the level that we got in the fourth quarter. We might be a little bit ahead of our sales on anniversary-ing these price concessions and the de-conversions. But the fourth quarter revenues should be a little more indicative, going forward. And we anticipate new business is going to make the revenues grow.", "Paul Bartolai - Credit Suisse", "Okay. And just on the pricing, was it new stuff that was signed or is it just the stuff that was still lapping from previous signings?", "Phil Tomlinson", "It was stuff that was lapping from previous signings. There was nothing new in the quarter.", "Paul Bartolai - Credit Suisse", "And are there any big signings coming up, I mean do you expect to see any further compression on pricing going forward?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, I mean, you heard me say before that we are always under pricing pressure. We do have some deals that are signed and we hope that these new clients will at some point let us announce it. We have not converted them yet, but we have factored that in and we think we will add additional clients as the year goes on.", "Paul Bartolai - Credit Suisse", "Okay, great. And looking at the payment processing segment, I mean we kind of have similar type of question there. I mean, when we look at growth for '08, how much of this stuff that is already signed and just needs to be loaded up, and how much is you just kind of assuming some level of new account or new business signings? And maybe just some comments on the backlog of what's to be loaded up this year?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Paul, I think for our '08 numbers, we didn't really other than class that we already know about, we didn't put anybody else in there, although we did put some stretch bills in for revenue growth. So most of the growth is really from stretching what we have and increasing value added, and this type of stuff that we already got.", "Paul Bartolai - Credit Suisse", "Okay, great. And just final question on the spin-related cost, is there some component of the '08 cost, that is ongoing?", "Phil Tomlinson", "There will be a small part that'll carry on through the end of the year '08, but after that, the dollar should be watched out.", "Paul Bartolai - Credit Suisse", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from [Glenn Green]. Please state your affiliation and pose your question.", "Glenn Green - Oppenheimer", "Thank you. Good morning. Affiliation is Oppenheimer. The first question goes back some where to the first question. But just want to get a little bit of clarity on the economic sensitivity, the business model within the payment processing business. Many of the predominantly account per month based business model, transaction based, volume based, just a little bit of clarity there, I have a view on it but I just want to hear from you?", "Phil Tomlinson", "It certainly is not. We get paid the same thing going for a $2 transaction as we do a $20,000 transaction. So when you think about the economics that people slowdown buying, what we worry about is, will they slow down the number of transactions. We don't fit really.", "At least historically, we have not seen transactions slow down an awful lot. They do slow down somewhat. But certainly the bottom does not drop out of transactions. It may drop out of the dollar amount. We also have some large deals that are priced on a bundle basis that we get the same prices per account, per active account per month, regardless of whether they have a transaction or not. And so it's kind of a combination of those two. But none of it is based on the amount of a dollar spent.", "Glenn Green - Oppenheimer", "Okay. And what have you seen in previous cycles where the credit card environment we started seeing delinquency and charge-offs like you are hearing from all the biggest, a lot of the big issuers, what was sort of the impact on your business?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, again, I am speaking historically it was not nearly as negative as you might think it would be. And I think it's primarily because we are pricing on transactions as opposed to the amount of transaction. And even more so today than say 2001, or earlier, recessions is the fact that we have a lot of this bundle pricing. In really good times, we sort of dislike bundle pricing. In times like we're experiencing right now, we think bundle pricing is probably going to be positive for us.", "Glenn Green - Oppenheimer", "And then just a question the stability of your book of business and there has been a few of your sort of high profile customers, potentially looking to sell their credit card portfolios. And I mean sure you know which names I referring to. I just wanted to get a little bit of sense on what you are thinking about with that, and what you might be able to tell us to get us comfortable with the stability of your book of business?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, I think you're absolutely right, we've got a couple out there, private label deals that at release have announced they are considering it and we've had all the appropriate conversations that you can have with our client like that. We have great relationships. Even if they do so, I think there is a good chance we'll continue to process it.", "But the fact the matter is that's the one thing that keeps us up at night and as this consolidation is merger and acquisition business with our clients. When we go back and we spend hours talking about the [BOA] deal, I mean if you recall when we had just signed new 10-year agreement with Banc of America and seven months later, they announced that they're going to leave us because of the M&A deal. Now we got paid a lot of money as a result, but certain it was a not a good think for TCS.", "Historically, we've been, I think, a net winner on mergers and acquisitions. But that is when people would say Phil what keeps you up at night. That is what keeps me up at night as we worry about it.", "Glenn Green - Oppenheimer", "And how you sort of reflect a better factor that into your '08 expectations at this point?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, this is not factored in because we don't know. Certainly, we have long-term contracts with everybody you might have been speaking about, and we had penalties. But again that's not what we are. If one of them does actually sell, we are going to do our very best to retain that business and I think we have at least a 50% chance in that. I really think better of making that happen in. So much of just there is (inaudible).", "Glenn Green - Oppenheimer", "Okay. And then just an easier question is, if you could just help me understand the strong retail account growth in the quarter? Are there any big conversions that came on?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Yes, there was one.", "Glenn Green - Oppenheimer", "Okay. Thank you.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Robert Dodd. Please state your affiliation and then pose your question.", "Robert Dodd - Morgan Keegan", "Hi, this is Robert, Morgan Keegan. Couple of questions. First, on the turnkey product that you are offering now obviously nationwide is the first. Average revenue per account that you get today on your telecom base is 350 annualized. Can you give us an idea on the pricing of turnkey? I mean are we looking at 10% more or we looking at double? And then also on that kind of the economics of how that works, if you go into a new market, because obviously there is a lot of additional investment to do collections in the new market, for example. Can you give us a little more run down on that offering?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Robert, a lot of it is, I mean, we don't have that right in front of us. Obviously, the more services they subscribe to like a nationwide virtually has subscribed to everything, or everything that I can think off. We have other folks who have subscribed to pieces of it. We have a fraud department here where we manage fraud for quite a few financials. When you subscribe to everything, I mean obviously that number goes up dramatically. But I do not have that here in front of us.", "Robert Dodd - Morgan Keegan", "And on the economics, I mean if you were to get, for example, a turnkey solution and say Australia, just picking a market, where you don't have a collections business today. What affect would it have if any on margins with investments necessary in those new markets?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, obviously we would process at hopefully all out of the U.S. I mean we don't have a collection business today in the UK, but we certainly have the systems that, very good systems that work. And basically we would have to hire the people in Australia unless they would allow us to do it in the U.S. or the Philippines or India or somewhere like that. The world has gotten so much smaller as you know. So if we were theoretically in a turnkey deal in Australia, I mean we would want to process it out of the U.S. We're probably trying to have a call center, just depend on the economics of where the call center might be and where collections might be and all that. It is pretty scattered around.", "Robert Dodd - Morgan Keegan", "Thank you. I might follow up with you on that later.  Secondly, on the slowdown at (inaudible) or TCS Acquiring or whatever we are supposed to call it. Was that kind of a slowdown in transactions per merchant or would they have any kind of reduction new merchant activations in the quarter?", "Phil Tomlinson", "I don't really have the detail on that, Robert. We still had some pretty good in the IP ant the SSL virtual net products. The Dow transactions were really down about 10%. Whether that's from I don't know if any loss of merchants that we had, so just a lower transaction volume.", "Robert Dodd - Morgan Keegan", "Okay, thank you. One final one if I can. Obviously now you are going to be looking around perhaps more aggressively on the acquisition front. Do you have any particular need you are looking to fill-in? And I mean what are you seeing on acquisition multiples internationally which has got pretty inflated for a while?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, that is one positive about this marketplace we have today is at least in theory the price of things will come down. We've talked a lot of times about ideas that we -- our strategy that we had in the M&A business and we've got Board meeting next week and while we don't have anything as imminent here, we've certainly started looking at acquisitions in a different way, because we do have to [drop out or now], we do have the ability to go do some things we have never been to do in the past.", "We are not going to rush out and do something just to say we've done something. We certainly not going to start to buy everything, this is not bolted down as people have in years past. So, I think you will see us to be very focused, in control, and hopefully smart about what we acquire. The obviously things would be within our business ways to enhance value at TSYS.", "Robert Dodd - Morgan Keegan", "Okay. Thank you.", "Phil Tomlinson", "I think we're going to cut off the Q&A right now. We know the market is opening and I'd like to go into the concluding remarks. Needless to say, I think you can see that we are very bullish on our future. We believe our fundamentals are stronger than ever. The spin will opens up a whole new world of opportunities, certainly improves our financial flexibility. It broadens our float and ownership structure.", "We think it certainly unlocks value to the TSYS' shareholders, certainly makes it a much more liquid stock. We are very excited to have been added to the S&P 500. We are also excited to be rated BBB by S&P. So, we are moving forward with all of that.", "I think we are serious player in a global consumer and commercial credit business without the greater risk. We have long-term contracts. We have blue-chip clients. We have this rich organic growth that we've talked about a lot. We have strong cash flow. We have a very experienced and aggressive management team. We have this expanding global rich that is getting bigger and better everyday.", "Our vision is to be the leading provider of global payment services. We have got to do three things strategically to do that. We have got to perfect the simplicity to continue get better at our operations, continue to get better at the blocking and tackling in this business. We have got to continue to expand internationally. As I said earlier, we have got about a 45% Visa and Master card market share in the U.S. today. We think we've got about a 6% to 7% global market share, that's a long way to go.", "And then the third thing as we've got to invest strategically just like we were talking to Robert just a second ago, we got to be smart about what we do. And we've got to do three things tactically. We've got to continue to do these three things tactically, and we think we are very good at them. And that is to be faster and better and cheaper at everything we do. We just got to be there. We believe we have the gold standard in technology. But we still believe in order to be the leading provider on a global basis that we've got to be faster, better, and cheaper, that's our mantra.", "It is a volatile time I talked about earlier the glass being half empty or half full. We do believe ours is more than half full, and we are very excited about the future. We appreciate you being with us this morning and thank you for your interest.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call.

At this time all participants have been placed on a listen only mode and we will open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation.  It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host Shawn Roberts, Director of Investor Relations.  Sir, the floor is yours.", "Shawn Roberts", "Before we get started I want to call you attention to the fact that we\u2019ll be making forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS.  These forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainties.  Factors that cause TSYS\u2019 actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in TSYS\u2019 reports filed with the SEC.  At this time I\u2019d like to turn the floor over to our chairman and CEO Phil Tomlinson.  ", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Welcome everybody that\u2019s on the phone.  We appreciate you being with us this morning.  I know a lots going on.  I\u2019m very excited about this first quarterly earnings call that we\u2019re doing as a fully independent publically traded company and we\u2019re really pleased with the way we\u2019ve started in 2008.  As you saw in the earnings release last night we\u2019ve done a good job of meeting our goals for the quarter.  Total revenues increased 8% quarter-over-quarter, international revenues grew 28%, operating income on a GAAP basis increased 1% and on a non-GAAP basis which excludes the $6.9 million in non-recurring spend expenses which is included in operations, operating income increased 9% quarter-over-quarter.  Basic EPS on a GAAP basis came in at $0.29 per share and adjusted for the 2% or the $0.02 per share of non-recurring spend expenses we wound up for the quarter at $0.31 which is exactly where we planned on being.  ", "Some highlights of the first quarter were we signed a new contract with Standard Bank of South Africa to provide card issuing, merchant acquiring and related payment services.  Standard Bank has a huge global presence operating in 18 countries in Africa, in 20 countries on other continents including the key financial centers in Europe, the Americas and Asia.  We are also very excited about a new relationship with Corporate Lodging Consultants and the recent launch of a very large prepay program.  This program already has over $9 million accounts on our system and is growing well ahead of forecast.  We also announced the launch of Engine which is a new business paradigm that makes it easy for TSYS clients to efficiently and thoroughly manage complex payment related business needs with a point and click ease.  Engine is not a conversion to a new platform, what it does is it just adds a new level of business intelligence that\u2019s made available through analytical based services giving our banks or institutions a total view of their portfolio in order to make actionable well informed decisions on growth opportunities and overall risk which is a huge issue in today\u2019s time.  I described it as it\u2019s like adding a new and thicker layer of icing on our cake which is TS2.  ", "Our TSYS loyalty company announced the development of an innovative new product that calculates points and rewards for customers who describe to multiple products with a single financial institution and these products include but certainly not limited to direct deposit or checking accounts, credit cards, mortgages, insurance and CDs.  It\u2019s a way to kind of do the total package for loyalty, we\u2019re very excited about that.   It\u2019s generated some good interest from the banking community.  ", "Our healthcare initiative is starting to pay off a bit.  We announced the successful market launch of what we think is the industry\u2019s most advanced benefits payment system and Fringe Benefits Management Company out of Tallahassee Florida is the first third party administrator to use this solution and it offers their subscribers the ability to pay with multiple healthcare tax advantage accounts such as they can use credit cards or other cash accounts through a single card.  Also I hope you saw the press release where after a lot of speculation about what Target was going to do we did resign Target to a new long term contract and we\u2019re very proud that during the quarter we also completed successful conversions of the Capital one and Nationwide portfolio in the UK and as we talked about in the last couple of quarters we did open up the call centers in the UK and we have some start up expenses there which Jimmy Lipham will talk to you more about in detail in just a minute.", "We believe our value added products are continuing to play a more significant role for our clients during these tough economic times, they add tremendously to our customers\u2019 ability to analyze their portfolios, to make good, strong, smart decisions and to reduce risk.  Value added has continued to be a solid contributor to our revenues and it makes up about 12% of our total revenues today.  TSYS Acquiring Solutions had a good first quarter, they continue to maintain strong operating results as they do a really good job of managing expenses while seeking additional and new revenues.  Their business was up slightly during the quarter, operating income increased to 26% in Q1 over Q1 07.  ", "That\u2019s sort of the highlights of the quarter.  I\u2019d like to turn it over now to Jim Lipham who will give you a lot more details about what\u2019s going on here at TSYS.", "James B. Lipham ", "I\u2019d asked everyone to take a look at the income statement that was included in the press release as I give a little more color to each of these line items.  We\u2019ll start off first of all with electronic payment processing and as you can see there we\u2019re up 5% for the quarter that was $11 million.  If we excluded the two main deconversions that we had from the first quarter of last year being Chase and BB&T you\u2019d see this revenue growing at 14%.  Our revenue growth has really been fueled by great internal growth as before. It\u2019s up 11% for the month, this is the same client processing revenues as we talked about before.  For the quarter last year it was up 12, this quarter it\u2019s up 11 so it\u2019s maintaining its growth pattern.  New business added 4% of our revenue growth also.", "On the account on file basis at the end of the quarter we\u2019re down to 365 million accounts which is down 58 million since the end of the first quarter of 07.  This net decrease is mainly contributed, it\u2019s about 130 million accounts total but Chase is roughly 91 million of that as they converted into an in house licensing platform and then we had some other deconversions in regard to Exante Bank on the prepaid platform left us at the end of 07.  And of course, I mentioned BB&T a while ago.  These losses were offset by new customers that came on board for 18 million accounts and then the internal growth adding another 54 million accounts.  So we continue to show good growth internally.  Our volumes for transactions and authorizations were impacted pretty strongly by Chase as for the quarter they were down 29% as far as transactions to $1.8 million and down 29% to $1.6 billion.  But, when you exclude the transactions that pertain to Chase you\u2019d see growth of 8.5% in transactions quarter-over-quarter and growth in authorizations of 9%.  ", "On an international basis our revenues increased $14.8 million or 28% over last year.  We have had some good conversions over in Europe since March of 07 as we\u2019ve added Cap One UK, Nationwide, CompuCredit UK and Barclay card.  International revenues were also favorably impacted by a currency adjustments of about $1.6 million.  Phil mentioned value added services and they were kind of flat quarter-over-quarter but when you restate the first quarter of last year pulling Chase out of there it would show a 12% growth quarter-over-quarter so we feel real good about the growth in value added as we go forward.  ", "Merchant services, slight growth there, the next line item at 3%.   Included in merchant services is the revenues also from GP Net in Japan and just to highlight there they had about a 30.7% growth or $1.5 million and part of that had to do with CPA but half of it had to do with good growth.  If you look at their volumes over there the base one, base two volumes are really growing as base one is up 38% from first quarter of 07 and the base two volumes we\u2019re seeing a 19.5% growth there.  So, things are starting to happen on the domestic front in Japan.  ", "TSYS Acquiring, revenues for full reimbursed [inaudible] are down slightly for the quarter but when you exclude the impact of the decoversions and the non-recurring revenues from the first quarter last year of Visa, their pro forma revenues increased 2.6%.  For the quarter volumes are growing at 4% still down a little bit from where they were for the fourth quarter last year but we do anticipate revenues to stabilize over the remainder of 08.  Phil mentioned their operating results and they are very strong for the first quarter of 08 as operating income was up $15 million or 25% over the first quarter of 07.  Our margins increased to 27% compared to 22% in 07.  Then TSYS Acquiring also had a great operating service quarter both front end and back end as they maintained 99.9% availability.  So, outstanding performance there.", "Looking back on consolidated other services, revenue as you see for the quarter is up $4 billion or 8% and this is mainly coming from the increased call center business both domestic which is Charming Shoppes and Bank of America mainly as well as a new and existing European business with RBC Nationwide and Barclay.  So, those are the big increases there.", "Reimbursable items increased 18% for the quarter.  This is primarily around the treatment of the court costs as reimbursable items for Total Debt Management.  This continues to be a shift from what we\u2019ve done in the past as we changed that contract last year.  Total revenue for the first quarter, they\u2019re up $32.1 million if you restated the first quarter prior year for the deconverting revenues you\u2019d see a growth there also of 14% year-over-year.  ", "As we continue down the page, looking at salaries and other personnel expenses you\u2019ll see growth of $8 million or 5.6%.  Europe\u2019s rapid growth of revenue impacted employment costs of about $7 million as we\u2019ve seen the headcount grow by 807 people.  Sequentially we\u2019ve grown about 627 people during this quarter.  Our capitalized salaries and contract expenses helped offset that some as this has grown during the quarter.  I might mention on a sequential basis also that this category is up $2.6 million and 1.8% for the quarter.  Our consolidated headcount the end of March is approximately 7,550 people that\u2019s up 744 people from March of 07.  And, as I noted before on the international we\u2019ve added about 807 people as we\u2019ve opened these new call centers during the quarter for their newly converted call center business there.  This 807 people was offset somewhat by a decrease in merchant acquiring headcount of around 67 people.  ", "IT equipment you see increase there of 8% or $5.5 million to $73 million.  This increase is a result of a new software agreement we signed, a leasing agreement with IBM in December as well as increased MIPS capacity which we have put in place which drives greater software amortization as we go forward so those were the real reasons for that.  Then, you see the spend related expense as we\u2019ve talked before, we had some advisory fees hit in the first quarter as well as the converting of the Sonova stock options held by TSYS employees to TSYS stock options.  You might make note that we have not recognized or seen any significant changes in our ongoing operating expenses due to the spend outside of these one-time items.  The other expense line is down 10% year-over-year or $5 million and that\u2019s attributable to lower transaction volumes within TSYS Acquiring.  The reclassification of these court costs to reimbursable as well as lower TS2 conversion amortization.  ", "Operating income mentioned on a GAAP basis was [inaudible].  I\u2019m going to talk to you in regards to a pro forma number without the spend related expenses since they\u2019re one-time non-recurring.  Operating income grew without the spend related expenses 9.3% for the quarter.  When you exclude reimbursable our margin for the quarter was 26% and as we stated in our 08 guidance we continue to expect our margins to remain in the range of 25 to 27%.  Evident was $133 million on a non-GAAP basis for a 7% increase over 2007\u2019s $124 million. Our Evident margin for the first quarter was 36.91% compared to 2007\u2019s 36.17 and we expect that level to continue as indicated in our guidance.  Going forward we realize that operating income and Evident metrics will be important in evaluating our financial performance and we\u2019ll continue to report these amounts to the public. ", "Other income it decreased $4.6 million for the first quarter and as you know interest expense associated with our long term debt arrangements as well as decreased amounts of cash cause that to drop.  Our average debt rate for the quarter was 4.355%.  Tax rate was impacted by some non-deductable spend expenses and some discreet items of about $1.1 million made our effective tax rate 36.9% compared to 37.9 last year.  And, we typically anticipate our effective tax rate to be around 36% pre discreet items so that\u2019s all in line.  Pro forma net income for the quarter increased 7.5% or $4 million to $62 million and our pro forma earnings per share increased to $0.31 up 7.4% over the 29% first quarter last year.  I want to back up and make one comment about equity income of investments, a big increase there for the quarter and that increase is strictly coming from Cut Data our and closing out some investment securities that they had so that will normalize itself this next quarter and be back in line.  So all that increase was closing out some investments they had and had some gains.", "We\u2019ll flip over to the segment information, I want to highlight a little bit on the international based services.  As we\u2019ve talked about they\u2019ve invested in the conversions of two major clients Cap One and Nationwide along with the conversion of two more portfolios in Europe operations.  With these expenses were budgeted, they are in line with budgets and their significant portions have to be expensed as incurred amount to approximately $3 million.  We expect operating results to improve significant as 2008 progresses and we look forward to the roughly $28 million of revenue to be generated by these spend expenses in the first quarter.  ", "When you compare international Q1 07 we also had a bad refund in 07 that reflected in operating expenses of $3.3 million and is not present in 08.  So, sequential quarter international operating income is down as a result of start up expenses and some one off revenues in December associated with the seasonality of holidays.  When you adjust Q1 for the startup expenses, the operating margin would have been 15.5% compared to the 14.7 we saw in Q1 of 07 when the back tax benefit is removed.  I\u2019m hoping that explains our operating margin drop there for the first quarter of 08.", "If you flip to the balance sheet I\u2019d just like to mention a few items there.  As you can see our unrestricted cash of $243 million and it\u2019s up $32 million since December.  Pretty good growth there.  The current debt down in the liabilities section of $71.7 million that was the increase of $65 million as the note in Europe for the Card Tech acquisition was $65 million and it comes up in January of 09 so it got re-classed to current.  During the quarter we also in the equity section you\u2019ll see we purchased 500,000 shares of treasury stock at the cost of $11 million.  Those are the major changes there.  We did also fund our employee benefit accruals in the first quarter and that was about $32 million we used there.", "When you look at the cash flow statement on the next page you\u2019ll note significant contribution cash generated of $100 million for the quarter as we continue to generate a significant amount of cash to fund investing and financing activities.  We also \u2013 down below you\u2019ll see where we invested $14 million in profit and equipment mainly in hardware and then we had $4.8 million in software which we split between purchased and developed.  We also paid $14 million in regular dividends so far for this year.  So very good cash flow.", "With that Phil I\u2019ll turn it back over to you.", "Philip W.

What is the \u2013 I know there were a couple of one-time expenses but will there be other one-time expenses going on in 08? And what is the margin profile look at for that division going forward?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Certainly the big expense of starting up these call centers and the conversion expense has been taken care of and I don\u2019t think that would be a real surprise to anyone.  As Jimmy said just a second ago we think those margins will get back and become normalized as we go forward through the year.  We\u2019ll continue to open up some offices here and there outside of the US but we don\u2019t have any significant expenses planned at this point?  Jimmy, if you want to add anything to that.", "James B. Lipham ", "I would add Phil that the normal operations in Europe are still running at 20 to 21% margins and of course, when you put the one-time expenses to it and you put the opening of the other international offices it\u2019s dragging it down right now.  But, the normal processing operations were still running at the margins we\u2019ve talked about in the past.  ", "Elizabeth Grausam \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "This is Liz, sorry I just hoped on.  Also on your M&A program can you give us any update around how you\u2019re viewing the European marketplace from an M&A standpoint?  And, if there\u2019s anything on the horizon that you\u2019ve been looking at?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I don\u2019t think we have anything that we can talk about this morning.  We\u2019ve certainly been doing a lot of looking.  There\u2019s a lot of opportunities there, we have looked at several things that we have decided to pass on.  We\u2019ve got several that we\u2019re taking a look at right now and they\u2019re not far enough along for us to really be talking about but we\u2019re very active in that area.", "Operator", "", "Our next question is coming from Adam Frisch.  Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question.", "Analyst for Adam Frisch \u2013 UBS", "We saw an announcement lately of MasterCard building up its IPS offering.  What do you think about the potential for associates to move further in to traditional credit and debit card processing markets?  And, what do you think of the potential impact this could mean for your business overall?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "That\u2019s a hard question.  I think certainly I believe MasterCard and Visa will both be looking at other services they can provide.  We think obviously this is a pretty unique business that we\u2019re in and I think there\u2019s a good reason why there\u2019s not a lot of people in it. It is a hard business to be successful at and it\u2019s hard to get really good at it and we think we\u2019ve done that over the past 30 years.  As an example that\u2019s really the reason that the folks at Cut Data and China UnionPay wanted us as a partner is because of the vast knowledge base that we\u2019ve built up on how to deal with customers and how to manage SLAs and contracts and new business and firewalls between competing customers and all of that.  So while I think they have certainly got the cash or the currency to go do most anything they want to do I would think that they would probably think twice before they were to try to get in to our business.  But, certainly there\u2019s nothing to stop that.  I think probably the biggest issue that someone like that might have is we are basically card brand agonistic and I think that Visa and MasterCard both would have a hard time at least mentally processing each others cards and they may be able to get over that, I don\u2019t know, you\u2019d have to ask them.  But certainly I think they\u2019re just like us, they\u2019re looking for more and better services to provide.", "Analyst for Adam Frisch \u2013 UBS", "And in this environment what would you say is an easier \u201csell\u201d to an issuer?  Is it an outsource service that you provide that they don\u2019t use from you that they do in house or use from somebody else?  Or, is it a cross sell to one of your existing customers who is already using a TSYS product but sell them another one instead?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, I think that the cross sell is always easier because they know you and they\u2019re on your system and you\u2019re selling these value added services and as times get difficult people tend to buy more of these services particularly in these fraud areas and risk areas, collection tools, those sort of things.  We\u2019ve always maintained that the sell cycle in this business was very long.  I mean, I would say in most cases it\u2019s a year to 18 months.  So, to sell somebody and to move them is probably a two year transaction.  That\u2019s why we sort of go in spells because it does take so long to move folks.  We are very good at moving them but sometimes when you\u2019re trying to sell particularly to people in house it can be a tough sell and it\u2019s usually a tough sell primarily because the cost accounting is a little skewed and it\u2019s not very good.  I mean, we can tell folks exactly what it\u2019s going to cost and what it\u2019s going to cost on a future basis and most people that we\u2019re dealing with who are processing in house really don\u2019t have a good handle on what it\u2019s costing them, you know it\u2019s allocated expenses and issues like that.  But, we do believe strongly in times like today it does cause people who have been very adamant about in house processing to step back and take a look at any options that are available to help them reduce and contain costs long term.", "Analyst for Adam Frisch \u2013 UBS", "My last question, just real quick just a follow on to Liz\u2019s question, regarding Europe, I know in the past in the US when you were kind of acquisition constrained you had said you looked to buy a domestic debit network, weren\u2019t able to.  Now, in Europe we have everything going on with SEPA and all the domestic schemes looking to do something sort of integrate across Europe wide.  Could a acquisition of a domestic scheme in Europe be within the range of possibility for you guys?", "Philip W.

Tomlinson", "Well, you heard Jimmy\u2019s comments on the new accounts that we\u2019ve added.  Our transaction growth continues to be really maybe better than what we expected.  We\u2019ve talked about this business and secular trends in this business that it\u2019s virtually recession proof and I was going to talk about this in my wrap up but I\u2019ll talk about it now.  We continue to see that although it\u2019s rather interesting, as best as we can tell right now our average ticket size is actually up which kind of surprises us.  But then we think a little bit about maybe the price of gasoline and other things have maybe pushed that up a little bit but our transactions are in good shape.  Our customers, we\u2019ve got a couple that have publically said that they\u2019ve got some issues but in general I think our customer base seems to be in pretty good shape from what we\u2019re seeing.  They\u2019re still adding new accounts.  Jimmy, you\u2019ve got those numbers right there in front of you?", "James B.

Tomlinson", "So we\u2019ve got good growth in the numbers.  We don\u2019t believe anything is going to stop there or at least we haven\u2019t felt the affect of it.  Like I said we mentioned this prepaid deal that I really can\u2019t tell you anymore about it but we think this thing could be really large, larger than it is.  As a matter of fact I was just handled a note and the 9 million accounts that was on my screen this morning has now increased to 11 million accounts and I think my information was about a week old so you can see the increase that we\u2019re seeing there.  We\u2019re feeling pretty good.  I think I would be na\u00efve to sit here and tell you we\u2019re not worried about our customers.  I mean, we\u2019re seeing our customers in the Wall Street everyday and the American Banker with difficult numbers and I think that we worry about that having an effect on us.  To date, it really hasn\u2019t had a great effect but what we worry about more than anything and we\u2019ve said this on multiple occasions on calls like this is consolidation.  One of these customers will get in trouble in a corporate way and they\u2019ll wind up selling their card program or they\u2019ll wind up selling their company and we struggle with that.", "Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse\t", "What about sales cycles in general, have they been extended at all in this environment?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "", "No.  If you can get people\u2019s attention in this environment we\u2019ve got a couple of prospects that we\u2019ve been working with that have obviously had so much difficulty in their bank that they\u2019ve had to kind of refocus on whether the bank might survive long term and we\u2019re continuing to sell in to those clients and I think the card business is doing pretty good.  I don\u2019t believe that the sales cycle \u2013 you know, six months from now I may tell you that is a fact.", "Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse\t", "Then the transaction and authorization volumes looked about kind of in line with what you expected.  I guess you haven\u2019t seen any change in the consumers I guess transaction behavior?  I know you talked about average ticket size up but anything you\u2019ve seen recently that would tell you the consumer is slowing down the amount of transactions that they\u2019re doing?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "No, not as of quarter end.  I mean we obviously like the transactions to be up 15% and maybe that is a slowdown but they\u2019re up over 8% right now and we feel good about that.  We have been a little surprised that the average ticket is up.

We think we\u2019re in good shape, we think we\u2019re in good shape with the length of our contracts.  We don\u2019t have any major contracts coming up in the next year or so.

In that business as you know, the real sweet spot of that business is the National Attorney Network and some of those deals that we cut there where if you\u2019re going to be in the collection business and you wind up paying the expenses up front it\u2019s an investment on the front end, you get a great return on the back end and that\u2019s where we\u2019re at in that cycle with those guys.

I mentioned in Europe that the normal operations were still in the low 20s as far as margins go and obviously depressed in the first quarter with the startup expenses.  You had some one-time stuff in the first quarter of 07 with the [BAT] about $3 million worth of [BAT] refund tax.  We expect Europe to get back to the normal level of margins around the low 20s and hopefully as we go forward the scale will pick up as it gets bigger.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I think you heard Jimmy wonder about the number of people that we added in the first quarter, in the first and fourth quarter which is pretty massive for this startup that we had and as I\u2019ve told on previous calls this deal that we\u2019ve got with Nationwide which will take them to a top 10 customer as opposed to a top 25 customer where we\u2019re doing everything from soup to nuts from the credit approval down through the customer service, collections, settlement and the whole operation of their credit card program.  It just takes people to do that and we feel very good about where we are at there.  We had a couple of bumps, minor bumps I would say in the startup because we had so many new people but I think we\u2019ve done a great job of bringing that up and I think that our customer is well satisfied with it now and it is running well.  ", "Glen Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "On the Cut Data venture, I know that Jamie tried to get some metrics on this but is there any way you can sort of talk about where you are in the process?  Is this sort of still a few years away before this becomes a viable sort of credit market?  And, any color on the number of issuers that are involved here at this point that are signed by the venture?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "It\u2019s pretty interesting, we went on our road show in early December, out of the last 50 RFPs that have come out in China we\u2019ve won 48 of them which is a pretty darn good batting average if you will.  Everything is a startup in China, I mean they just still are learning about credit cards, it\u2019s a chicken and egg issue I mean we didn\u2019t have the acceptance to begin with.  I think the Olympics as advertised has certainly helped the acceptance.  I think people in China do want cards and it\u2019s starting to crank up but I think to be perfectly honest with you the government certainly is not going to allow a massive issuance of cards.  That\u2019s just not the way they do business and I think it will be a slow start up and I think we are at least a couple of years out before we see any significant revenue and income from there.  We still are very bullish on what\u2019s going on in China.  We feel good about where we\u2019re at and we think it\u2019s getting better every time we take a look at it.  We just had a board meeting 30 days ago, everything was positive.  For our board meeting in July we have their chairman coming over to make a presentation to our board which we think is going to be a very special deal and we\u2019re excited about that and our relationship is in great shape.  So, we\u2019re feeling good about it.  We\u2019re optimistic about where the Olympics are, that\u2019s coming up late this summer and hopefully that\u2019s going to help this card cause.  ", "Operator", "", "Our next question is coming from Tim Willi.  Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question.", "Tim Willi \u2013 Avondale Partners LLC", "I apologize if this was already asked I got distracted here for a second but I was wondering if you could talk about in the prepaid industry in general you continue to see lots and lots of bullish stuff about the industry, lots and lots of people also chasing it with different angles and flavors of their offering.  I guess I\u2019m curious just thinking about the profitability curve of that business if its one that you see changing markedly over the next several years?  Do you see people exiting the space?  Do you see a lot of opportunity to consolidate that space to sort of maybe help that cause?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "It\u2019s a really interesting question and it\u2019s one that we ponder around here at lot.  As you know we have not made a lot of money on prepaid but we\u2019re still bullish about it and what\u2019s going on is exactly what you said.  I mean, it appears that everybody and their brother is in the prepaid business and I mean there are a lot of people operating prepaid cards basically out of their garages and we think that\u2019s going to have to change.  We think there will be a pretty big consolidation in this business.  We think we\u2019re advantaged there because we do have these harden computer centers, we do have a lot of really strong data security and as people start figuring this out and as this business continues to grow I think it will be very much like a lot of businesses that you\u2019ve seen in the past it\u2019s going to have to consolidate and that\u2019s why we\u2019re working so hard to try to \u2013 we\u2019ve moved our operations and data center out of New York and New Jersey down to Alpharetta, we\u2019ve saved a lot of money doing that.  We\u2019ve added some really strong new people to the team.  ", "We\u2019re feeling better about it but the business in general is a very fragmented, just as you described, I mean there\u2019s a lot of people chasing it and certainly we plan on being a winner in that business as time moves on.  We\u2019ve had to learn the business, it\u2019s certainly not the traditional card business that we have know and we\u2019ve won some big deals like this one I was talking about earlier.  I don\u2019t think that you can win those kinds of deals and be operating out of your garage, you\u2019ve got to have a real business to be able to do what we\u2019re doing there.  We\u2019ve been very involved in the Walmart transaction with Green Dot and GE.  That\u2019s been one of the real success stories in the prepaid business.  I saw this morning I think First Data bought a prepaid company that I\u2019m just not real familiar with.  But, it\u2019s a business I still believe has a future long term there are just too many people particularly in this country that are unbanked that want card and when you look at what happened over the Christmas holidays with gift cards and prepaid cards it\u2019s pretty amazing really and I just look at myself, I wound up with about three as gifts and they work pretty well.", "Glen Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "If you could just add on to that comment, any thoughts you have about prepaid in an international marketplace versus domestic capabilities you have or don\u2019t have? Is it an issue?  I mean I\u2019ve seen and I think there\u2019s a consensus that parts of Europe are probably multiple years behind the US in terms of gift cards and prepaid cards?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "We\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised at the activity we\u2019ve had in Europe.  We\u2019ve got a prepaid operation that runs out of our center in York and we\u2019ve had a lot of activity in places like Spain and the UK and we\u2019ve done some really neat products there, some that I believe are certainly much more creative than what we\u2019ve seen in the US.  I think in answer to your question I think there\u2019s a big market there and we certainly play in the European market.  We\u2019ve been pretty wrapped up with some of this traditional card business that we\u2019ve got but we feel good about that.  Speaking of that I did want to mention while we\u2019re talking about Europe that this Card Tech acquisition continues to be a really big win for us.  It has created much more enthusiasm and activity than we had expected and we believe that we\u2019re going to continue to win some good business and process it on the prime software.  That\u2019s really what we\u2019re going to use with the Standard Bank of South Africa and do the 18 countries in Africa.  We\u2019ve got several other deals to be announced that are really multiple countries and its really turned out to be a more exciting acquisition or product line than we had anticipated.  I just needed to get that off my mind Tim, I\u2019m sorry I hope I answered your question on the prepaid business.", "Operator", "", "Our next question is coming from Brett Huff.  Please announce your association and then pose your question.", "Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens, Inc.", "Most of my question have been answered, just a couple of color questions, number one you all had talked about doing some work on your debit product maybe coming to fruition later in the year, is there any update on that?  ", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Yeah, that product is right on line and I\u2019m sitting here and looking eyeball to eyeball with our CIO who is shaking his head yes so I\u2019m feeling pretty good about where we\u2019re at there.  We think we\u2019ve already got a customer or two lined up and we think it will allow us to offer a competitive debt product and it will also allow us to do this decoupled debit that there\u2019s been a lot of conversation about.  So, we think that is on track and on line and we\u2019re feeling good about it.", "Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens, Inc.", "Then on the Standard Chartered win can you give us a sense of how that phases in?  Will it be soon this year, late this year?  Can you size the total amount of impact and when that might occur?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I think it will be in the third and fourth quarter of this year, the conversion.  I was just told we\u2019re already operating in Uganda which is not a lot of cards in Uganda but we are operating there and that is certainly a first for us and what you\u2019ve got is a staging of these 18 different countries.", "Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens, Inc.", "Just a follow up question on that is, is this a foothold to sort of more of the Standard Chartered business?  Or, what are your thoughts on that?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, we think it is. We believe that we\u2019re going to wind up doing a lot more business with Standard Chartered, they are just a great organization and we\u2019re very excited about our relationship with them.  We\u2019ve started to really do well in South Africa.  As you know, we have the joint venture on the call business in Europe with Dimension Data out of South Africa also so we\u2019re pretty excited about what\u2019s going on there.", "Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens, Inc.", "That\u2019s helpful.  Last question, just looking forward in terms of adding accounts on file, how do you see the additions of accounts on file splitting out between the same store sales or how you guys define organic versus the new business?  Will it be similar to what we saw this quarter?  Or how do you see that planning out?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, our best guess right now is going to be similar.  I mean, you read the papers every day, it was up 12.9% for the year so far.  We think it will continue but that\u2019s \u2013 the world is changing every day.", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions)  Gentlemen we have no further questions at this time.  ", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I wanted to close it out with just a couple of comments.  We do feel really good about our first quarter.  As you can imagine we\u2019re really excited about our future and we\u2019re certainly going to continue to focus on new revenues, operating income and margins.  We\u2019ve got a great experienced team here, we\u2019ve got a lot of really positive things to help us reach our growth objectives.  You\u2019ve heard me say this before but giving the difficulties the economy is experiencing today we think our story is more compelling than ever.  With TSYS you get a great play in the global credit markets with really no credit risk.  We continue to win blue chip clients as evidenced by what we told you this morning.  These clients sign long term contracts.  We have a great recurring revenue model, we have a very strong double digit organic growth, we\u2019ve got really great free cash flow.  Secular trends in this industry are positive, card usage is growing stronger and stronger and again, we get paid by the unit measure and history basically shows that this business is virtually recession proof.  I would thank you for your attention and interest today.  We appreciate your support and look forward to hearing from you in the future.

(Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host Shawn Roberts, Director of Investor Relations.", "Shawn Roberts", "Before we get started I want to call you attention to the fact that we will be making forward looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS\u2019 actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements are set forth in TSYS\u2019 reports filed with the SEC. At this point I\u2019d like to turn the floor over to our Chairman and CEO, Phil Tomlinson.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Welcome everybody to the TSYS xecond quarter earnings call. I\u2019d like to thank everyone of you for taking time during this busy season to participate in the call. I wanted to take a few minutes and explain our reasoning for changing this call that was originally scheduled for tomorrow morning. We changed it to this evening last week.", "After our first quarter we noticed some confusion regarding the decline in international margins as a result of the nationwide operations center start up cost in London. With today\u2019s announcements and the earnings adjustment that we\u2019re going to talk about we decided that considering the volatility in the market it would be best if we had the earnings call as early as possible after the press release. I apologize for any inconvenience we might have caused for anybody out there but believe this route will give you the latest real time information.", "Also, I hope you have had time to notice that we have substantially changed the format of the press release and we\u2019re providing much more detailed information as many of you have asked for. Every time I go the gas pump it certainly feels like a recession to me. We\u2019re continuing to experience growth but we\u2019re now experiencing the back wash of what I would call economic headwinds that our clients have faced all year long.", "As outlined in the press release we are reducing our guidance primarily for two reasons. First is the first six months of 2008 were tough on our clients and anyone certainly including us could have ever imagined. The fact that most of our major clients have earnings problems and the anticipated card growth began to slow down in late May and has continued through June. We\u2019re certainly disappointed with the change but our fundamentals are as strong as ever and we\u2019re confident about long term growth prospects.", "Now I\u2019d like just hit some highlights on the second quarter. As you\u2019ve seen the consolidated total revenues increased 5% in Q2 and 6.2% for the first six months ending June 30, as compared to 2007, very solid performance under the current conditions. Our operating income on a GAAP basis increased 1.8% in Q2 versus Q2 \u201907 and on a non-GAAP basis which excludes the one time Synovus spin related cost, operating income increased 3.1% for the same period.", "Our Global Services segment grew total revenues for Q2 at 31.9% over Q2 2007. Sequentially Global Services operating income grew a remarkable 57.7% as we benefited from the investment in the first quarter to start up the processing and managed service clients in the UK, the new ones that we talked about last quarter.", "Basic EPS on a GAAP basis came in at $0.32 per share as compared to last year and on a non-GAAP excluding the one time spin expenses we came in at $0.33 per share for the second quarter and $0.64 year to date.", "Some highlights, new business we announced that we\u2019ve signed a processing agreement with Global Card for the launch of consumer credit card portfolio in Mexico. We\u2019ll provide account processing services, risk management, portfolio management and reporting to Global Card. As I said, they\u2019re based in Mexico.", "We also announced an agreement that we\u2019re very excited about, PartnersFirst Affinity Services, which is a division of Torrey Pines Bank, to process its consumer credit card portfolio. In addition the core processing PartnersFirst will use all of our technology for online credit card services, instant applications, cards, statements, letter production and a full suite of the customer care offerings. ", "It\u2019s a great partnership between two good companies and we\u2019ll offer a full range of card services for small and mid-size Affinity partner marketing groups. They\u2019ve already experienced good success in this Affinity space and we certainly expect big things from them going forward.", "We also announced that we\u2019ve renewed our agreement to exclusively process Canadian Tire. It\u2019s a multi-year contract and it\u2019s for the MasterCard and private label portfolios. We also negotiated several other long term contracts with customers. I do have some negative news, we\u2019ve been notified that one of our retail clients will be de-converting to a competitor in March of next year I believe it is. Price was the issue and while I hate to lose them they represent less than 1% of our revenue.", "We\u2019ve also signed a deal in Japan with Sony Bank. We always have a lot of questions about China UnionPay. I\u2019m thrilled to tell you, you may have read pieces of it in the trades here recently. We signed a deal with CUP Data for the Chinese Citi debit business which is very exciting to us. We also, I think this is the kind of things that sometimes go unnoticed at TSYS. This one is so big I just wanted to give you a flavor for it.", "I\u2019m not in a position to give you any names today but one of our banks has recently signed a new Affinity group and they have added over a million accounts as a result of that Affinity group in the past 25 days. Those are the things that make a real difference here. Value added products have continued to be a solid contributor. Value added was up 12.2% for the year and 12.4% for the second quarter.", "In our Merchant Processing business revenues for the first six months are up 2.1% over the same period in 2007 but TAS contributed significantly to operating income or margins of 29.4% and revenues increased 5% for the first quarter. I talked enough I want to turn it over to Jim Lipham our CFO who is going to give you a lot more details about what is going on at TSYS.", "Jim Lipham", "I would ask everyone to take a look at the income statement we provided with the press release. As a reminder I\u2019d like to note that several of the comparisons of \u201908 to \u201907 are impacted by the migration of Chase from a processing solution to an in house licensing model. We\u2019ll anniversary this at the end of July of \u201908 and then our comparisons thereafter will be done a quarter basis a more true reflection of the trends of our business.", "We\u2019ll start off with electronic payment processing. As you know it mainly includes our core processing and licensing arrangements for both our North American segment as well as our global based clients. As shown in the release our electronic payments processing revenue was down 1% or $2.3 million for the quarter and for the first six months we\u2019re actually up 1.9% or $8.9 million.", "The revenues in \u201907 include the processing revenues from Chase prior to its migration and this loss of revenue was really picked up by new business that we put on mainly in Europe and the growth of our existing clients here in the US. ", "We\u2019ve had some good things happen to help offset that loss of revenue. When you exclude the revenues associated with the de-converted class, the impact of the migration also, the electronic payments actually grew 9.3% for the quarter and 12% for the year. Out of this growth 70% of the quarterly growth and approximately 50% growth for the year is also new business added since the second quarter of \u201907. This is mainly, as I said in Europe our clients such as Nationwide, CapOne and Rabobank.", "The remaining portion of our growth was provided by our consolidated internal growth rate for the year to date is at 7% and we\u2019ve had a little drop in the second quarter which is part of the reason for the change in the guidance we\u2019ve seen the internal growth drop off some and we had price concessions as Phil mentioned we had some re-negotiated contracts that we did through the first half of this year and we had price concessions also affecting our growth from internal customers.", "The International revenue segment this includes Global Services as well as Canada and Mexico. That revenue stream increased $20 million or 25% over last year\u2019s second quarter and increased $35.8 million or 18.9% year to date. There again the real increase there is the strong growth in the UK and the international clients that we\u2019ve added.", "Also in Europe are the international revenues, mainly in Europe, were affected positively by the currency translation adjustment. In the quarter it was about $650,000 and year to day it\u2019s about $2.2 million. Phil mentioned the value added services so I won\u2019t go into that but obviously a big item there is some of our Triad services, scoring services and with the loss of Chase it\u2019s affected that growth. Sequentially we\u2019re showing some good growth there, about 8.4% in the value added area. It really complements our core services.", "Phil Tomlinson", "I misspoke a minute ago. Those numbers of 12.2% and 12.4%. What I really meant to say is as a percentage of revenues that growth is.", "Jim Lipham", "Sequentially I think the big thing there is we are growing in the value added area and it\u2019s up 8.4%. We lost a lot with the loss of Chase. Compare more favorably as we go forward.", "During the quarter we were very successful as Phil said in extending the agreements with Target and Canadian Tire. Overall we\u2019ve renewed six clients including four of our top 20. Most of these clients are signed up through at least 2012.", "Excluding the de-converted council filed from last year our council file numbers year over year grew 17.8% or 56.7 million accounts to $372.9 million the growth was really the result of 30.1 million new clients and we\u2019ve added a lot of customers with folks like Charming Shops and Green Dot. Then we\u2019ve had internal growth and added another 39.5 million accounts.", "Transactions, despite the current economic environment we continue to see cardholders using the accounts. Sequentially our quarterly transactions grew 8% to $1.95 billion and authorizations also increased a little over 8.2% to $1.77 billion. Good growth sequentially in transactions. ", "Drop to the merchant acquiring services revenue, it increased compared to prior year and also for the quarter. More importantly when you look at it sequentially these revenues are up 6.3% primarily as an increase of both the outgoing transactions and point of sale transactions growing at 7%. TSYS acquiring its revenues before reimbursables are down slightly for the quarter and the other part of the growth here is coming from GPNet. That\u2019s mainly due to their drop still from the de-conversions and price compressions that they\u2019ve had going on which is suppressing their growth.", "However, when you look at their operating income for the second quarter it was $18.1 million an 11% increase over the second quarter of \u201907. Year to date the operating margin excluding reimbursables increased to 29.4% compared to 24.9% in \u201907. This is the result of a concerted effort by all those team members managing those costs and we\u2019ve said that before we tend to do a real good job of managing our expenses in light of our revenues.", "TSYS acquiring also had a great quarter from the service standpoint as both it front end and back end maintained over 99.99% availability. Good performance for them.", "For the other services revenue you can see there its pretty strong growth in \u201908 compared to \u201907. The primary reason is Phil mentioned the call center business in Europe and we\u2019ve had huge growth there with Nationwide as we\u2019ve put them on in the first quarter and they really came, the revenues started showing up this quarter. We\u2019ve had also an increase in the US, and it\u2019s mainly coming from Charming Shops.", "The reimbursable line item increased for the quarter 15.3% and 16.7% for the year and this is again the result of the treatment of the court costs and our debt management business as reimbursable items instead of our revenue and that\u2019s caused this big jump here in our reimbursable items. Total revenues for the second quarter increased 5% to $23 million excluding de-conversions from the second quarter \u201907. These revenues for the second quarter were up 12.2% or $51.9 million. Year to date would have been up 13.4% or $110 million. Revenues would have been strong when you take the de-conversion out.", "As we go down the page, looking at the expenses the expense growth in employment was at 1.5% for the quarter $2.1 million and 3.5% or $10 million for the year to date. This is mainly the result of increased salaries, from increased headcount that we\u2019ve had. Basically put on a lot of it in the first quarter and we\u2019ve also had merit increase partially offset by reduction in performance based incentive benefits.", "Our growth in employees over \u201907 stands around 809 employees and there again it\u2019s the result of the call center build up that we had in Europe mainly. On a sequential quarter basis employment expenses are slightly down so we\u2019re holding the line on them as we go through the rest of this year but it\u2019s slightly down about $651,000.", "[Inaudible] and equipment category increased 8% for the quarter and for the year. This increase is again the result of the software licensing agreement signed in December \u201907 and the increase associated with the increased capacity is causing the software amortization to grow. In addition to that we\u2019ve had higher maintenance and repairs in our equipment area as well as we\u2019ve had some increased rent and building maintenance in Europe which totaled about $1.5 million so it\u2019s mainly a capacity issue and hopefully this will level out for the rest of this year.", "As the result of the spin off from Synovus we did incur expenses associated with advisory services related to the deal. We also had costs that include the incremental fair value associated with converting these Synovus options to TSYS options held by TSYS employees. We do expect to incur additional expenses going forward as we continue to split the shared services we had with Synovus primarily talking about the payroll system. Through all this spin off we have not experienced any significant changes in our own going operating expenses due to the spin.", "The other expense category saw a decrease of 4.4% for the quarter and 7.1% for the year. This is largely a part of due to the lower transaction delivery costs of TSYS acquiring. Also the reclassification of court costs expense to pass through items. We\u2019ve had lower TS2 conversion amortization during this period of time and also this was the category that housed the management fee expense that we paid to Synovus in \u201907 and it\u2019s now been redistributed as we have obviously brought those expenses in house.", "On the operating income line my analysis in talking about that I want to exclude the one time spin costs there. As you see on the P&L its 1.8% growth for the quarter and 1.6% for the year to date but when you back out or exclude the spin cost operating income grew 3.1% for the quarter and 6% for the year. We did improve the quarter and the first six months on our operating profit margin. Without the spin we\u2019re at 26.6% for the quarter compared to 26.3% in \u201907.

On our year to date EBITDA it was at $272.3 million on a non-GAAP basis for a 5.5% increase over 2007\u2019s $258.2 million. Our EBITDA margin before reimbursables in \u201908 was 37.2% compared to 36.4% prior year and we expect that level to continue as indicated in our guidance.", "Other income it decreased $5.4 million for the second quarter and $10.1 million for the year. Interest expense associated with the long term debt arrangements as well as decreased amounts of cash available to invest accounted for all these changes. As you know our debt is that we got is based on LIBOR for the second quarter LIBOR was at 3.25% or 2488 and in July it\u2019s dropped down again to 3.08%. It\u2019s been very favorable for us to have LIBOR based debt.", "The effective tax rate was impacted in the quarter as the result of the spin transaction and subsequent utilization of certain state tax credits and discrete items. The discrete items resulted in a tax benefit of $1.6 million for the second quarter and effects of these items resulted in an effective tax rate being 35.1% for the quarter compared to 35.3% last year. Year to date we\u2019re at 35.97% on taxes compared to about 36.5% last year. As we said before we anticipate our effective tax rate pre discrete items to remain in the 36% range.", "Net income when you look at pro-forma net income for the quarter it decreased 2.7% to roughly $63.9 million, that\u2019s taking the spin out and that\u2019s down from $65.7 million for the second quarter last year. For the six months it increased 2% to $125.5 million up from $123 million for the second part of last year.

As we expected the operating margin for the second quarter strongly rebounded and we expect operating results to improve significantly as 2008 progresses.", "Moving on from the income statement just a few comments I\u2019d like to make on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. If you look at the balance sheet the changes from December \u201907 unrestricted cash at $257.8 million that\u2019s an increase of $47.3 million since December. Also during the quarter we purchased 500,000 shares of treasury stock at a cost of $12.2 million. This brought our total for the year to one million shares that we\u2019ve purchased during the first half of the year $23.6 million.", "On the cash flow statement you\u2019ll note our significant contribution to cash generated from operating activities at $174 million. It\u2019s good growth for the first six months of this year and we invested roughly $26.3 million in property. This may slow going forward and equipment we bought was mainly in the hardware second of the mainframe disk drives and about $16.9 million was spent on software roughly $8.6 million was purchased and $8.3 million for developed.", "We also had an increase in our cash used for contract acquisition costs where the customers were brought on in Europe and some signing incentives.

We are aggressively and successfully expanding internationally. I think the numbers for that are up 15.8% year to date as a percentage of revenues and up to 16.4% for the quarter, showing good strong growth as percentage of revenues.", "We\u2019ve got a strong and growing market share in key and emerging markets that you heard from me earlier about. We\u2019ve got a strong recurring revenue model. Also a great play in the consumer and commercial credit business without any credit risk. I think there\u2019s no doubt in anyone\u2019s mind. I know you heard this from Visa and MasterCard that plastic card transactions will continue at a rapid rate replacing checks and cash which means more transactions, which is a good thing for TSYS.", "We have this newly acquired M&A capability. We\u2019ve got a strong prospect list and I think you\u2019ll see us continue to win in the marketplace. We\u2019re a company that continues to enjoy a sterling reputation and we\u2019re a company that\u2019s easy to do business with. As I said the fundamentals are all there. We have not lost our way and we are still pushing forward very strongly. With that I\u2019m going to open it up.

Is it more of a down turn and if so how much, or does it assume we hold steady at these levels?", "Phil Tomlinson", "I think we\u2019re going to hold where we\u2019re at. We actually have some hope that things are going to pick up in the fourth quarter. When you start looking at a list of our customers it\u2019s the same list you\u2019ve been reading on the front page of the Wall Street the last six months. We\u2019re feeling those headwinds right now and so I think the fact that we\u2019re just trying to be transparent here today and I think we\u2019re going to hold our own and I think it will as some point late in the fourth quarter, early next year start picking up. I know people want to grow these businesses, they\u2019re very profitable businesses.", "Glenn Fodor \u2013 UBS", "There\u2019s a lot of moving parts going on here that are affecting the guidance. I want to get a sense of how much of the actual reduction is from pricing versus sales cycles not closing as fast as you thought versus internal card growth not being what you thought it would be.", "Jim Lipham", "A lot of it has to do with internal card growth has slowed. We\u2019ve got customers that have really slowed down and you know who some of them are WaMu, CompuCredit and some of these others.", "Phil Tomlinson", "I think it\u2019s in the press release. If you recall last year this organic growth that we have been describing almost as like same store growth to make it easier to understand last year it closed out right at 15% for the year and this year if I\u2019m right its about 7% for the first six months.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse.", "Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse", "I want to follow up with the weakness in the financial services industry that we\u2019re seeing and it\u2019s causing you guys to be cautious on the guidance. Is it just in the card growth or it also sounds like you\u2019re seeing it in transactions and authorizations as well that\u2019s making you a little more cautious going forward. Maybe some comments about the amount of value added services they\u2019re willing to spend in this kind of environment it looks like they\u2019re cutting back on that as well.", "Jim Lipham", "On transaction growth I think sequentially we\u2019re seeing good growth in the 8% range. In the past we may have had some double digit growth and that\u2019s part of the economic environment we\u2019re in may have that 8% growth but I still think that\u2019s good growth in these times. Value added services we\u2019ve had drops there from de-converted customers. We also, as you know these services can come and go and not affect the main processing that we do for customers and we have seen mainly a drop back just from de-converted customers. Outside of that I think it\u2019s pretty normal.", "Phil Tomlinson", "People have slowed down on projects, obviously we charge for a lot of these new roll outs. I don\u2019t know about you but in the last month I haven\u2019t received very many solicitations in my mail box. That has really slowed down here lately. We get paid for all of that. Our pre-paid business we\u2019ve had some really good success there with a couple of deals that we\u2019ve signed that have grown very rapidly. We are feeling very, very good about what\u2019s going on in Europe and the UK. ", "We\u2019ve talked a lot about CUP Data and I hope I\u2019ve been clear that that\u2019s a long term payout but we still are continuing to win there as evidenced by what I was saying earlier. We\u2019ve also won several other RFPs in the meantime. As a matter of fact, we had a Board meeting today and the Chairman of CUP Data made a presentation and it was very encouraging. We\u2019re thrilled with that. I think we\u2019re feeling the effects of people just cutting back in general. There are a lot of these banks that are worried about a lot bigger things than credit cards.", "Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse", "You talked about the environment, it sounded like it got a little bit worse throughout the quarter June being a little worse. How about July, how does it fall through is it still deteriorating?", "Phil Tomlinson", "I don\u2019t have enough information to speak to July but it really started right at the end of May and really started slowing down through June. As Jimmy said, we still have very positive growth but it\u2019s just a combination of a lot of several things. We did renegotiate several contracts that we did discount to some degree and I don\u2019t have that number in front of me but that\u2019s a contributor. It is not a major cause to this.", "Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse", "In this kind of environment that discounts more than typical that you\u2019ve had to give bigger price concessions?", "Phil Tomlinson", "I really don\u2019t think that they are. At least we haven\u2019t seen that. We\u2019ve been renegotiating contracts for 30 years and it\u2019s always the customer wants as much as they can get and we just have to try to balance that as best we can. At the same time we\u2019re certainly trying to make our business faster, better and cheaper and we\u2019re making good progress. ", "As an example, we charge for inactive accounts. This is a time where a bank might go in; during good times they\u2019ll leave those accounts sitting out there thinking that they might really reactivate those accounts at some point. Some banks are coming in and saying we want to purge these inactive accounts and put them on the tape and hold them for me and I\u2019ll try them later. That\u2019s a good example of a fee that could go away during a time like this.", "Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Do you have any idea how many of your accounts are inactive?", "Phil Tomlinson", "No, I really don\u2019t have that handy. We\u2019ve got that information I just don\u2019t have it handy.", "Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Like 5% or is that too high, too low?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Too low. When I talk about inactive accounts I\u2019m talking about a guy that\u2019s been inactive for a couple of years. I might go inactive on my primary accounts for a month or two but if I\u2019ve gone inactive for a year or two I quit using that card and somebody\u2019s going to have to do something to prod me to start using that card again.", "Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse", "The inactive accounts it would be a little higher than 5%.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Yes, I think it probably would. That\u2019s doesn\u2019t mean that everybody\u2019s doing that.

I know you had alluded to some of this in your commentary but the data function of the composition of revenue or the cost controls or a combination of both.", "Phil Tomlinson", "It\u2019s a combination of both. Controls on expenses are and have been for a couple years now real good.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna", "If we continue to model, looking at the number excluding the reimbursables 100 to 200 basis point improvement in the operating margin year on year is that consistent with what your guidance contemplates?", "Phil Tomlinson", "The guidance is still in the 25% to 27%. I would say 26% operating margin consolidated.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna", "That\u2019s up from 24% to 26% last year.", "Phil Tomlinson", "We do think if you\u2019ll recall last quarter we talked about that to some degree. We really talked about we didn\u2019t think that we could do much with that as long as we were really trying to expand internationally. We think we\u2019ll still be in that range but we\u2019re spending a lot of money trying to expand internationally and we\u2019re having some good success. Those numbers won\u2019t be quite as high as say the core business in North America would be.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna", "With regard to China UnionPay, on your commentary, can you give us some estimate of what Citibank\u2019s card portfolio is in China?", "Phil Tomlinson", "I wish I could but even if I knew it right in front of me I couldn\u2019t tell you that. We don\u2019t give any numbers out on specific customers.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna", "Is this a large incremental customer for China UnionPay?", "Phil Tomlinson", "It\u2019s a good win for China UnionPay, we\u2019re excited about it. It\u2019s obviously the largest named bank that we\u2019ve signed on a debit card basis. I think that Citi is sort of a debit start up there as I understand it. It\u2019s just a great indicator of where we\u2019re at.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna", "The equity in income in equity investments, that\u2019s still tracking below where it was in the second half of \u201907. How do we reconcile the mechanics of progress in China UnionPay with that line item?", "Jim Lipham", "The equity line for this year is more in the processing arena. Last year we had a lot of investments in China that were going on that were from the cash that they had and they closed it out. It also, this line item today includes a partnership that we have with B&C an airplane partnership that\u2019s in here that brings that number down, it wasn\u2019t there last year. ", "China UnionPay going forward will do a little less than they did last year, this year and should improve back to the levels of \u201907 and \u201909 as it continues to grow. The processing business is picking up over there; the accounts are coming on board. There\u2019s been a shift out the investment market into processing. We\u2019ll get more into the core business of China UnionPay now.", "Phil Tomlinson", "That line is a little bit muddied up by this. We had this partnership with Synovus on an airplane and we\u2019ve had to break that up and so some of those expenses that take that down are a part of that. If that makes any sense to you.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna", "Yes, I know there\u2019s a lot of moving parts. Is there any contemplation of monetizing the investment in CUP China UnionPay taking it public? What stage are we in terms of the funding cycle of that entity?", "Phil Tomlinson", "You\u2019ve heard me say on several occasions that\u2019s a three to five year term and I do think that things, I wish I had some of those stats that I heard this morning about the growth in China particularly about acceptance, the Olympic start next week. I would never say that they wouldn\u2019t go public at some point in time but I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s imminent at this point.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer.", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer", "The first question is following up on Bryan Keane\u2019s question. If you could give us some color on the transaction trends by month and it fell of at the end of May and it looked like based on your comments and the press release \u2018x\u2019 the de-conversion transactions were up 6% for the quarter. Any way you can give us some color on what it looked like April, May and June. What I\u2019m getting at is was this similar to the trends that American Express talked about where it really fell off pretty hard in June?", "Phil Tomlinson", "We don\u2019t have it in front of us. If you\u2019ll ask us another question if we\u2019ve got it here we\u2019ll dig it out.", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Outside of the slow down of internal account growth and incremental projects, could you give us some color on what your six to nine month pipeline looks like and color around the length of the sales cycle, what\u2019s happening in terms of getting deals closed?", "Phil Tomlinson", "The sales cycle is pretty long in this business. I would say it averages anywhere from six months to 18 months. We\u2019ve got some good business lined up we have not announced. We do have some very nice letters of intent. If I gave you a number of a pipeline it\u2019d just be an absolute guess but I would say its, I don\u2019t think I want to take a guess at it. It\u2019s not like we\u2019ve got 100 million accounts out there today. As soon as we\u2019re able to release some of these wins that we have going on I think you\u2019ll like what you see.", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer", "That\u2019s kind of what I\u2019m getting at. Is there a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes that we really haven\u2019t seen yet in the environment and maybe slow things down a bit and maybe you\u2019ll get wins some nice deals by the end of the year which are going to help \u201909? That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to get at.", "Phil Tomlinson", "I think that we will win some nice deals. I wish I could sit here and say that I thought it was imminent that we\u2019re going to sign somebody with 100 million accounts; I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. We do have as an example I can think of four LOIs that we got this week that they\u2019re not home runs in the bottom of the ninth of the seventh game of the World Series but they\u2019re very nice wins and they\u2019re names that you will know, names that could be significant over some period of time.", "We have some good things going on, let\u2019s start in Mexico. Mexico has really picked up. We\u2019re seeing a lot of activity in Mexico. The US has picked up a little. We got a couple good things going there that we\u2019re pretty excited about. Same way in Canada. I think we\u2019re probably more excited about the UK and Europe right now than anywhere around the globe. We talked a little bit about CUP Data.

There\u2019s a possibility we might have something before year end.", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Is there any way to characterize the pipeline relative to where it was six, nine, 12 months ago?", "Phil Tomlinson", "I think it\u2019s about the same. There\u2019s no big increase. It\u2019s good or better.", "Jim Lipham", "On the question you had on transactions what we saw in the first part of the year we\u2019ve actually had an increase in transactions every month through June. We have not seen a drop off from the total transaction basis.", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer", "If you get 6% in the quarter of June was it 8% in April, 7% etc. on down the floor. I\u2019m trying to get a sense for the year over year.", "Jim Lipham", "Sequentially we grew 8% in transactions that\u2019s for the second quarter. I think you saw about the same thing in the first quarter, 8.5% for the first quarter. I\u2019ve got it by month but I don\u2019t have the percent growth I\u2019ve just got the total transactions.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "A quick questions on the M&A front given that the US is slowing and you\u2019re seeing your customers suffering a little more. Would you be willing to accelerate your M&A pipeline and will make more acquisitions on the international front and what would be your regional preference for now.", "Phil Tomlinson", "That\u2019s one of the key reasons that we were spun from Synovus so we could play in the M&A business. We\u2019ve talked a lot of times about where we would prefer to go. Obviously there are some things here in the US that has come up. As I said earlier we are very excited about the UK, we\u2019re excited about the, when I say the UK I really mean the UK and Europe, we\u2019re very excited about the merchant acquiring business or the merchant processing business.", "We\u2019re still very excited about the card processing business, our core business, the business that\u2019s got us primarily to where we are today. There are opportunities, we just hadn\u2019t been able to get one across the finish line yet and we\u2019ll do that. That\u2019s really about as far as I\u2019d rather go today.", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "On the merchant acquiring side on the top line can you accelerate the top line by maintaining your margins, is it just the softness in the market and are you maintaining your market share on the acquiring side of the business?", "Phil Tomlinson", "We\u2019re maintaining our market share and I think that Jimmy said that our margins had actually increased.", "Jim Lipham", "The margins have increased; they\u2019re up to 29% for the quarter. When you look at the acquiring business the volumes are down a little bit in the low single digits but what\u2019s happened to our merchant business is we\u2019re anniversaring some de-conversions and price concessions that have gone on in the later part of \u201907. As we anniversary those you\u2019ll see more growth in this revenue as the volumes continue to hold up. They\u2019re not down; they\u2019re all up in the low single digits.", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "In which quarter are you anniversaring the de-conversions for the acquiring business?", "Jim Lipham", "It\u2019s spread out during the year. I would say by the end of the third quarter we should be pretty much over.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thank goodness the end of July we\u2019ll anniversary the date that Chase licensed our software and moved in house and took the license agreement.", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "The last question I have is on the first quarter these de-conversions were there as well but the growth on the top line was much strong. It\u2019s overall a more weakness in the market on the acquiring side which is slowing down your top line would that be correct?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Price and pressure yes was on the merchant.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from David Scharf \u2013 JMP.", "David Scharf - JMP", "Curious about Europe, it\u2019s certainly the regional bright spot. I think in a lot of past down turns we see a slow down start on our shores and move their way across the Atlantic and also ultimately make their way to Asia. It\u2019s been a couple months now since late May when you started to see some material changes in the US issuers. Are there any early warning signs or anything you\u2019re on the look out with some of your European issuers? We\u2019re just wondering if that\u2019s the next leg.", "Phil Tomlinson", "I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the next leg but we\u2019ve got a couple of examples where transaction growth has slowed down in Europe. We\u2019re talking about credit card transactions; the predominant card in Europe obviously is the Debit Card. We don\u2019t process Debit Cards in Europe. We have seen some decline at this point.", "David Scharf - JMP", "Inherent in the back half of the year\u2019s guidance are you assuming any further fall off in your European growth?", "Phil Tomlinson", "No, we\u2019re not. We feel comfortable with where we\u2019re at.", "David Scharf - JMP", "I wonder if you can also give a couple more examples, these were very helpful when you gave some specific examples of how issuers cut back in this kind of environment. You used the example of how you get paid for card solicitation, mailings, maintaining inactive accounts. These are actually helpful examples to give us some benchmarks to keep an eye on. Are there any other top five types of discretionary spending other than obviously just card issuance that we should keep an eye on?", "Phil Tomlinson", "I think there is. One of the great things about TS2 is we had this massive ability to retain data. We can retain it for a month or we can retain it for 10 years. Some people will go in and adjust that. Retention cuts and things like that. It\u2019s a very complex process that we have and some of those are core services and people have to use them. ", "We have this system called Total Access which is a relational database reporting system. Some people use it very heavily and others not so much. You have the ability to use it as much as you want but you do get charged for it. You might cut down some of that. It\u2019s really across the board. ", "On the other side things like our fraud systems card guard, FICO, Experian, those services tend to increase during times like this, credit scoring capabilities, follow up with people who have authorization habits who have changed, you\u2019ve seen those ads on television where somebody\u2019s charging something on his card and you\u2019ve seen it. We do all sorts of things like that. Those services more than likely will increase.", "Our plan is to hold our own and we think we can do that.", "David Scharf - JMP", "One last question, just circling back to the guidance and this is more putting some context around what\u2019s behind the guidance. I\u2019m actually trying to reconcile what looks like some very, very slight, slight trimming of the second half guidance. It looks like your EBITDA guidance for the second half is being trimmed by 1% to 1.5% at most. In some ways that out of sync with the dire language in the press release concerning the state of your clients.", "I want to get some additional color on whether a 1.5% trimming of operating cash flow fully captures what you\u2019re seeing in your clients right now.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Let me go through a litany of our clients right now and I\u2019ll give you an example. When you start thinking about WaMu and Wachovia and Fifth Third and CompuCredit, you name them and we probably do business with them at some point. The expectations are that we had very high expectations on the front end. If you recall back in January we actually raised our revenue guidance. ", "To be perfectly frank and honest, we\u2019re probably flying a little high, maybe too aggressive with it. We really thought we could get there and I don\u2019t think anybody in January or at least I certainly didn\u2019t think that we would be dealing with the issues in the FI business that we\u2019re dealing with today.", "David Scharf - JMP", "My question focuses on the second half outlook. In light of those issues you\u2019re facing today is a 1.5% reduction in second half EBITDA guidance did you feel that gives you much wiggle room or is that?", "Phil Tomlinson", "We\u2019re not used to having a lot of wiggle room with you guys. We tried to keep it as tight as we could. We hated to go down at all honestly, it just makes us sick to do that but it is what it is and we\u2019re very optimistic about our long term prospects and we\u2019re optimistic about the rest of this year. It\u2019s pretty apparent what\u2019s going on in this business and what\u2019s going on with a lot of our customers who had planned on having pretty strong growth.", "We looked at it very, very hard and we believe that we\u2019ll be able to get there and while it may be a small adjustment. I\u2019m glad to hear you say that you think it\u2019s rather small. We\u2019ve tried to have a history with all street being upfront and being very transparent.", "Operator", "That was our last question. Do you have any closing comments?", "Phil Tomlinson", "In our Board meeting today, you folks might think this is corny but I told our Board, we\u2019re sort of like a toll bridge. There are not a lot of toll bridges out there and you just pay the trip. Our toll bridge is really in good shape. It seems that we\u2019ve got a couple pot holes out there that we\u2019ve got to get fixed. We think that it\u2019s going to take a little time. The bridge is in great shape and we\u2019ll continue collecting these tolls which basically are transactions to us. We\u2019re still excited about out business. We think it\u2019s good. We think we\u2019ll continue to win in the marketplace.", "Think of us as like that and I hope that we\u2019ve been able to answer all of your questions today. We thank you for your attention and your support and interest and look forward to hearing from you in the future.

(NYSE:TSS) Q3 2008 Earnings Call October 10, 2008  8:00 AM ET", "Executives", "", "Shawn Roberts \u2013 Investor Relations", "Philip W. Tomlinson \u2013 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "James B. Lipham \u2013 Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President", "Analysts", "Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Adam Frisch \u2013 UBS", "[Paul Fardali \u2013 PV Investment Research]", "Robert Dodd \u2013 Morgan, Keegan & Company, Inc.", "Nick Fiskens \u2013 Stephens, Inc.", "Timothy Willi \u2013 Avondale Partners, LLC.", "[Garv Vora] \u2013 Raymond James", "", "Operator", "", "Welcome to the TSYS third quarter 2008 conference call.  (Operator Instructions)  It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host Shawn Roberts of Investor Relations.", "Shawn Roberts", "", "Before we get started we want to call your attention to the fact that we will be making some forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS.  These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties.  Factors that could cause TSYS\u2019 actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in the TSYS\u2019 reports filed with the SEC.", "At this time I\u2019d like to turn the floor over to Phil Tomlinson, Chairman and CEO of TSYS.", "Philip W. Tomlinson ", "I want to thank you for joining us this morning, it\u2019s really three weeks earlier than we\u2019d normally be coming together to discuss our third quarter results.  There are several reasons for the earlier timing.  First, is let me say that we reported good financial results for the quarter, results that reflect a solid revenue growth and we signed some great new business, all against a pretty difficult economic wind.", "We wanted to get these results to you and to the market as quickly as possible and provide as much transparency as we possibly could.  We also wanted you to hear sooner rather than later our perspective on the issues going on in our world especially those involving our clients.  As you know, two of our very good clients, Washington Mutual and Wachovia have been involved in acquisitions from two of, I was going to say, maybe three but I understand that\u2019s resolved, of our other customers.", "Washington Mutual and Wachovia combined account for approximately 4.5% of our revenues year-to-date.  On WaMu we have a strong relationship and we continue to have a strong relationship with Chase and we continue to process their commercial card and some private label work for them.  Frankly, we\u2019re not sure what will happen with the WaMu processing but I\u2019m here today to tell you that Chase has not given us any direction yet about the long term processing plans for that portfolio.", "Chances are at some point in the future Chase will consider consolidating the WaMu portfolio in to its own in house portfolio, which as you\u2019ll recall, is the only licensed site of our TS2 software.  As you\u2019ll recall again, Chase elected to take the option license and transition in house in July of 07.  At this point in time we don\u2019t know when a conversion might occur or if it will ever occur.  Obviously, we\u2019ll disclose that when we become aware of a definite plan.", "The other client affected by the latest acquisition activity is Wachovia and until last night, we really didn\u2019t know who owned Wachovia, much less their card portfolio.  However, we do have a processing relationship again, with Wells and we believe that our relationship is in good shape with that bank.  With both WaMu and Wachovia we have processing agreements that extend into the future and I think you could call them long term and both include appropriate fees for early termination.", "Should either decide to leave TSYS, based on our experience, we really believe that from today or from the end of the year our best estimate, it would take somewhere between nine and 18 months at a minimum to do a conversion or deconversion.  The WaMu and Wachovia bank acquisitions are large and complex and they\u2019ll provide more than their share of hard issues as the new owners work to integrate not only the branch and the product offering but also the technology issues that are sure to come.", "We see it as a long term opportunity for us to sell our capabilities.  We know that we can deliver quality service, we\u2019ve got a good reputation with both acquiring banks.  We know we can give them better speed to market, great technology and maybe in today\u2019s environment what might be more important than ever is we can give them lower cost in addition to containing and guaranteeing cost in to the foreseeable future.", "Whoever the long term winners are in our industry turn out to be, we\u2019ll continue to have state of the art effective cost saving solutions that help them with not only the card portfolios they might acquire but also their existing card portfolios.  Listen, don\u2019t think I\u2019m delusional, we have a big mountain to climb with these big issuers but we believe the world as we know it has changed and with that change there absolutely comes disruption and we\u2019re seeing lots of disruption today.", "We like our chances, we like our chances because of our technology.  We like it because of our strong balance sheet.  We like it because we are becoming more and more international and we have great execution capability with outstanding people.  We\u2019ll pull out all the stops to help our clients and prospects deal with change and disruption.  While there is uncertainty and risk in today\u2019s world, there\u2019s no doubt about that, we believe very strongly that it presents opportunities for someone like TSYS.", "Banks that have never considered TSYS in the past will in many cases have to look harder at our proposition.  We strong disagree with [inaudible] who see insourcing as a trend.  We do not agree with that whatsoever.  Issuers and acquirers will no doubt have to deal with the new market realities, is what we\u2019re calling it today as we move forward.  ", "Frankly, what we see in the in house card processing market to date is software that was built in the late 70s early 80s.  It\u2019s aging, it\u2019s patched up software, it\u2019s needlessly complex with a very difficult surround infrastructure.  It\u2019s expensive, it\u2019s time consuming, it\u2019s a drain on resources, it\u2019s slow to market, it\u2019s risky to change and it\u2019s hard to operate.  We know, and I think the world knows that our systems are less risky, less expensive, better technology, they\u2019re flexible and they provide much more capability. ", "A good example of systems pressure is the new card rule coming down from the Fed in January.  We\u2019ve talked to some issuers that say that they\u2019ll have to use every technical resource available to them for the entire year of 2009 to comply with the new Fed rules on credit cards.  We don\u2019t have that problem.  We think it\u2019s a great strength.", "We talk about we\u2019ve had a lot of conversations over the past about people rebuilding software or starting from scratch.  I wanted to reiterate what I\u2019ve said a couple of times over the last few years that a large issuer or competitor we believe would have to commit over $1 billion and probably three to five years and with that you and I both know the chances of success for a project of this size are I would say much less than 50%.", "On this subject time is TSYS\u2019 friend and I would be surprised to see anybody take the route to rebuild.  Remember, there\u2019s been a lot of folks that have tried this and failed over the past 20 years or so.  Let me move on to acquisitions, we all know that creating the ability to make acquisitions using both our equity and debt was one of the key reasons that we spun out from Synovus in January.  We want to and still plan to make acquisitions using both equity and debt.", "We greatly improved our capability to evaluate targets and with that capability and with the advisory help that\u2019s out there, we\u2019ve looked at over 30 opportunities year-to-date both large and small.  Unfortunately, for a lot of different reasons, some beyond our control, we haven\u2019t completed an acquisition since the spin.  I\u2019ll assure you our lack of success is not due to a lack of hard work.", "As we look at acquisitions, especially in the current credit market, I wanted to assure you that we\u2019ll be prudent, we won\u2019t do anything to hurt our credit ratings or overburden our solid balance sheet without very, very strong rewards.  Also, we won\u2019t issue shares for an acquisition when we believe the price of our shares are totally undervalued, like today.  We believe they\u2019re really undervalued today.", "I want to reiterate our three main areas of interest for acquisition, and we\u2019ve talked about this before.  First, we want to acquire technologies and businesses that acquire and process transactions at the point of sale, the acquiring business.  Today we process billions of POS transactions through TSYS acquiring solutions and we want to be a larger player in that space.", "With hard times comes opportunities and for the first time in several years we\u2019re beginning to see opportunities out there that fit well strategically and the prices are becoming much more attractive.  The second area of interest is international.  We\u2019ve stated that our plan calls for the company, TSYS, to have 30% plus of our revenue from outside of the US by the end of 2011.  We expect to complete international transactions that create shareholder value with appropriate risk/return balance.", "You\u2019ll see us in all probability this quarter add a small deal in Japan which is the third largest card market in the world and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate other opportunities and card markets.  Finally, we\u2019ll keep pushing to look for a card processing opportunity that replace or products that replace or enhance our current products.  With these new products are a better technology, looking for them we feel like we\u2019re making good progress.", "Products that help our clients win are fuel for future growth at TSYS.  We\u2019ll put those in the chapter of value added products.  Let me be clear on this point, we are and we\u2019re going to remain in the hunt for acquisitions and we will do the right deal when we get it identified assuming the credit markets will allow such a thing.  The charge to our team and my commitment to our board is that we\u2019ll make smart, thoughtful acquisitions that fit in to our business model.  That\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for.", "Also, a topic that I know you\u2019re curious about, as you know, we have a share repurchase program in place.  However, during the third quarter because of due diligence efforts on a large deal which was not successful, we were out of the market for the whole quarter.  Certainly, after today\u2019s call it allows us to reenter the market.  Also, I wanted to tell you that we\u2019re going to install as quickly as possible a Rule 10B51 plan which will allow us to continue to buy back shares during blackout periods.", "There\u2019s no doubt it will provide us more flexibility by broadening the repurchase window that we have and will help us to more effectively execute our share repurchase strategy.  The bottom line on our buy back is we think it\u2019s good for the shareholders and our plan is to be opportunistic.  With that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Jim Lipham who is our CFO who will give you a lot more details on the quarter.", "James B. Lipham ", "Before I begin my comments, I\u2019d like to highlight some changes that I\u2019m going to be making in this financial review.  Many investors and analysts have asked us to review our financial results more in line with how we manage our business so that communications from us are more useful to them.  So, we\u2019re going to make some general comments and then focus on three segments: the North America services; global services; and merchant services.", "I\u2019ll open briefly by highlighting the key three and year-to-date operating results and then conclude with some financial comments.  As Phil mentioned, we believe getting this information out to you as early as practical will assist in clearing up some of the uncertainties and clarify where we stand.  Due to this early time frame however, we do have some statistical information that we normally release each quarter, such as our account on file by type and our revenues break out by country, we don\u2019t have at this point.", "As Phil said in the press release, we do anticipate a slow upcoming holiday shopping season and with that said, we\u2019re still reaffirming our 2008 net income guidance of an increase of 5% to 7%.  When we look at the consolidated results for the third quarter, you see consolidated revenues before reimbursables were at $382.2 million, up 6.6% over last year and that\u2019s 2.8% up sequentially from the second quarter.", "Total revenues for the quarter were $500 million, up 9.4% over last year.  During the quarter these revenues were impacted unfavorably by about $4.7 million due to foreign currency translation.  Our total accounts on file at the end of the quarter were 355.4 million and that\u2019s a decrease of .5% from last year compared to [357] million.  Our same client transactions volumes, same client for the third quarter were 1.9 billion an increase of 3.6% compared to the 1.84 billion for the same period last year.", "The total cardholder transaction volumes for the quarter were 1.97 billion, a slight increase sequentially compared to 1.95 last quarter.  Our headcount at the end of September was 7,772 full-time employees a 15% increase over where we were last year at 6,774.  As we stated before, this increase is mainly contributable to our expansion in Europe and our call center business and the new clients that we added.  ", "Operating income at $95.9 million, that\u2019s an increase of 5.1% over last year and a decrease of 1.8% sequentially.  Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.06%.  We expect it to remain in the 35% to 36% range for the remainder of the year.  As you notice, taxes last year were much lower in the quarter primarily as a result of  us favorably settling some state income tax audits last year.  ", "Net income was $64.1 million, a decrease of 6.9% compared to last year but a sequential increase of 1.6%.  This decrease is mainly due to our net interest expense position that was created in the spin and was in the range of what we had anticipated for this quarter.  Earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $0.33 per share versus first call\u2019s estimate of $0.32 per share.  ", "As we\u2019re experiencing a decrease of levels of spend expenses each quarter as we go through.  Mainly what\u2019s left is some stock option expense, most of the one-time transition costs are now completed so the difference between earnings per share and pro forma earnings per share will be minimal as we go forward.", "Getting in to the segment highlights now looking at the North America services segment, as you know this segment includes the deconversions of several large clients from last year and that kind of put some unfavorable impacts on our quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year comparisons.  But, as we have anniversaried these deconversions this quarter, we expect an improve in the fourth quarter of 08 and in to 09.  ", "Looking at total revenues they were at $345.9 million up 6.8% over last year and 2.9% sequentially.  Electronic payment processing services revenues were $190.7 million, a decrease of 1.2% compared to $193 million last year.  The other services revenues were up, they were at $50.1 million and that\u2019s an increase of 10.6% compared to $45.3 million last year.  We saw strong growth in our loyalty business as well as our domestic call center and debt collection business this quarter compared to last year.", "Reimbursable items, they increase 23.7% to $100.7 million from $81.4 million last year as this is all result of increased court costs and attorney commissions as we discussed before.  Total accounts on file for this segment was at 322.6 million, a decrease of 3.5% compared to 334.1 million a year ago.  Cardholder transactions volumes for the third quarter were 1.69 billion, a slight increase sequentially over the second quarter.  ", "The same client transaction volumes for the third quarter, this being the same clients year-over-year taking out the effect of the deconverted clients was 1.69 billion an increase of 3.8% compared to 1.63 billion last year at this time.  Year-over-year operating expenses before reimbursable items were flat.  Sequentially, operating expenses before reimbursables were up $8.3 million or 4.8% and this is mainly the result of expenses incurred in mergers and acquisitions work, some at risk performance incentives and annual merit pay raises effective on July 1, 2008.", "Our headcount at the end of September for this segment was 5,375 full-time employees, a 5% increase over last year.  The increase mainly relates to our domestic call center business as it does consolidated on the global services front.  Operating income was $63.8 million down 7.7% sequentially or $5.3 million and up $1.4 million or 2.2% year-over-year.  Our operating margin was at 18.4% and when you exclude the reimbursable items as we have done in the past, operating margin was at 26% which is in line with our guidance where we plan to stay.", "Moving on to the global services segment, total revenues there at $88.1 million for the quarter.  They\u2019re up 10.2% sequentially and up 31.9% over last year.  This segment growth is a result of increased business from existing clients as well as new business converted since last year.  The electronic payment processing services revenue was at $60 million, an increase of 24.8% compared to $48.1 million last year.", "These revenues were negatively impacted by approximately $3.9 million of foreign currency transaction adjustments.  Other services revenues were $19.1 million, an increase of 79.6% compared to the $10.6 million the same period last year.  These revenues predominately consist of our international call center business and have dramatically increased as a result of new processing business converted.", "These revenues were also negatively impacted by the foreign currency translation of approximately $1.1 million.  Our total accounts on file in the global segment ended the quarter at 32.9 million which is an increase of 43.2% compared to the 23.9 million a year ago.  Transaction volumes for the third quarter were 271.9 million an increase of 28.3% compared to the 212 million for the same period last year.  Sequentially transactions are up 2.8% compared to 264.4 million for the second quarter.  ", "Our same client transaction volumes for the third quarter were 216.6 million, an increase of 2.5 million compared to 211.4 million for the same period last year.  Operating expenses, they were at $71.3 million and they are up 29.2% compared to last year and were up 4.7% sequentially over the second quarter.  As we have completed the conversions of the new client business this year, the increase in expense growth has stabilized and the rate of revenue growth has resulted in positive productivity.  ", "Headcount in global services at the end of September is 1,617 full-time equivalent employees and that\u2019s a 66% increase over last year.  The increase obviously relates to the increase business we converted that I previously mentioned.  [Inaudible] operating income, it was at $16.8 million up $5 million or 42.7% sequentially and 45.1% over last year as we continue to maintain strong growth in our international businesses.  ", "Net impact of the foreign currency translation on this segment\u2019s operating income was unfavorable by $1.5 million.  As we look at Q4 this year we expect to see some headwinds from a stronger dollar impacting our UK and European businesses.  However, on a local currency basis we expect our business to remain strong.  Operating margin, it was 19%, that\u2019s an increase of 174 basis points over last year\u2019s 17.3%.", "Operating margin excluding reimbursable items was at 19.7% which has improved sequentially from the 15.2% we saw in the second quarter and from the 11% that we saw in the first quarter.  If we take a look at merchant services you\u2019ll see revenues before reimbursables of $58.4 million.  It was flat sequentially and down $1.1 million or 1.9% year-over-year.  Total revenues were $74.6 million down 2.1% compared to last year and flat sequentially.", "Our point-of-sale transactions continued to slow.  They were at 1.29 billion, that\u2019s an increase of 2% compared to the 1.26 billion last year.  Sequentially the POS transactions are down about 2%.  Operating income was down 5.5% or $995,000 sequentially and year-over-year it was down 9.8% or $1.9 million.  Operating margin, we continued to maintain them at 22.9%.  When you exclude reimbursable items then the margin was at 29.3 and continues to reflect management\u2019s ability to control these expenses in turbulent times.", "Now, some financial comments I want to make.  When you look at our balance sheet, as Phil said, it remains strong and relatively unlevered.  Many of our investors have asked me how we\u2019re going to use the strength of the deployment of capital post our spin off from Synovus.  As Phil said, our corporate strategy to grow shareholder value includes the use of mergers and acquisitions and share repurchases through our 10B18 plan.  ", "The use of our leverage while maintaining an investment grade credit rating should allow us to increase our leverage up to two to two and a half times our EBTIDA.  Generally, this would allow us to carry debt levels of $1.1 billion to $1.5 billion.  When we look at that deployed in support of our acquisition strategy, we\u2019re comfortable with this level given our strong cash flow.  The additional leverage may also be available when a potential acquisitions business is profitable and stable.", "We\u2019ll be able to determine our leverage capacity to include the target\u2019s EBTIDA and determining our levels of debt we can carry.  Regarding the share repurchase Phil mentioned, we are also implementing a Rule 10B51 share repurchase plan to facilitate the repurchase of shares under our program.  This program allows us to execute share repurchases during periods in which we are not in the market because of self imposed blackout periods.  It will provide us more flexibility by broadening the window for share repurchases and will help us to more effectively execute our program.", "Because we were, as Phil mentioned, extremely involved in merger and acquisition talks in the third quarter, we were unable to deploy our stock repurchase program.  This new plan will help elevate this issue in the future.  The debt on our balance sheet includes $33 million pound denominate loan that matures in January 31 of 09.  From our $420 million financing facility we drew down $168 million last December related to our spin off.  We still have $252 million available.", "We also have a long term note due to a vendor and several smaller notes related to a consolidated subsidiary.  Financially we\u2019re in great shape with $309 million of unrestricted cash and our operating cash flow year-to-date is at $283.6 million.  We have maintained our strict financial discipline in managing expenses while not stopping new initiatives.  As Phil noted earlier, our plan includes stepping up our share repurchasing and continuing to pursue attractive acquisitions that expand our share of the processing dollar and contribute to the growth of our business.", "With that Phil, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you.", "Philip W. Tomlinson ", "We thought we would take a break here and open it up to any questions before we close it out.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions)  Our first question comes from Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse.", "Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Just on the total accounts on file, it looked like it dropped, I think if I heard you right total accounts on file now is 355 million.  It dropped about 18 million or so.  Can you just talk about what\u2019s going on in that number?  Was that deconversions or is that just lower organic growth or churn in the portfolio?", "Philip W. Tomlinson ", "Mainly it\u2019s some kind of purging going on in the portfolio.  It\u2019s in the prepaid card areas mainly is what caused the decrease.", "James B. Lipham ", "These prepaid cards come and go pretty quick.  We\u2019ve got a couple of plans that we have added millions and millions of cards and once that card is used up they don\u2019t renew it.  So, you\u2019ll see more volatility in that area particularly as we get larger with prepaid.  There\u2019s been no deconversions, or if you recall I think last quarter we did have the Nordstrom\u2019s gift card deconversion, they took that back in house.", "Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Is there any idea or any way to know what the purging is going to look like going forward?  Or, how much clean up there might be to your accounts on file?", "James B. Lipham ", "I think most of the cleanup is pretty well done.  We\u2019ve got two or three clients who still have some what I would call inactive accounts, a lot of inactive accounts that they\u2019ve kept on file.  We do charge a fee for an inactive account.  But, I think most of our clients have looked at that pretty hard.  ", "Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Then just moving over to transaction volumes, I think it was 3.6% at least that was in North America, that\u2019s down quite a bit.  Can you just talk about volumes, did it fall off as the quarter ended here?  And, I guess you\u2019re assuming going forward in the guidance that that is going to get even lower?", "James B. Lipham ", "We don\u2019t it on a day-to-day basis yet.  We probably will have some trends as time passes by.  I don\u2019t know that we see if falling off a lot more than that.  We were pleasantly surprised that it held up as strong as it has.  Although, you know, we keep hearing all the grim predictions that you read about, about this holiday season but we\u2019re feeling pretty good about where we\u2019re headed in to the holiday season and that\u2019s why we reaffirmed that guidance.", "Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Just finally I guess for me, how much of the card business does Wells do in house?  And, how big is TSYS\u2019 relationship with Wells today?", "Philip W. Tomlinson ", "We do all of their commercial card processing and the consumer portfolio is processed by a competitor which is the larger portfolio.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Adam Frisch \u2013 UBS.", "Adam Frisch \u2013 UBS", "I wanted to look at the P&L for a second and the opportunity for further cost cutting.  I know you guys run pretty lean and just went through it after the deconversion and stuff but, what kind of \u2013 assuming your revenue environment becomes more and more challenging as we go through the next couple of quarters, if not years, what more opportunities do you have for cutting costs?", "Philip W. Tomlinson ", "We think we have a good group of people here who understand how to operate on a lean basis.  We\u2019ve had some good build up particularly internationally.  I don\u2019t think that we will cut cost \u2013 I don\u2019t think that we\u2019ll get in to cutting costs that would hurt growth because we do have a lot of really good things coming down the pipe that we can\u2019t announce right now.  But, we do know that we have the stomach for cutting cost should that be required.  And, it very well may be.", "I mean, we\u2019ve got plans in place and I\u2019m not going to get in to the details of them today but we\u2019ll do what we have to do.", "James B. Lipham ", "Adam, I think our guidance we have given on margin of 25% to 26% I think we can maintain that going forward.", "Adam Frisch \u2013 UBS", "That\u2019s the key thing, right?", "James B. Lipham ", "Right.", "Adam Frisch \u2013 UBS", "So long as we know that and there is room even if revenue growth continues to decelerate.  On the pipeline, I can make a pretty fair case on both the bullish and the bearish side, the bullish being that banks are going to want to outsource more stuff to save cost.  But, the bearish side that they\u2019re not going to do anything right now because they\u2019ve got other challenges to meet.  Where is your pipeline headed right now?  And, do you see sales activity better, worse or the same as it\u2019s been in the past?", "James B. Lipham ", "I think it\u2019s better really.  As you saw in the press release we\u2019ve had some people go ahead and sign, when you talk about Wal-Mart in Mexico and this home retail group in the UK.  Today we\u2019ve got 7 million or 8 million accounts in the pipeline.  That\u2019s business that\u2019s signed.  We think we\u2019re very close to signing some other business that you\u2019ll certainly recognize the names as we roll them out but we\u2019re just not there today.", "I will say that frankly you\u2019re right, it is a little harder to get people to sign their name on the dotted line today.  But, as I said in my opening remarks, I believe we do have a new day and the term I use, new market realities, I think is a term you\u2019re going to hear from us a lot.  The world has changed and there\u2019s a lot of disruption out there and we do believe disruption is a good thing for TSYS.", "I go back to what I was talking about all these new rules that the Federal Reserve has enacted.  We haven\u2019t seen that yet, we\u2019ve seen drafts of it but we\u2019ve talked to banks that say, \u201cIt\u2019s going to take everything I can ramp up for the next year to get that done.  So, I won\u2019t get anything else done.\u201d  It\u2019s pretty straightforward to us.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s a good project but it\u2019s not a life and death issue here.  We can push it forward pretty easily.", "Adam, you\u2019re right, you can argue the bear side or the bull side, we\u2019re going to argue the bull side today.  We\u2019re thinking that this environment, as bad as it is, long term will be good for TSYS.", "Adam Frisch \u2013 UBS", "Last two housekeeping issues maybe for you Jim.  What are you doing to address the fx headwinds both with the Euro \u2013 I don\u2019t even know if there are going to be headwinds anymore, I mean it changes basically by the minute, but Canadian and Euro headwinds?  Then, on the debt side can you just talk about your borrowing costs, if they\u2019ve changed at all materially in the last few weeks and whether you have any access to commercial paper?", "James B. Lipham ", "First of all on the borrowing side, we haven\u2019t seen any changes in our debt other than we\u2019ve had some LIBOR increases here, 10 to 30 day LIBOR rate.  I mentioned the Pound loan that we had on the balance sheet that\u2019s due in January 09 and currently we have a pretty substantial gain in that loan if we decide to go ahead and pay it off which we\u2019re looking strongly at.  We said that we were going to have some headwinds on this currency translation adjustment and we will.", "We continue to look at whether or not we need to do some hedging on some of that bet as we continue to expand in Europe.  I mean, outside of that, that\u2019s about where we are.", "Adam Frisch \u2013 UBS", "The increases in your debt costs, are they material at all?", "James B. Lipham ", "No.", "Adam Frisch \u2013 UBS", "And you do not have to access the CP market, is that correct?", "James B. Lipham ", "That\u2019s right.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from [Paul Fardali \u2013 PV Investment Research].", "[Paul Fardali \u2013 PV Investment Research]", "First question is on the margins in North America, they were down a bit sequentially, were there any one-time factors in there?  I heard you talk about the acquisition that didn\u2019t happen, anything material that impacted that?", "James B. Lipham ", "Not anything material.  We had, like I said, some merger and acquisition stuff and we had some changes in some of our benefit options and then the salary increases that went in July this quarter.  But, outside of that there\u2019s nothing really unusual.", "[Paul Fardali \u2013 PV Investment Research]", "Then you\u2019ve mentioned guidance and the fact that you reaffirmed it should give people some comfort but maybe if you can give us anymore color on what type of environment you\u2019re comfortable with as far as the fourth quarter in terms of being able to hit those numbers?  Do you assume kind of a continued weakening in the environment or what type of environment are you guys comfortable with?", "James B. Lipham ", "I think we\u2019ve assumed that the market will continue to weaken somewhat for the fourth quarter.  I\u2019m reluctant to try to predict anything anymore but we do have some good business coming on.  We know what we can do expense wise and we feel good that we\u2019ll be there at the end of the day.", "[Paul Fardali \u2013 PV Investment Research]", "Then I guess the continuation of that question is obviously I think people are also worried about 09.  Do you maybe want to take this opportunity to give us any comments on 09?  I know it\u2019s early and a lots changing but what kind of outlook you guys might be looking at there?", "James B. Lipham ", "Paul, we\u2019ve got a lot of good business coming on in 09 but I\u2019d be run out of the room if I predicted what I thought might happen in 09 right now.  I\u2019ve got about 12 people in here glaring at me right now for just saying that.  I will let you know that we\u2019re in the beginning stages of our budget process so we\u2019ll know more about that later on.", "[Paul Fardali \u2013 PV Investment Research]", "Then international margins bounced back pretty nicely.  I think you guys were talking about 20% by the end of the year and you\u2019re already pretty much there.  Is that the kind of level we should look at you guys maintaining?  I know with a lot of new business coming on that could impact that a little bit but is this kind of where we should be right now do you think?", "James B. Lipham ", "I think it probably is.  We\u2019re going to continue to add new business and over time it will certainly expand.  Paul, I will go back to I think it was the first quarter when the margins were 11% and we took a hit from a couple of analyst that possibly didn\u2019t quite understand what we were doing and we\u2019ll take responsibility for that.  But, we\u2019ve done in international margins exactly what we said we will do and I think that\u2019s important in today\u2019s time.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Robert Dodd \u2013 Morgan, Keegan & Company, Inc.", "Robert Dodd \u2013 Morgan, Keegan & Company, Inc.", "Going back to this question about the federals and implementation, as you said a lot of the banks out there have very old systems, it takes a long time to get up to speed there which is a plus for you.  What\u2019s the fastest conversion time you could do on a material size portfolio?  Because, if it takes 18 months to convert a portfolio, the banks just have to do the work in house and they can\u2019t outsource to you in time anyway.  So, can you give us a run through on how the timing of all that works?", "James B. Lipham ", "Well, I think in today\u2019s world we could probably do a good size conversion faster than ever because we really want to add new business.  But, I think realistically we would be looking at six to nine months if somebody signed today.  The problem you get in to in our world and the world of credit cards is typically from late October, first of November through the end of the year there\u2019s virtually a freeze on anything like that happening because nobody wants to make any real serious changes through the holiday season because there\u2019s so much volume that goes on.", "Robert Dodd \u2013 Morgan, Keegan & Company, Inc.", "You\u2019re relatively, and I said relatively, underexposed to the debit markets which transactions there and cards there have been hanging in a little better.  What are you looking to do to expand your focus there?  Obviously acquisitions is one potential but can you give us a bit of an update on your debt strategy here?", "James B. Lipham ", "Well I think that we will roll out some new debit products before year end.  We have, as you know over years past we\u2019ve tried on several occasions to buy a switch.  We were unsuccessful in that.  Who knows, maybe an opportunity will come up in that area again, I\u2019m not aware of any but anything can happen.  We want to be larger in debit and we do have a strategy that I\u2019m not prepared to get in to the details of it this morning but I think when we roll it out you\u2019ll like it.", "Robert Dodd \u2013 Morgan, Keegan & Company, Inc.", "Just two more kind of housekeeping ones, again going back to the currency issue, obviously you have a good amount of exposure to the Sterling both on the revenue side and on the cost side.  Today, do you do any hedging with Sterling, Euro or anything like that to match up your revenues with your expenses?  Or, are we just looking at straight translation on those issues for the near future at least?", "James B. Lipham ", "It\u2019s straight translation.  We don\u2019t do any hedging at this point.", "Robert Dodd \u2013 Morgan, Keegan & Company, Inc.", "Lastly, on the buyback could you just tell us how much you\u2019ve got left on the authorization?  I don\u2019t know if that was provided.  Then how, you said you could draw down $1 billion of debt, how much of that would you be willing to use for a buy back given your stock is where it is today?", "James B. Lipham ", "We\u2019ve got 7.8 million shares left on the current repurchase program that\u2019s been approved by our board and we think that is certainly adequate for where we\u2019re at today.  As I said earlier, we\u2019re going to be opportunistic with that.  We think that\u2019s good for the company, good for the shareholders, it\u2019s a great buy right now.  We\u2019re just hoping that when we get in the market we can make some kind of difference because I\u2019m probably like most of you on the phone today, it scares me that the market seems to be bottomless almost.  We need to hit bottom and bounce back.", "At this point we don\u2019t have any plans to take on debt to buy shares back.  We\u2019ve got $300 plus million in cash sitting here.  We have very strong free cash flow, as you know we\u2019re building up cash every month.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Nick Fiskens \u2013 Stephens, Inc.", "Nick Fiskens \u2013 Stephens, Inc.", "Can you remind me, if you look at that JP Morgan contract if they do bring Wachovia in house what changes in the economics with JP Morgan?", "James B. Lipham ", "You mean if they bring WaMu in?", "Nick Fiskens \u2013 Stephens, Inc.", "Yes.", "James B. Lipham ", "We do have the ability and I don\u2019t have the details of that in front of me but for some period of time we can get paid on a tranche basis as they increase substantially the number of accounts they process.  The price would go up somewhat but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything dramatic.  It certainly wouldn\u2019t be anything close to $1 per $1.  Now again, we don\u2019t expect that to leave any time soon and we\u2019re hoping it will be here a while.", "Nick Fiskens \u2013 Stephens, Inc.", "Would you say like $0.10 or $0.20 on the $1?", "James B. Lipham ", "No, I wouldn\u2019t.  I can\u2019t answer that right now.", "Nick Fiskens \u2013 Stephens, Inc.", "Then on Wachovia, is their consumer larger or smaller than Wells?", "James B. Lipham ", "Smaller.", "Nick Fiskens \u2013 Stephens, Inc.", "Do you have any insight on what Wells is paying to your competitor versus what you get paid by Wachovia?", "James B. Lipham ", "No.  But, I\u2019d have to say it would be a competitive price.  Wells is a hard bargainer and I\u2019m sure they would have a competitive price.  Certainly we will, if given the opportunity, we will be very aggressive in trying to retain that business and get more.", "Nick Fiskens \u2013 Stephens, Inc.", "Do you have any idea how much smaller that card portfolio is?", "James B. Lipham ", "I don\u2019t.  You can probably look at some of these trade publications but, I would say Wells is at least double.", "Nick Fiskens \u2013 Stephens, Inc.", "Given what\u2019s going on in the marketplace, where are you seeing the most dramatic slowdown in your business?", "James B. Lipham ", "I would say that the merchant side of the house has slowed down more than what we had hoped, the merchant acquiring, the merchant processing side.  The transactions, you may think I\u2019m crazy thinking this but I think transactions have held up pretty well.  ", "Nick Fiskens \u2013 Stephens, Inc.", "Are you comparing that to the last downturn?  That 3.6%?", "James B. Lipham ", "Yes.  It didn\u2019t get quite that bad the last go around in 2000, 2003 but we\u2019ve obviously got bigger issues this time going around.  But, I think \u2013 I\u2019ll close out talking about the health of this company but when you start looking at the fact that we continue to grow, that our North American services revenue increased by 6.8%, that global revenues increased by 32%, that we improved our operating margin internationally by 174 basis points, we were talking about that earlier, up to 19%.  We\u2019re feeling pretty good about where we\u2019re at.", "We worry about consolidation.  As I have said on many, many occasions, consolidation is our big enemy.  We win on consolidation but you can lose on consolidation.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Timothy Willi \u2013 Avondale Partners, LLC. ", "Timothy Willi \u2013 Avondale Partners, LLC.", "Two questions if I could, one is Phil could you talk a little bit about any kind of change in the pricing discussions as you are pursuing the pipeline?  Are people trying to take advantage of a slow market to be much more aggressive in their pricing demands thinking you\u2019re in some kind of position of weakness or chasing growth?  Or, are the discussion pretty much as they have always been in terms of pricing?", "Philip W. Tomlinson ", "It\u2019s pretty interesting, we haven\u2019t had a big rush to come pound on us over pricing.  We\u2019ve renewed three or four contracts here recently.  Again, as I\u2019ve said before, we always have to negotiate prices on a pretty aggressive basis but the truth is we don\u2019t see anything unusual happening there.", "Timothy Willi \u2013 Avondale Partners, LLC.", "My second question was in the sort of traditional card processing and support business, can you give us any feel for what portion of the revenue stream there is tied to the actual activity of the card versus just sort of the monthly maintenance of the files, the statementing, the customer service, etc.?", "Philip W. Tomlinson ", "I believe it\u2019s about 24%.  We are seeing some things really pick up, like our fraud and risk services, the revenue for those in today\u2019s world have really jumped.  I was just handed a note, in my old age I\u2019m getting slow but I\u2019ve been reminded that 24% is of electronic payment services revenue not the total revenue.  So, just the transaction revenue, that $250 million.", "Timothy Willi \u2013 Avondale Partners, LLC.", "Is there any other revenue this quarter that was out of the ordinary?  Any kind of big project work or something along those lines or is this actually a pretty good run rate looking forward?", "James B. Lipham ", "I think it\u2019s a pretty good run rate.  There wasn\u2019t anything unusual here.  This has got the good growth in it from Europe.  But, I think the numbers should be around the $68 million is pretty good.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from [Garv Vora] \u2013 Raymond James.", "[Garv Vora] \u2013 Raymond James", "Just one quick question, one of your largest growth drivers is the global services division and with the financial turmoil spreading from the US to overseas now, how much of this financial turmoil being spread is factored in to your guidance?", "James B. Lipham ", "Well, we think we\u2019ve got our guidance right obviously.  Frankly, we saw a slowdown in Europe in transactions about the same time we started seeing it in the US.  We\u2019re feeling good about that.  We are adding a lot of new business and we\u2019re adding it at good margins so we feel good about that.  It\u2019s factored slow but it\u2019s not factored at catastrophic I guess is a way to put it.", "[Garv Vora] \u2013 Raymond James", "And is this something that you see spreading in to \u201809 also since it\u2019s started later than the US?", "James B. Lipham ", "No, not particularly.  I think the business has slowed down, we\u2019re still feeling good about where we\u2019re at, we\u2019re still doing good.  We think we can keep our margins where they\u2019re at and we think we\u2019re going to make our guidance.", "Operator, we promised to let these folks go at nine o\u2019clock and we\u2019d like to cut off the questions.  Anybody that has any additional questions of course, you can call Shawn and we\u2019re available all day.  I wanted to close and it\u2019s probably a little bit longer than what I would do but I wanted to tell you about a great company and that company is TSYS.", "You know that I normally don\u2019t spend much time talking about our balance sheet but in today\u2019s world I think it is an in your face kind of topic and to use an old southern term, our balance sheet is as strong as potash.  Our credit ratings are stable, our operating results are good for the third quarter and will be good for the rest of the year.  We have very little debt, we have, as we mentioned earlier, over $300 million in cash, we have a strong free cash flow.", "We have top line growth, good growth and as you heard me say many times in the past, we don\u2019t have credit risk, we\u2019re not in that business.  We continue to grow as evidenced by the release we set out yesterday, First Citizens in Raleigh, Wal-Mart in Mexico, Metro Financer in Mexico, Paragon Benefits in the healthcare side, Argos and Homebase, two of the real key components of the largest retail group in the UK and we\u2019re winning in without a doubt the most chaotic time in my life and probably since the Great Depression.", "We\u2019ve always said that our secret sauce is our people and they\u2019ve raised their game to meet today\u2019s challenges.  We just spent two days offsite reviewing each business and the growth plans for the future and I\u2019ll assure you their energy and passion is stronger than ever.  Our leaders, the folks in this room that are listening to this call are driving this business to become more diverse through a whole variety of service and product offerings.  Whether it\u2019s loyalty, prepaid, managed services or merchant servicing, our entire team of over 8,000 is committed to winning in this business.", "Over the next several months we\u2019ll announce more successes, some domestic, some international including consumer, commercial, fleet and retail card programs.  Around the global we\u2019re increasing our emphasis on cross selling and cross selling these value added services and products such as risk management, fraud detection and Internet services which will have significant growth and they have bigger margins.  ", "I think another key is we\u2019ve proven in the past that we can effectively manage through bad news and hard economic times.  Finally, from a valuation perspective, we are absolutely one of the more undervalued stocks in our segment.  Today, we\u2019re trading at a 10.3 PE multiple compared to our median peer average of 12.5 and that\u2019s a 17% discount that we\u2019re below the group.  We don\u2019t get that.  We just don\u2019t see that.  ", "We think that\u2019s especially interesting when we have the lowest leverage which gives us really more flexibility and staying power.  At the end of the day when all is said and done, we\u2019re convinced that good companies with strong financials will be rewarded and we\u2019re one of those companies today and we are committed to continuing to be one of those on a go forward basis.  ", "Thank you for your interest in TSYS and thank you for being flexible in working with us with the change of the date of this call.  We hope that you\u2019ll continue to be interested and watch us as we go forward and succeed.  Thank you for being with us today", "Operator", "", "This does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

(NYSE:TSS) Q4 2008 Earnings Call January 27, 2009  5:00 PM ET", "Executives", "Philip Tomlinson \u2013 Chairman, CEO", "James Lipham \u2013 Chief Executive Officer", "Analysts", "Bryan Keene \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Glenn Fodor \u2013 UBS", "[Paul Butterlie]", "Operator", "Welcome to the TSYS sponsored fourth quarter 2008 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Director of Investor Relations, Shawn Roberts.", "Shawn Roberts", "Before we get started we want to call your attention to the fact that we'll be making some forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS's actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in the TSYS's reports filed with the SEC. At this time, I'd like to turn it over to TSYS Chairman and CEO, Phil Tomlinson.", "Philip Tomlinson", "Welcome everybody to our fourth quarter analyst call. Thanks for joining us today to discuss the fourth quarter and 2008 year end results. As usual, James Lipham, our CFO will discuss our results with you in a few moments, financial results but before he does that, I want to give you a brief recap of 2008 and then talk to you a little bit about 2009.", "2008 was our first full year of operation as a stand alone public company subsequent to our spin off from our former parent, Synovus, and frankly, I couldn't be more thrilled in how our team has dealt with that transition. During 2008 we built out numerous functions and systems which had to be shared with our parent in the past and we accomplished this build out below our budget, and most importantly we demonstrated to the world and confirmed to ourselves by our accomplishments that TSYS was ready to stand alone and the time was right for the spin off.", "Secondly, our 2008 successes in the market place demonstrated that even as the global economy has been devastated by uncertainty and recession, the market out there remains receptive to the products and services that TSYS offers. We don't spend a lot of time looking in the rear view mirror, but I would like to run down a list of our 2008 successes with you.", "First we reviewed processing agreements for longer term extensions with 14 existing clients. We signed 23 new payment agreements across the North American merchant and global services sectors. However, 2008 was not without its disappointments as we experienced the announcement of the end of our long term processing relationship with WaMu when it failed and was subsequently acquired by Chase.", "As you know, Chase will process the WaMu portfolio on the license version of our TS2 software starting somewhere around the end of the first quarter of this year.", "Wachovia is a great client, as you know was acquired by Wells. We are aggressively trying to sell our capabilities to Wells as they go through their decision process. We don't have any indication as of this conference call about their future plans on that credit card portfolio.", "Now let's talk a little bit about 2009. I'm sure that everybody on this call would agree that the world's economies are in a terrible recession and that financial institutions remain under stress, and no one expects 2009 to be an easy year. In fact, we expect 2009 to be a tough year for our customers which will certainly create headwinds for TSYS.", "We're certainly optimistic as a group and we anticipate the best outcome in every endeavor we undertake, but in today's uncertain times we try to make sure that we avoid any surprises and we don't want to surprise you, the investment community that owns and follows us. I don't want you to hear that we're not optimistic. We certainly are.", "We have great strengths and we have great abilities to retain and continue to attract new customers, but in today's world which every day it seems like brings some new and unanticipated crisis, we plan on continuing to be very transparent with you regarding our assessments and our expectations and you'll hear that transparency today.", "We expect our 2009 revenues, both total revenues and revenues before re-imbursables to be flat to up 2% over 2008 levels and our 2009 net income to be from down 3% to flat when compared to 2008. That may be hard to comprehend a little bit of that but you can see this guidance clear in the charts that are behind today's press release that was sent to you about 4:00 p.m. this afternoon.", "Certainly we're not totally thrilled with this and this is below what the TSYS norm has historically been, but in today's world when you peel the onion back we feel really good about these numbers and are excited about where we think we're going to be at. ", "Through this recession, obviously banks are building up capital, reducing exposure to risk. They're seeking opportunities to leverage economies of scale and there is certainly a heightened focus on increasing deposits and reducing expenditures or expenses while also meeting the deadlines for increased regulatory compliance and government intervention.", "As you know, the Fed just published the UDAQ rules which will be a massive effort for most any bank processing in house. We have looked at that and we feel very good about being able to do that and it's going to be pretty straightforward to us.", "We hear every day that consumer confidence in the financial services sector is at an all time low and we're working to rebuild that loss of confidence in every way we can. If you think about it, you can't buy a plane ticket or book a room or buy anything online without a card. Cards have become a utility of every day life and consumers today are certainly nervous and worried about their jobs and card spending has slowed.", "Our clients are working hard to help rebuild consumer confidence and find new and better products to offer, particularly as things begin to improve. And right now is the time for TSYS to make sure we're ready for the next growth cycle and we are convinced that cycle will come and this recession will end.", "We know that we bring innovation and value that client's demand in tough times. We believe that we're a trusted partner with our clients and we're helping them focus on profitability so they can retain their good customers. We're helping to mitigate risk and use intelligent information provided by our analytics group to make smart and wise decisions.", "Our clients want to evaluate their customer across the enterprise and get the right product to the right customer at the right time and we're committed to and making ongoing investments and enhancements to our services and technology. We're doing everything in our power to help our clients be successful and improve service levels.", "While these challenges aren't so unique, let me tell you how they translate to our business. Card issuers are faced with increasing levels of delinquencies and subsequently increasing charge offs. The ever tightening credit environment has reduced solicitations as you can tell by your own mail. It's limited the number of new development in IT projects and we've seen a slowing of card holder transactions at point of sale as evidenced by the recent holiday slowdown.", "Issuers are focused on reducing costs and wanting more for less and we have a strong history of being able to effectively manage our expenses. We're managing our costs and driving down expenses in a way like never before and I've said in years past, we're going to win by being faster, better and cheaper.", "We continue to be strong financially. We've talked about this a lot in the past. Our balance sheet remains strong and continues to improve every quarter. Our debt is very limited and it certainly is priced right. Free cash flow continues to grow and our margins remain strong. ", "On the acquisition front which is one of the key reasons for the spin, we certainly have felt pressure to do deals but I think we have been very mature in our ability to know when the time is right as well as the acquisition being right. We certainly have made good progress with our M&A capabilities and we'll talk about that a little bit later.", "So let me take just a few minutes and give you a quick sector by sector performance review of our strategy for growth in these areas. I'll talk about North America first. Our pipeline in the America's is as strong as it's ever been. We believe that every major financial institution is being forced to look at reducing cost.", "We're starting to see finally, former proponents of in sourcing that have begun to re-evaluate the cost savings of out sourcing. Many of the banks are dealing with 20 and 30 year old systems, card systems that are just patched work. You know, the code is just put together with bailing wire and most of them need pretty much a complete re-write.", "The last few that we've talked to that a re-write is anywhere from $500 million to $1 billion in investment and there's just not many people that are going to be able to do that. These new and changing rules from the Federal Reserve that I just talked about, they've got real deadlines and its prompting banks again to look out and see who can help them with something that massive.", "We can do that. Today, we're happy to announce a new client in Mexico, Unicard Mexico. It's a subsidiary of Unibanco in Brazil which is one of the largest banks in Brazil, and it's our first Mexican client to run on TS2.

It grew by 14% in 2008. This segment was negatively impacted by the currency exchange rates.

The big news in Europe that we've announced today, you seen is, we've signed Duetsche Bank. We're very proud that they've selected TSYS to serve their German charge and credit portfolios. It's a huge win in Germany and I think it absolutely increases our global footprint as well as our credibility across that continent. It is something that we are very excited about. ", "We're also proud to announce that we've signed processing payment services for PaySquare in the Benelux.

", "But compared to prior periods and sequentially the fourth quarter results of '08 do not adequately reveal the underlying strength of our Global Services segment so to help isolate the impact of that, we provided in this press release on the last page a GAP reconciliation schedule which will help you see the impacts of this true up on the exchange rates.", "We call it \"cost of currency' basis so I'm going to make reference to that as we go through here. When you look at the quarter, consolidated revenues before re-imbursables were up $377 million or 4.3% over last year. This is down about 1.6% sequentially over the third quarter and is largely impacted by the swing in that currency translation of our Global Services segment which you can see when you look back on that page.", "The increase over last year is a result of really the North American segment has had growth, internal growth of customers and the like and that's helped offset the de-converted customers that we've had since last year.", "In the Global Services segment we saw good growth again driven by the new processing business related to Cap One and Nationwide that got converted during the early part of '08.", "The Merchant Services segment growth was driven by the acquisition of Infonox as well as other growth in new services to clients. But total revenues for the quarter were $493 million, up 7.6% over last year and the total revenues during the quarter were impacted unfavorably by $18.8 million due to the foreign currency translation difference that we had from '07 to '08.", "Internal growth rate of existing clients showed an increase of 6% for the year, and this is in the revenue growth, not just the account on file. The account on file internal growth rate is about 12%, but the actual revenue is up 6%.", "Total accounts on file at the end of '08 were $352.5 million which is in the press release, and that's a decrease of 6.1% compared to $375 million a year ago. This net decrease of $23 million results as you can see there adding $22.7 million accounts for new clients and $36.5 million of internal growth of existing clients, all this helping offset the de-conversion of $35.9 million and the purging of another $46.3 million of inactive accounts.", "When you look at transactions, our same client transaction volumes for the fourth quarter were $1.91 billion and that's a decrease of 1.8% compared to $1.99 billion for the same period last year.

That's an increase of 13% over last year and a decrease of 4.9% sequentially and this sequential decrease again is a result of ETA, translation adjustment which caused a decrease of approximately $2.5 million.", "Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 31.5 and then for the year it was 34.6. Taxes in 2007 in the fourth quarter and end year to date were pretty much higher and as a result of the one time spend cost associated or due to the deconsolidation from Synovus and it was recorded in the fourth quarter of '07.", "And then when you look at '08, we had recognition of a full year of research and experimental credits, tax credits that came in in the fourth quarter that had been not allowed up to that point and so you had a pretty good criss cross affect here in taxes compared to '07 to '08.", "Net income was $66.3 million. That's an increase of 45.2% on a GAP basis compared to last year, and as I said before, the taxes played a huge part in that big growth.", "Earnings per share on a GAP basis were $0.34 versus first calls estimate of $0.33 per share and as we are experiencing decreased levels of spending expenses, each quarter principally pertaining to stock option expense, most of the one time transition costs are now completed. Going forward, we feel there will be no additional one time spend costs so this will become less of an item.", "For the year, switch over from the quarter, look at the consolidated total revenues met our guidance as did earnings per share for both GAP and excluding the one time spend expenses. ", "In spite of the currency headwinds in Q4, we had total revenue growth of 7.4% and operating income growth of 5.10% for the year. On a constant currency basis, consolidated revenues were up 9% for the year and this primarily driven North America reimbursable items was the largest driver and is mainly the attorney commissions and court costs related to our debt collection business.", "In Global Services, we had new business from processing related to services that we mentioned about Nationwide and Cap One, and then on the Merchant Services side growth driven by acquisitions and new clients.", "For the year we were able to achieve positive productivity by maintaining consolidated total expense growth below consolidated total revenue growth. For the year on non operating income it declined $18 million and that's reflected again when you consider the loss of $18 million in interest income and an increase of $8 million in interest expense along with an offset of around $8 million in other income. But that's the result of turning around to a levered position from where we were at the end of '07 prior to paying our dividend on a spend out.", "Our consolidated tax rate for '08 was 34.61 and that's again as a result of the tax credit that we recognized. We do expect our tax rate going forward to be in the 35% to 36% range as we go into '09 and beyond.", "Now a few comments on the segments, as you can see on the segment page, total revenues on North America up $342.9 million or 6% and the Electronic Payment Services line there was at $189.2 million or up 1.1% so a little increase there and we've mentioned before about how we have some new client revenues come on to offset the de-converted revenues and they pretty much offset themselves.", "We had an increase in the client amortization with the signing bonus we had on the balance sheet for WaMu as we got notification they were leaving in March we had to accelerate the write off of that which came through as a contra revenue account and that was about $2.7 million.", "On the other services line, revenues were $49.6 million. That was up 5.6% compared to prior year. We saw pretty strong growth in our commercial printing as well as our domestic call center business and debt collection this quarter compared to last year.", "Reimbursable items increased 22.3% to $99.4 million up from $81.4 million. This is a result again of the increased court costs and attorney commissions. And you can see the North America segment as well as consolidated. That's a pretty big item showing an increase of revenues.", "Total accounts on file for the U.S. our North America segment is $319 million and that's down 9.4% from prior year. Total cardholder transaction volumes for the fourth quarter were $1.689 billion. That's a slight decrease sequentially from $1.693 billion. When you look at the same client transaction volumes for the fourth quarter they were at $1.684 and that's a decrease of 1.8% when you compare to the same period last year, showing the indication there of lower sales that went on during this fourth quarter.", "Our quarterly operating expenses before reimbursable items, they were flat when you compare to the same period last year. Head count at the end of '08 was 5,337 full time equivalents. That's a 4% increase over what it was last year. And again, the growth in head count pertains to the cost center business in the domestic area just like it does in the Global Services segment.", "Operating income, it was at $64.7 million and that's up 1.5% sequentially and also 1.5% year over year. Our operating margin was at 18.9% and when you exclude reimbursable items, operating margin was at 26.6%.", "On the Global Services segment for the fourth quarter, total revenues were at $80.7 million and down 8.4% sequentially and up 14.4% over last year. On a constant currency basis, these currencies grew 41% over last year for the quarter.", "Electronic Processing Services revenues were $54.4 million and that's an increase of 9.6% over the same period last year, and they were negatively impacted also by the currency by $14.3 million. So on a constant currency basis, the Electronic payment processing would have been up 38.4% which is very good growth in our processing business.", "The other services revenues were $16 million and that's an increase of $27.9 million. On a constant currency basis, these revenues increased about 63%. These revenues predominantly consist of our international cost center business which dramatically increased as a result of new processing business converted in '08.", "Total accounts of file at the end of '08 were $33.5 million and that's an increase of 43.4% compared to $23.4 million last year, so you can see the good growth we've had in accounts. It goes along with revenues.", "You look at the volumes for the fourth quarter, there were $282.1 million and that's an increase of 23.1% compared to '08. Sequentially our transactions are up 3.6% compared to $272.1 million last quarter.", "Our operating expenses at $68.3 million. They were up 15.4% and were down about 4% sequentially. As we have completed these conversions during the year, the increase in expense growth has stabilized somewhat and the rate revenue growth has resulted in positive productivity.", "On a constant currency basis, these expenses grew 40.4%. Head count at the end of '08 was 1,908 full time people. That's a 69% increase and we've mentioned before that big increase came in cost center business and good growth that we had with two big clients that we put on in '08.", "Operating income was $12.4 million. That's down $4.3 million or 25.8% sequentially and that's primarily due to the CPA affects, but were up 9.2% over the fourth quarter of last year as we continue to maintain strong growth in our international business.", "The net impact of foreign currency on the segments fourth quarter operating income was an unfavorable amount of about $4 million. Operating income was 15.4%, and that's a decrease of 70 basis points compared to last year's 16.1%.", "We look now at the Merchant Services segment, we look at the fourth quarter revenues before re-imbursables at $62.7 million. They're up $4.3 million or 7.4%. Total revenues were $78.7 million, up 7.3% compared to last year. The growth here in revenues is a result of the acquisition of Infonox as well as some new client business that came on during '08.", "On a point of sale transactions, they were at $1.24 billion. That's an increase of 1% compared to the $1.23 billion last year. Sequentially they were actually down 4%, showing the drop in the Christmas volumes that went on during the fourth quarter.", "In head count we finished '08 at 865 full time people. That's a 27% increase over prior year and really equates to the increase in people due to the acquisition of Infonox I mentioned before.", "Operating income was down 10% or $1.7 million sequentially and year over year it was down 11.7% or $2 million. The operating margin was 19.5% and then when you see the reimbursable items, it was [inaudible]. The margin at Merchant Services was impacted by purchase accounting adjustments and expenses related to a class settlement issue. That was a one time expense that came at the end of the fourth quarter.", "On the balance sheet, I'd like to highlight a few things here about how strong it is and unlevered it is, but we finished '08 with $220 million in cash and that's unrestricted cash and I think if you look at the cash flow statement I think you'll see that we generated another $355 million from cash flow from operations.", "And the $220 million that we have in cash is especially good in light of three major deals that we did are significant cash outlays that we had this year that are non recurring. We did the acquisition of Infonox in the fourth quarter for $50.9 million cash and then we were active in our share of repurchase agreement where we bought back $35.7 million worth of stock.", "And the debt repayment, we had a debt repayment to the Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi during the year of $54 million payment for that loan. When you consider that and still have the cash where it was at the beginning of the year and continuing to pay our operating expenses, it speaks well for the strength of the company and the balance sheet itself.", "Our notes payable have remained the same, down a little bit from the previous year and as you know the big item there is $168 million note with Bank of America and the consortium of banks that helped with the spin out of TSYS and that's at LIBOR plus 60 basis points, so very good rate.", "Speak just briefly about our guidance, and Phil talked some about it, but growth showed zero to plus two, It takes into consideration the weakness of the pound versus the pound and the Euro and the Yen, and we do expect some weakness to continue during the year. In North America we do anticipate growth in '09 that will offset the loss of the anticipated de-conversion. ", "You remember we talked about the internal growth we had in accounts and this past year in '08 was in excess of $36 million accounts. We do think WaMu's account is going to be around $20 million when the de-convert in March so we're hoping that next year we'll show a positive growth in the accounts.", "Global Services, we expect to have six new customers in '09. We anticipate increased head winds related to the currency in '09 to more than double the impact that we saw in '09. If you remember we talked about $21 million was the impact to revenues negatively in '09. We're expecting that to move to about $55 million when you get to '09's revenues.", "We do expect the exchange rates to stable out to where they are today. It's just that they'll be compared back to some pretty heavy rate at the first three quarters of this year.", "On the Merchant Services segment in our guidance we accounted for some good growth with the acquisition of Infonox and provided expanded services and opportunities to grow with new products and really helps our existing and will also help us with new clients.", "In summary, I'd just reiterate again that we've been several years here back to back where we've had some de-conversions going on in lost account growth. We've been able to maintain our bottom line growth or flat rate growth and it's been because of internal growth and some new business that came on and a direct response from our employees and how they've understood what's going on and hold expenses. ", "We work contracts and here we are forecasting '09 to be flat to down to slightly down and still have a decompression again, but we do have strong cash flow, good balance sheet. We don't have any credit risk. We have a little good will on the books but very small amount and we are excited about our opportunities.", "Phil, I'll turn it back over to you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Bryan Keene \u2013 Credit Suisse.", "Bryan Keene \u2013 Credit Suisse", "I just want to go over some of the pluses and minus of the accounts on file heading into next year. I guess first on the de-conversions, the only major de-conversion right now that you are estimating, is it $20 million accounts from WaMu, is that right?", "James Lipham", "That's right.", "Bryan Keene \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And there's no anticipation yet or nothing in the estimates for what might happen to the Wachovia business.", "Philip Tomlinson", "Certainly that is not a huge customer. It's a very valued customer but we don't that decision is anywhere close to be being made. It may or may not be made before the year is over, but we certainly think that we would have a chance to retain what we have and possibly get the Wells business and we're certainly going to give it our best shot.", "Bryan Keene \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Then thinking about purging of accounts, can you give us an update on how that looked particularly in the quarter and how you think about that into 2009?", "James Lipham", "I think we had roughly as I think I mentioned before, I think it was 40 million something in accounts purged and I think that's going to be I hope pretty much all. You won't see much of that going on into '09 and I just remember for sure how many of the purges went on in the fourth quarter. I'll have to try to get that number for you.", "Philip Tomlinson", "I miss-spoke a second ago. We are going to de-convert the Nordstrom business and I think that's scheduled for July/August at this point. The date keeps moving on us and that's just the latest I have. We talked about that last year, but that's in the numbers.", "Bryan Keene \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Remind me, how many accounts is Nordstrom's?", "Philip Tomlinson", "Six million.", "Bryan Keene \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Then on the flip side, just talking about new account wins or new accounts that are going to be converted on the positive side can you talk about any of those clients? For example, Deutsche Bank, are those in the numbers already?", "Philip Tomlinson", "Deutsche Bank is. Brazil is not. We don't have a firm date on when we're going to convert Brazil yet. We're getting close there. I think Deutsche Bank will convert sometime in June.", "Bryan Keene \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And Deutsche Bank is expected to be about how many accounts?", "James Lipham", "I think it's initially about 1.5 million. Somewhere in that range.", "James Lipham", "It's between one and two million. You would make a mistake in comparing that to all retail account. I mean these private label accounts, we don't generate nearly the revenue out of a private label as we would say a Visa, MasterCard. ", "There were 12 million accounts that were purged in fourth quarter. When we say purged, that's just accounts our clients have had on file and for whatever reason they become inactive and we charge for accounts for on file. So it's a small fee but we do charge for it, and that's one of the ways our clients have been trying to reduce cost over the past year.", "We think the purging business is pretty well done. I think most of the people have got as much of that as they want.", "Bryan Keene \u2013 Credit Suisse", "On operating margins when we think about it just as overall for the company, do we still believe we can get a little bit of leverage in the model or should we look flat at this point down margins.", "James Lipham", "I think what we've been saying is the 24 to 26 range. As the Global Services segment gets bigger, as we have talked about it becoming 30% of our revenue stream, we'll get some economies out of that and we'll see some improvement in that margin, hold the U.S. to where it is and see Europe getting better than they are right now.", "Bryan Keene \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "You talked about pricing and have you had a lot of larger clients come back to you and try to get a discount for your services?", "Philip Tomlinson", "I hate to say this publicly but not really. Jim just said not any more than usual. I mean that's the world we live in, but it's not like anybody's lined up at the door or anything. As we renew contracts, we typically work our way through all of those discussion. But it's not like there's some demonstration out in front of the front door trying to get lower prices. It's just not going on.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Glenn Fodor \u2013 UBS.", "Glenn Fodor \u2013 UBS", "It's Glen Fodor from UBS. Regarding your initial comments that you felt good about the numbers that you laid out there and you don't want to give any surprises to the street, just trying to see how this train of thought represents any change or approach to guidance versus prior years and help us bracket the ranges you put out there. So in prior times when things were better, maybe you would give guidance that's attainable but you'd need to pedal a little bit to get there. That said, is your approach more aimed at laying out the bare minimum forecast and we could thing of these ranges as pretty much bottom line expectations?", "Philip Tomlinson", "We're not smart enough to do a bare minimum. We always have a little stretch in there. Last year we have probably 125% of the stretch we've got today, but we do have some stretch in there and we think that we'll make it up. But it is not a cakewalk. It's not a lay up. We're going to have to work hard to get where we're at.", "Glenn Fodor \u2013 UBS", "A question on pricing, how does the contract renewal schedule look over the next 12 months? Is it heavily weighted toward the beginning of the year, the end of the year or is it pretty modest?", "", "Philip Tomlinson", "I think it's pretty straightforward. We've got one good sized customer that we, they're not our largest customer but we're trying to get them renegotiated and I think we're down to the bottom of the ninth. They're like a lot of banks. They're a little bit preoccupied with some internal issues and I have no doubt we'll resign them but it's just a continuing process. ", "We don't have a lot of big stuff going on. We don't have a lot of big renewals. We always have small ones going on. I think we've told you in the last 18 to 24 months we've pretty well tried to renew every major customer we've got on the card side and on the merchant side. We think we're in pretty good shape.", "Now that doesn't stop them from coming back and asking for a price decrease, but we don't feel required to give them one either.", "Glenn Fodor \u2013 UBS", "With the WaMu contract, I was wondering if you could walk through it in a little more detail on how we should treat this, because I know there are some gives and takes because you're taking away revenue from WaMu but then you're giving some back to J.P. Morgan on the license side and then there'll be some termination payments over several quarters. What are the moving parts here? Can you go through that?", "Philip Tomlinson", "We can't go through the termination fee. We have an agreement that we would not go into the details of that. They're going to leave as I said earlier in the March/early April is the date right now and we have no reason to expect that will change. We certainly do pick up some revenue on the license agreement, but it would be wrong to think that it's significant enough to make a real difference on the loss of the WaMu revenues.", "James Lipham", "On the termination fee, it'll be recognized over the remaining months of '09 and that's the way it's paid after the de-conversion in March. So when you get through '09, you'll have the impact of WaMu completely gone as a way of processing fee and '10 will be basically just the license fee coming from Chase.", "", "Glenn Fodor \u2013 UBS", "And was the net effect in '09 $20 million? Did I hear that right or where you talking about something else?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from [Paul Butterlie]", "[Paul Butterlie]", "On WaMu was the only thing that hit 4Q the accelerated amort? Is there any termination fees that were paid? I know you're not going to discuss any amounts but were there any termination fees paid in the quarter?", "James Lipham", "No.", "[Paul Butterlie]", "So just the accelerated amortization?", "James Lipham", "[Paul Butterlie]", "And then the settlement in the Merchant segment, you talked about a settlement that impacted that segment?", "James Lipham", "$3 million pre tax. That was on the Merchant.", "[Paul Butterlie]", "And were those the only one time larger items in the quarter?", "James Lipham", "I believe that's it.", "[Paul Butterlie]", "Looking at the guidance, it looks like it assumes a modest decline in margins, somewhere in the 24% range. I'm just wondering if you could discuss what is impacting that. It looks like a lot of it at least in 4Q was on the other operating line. Maybe you could just talk about what happened in 4Q on the other operating expenses and kind of how you're looking at margins in '09.", "James Lipham", "I think when you look at the margins, if you look at it on a constant currency basis you won't see that decline. I believe what you're look at is the translated numbers and it's drawing that margin way down. I believe Europe on a constant currency would be in the 19% range versus where it is today. ", "If you look at that constant currency page at the end of the press release you can see the better margins reported if you back out the translation effect.", "[Paul Butterlie]", "But the currency impact is just kind of a straight margin, right? There's no hedging or anything else that impacts that?", "James Lipham", "That's correct.", "[Paul Butterlie]", "So there's really not going to be a huge impact on margins is there? I mean the international business is roughly in line with the corporate average or a little bit below?", "James Lipham", "As far as the 26% margin that we had here in the U.S. on the North American side, Merchants suffered a little bit but that was mainly because they got hit with that arbitration settlement at the end of the fourth quarter, so it messed up their fourth quarter margins a little bit. But we still believe our margins are going to run in the 24% to 26% range and as we said before, as Europe gets bigger and scales, we'll be able to bring margins up a little bit hopefully.", "[Paul Butterlie]", "In 4Q, there was other income that looked like it was quite a bit higher. What was that from? About $5 million or so.", "James Lipham", "Other than CTA I can't think of what it would be. The cost center business and CTA.", "[Paul Butterlie]", "Looking at the balance sheet, debt was down $50 million in the fourth quarter. Was that the note you talked about paying back?", "James Lipham", "That's correct.", "[Paul Butterlie]", "You did buy back some stock but I'm just wondering how you're thinking about the share buy back versus very cheap debt at these levels and given where your stock is trading, I'm just curious about what you think about as far as share buy backs and really why not be more aggressive on the share buy backs here.", "Philip Tomlinson", "We talked about this on the last quarter call. We certainly do have a stock buy back in place as an ongoing argument as to whether you should buy the stock back or say you try to buy something to grow the business. My theory is, in today's financing environment, we need to save our cash to try to buy something that can add value to the bottom line of this company.", "That could change if the financing environment gets worse, but I don't expect it to change any time soon. That's our strategy, and that's what we're looking at now. We can start to buy back when we feel like it or when we think it's required, but at this point in time, we've got a few things we're looking at and we would really like to see if we could make something happen.", "James Lipham", "I could add to that if you look at the markets today, they're starting to open up a little bit but you're looking at rates that are a lot higher than what we've got debt at. We do have part of our financing facility as you know we put it in place for $420 million at LIBOR plus 60 so we could go get that probably. That's the extent of it.", "Operator", "That appears to be all the time we have for questions. I'd like to turn the floor back over to the speakers for any closing comments they'd like to make.", "Philip Tomlinson", "I'll close it out. Before I close I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the passing of one of our great directors, Griffin B. Bell. Judge Bell was a former Attorney General. He was a Federal Judge and for years he was a managing partner in King and Spaulding, the largest law firm in the south. He was a TSYS Director for 20 years and helped TSYS and our Board dynamics in more ways than most people would know. Judge Bell would have been welcomed on any Board in the world, and he chose TSYS. And we loved him and we'll miss him so much.", "There's not a whole lot we can do about this economic environment. It certainly is a challenge but we do believe that we offer a service that is needed and good in bad times. In fact, I strongly believe issuers and suppliers need TSYS more now than ever. Most all of our products we believe are the gold standard and we can compete and we have shown we can continue to win in this environment.", "I'm more optimistic today than ever before about future opportunities here at TSYS. Remember if you walk away with one thing, we love, historically we've loved being associated with banks and we still love banks because a lot of them are our clients, but we're not a bank and we don't make loans.", "We process payments, credit, debit, pre-paid and we believe that in times of crisis, opportunities are going to arise for TSYS. We grew up in this business. We know how to manage it in good and hard times. We'll continue to become more diverse with expanded service and product offerings. Our pipeline is growing as evidenced by today.", "We have a passionate and driven team with a great will to win and we're in the game and better equipped each day for the next growth stage which will come. We're working hard to ensure that we do everything possible to help our client's weather this storm and we believe we'll succeed in coming out of this for lack of a better term, economic wilderness, and be better for it.", "Remember, my goal is to be better, faster and cheaper than anybody else in the world. And with that great technology and our secret sauce, which is our team of people, we believe we'll continue to be successful in this business as we go forward.

(NYSE:TSS) Q1 2009 Earnings Call April 28, 2009  5:00 PM ET", "\t", "Executives", "Shawn Roberts - IR", "Phil Tomlinson - Chairman and CEO", "Jimmy Lipham \u2013 SEVP and CFO", "Analysts", "Glenn Fodor - UBS", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "Darren Peller", "Wayne Johnson", "Brett Huff", "Craig Maurer", "Julio Conntearous", "James Friedman", "Glenn Greene", "Jason Kupferberg", "John Williams", "", "Operator", "", "Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the TSYS-sponsored First Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are placed on a listen-only mode. And the floor will be opened for your questions and comments following the presentation.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host Shawn Roberts. Sir, the floor is yours.", "Shawn Roberts", "Thanks, Dave. Before we get started, we want to call your attention to the fact that we will be making forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS's actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in the TSYS's reports, filed with the SEC.", "At this point, I would like to turn it over to the Chairman and CEO in TSYS, Phil Tomlinson.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thanks Shawn and thank you for joining us today for our first quarter earnings call. I hope everyone has been able to take a moment and review our earnings release, which was issued earlier today.", "I don't think there is any doubt. The big news today is the reduction in guidance for 2009, the sale of Total Debt Management and the Carrefour announcement. Needless to say, we are very disappointed about the guidance, but we felt it necessary in the light of the continued deterioration of the card issuing business and just the economy in general, it's no new news to you, but unemployment has continued to climb delinquencies and subsequent charge-offs are at record levels really around the globe.", "Over 30-day delinquency seem to be tracking right along with the unemployment rate at least here in the States. Major issuers this week are reporting volume reductions in the 9% to 18% range, and we are very happy that we do have an advantage charging by the transaction. But when transactions are down that much, when volume is down that much, it does have an effect.", "The fed has obviously mandated extensive new card regulations and congress has even more plans as we said before. Our clients as a whole are laboring with all these issues. In many cases, they are having more difficult issues at the respective banks than just at the card businesses, as you are well aware of.", "Our North American organic growth went down, went negative 1.3% for the first time that I can recall. Card transactions declined 4.3% for the quarter and declined in really revenue for products and projects in general declined.", "In addition, like many companies with international operations, we are being hammered by the currency exchange, and Jim Lipham will talk to you in a lot more details about all these issues.", "In 2004, I used the term perfect storm. But today's world has proven to be more than just a storm. We have decided to sell Total Debt Management, which was a wholly owned sub of ours that was involved in the collection and bankruptcy processing business.", "We have good people throughout that organization, but the business model, the synergies the margins have not proven to be what we had originally planned and hoped for. There is one really good thing about this. It certainly will improve our margins. We expect that to happen in the near-future.", "All of that said, we are not happy with our current position. I truly believe that what you do in difficult times, determines how you rebound when the economy improves. And I've challenged our executive team that now is the time to do whatever it takes to grow revenue and reduce expenses.", "Our long-term goal, obviously, is to raise our financial performance back to historic levels. I really want everybody on the phone to understand that our energies are truly focused on growing revenue and reducing expenses. We have got to add muscle and cut fat. Now more than ever, we have to be smatter and cost-effect in the way we operate this business.", "There is a couple of things though that caveats to that. We won't cut muscle that supports current clients or clients in the conversion process, or investment in expanding our geography or products. We think that's where the future lies.", "Our clients and prospective clients need these products and services that we offer. The pressures of this recession, and we have talked about it on many occasions and the knowledge that they gain really in even more competitive world present great opportunities for us and we are having good conversations with a lot of people around the world.", "As this economy improves and it will, one thing that will remain constant is the need to reduce expenses and generate revenue. And that's really what TSYS products and services enable our clients to do.", "Now I want to turn it over to our CFO, Jim Lipham for the details, and after questions I will have closing remarks about future direction, Jimmy?", "Jimmy Lipham", "Thanks, Phil. My financial report today I want to address, first of all some of the highlights for the first quarter, and then I'll take a few minutes and walk you through the guidance the main changes to our guidance for the remainder of '09.", "When you look at the income statements, start with revenues. There are two main items in there, Phil touched on currency. And just to let you know, the strengthening of the US dollar against the British pound and euro continued to negatively impact us during this quarter.", "Year-over-year in Q1, the average exchange rate for the British pound declined 28% and euro declined 11%. What this equated to us is a negative reduction of revenue of $22.6 million when you look over quarter over quarter.", "Also, he mentioned around the discontinued operations of Total Debt Management. This required us to move $66.8 million of revenues out of '09, and restate '08 by $41.9 million. So these two items alone were pretty big and in fact of our consolidated revenues decreasing 2.6% year-over-year.", "When you adjust the TDM on pro forma basis, not pro forma, but non-GAAP basis if you take TDM, put them back and take care of the currency rate, we would have been up 7.9% in revenues.", "But outside of that there were few items that affected revenues during the quarter. First being the internal organic growth rate of the existing clients and our electronic payment area for North America. As Phil mentioned, that we are down 1.3%, and that's the first time I remember that ever happening.", "Last year during the first quarter of '08, we saw growth of 10.8%. So it's quite a shift from where we were at year ago. Phil mentioned the consolidated client transactions, they were down 4.3% to $1.7 billion from $1.8 billion last year at this time.", "We also had a reduction in revenues due to the accelerated amortization of assigning incentive for the WaMu de-conversion about $2.2 million. So that hit us in this first quarter. When you look at our merchant business, it's up 6.1% and is direct result of the Infonox acquisition we had in the Q4 of last year.", "And also, we have got a new client to sell the books this year, we are charge back volumes pretty large that have helped. And then the point of sale volumes of TISS acquiring are up1%.", "We attribute a lot of that to be in the mid-sized merchants that predominant on our system there. In the other services revenue line this consists mainly of our loyalty business and our call center business. You can see it's up 4.6%, quarter-over-quarter. And probably would have been up a lot higher without the currency translation that hit us in Europe, but year ago versus 4.6 and good number for us.", "So overall total revenues are down 2.6. If you move to the expense side, our operating expenses benefited by 19.3 million from the currency translation, which obviously works as a natural hedge, partially offset the impact of the $22.6 million, loss of revenues that we had.", "The investments we are making in our infrastructure mainly people costs associated with a new clients in Europe and expansion in Brazil increased operating expenses and reduced our margins in our international segment in the quarter much the same as it did last year.", "As these conversions are completed later this year, margins will improve. Our headcount at the end was 8,068 employees an increase of 6.9% compared to 7,500 last year. The main changes here are the addition of Infonox brought on 111 people. At the end of the year, we had expansion in managed services area, call center business about 87 people, international. International expansion in Russia brought on 92 people, so those were the main three areas of growth in the headcount number.", "But overall, our total expenses before reimbursables were pretty flat year-over-year, and that's a good sign. Obviously the currency helped offset some of the growth. When you look at the margins, consolidated operating margin, excluding reimbursable items we were at 22.6%, the same compared to 24.4% last year.", "Historically our margins in the first two quarters have been lower than our full year results, and we expect improvement as the year progresses. Our International segment's operating margin was 8.51% compared to 10.96% at the same time last year. As I noted earlier, we look for improvement as conversions are completed in the second half of the year, in advance to the 13% to 15% range for the year.", "If you look at earnings per share, for the quarter we are at $0.24 of net income, and $0.26 from continuing operations. Some of the major items, there are  really three of them that pertain to operating income, and two pertain to non-operating income, and I want to walk you through those.", "First of all on operating income, we had that accelerated amortization of $2.2 million, on the client incentives. We had a process of near about $1.9 million, it was a one-time item. Then we have a currency translation loss of $3.3 million. And that's the loss generated from the $22 million of loss revenues, $19 million of positive effects on expenses.", "So overall, operating income suffered $7.4 million. After-tax, that would equate to about $2.04 a share. On the non-operating items that hit us, we had a one-time client resolution of $3.7 million, pertaining the to TDM operation, then we had some CTA losses of about $800,000.", "So overall the total pre-tax hits that we had were $11.9 million, after-tax, that's $7.6 million, or $3.08 a share. And our original budget we forecasted for the first quarter to be at $27.3 cents a share. So without those items, we would have been pretty close to that.", "Balance sheet, I want to flip over to it, hit a few items there, just comment on two things really. We have continued to have very strong balance sheet, our unrestricted cash position at the end of first quarter is at $271 million. That's an increase of $60 million since December of '08.", "Also when you look at the liability side, understand we got tremendous amount of unused debt capacity that we will deploy in conjunction with our strategic plans as we go forward.", "If you look at the cash flow, cash flow from operations continue to generate very strong cash with $98.7 million of cash being produced in the first three months. In addition, our free cash flow at the end of the first quarter was $73.7 million, which was an increase of 15.7% compared to $63.7 million last year.", "Now I would like to move on to the updated guidance for '09, and go through really two parts. The first part had to do with the removal of TDM into the discontinued operations and just to summarize that for you.", "Revenues before reimbursables were reduced $39.1 million. And then reimbursable items were reduced $204.3 million, total revenues then been reduced $243.4 million. This equated operating profit of $2.7 million was taken out net income of $1.8 million was taken out.", "Now the other part of the changes to guidance had to do with as a result of the first quarter, and some things that had changed from what we had in the forecast. The first one being our initial estimate of the impact of currency on 2009 was a decrease in revenue of $55 million. After three months in revised forecast that we see, we now anticipate an additional $10 million negative impact on currency translation bringing the total to $65 million negative for '09.", "We also had price negotiations and discounts associated with clients qualifying for volume tier pricing, and this result in another $10 million reduction in revenues for the remainder of '09.", "Our estimated reimbursables, we lowered those to $13 million and that's due to decreases in volume mainly. Then the last item here, as we analyzed all the client activity during the first three months and comparing the entire original estimates, and we now believe these trends that we have seen in the first quarter are going to continue or be further end of the year than we initially anticipated.", "So as a result of that we brought revenues down due to volumes by $26 million. In summary, total revenues were reduced $302 million with $243 million due to TDM, and $59 million as I just mentioned.", "In conjunction with this decrease in revenue, we did lower expenses $34 million, we increased our non-operating expenses $8 million for CTA changes and interest income decreases that we anticipate for the rest of the year. These resulted our total in a pre-tax income reduction of $33 million. When you reduce the income, $33 million it reduced taxes $12 million, which produced the bottom line effect of $26 million to $29 million.", "Also in there, we had the discontinued operations of TDM, which was total about $5 million from where we had in the original forecast. When you calculate earnings per share, please keep in mind as noted in the press release that the adoption of EITF 03-6-1, and it requires prior peers to be restated. And this has resulted in a 2008 adjustment of $0.02 a share, in our previously reported earnings per share.", "As we move through these volatile economic times, we will continue to manage expenses in order to maximize our operating margins and I guess my message to leave you with here is that achieving our margin targets is a priority of managing our finances.", "And with that, Phil, I will turn it back over to you.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thank you, Jimmy. Dave, we are ready to open it up for questions now, if you are with us.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. The floor is now open for questions. (Operator Instructions). And we will take the first question from Jason Kupferberg. Your line is live.", "Glenn Fodor - UBS", "Hi, it's Glenn Fodor from UBS. Thanks for taking my question. I got the sense from the last call about the heavy account purchase would be behind us. But it was still relatively big number in the quarter. Can you talk about what happened different than your expectations and update us on how we should think about this figure for full year '09?", "Jimmy Lipham", "Glenn, it has slowed down considerably, and I really had a strong feeling that we were pretty much through with that. But we have had some purges. They are looking it up for the quarter. Wait a minute.", "In the first quarter, we had 3,800,000 accounts that were purges. What was it for fourth quarter? In the fourth quarter it was 12.5 million. So it's dropped dramatically.", "Glenn Fodor - UBS", "I'm looking at from a year-over-year type of, okay. So I guess it's kind of different measurement standpoint.", "Jimmy Lipham", "Well, you got WaMu that left, which was a pretty big number.", "Glenn Fodor - UBS", "Right. Okay, I'm looking at it differently, sorry about that. One, international margins, shifting gears a little bit. How much of impact was due to start up, due to start up expenses and capacity buildup, and was there any part of the impact that sort of wasn't expected to you?", "Jimmy Lipham", "I would say the majority of the drop in year-over-year, we went from 10.5 down to 8, and we have had more start up this year due to the Carrefour Brazil operation and the new businesses coming on over there. So we still think that our margins are going to get back to the 13%, 15% range by year end.", "Glenn Fodor - UBS", "Okay. And then last question on the last call, I didn't do the math yet from the implied guidance, but you said 24% to 26% operating margins for fiscal year '09, what's your expectation now?", "Jimmy Lipham", "I think we will still be in the 24, 26. But I believe if we can on the bottom end of the range depending on when the economy comes back.", "Glenn Fodor - UBS", "Okay. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thanks, Glen.", "Operator", "Thank you. We will take the next question from Bryan Keane. Your line is live.", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "Hi, good afternoon. Did WaMu move off already, and is that reflected in the accounts on file?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Yes. That's right.", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "And if I understand it, the WaMu loss, you get a term fee. So therefore net-net, it's a neutral effect this year. Do we have any idea when the term fee rolls off in to 2010, what kind of effect it's going to have then?", "Phil Tomlinson", "The termination fee on WaMu is spread throughout this year, and it will be over in December. And I'd say next year, obviously, you will see a big change, but the termination fee that is associated with it is not as much as the revenue was per month.", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "But the term fee obviously offset. It's still a neutral effect this year, because I assume the term fee is dropping straight to the bottom line.", "Phil Tomlinson", "It's not a neutral effect for this year. The term fee was not as much as if you would have had there ongoing monthly revenues.", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "Okay. And so there will be some a hole to grow over in 2010, but it doesn't sound like it's going to be a tremendously big number.", "Phil Tomlinson", "That's right.", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "Okay, and then just on the reduction in revenue guidance, one of it was price negotiations. Can you talk about what that was, was that planned price negotiations, because you said something about tiered volumes. But on the other hand, I didn't know that some of your clients were coming to asking for certain reductions due to the trouble they are in.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, we haven't had a lot of that yet as I said last quarter, but we did have a couple of clients that hit some pretty big tranches in just their normal tier reductions. And these are clients that have continued to grow through this process. And the other is, we do have some money in the budget for a contract renegotiation that we are going through.", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "Okay. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Of a fairly large customer.", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "Okay. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "We think it's very important to get those guys signed and put that to bid pretty quickly if we can.", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "And that's an existing large client?", "Phil Tomlinson", "That is an existing client, yes.", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "Okay, and then just finally, any de-conversions or new de-conversions to think about going forward or new account ads to think about that you will be adding over the next, let's call, by the end of the year?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, we are going to add the Deutsche Bank, and add at least parts of this Carrefour transaction, we have got a couple of others. I'm just looking at this. We have got a pretty good sized commercial card account, we have got a good sized debit card account.", "We have Deutsche Bank, as we talked about we will start up Unibanco, and we have a couple of commercial card accounts, including one that I was going to tell you about, and that's ING that we have added, so there are some good start ups there, and we are excited about it. Most of that, by the way is international.", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "And then anything on the de-conversion side, I think Nordstrom is probably still out there with some accounts, and I don't know if there is any update on Wachovia.", "Phil Tomlinson", "That's the only one that we are certainly still having conversations with, Wells and Wachovia, and as we said before, we would say that's 50-50 deal. And Wachovia is not a huge account for us. But we would still love to keep it. ", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "Great, okay. Thanks a lot.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thank you.", "Operator", "  ", "Thank you. We will take the next question from Darren Peller. Your line is open. ", "", "Darren Peller ", "Thank you. Can you just comment quickly on trends you are seeing specifically throughout the quarter with regard to transactions being processed from on a month by month basis January through March and now in to April?", " ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, most of the, certainly the transaction trends have been down, this as I said earlier, it's the first time that I can recall, I've been here a while that our organic growth or same-store sales in North America has been down. I'm sure you saw the releases this week from the really the top two or three card issuers in the country that in the world really that were down anywhere from 19% to 18% in volume wise. The trends are, I don't look for the trends to really jump forward until this economy starts improving, I mean we are so consumer driven. But I will say this is even our commercial card business has seen a decline in the transactions which is pretty unusual we think. And we think it's basically because businesses just like yours and ours have slowed down travel and conventions and all the things associated hotels, things associated with travel. ", "Darren Peller", "All right, when we look at April and March are the year-over-year trends comparable to what we saw for the full quarter? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "I think you can expect that for April and March, yes. ", "Darren Peller", "Okay. And then just touch on if you would, a bit, any new revenue potential from the UDAQ or other regulatory changes we are seeing, I know you have discussed in the past as a potential win for you down the road. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "I don't think there is any significant at this point in time, I can't tell you there is significant revenue of UDAQ. I think that the key there is that people will start changing the way they do business and we will get paid for a lot of projects as a result of that but it's still pretty early in the game and we don't have a number on that yet. We will have some revenue but I think I would be misleading you if I said it was going to be a huge number. ", "Darren Peller", "All right. And then lastly, just when you talk about expense cuts to try to mitigate some other revenue, to slow down the revenue. What kind of timing range should we be expecting is this something that we can see kind of really eating into expenses in to the third quarter or second quarter? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, I think you probably look in to the third quarter, we are working on that right now, we have been working on it our budget process was very detailed. We haven't been that long off of the budget process. I think we did feel like the economy would start to look a little bit better in the second half of the year and we just don't feel like that's going to happen now for obvious reasons. If that does get a little bit better we will be certainly much better off, but consumer has been hammered and as you know so have the banks. And so there is not a lot of people out there pulling the trigger on trying to put new products out the door.", " ", "Darren Peller", "All right, so when you say in your guidance, in your prior guidance you had said that you assumed economic stability in the second half of '09 and unemployment would be at the certain rate. Maybe you can just help us understand what the assumptions of the second half '09 really are now maybe certain metrics?", " ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Pretty much, when we did the guidance to start with, we had our organic growth and now going about 3%. So that's not going to happen. We had better exchanges rates; we had in the second half of the year, that's probably not going to happen anymore, because we got hit so hard in the first part. ", "Darren Peller", "Right. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "So, I think it's just the change that we seen from our make up of our customer base in the first quarter and it just can't get back to where we had it in the third and fourth quarter in the guidance. ", "Darren Peller", "Okay. All right. Appreciate it. ", "Shawn Roberts", "", "Thanks, Darren.", " ", "Operator", "Thank you. We will take the next question from Wayne Johnson. Your line is live. ", "Wayne Johnson", "Hi, yes, good afternoon. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Hey, Wayne. ", "Wayne Johnson", "Hi. I was wondering if you could talk little bit about the merchant processing division and what the plans are going forward here? Are there any acquisitions potentially pending over and above, I know you did the Infonox, but anything else that you see domestically because of lower valuations and multiples compared to prior years that maybe of interest?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, we have got three or four companies on our horizon, but I want to say that, I wouldn't even consider saying anything is imminent. We certainly as we told you before would like to grow that business. It did have some growth this quarter. The Infonox has turned out to probably be a better acquisition than what we originally hoped for. The products and the people have been integrated almost 100% into total acquiring solutions. We think those products probably gave us a two to three year jump on our competitors in some of the areas there we would have had to go out and developed and it is turned in, and we would have spent probably more money than we spent buying Infonox.", "We are having conversations with a lot of people around the world. We have got a lot of good things going on the fact that we, we are building cash reserves, we have our cost of credit right now is less than 2%. We would certainly like to acquire something, but the truth is we just have run across, we are looking for right now and at least we are starting to feel like there is some hope out there in this economy. I\u2019ll tell you, we seen a couple of really good players that have really had some issues, the data breech with Heartland that was our tragedy, that's a great company that we like a lot. And there certainly others out there around the world that would might make some sense for TSYS long-term. Not only when I want to say around the world, I mean there is plenty here in the US too. But there is a lot of good companies, we are having conversations whenever appropriate. And I think you can look for something to happen but I think you make a mistake putting a timeline on it at this point. ", "Wayne Johnson", "Okay. Terrific. Okay just one quick follow-up on the transaction volume trends, that you mentioned domestically, do you have any color internationally on how you are feeling about those trends and do you have any granularity on that between debit and credit? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "We don't process a lot of debit, and I don't have that, although we do have a very large debit player to us, a very large debit player that will be coming on board this year. But the truth is our international transactions are down at least the same amount. The same percentage is that what you are seeing in the US. ", "Wayne Johnson", "Is there any movement in china, any update that you have with the China Unionpay agreement or that can shed some light on how that region of the world is performing? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "We continue to sign lots of prospects there and but I think they have got about the same, well they have got a lot of same issues we got that we have in the US, and around the world. I think that there is pretty much a governor that's been set on the issuance of credit cards until the economy does improve. So, I think we will continue along pretty much in the same vain we have until these banks get in better shape. Now, we have signed some good business there, we talked about it last month the bank of East Asia, over to Hong Kong, the city debit business, we continue to do well there. I think that's the thing that's just so frustrating in this business to us is we are continuing to win, we are continuing to do well, our prospect list is very strong, it's probably well it's not probably it's this big potentially as any we ever had in our history. So, we feel like we are going to do great, but we need to get this period of time behind us. ", "Operator", "Thank you very much. We will take the next question from Brett Huff. Your line is live. ", "Brett huff", "Good afternoon. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Hey Brett. ", "Brett huff", "Just a couple of quick questions and follow-up some what people had asked before. I want to dig down a little bit if we can since the granularity you can give us on some of the assumptions on the new guidance, you had talked about a changed currency assumption. Can you give us one of the miracle thoughts on what do you expect the pound and the euro, it sounds like those are the largest exposures, what are those going to do, what you assuming for the year?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, I think what we use for the pound is around 1.5 on the second half of the year. On a forecast, the currency hit us for like 22 million this quarter probably the same next quarter and it will start tapering off and maybe hit us about 16 or so million in the third and really be down pretty low fourth quarter.", "Brett huff", "Okay. How about the euro, what assumption is that, or is that not as material? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "About 130. ", "Brett huff", "Okay. And then in terms of accounts on file. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "That is not as material as the pound.", "Brett huff", "Okay. And then any detail on accounts on file assumptions you all are making in terms of the purges and in terms of de-conversions and maybe more importantly new accounts and same-store sales?", " ", "Phil Tomlinson", "We are not making any, we are not counting on any de-conversions at this point other than what you already know about. I don't think we are prepared in this day and time to make any assumptions on new account growth but you will see some new business added. ", "Brett huff", "Okay. Any color on the same-store sales as well? Or you just saying you are not you are expecting kind of flattish?", " ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, same-store sales were flat right now, we talked about it being down 2% roughly or same-store sales. Our total transactions down four, but when you look at the same clients it down 1.5%, 2%, I think it will get better as the year goes on. ", "Brett huff", "Okay, but what about based on the press release that you all put out in the accounts on file. Is that same-store sales, do you have any thoughts on the same-store sales number for that, because it was up pretty nicely this quarter? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "I don't have that. ", "Brett huff", "Okay. And then just one other data question, I don't think I might have missed it what was the transaction number for the merchant services, did you all include that in the press release, did I just miss it? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "I don't know if that's in there. I don't think we break that out separate. ", "Brett huff", "Okay. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "We don't. ", "Brett huff", "Okay. And then in terms of the revenue from value added products sometimes you give us some color on that, I know that that can swing margins around a lot given that they are fairly high margin products, can you give us any commentary on that? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Value added was down but it's still is about 12% of consolidated total revenue. But it was, it did decrease.", " ", "Brett huff", "Decreased year-over-year or sequentially or both? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Year-over-year. ", "Brett huff", "Okay. That's helpful. And then just commentary also Jim I think you have mentioned that your internal budget you saw sort of excel some of the one timers or miscellaneous charges that you thought you would come in $0.27.", "Jimmy Lipham", "Right.", "Brett huff", "Can you give us thoughts on how you expect in so far as you can how you expect the EPS to kind of trends throughout the year, up and down, down then up, steady March?", " ", "Jimmy Lipham", "Gosh, I don't really have that here with me. Hold on one second, Brett. ", "Brett huff", "Okay, thank you. I'm done. You can go ahead and move on. Come back to that, thank you.", " ", "Shawn Roberts", "We will come back with that just a second. ", "Operator", "", "Thank you. We will take the next question from Craig Maurer. Your line is live. ", "Craig Maurer", "", "Yeah, good evening guys. I wanted to know if there was any change that you\u2019re perceiving in attitude around in-sourcing versus outsourcing in the US, if there is any continuation around what JPMorgan did or any type of color you can give us there? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "We are certainly not seeing any in-sourcing trends. As a matter of fact we are talking to several people today that would be great successes for us that are processing in-house today on old systems that are really feeling the pressure to do something big, primarily because of this economy. ", "Craig Maurer", "Thanks. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thank you, Craig. ", "Operator", "Thank you. We will take the next question from Julio Conntearous. Your line is live. ", "Julio Conntearous ", "Great. Couple of quick questions, first of all, can you guys help us decompose the revised revenue and net income, I guess specifically as it relates to the disposition of the TDM asset, so when I look at the percentage change for over 2008 the negative five to negative three now on revenues and negative 13 to negative 11 on net income, is that apples-to-apples meaning that the TDM numbers have also been scrubbed out of '08 at this point? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "That's correct. ", "Julio Conntearous", "Okay. So, can you just maybe clarify then, I might have missed it earlier, the decline in the net income but I think you sited that the revenue the margin target would then changed 24 to 26 or whatever the number is. I'm trying to reconcile why the net income numbers are dropping so much more of your margin are sustained more or less inline here? ", "Jimmy Lipham", "", "Most of the net income dropped the big drops you see is the drops in revenue that we have were really for business already owned and like Phil mentioned a while ago we are not going to, came out of the higher margin, really about 40%. When you look at the changes that we made outside of TDM and the TDM itself has very little net income, I said about a million eight. ", "Julio Conntearous", "Right. That's the exact, that\u2019s my point, is that -- ", "Jimmy Lipham", "", "So the rest of it is the stuff coming out from just the changes we made in our revenues and we did pick up some expense cuts that we can make initially and that's what we have at this point, but we are still committed to getting this margin backup and getting more expense cuts out of here. ", "Julio Conntearous ", "", "24 to 26 range, correct? ", "Jimmy Lipham", "Right. ", "Julio Conntearous", "Okay. I think you said towards the lower end? ", "Jimmy Lipham", "", "That's correct. ", "Julio Conntearous", "Okay. Then just related to that then any sense on free cash flow guidance or free cash flow number to be thinking about here? ", "Jimmy Lipham", "", "I don't think we have anything really new to add that there, it's really going on about the pace we thought it would. I don't know much, most of our growth out there is really from leased space or something like that. We are not really anything going on that I'm aware of.", " ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Two big payments. ", "Jimmy Lipham", "Dividends is all. ", "Julio Conntearous", "Okay. So, I guess I'm just trying to understand as a percentage of net income or on a free cash flow basis is there any change in your expectations for free cash flow growth or free cash flow target if you provided one? ", "Jimmy Lipham", "I don't think so, no. ", "Julio Conntearous", "So just kind of trending along with net income growth at this point is that reasonable? ", "Jimmy Lipham", "Just one second. I don't think you heard that. ", "Julio Conntearous", "All right. I'm sorry. ", "Jimmy Lipham", "Can you repeat that? ", "Julio Conntearous", "No, I was just saying is it reasonable to think free cash flow growth would be basically trending along with the net income growth at this point?", " ", "Jimmy Lipham", "Yes. ", "Julio Conntearous", "Okay. Then I guess more on a kind of a longer-term view, and thinking about this little bit more strategically assuming that credit card business does not come back this year or next year even what are the alternative options you guys are thinking about for driving growth in this business. Are there any alternative scenarios for really sort of reinvigorated the growth whether it's through M&A or through ancillary lines, what are you guys contemplating longer-term assuming that this industry remains under the kind of pressure we are under right now? ", "Jimmy Lipham", "Excuse me, first of all, we do believe that we can grow ourselves through this, but I certainly understand what you are taking about the industry and the pressure that is going to be under for some period of time. We are looking at other processing capabilities and other industries that would really fit in to closely in to what we do and I'm not prepared to go in to those today, but we have, we are discussing that and we will discuss a lot of that later this week.", "There are all sorts of things that we can do with particularly in the print business, in the transaction exchange area of I'm just trying to think, we have said that we really do want to do some acquisitions that make sense for us. I think you would have seen us already do a significant acquisition or two had the credit markets not been so bad. We did, I think I know I mentioned this in the first quarter or the January call we really pulled out a major acquisition on international basis because the credit markets just couldn't do what needed to be done. ", "So we do have some opportunities there, we would certainly like to be in the merchant acquiring business at some stage and I think we'll get there. This acquisition that we made with Infonox gives us some opportunities in the mobile space, it gives us some opportunities with some of the large retailers to do some things that I don't think anybody else in the industry or it really in the retail business is doing. And we are pretty excited about all of that. I mean this business is -- we certainly diversified and we are going to continue to diversify, but I do think in the meantime that you are going to see us add some more good business, we are certainly not giving up on this or walking away. ", "Julio Conntearous", "Okay. And then any thoughts on when you guys would contemplate even assuming there is not a lot of growth and some other priorities fall further down on the line increasing the dividend or paying out just given the kind of free cash flow that you guys are throwing off? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well we have talked about that and at this point we decided to hold cash, and we've heard 10,000 times in today's world cash is king. And we really wanted to have the cash when we decided to make an acquisition. I'm sure at some point there is a line of demarcation where that would be the smart thing to do. But it's not in the near future. ", "Julio Conntearous", "Got it. Okay guys, great thanks. And good luck. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thank you [Neil]. ", "Operator", "Thank you, we will take the next questions from James Friedman your line is live. ", "James Friedman  ", "Hi, thank you for taking my question. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Sure. ", "James Friedman  ", "With regard to -- you described as part of the rationale for the disposition of total debt management as the low margins, I was wondering if you could compare and contrast the margins in TDM versus the margins in the other services line item? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "I'd sat the TDM margins are at the lowest of anybody in that group. You got some of our printing operations, maybe carry low double-digit growth and margin. Or margin at low double-digits, and then you got some of the managed services call center area which is high singles to low double-digits. But I would say TDM is almost -- almost breakeven.", "James Friedman  ", "Okay. You were asked earlier about UDAP, and correctly you governed our expectations on UDAP, but I guess what I'm asking more generally is in your conversations with prospects, you have, what seems like a significant regulatory development surrounding UDAP, what is the remaining ingredient from our past experience that's prerequisite, you got the regulatory environment coming down and then what else do they need in order to green light a transaction like what do they need to actually purchase the next series of solutions from TSYS. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "That's a great question. And I wish I had the exact answer to it because every bank is or every issuer has different issues. I think -- honestly I think part of the problem is people are almost in shock. They've been dealing with these issues for so long. The UDAP is just another layer on the cake. I think the problem that we are seeing with most banks as I mentioned earlier is and particularly within the banking industry is they are not nearly as concerned about the card business as they are about the bank. And both the card business is certainly down but the banks typically are having these tremendous loan loss problems and not many of them have seen great progress yet. And I do think that, that will turn at some point in time. And I think we will be in better shape. But, everybody has a tipping point. And we are starting to see some good size issuers that are saying, hey I probably had enough trying to do this myself. ", "It's almost criminal to me that half of them are not running down here signing up. Because we know we can save the money, we know we can put a good product out the door and we certainly can contain and their cost on a go forward basis with good products. But like I say everybody has a tipping point, and we are certainly trying to help them get to that decision. But as I've said on many, many occasions this is a very long sales cycle and the best of times.", " ", "James Friedman  ", "And then last thing I may have missed it in the press release, but did you disclose or if you didn't, could you maybe book and the amount that you actually received for TDM? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "We don't -- that sale is still on going, I think you will be able to see that as it closes out in the second quarter it will show up in discontinued operations.", "James Friedman", "And is there a standard metric as a multiple, say, is there revenue that we should contemplate?", "Jimmy Lipham", "No. Sorry Jamie, we can't help you on that one, stay tuned. ", "James Friedman", "Yeah. All right, well that's my job. Thank you.", "Jimmy Lipham", "Thank you.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Dave, let's wait for the next question, so Jim can answer Brett Huff's question about EPS for the remainder of the year.", "Jimmy Lipham", "Brett, are you there?", "Phil Tomlinson", "He won't come back on. ", "Jimmy Lipham", "Okay. Well, as we look to earnings per share as it goes through the rest of the year, you can expect a progression from where we are today. And it's going to be up anywhere in the, I don't know, around 2 to 3 cents a share as it goes through the quarter. ", "Operator", "Excuse me gentlemen would you like me to make Mr. Huff's line live? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Yes, if you could.", " ", "Operator", "Okay Mr. Huff your line is live. ", "Brett Huff ", "Thank you, that's all I need. So you say its 2 to 3 cents sort of sequential each quarter till the end of the year. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "That's correct. ", "Brett Huff ", "Okay thanks for getting back to me, I appreciate it, Jim. ", "Jimmy Lipham", "Yeah thank you. Dave? ", "Operator", "And we will take the next question from Glenn Greene, your line is live. ", "Glenn Greene ", "Thank you. Good afternoon Phil and Jim. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Hey, Glenn, how are you? ", "Glenn Greene ", "Pretty good. Just a couple of clarification questions, one I was just hoping to just get clarification on the client and the consumer accounts roughly 19 to 20 million, from the fourth quarter. I suspect the good majority of its WaMu, but could you help us understand how much of it was WaMu and how much of it was from purges and anything else that helps to reconcile that difference to the 19 to 20 million change? ", "Jimmy Lipham", "I would say that you could probably think its over two-thirds would be WaMu. ", "Glenn Greene ", "And probably another two or three million from purged accounts? ", "Jimmy Lipham", "Right. ", "Glenn Greene ", "Okay that's helpful. And then just on back to the international margins, which obviously fell a lot, and you explained that, but I guess I wasn't exactly clear on what's going to drive the improvement in the margins back to sort of the 13% to 15% level for the year, is that manually the cost cutting initiatives or some new clients that are going to be or a combination there of. ", "Jimmy Lipham", "It's mainly new revenues coming in during the rest of this year, as the clients convert. ", "Glenn Greene ", "So expense base should be relatively stable from here on now? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, you know, I think under, yeah I think you could say that until we announced that we've signed some other nice piece of business then we will crank that up again and you will have some expenses. But when you go to these new countries your first customer is absolutely the most expensive to add.", "And we are in the process of going to Germany, we are having to modify systems for, to issue cards in Germany. We are doing the same thing in Brazil. And they have significant differences in the way we do business in Brazil than we do for instance in the US, and so the next customer that we add in Brazil will be much, much easier in the same way in Germany.", "Glenn Greene", "Okay. All right, that's all I had, thank you.", "Jimmy Lipham", "Thank you, Glenn.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. We have a follow-up question coming from Jason Kupferberg. Your line is live.", "Glenn Fodor - UBS", "It's Glenn again. Thanks for the follow-up. Regarding new contracts and meeting guidance, does guidance assume some sort of win hit rate of the current pipeline, and could you give us a range of what kind of success rate you are assuming and you need to happen on your pipeline to make the guidance?", "Jimmy Lipham", "I does assume that, Glenn. It assumes what we know that is coming on board.", "Glenn Fodor - UBS", "Okay. Anything you win, over and above would be some upside this year. ", "Jimmy Lipham", "That would be a plus.", "Glenn Fodor - UBS", "Okay. But what's likely this year, because of the long lead times and implementations.", "Jimmy Lipham", "That's exactly right. You can figure typically 9 to 15, 16 months, and on a smaller accounts you might do it faster than that. But we've done them in 90 days, but it's not really the way you want to do it. But it would be hard, we are really in May now.", "Glenn Fodor - UBS", "Right, okay. And on pricing just follow-up you addressed it in the beginning of the Q&A. Can I infer from your statements that aside from the large client renegotiation going on, and tiering that impacts some of your clients, is pricing overall relatively steady is that a fair assumption aside from the abnormalities.", "Jimmy Lipham", "Yeah, I think that's pretty fair assumption. We do have, gosh, as we said earlier, we have had some commerce meet different tranches and some of those tranches are more expensive to us than others and that happens periodically, it's just the way we do business, and we do feel like this customer we were talking about where we can go ahead and put this bed for a long-term contract and move on with it.", "Glenn Fodor - UBS", "Okay, great. Appreciate it, thanks.", "Jimmy Lipham", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen, the floor remains open for questions, (Operator Instructions). And we will take the next question from John Williams your line is live.", "John Williams", "Hi, guys. Quick question, wondering if you could give a little bit more color on what you are seeing in the international acquiring business acquiring business (inaudible) if acquisitions or something you have talked in the past, I guess maybe give us some near-term catalyst you are seeing.", "Phil Tomlinson", "On the acquiring side, we only have one customer in the international acquiring business, and that's PaySquare in The Netherlands, which we added, I think in the fourth quarter of last year, and so it's not like we have a big business internationally on the merchant processing side.", "I could, just with one customer, I couldn't tell you what they are doing under any circumstances, because I would be disclosing something about a customer in particular. But I think Europe has certainly, we said earlier has certainly slowed down as much in some cases more than the US.", "John Williams", "Any idea when you will be restating the remaining three quarters of '08, just to look like what you showed for the first quarter? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "Jimmy, you have to answer that.", " ", "Jimmy Lipham", "Just doing it by quarters is what we started. I think we will have to look at that and see if there is some need for us to put it out there. It's mainly all the restatement that you have for TDM is Total Debt Management has to do with reimbursable revenues, which doesn't really effect operating income anyway.", "And when you look at the total that you were getting as an effective net income, earnings per share, they are only contributes 1.8 million for the whole year. Those are pretty immaterial.", "John Williams", "Okay. Thank you, guys. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "We see that's the last question in the queue. And I wanted to go ahead and close this thing out. One, I wanted to remind you that our upcoming Analyst Day in New York on May 21st, and certainly I think all of you have got invitations to that, and call Shawn if you would like to make reservations, if you haven't already.", "I think that it's obvious we are not happy with the first quarter, and we are not happy with changing guidance like we have felt a need to do, but I think you can count on us to continue to win significant business around the world, and I think today's press release about Carrefour, it just solidifies that, I don't know if you know much about this company, but they are the largest retailer in Europe and they are second largest in the world. At 15,000 stores, 495,000 employees globally, so this is not some small deal that we are working on here.", "In the first phase of this thing is a hybrid card that we come up with that looks and acts like a general private label card when you are in the Carrefour stores, but then when you take it outside the Carrefour stores, it acts like a general purpose Visa or MasterCard when you use it at their service station or somewhere else at a restaurant and it allows them to do some very unique things inside of their stores.", "We will also be converting a very large private label program to TSYS as a result of this new contract. And as you know, one of our goals that we have been talking about for a long time is to be in Brazil, it's the fourth largest credit card issuing company in the world. And I think this announcement does that in a big way. And we are very excited about that.", "As Jimmy said, margins have contracted, but we believe they will improve each quarter. We are going to continue to enhance and improve products and services, I said earlier our prospect list is long and deep and varied and stretches around the world as we know it today.", "Prospects and clients, both have tremendous pressure to improve efficiencies, and I think you will see that a lot of them are searching for better answers than what they have got today, I do believe that we can answer that mail, I think there are four significant issues that will be in this industry for the foreseeable future.", "One, the economy is going to continue to struggle, it's not going to cure itself overnight, and we just hope it cures itself this year. There is going to be a widespread retreat from risk, and it's been a wonderful thing over the years to be associated with banks, they are great customers but I have to remind everybody every time I talk to them that we are not a bank, we don't have credit risk, we don't loan money.", "The third thing, there will be just massive new government regulations and I think in some ways it's going to encourage some of the smaller banks to get back in to the card business and try to take care of their customers, as you know a lot of them have got out of the business over the years, and I think there is a changing competitive landscape when you look at what has happened with Metavante and some of the other changes that are going on.", "Our fundamentals are as strong as they have ever been, we got a good company. We have got a lot of the, I have been telling you all the reasons why you would want to own TSYS's stock and I don't see any of that changing.", "Our cost controls are working and we are going to be even more aggressive. And we believe that now is the time that we got to get ready for the future and there will be a growth spurt that will come out of this horrible economy that we have been dealing with.", "So I wanted to thank you for being with us. Thank you for your questions and your interest, and hope you will keep your eye on us and we look forward to chat with you soon.", "If you have any questions after this, certainly feel free to call Shawn. He is available and we will take your calls all night if necessary. So thanks for being with us and we look forward to talking to you soon.

At this time all participants have been placed on listen-only mode and we will open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Shawn Roberts, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.", "Shawn Roberts", "Thank you, Anthony, and welcome everyone. As you can see we've provided slides with our call in an attempt to better communicate our story to investors and explain what we believe are the key metrics that drive TSYS.", "I'd like now call your attention to the fact that we'll be making some forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS's actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in TSYS's reports filed with the SEC. ", "As you can see on slide four, our agenda will include presentations by Philip Tomlinson and Jim Lipham and conclude with our Q&A.", "At this time I'd like to introduce TSYS's Chairman and CEO Phil Tomlinson.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thank you, Shawn, and thank all of you for being on the call today and for your interest in TSYS. We are pleased with the results of the second quarter as we met or exceeded most all of the consensus expectations, and we certainly believe it was a critical quarter to get behind us and we are happy to reaffirm our guidance for the year.", "Also, I know you are curious about any updates on the B-of-A Merchant Services JV announcement, and frankly, we don't have anything to add to that other than what we've sent out in our press release earlier this month. So, I just want to talk just a bit about the quarter and some of the things that we have going on. We certainly saw some improvements in our overall operating margins and our international operating margins on a sequential quarter basis. Certainly, I don't have to tell you the economy continues to be a challenge and Jim Lipham is going to give you a lot of details about that later.", "Overall, we are pleased with our progress. We think we are making good progress. We're focused in four key areas. One, we are aggressively addressing the new regulations, their impact on our clients and prospects. We're working hard with them to help sustaining their profitability. We don't expect any issues in implementing these regulations. We are on track with those and moving forward.", "We are also working hard to continue growing revenues through signing and converting new clients, plus cross-selling value-added products to our clients and as you'll hear about later. We'll continue to pursue an acquisition strategy that makes sense and one that will move the needle. Four, we'll continue to do what we feel is necessary in the expense management area.", "Now, I want to talk about North America just a bit. We continue to expand our Canadian footprint in the banking, retail and debit sectors. We today are in contract negotiations with four Canadian firms that we expect to sign as long-term clients, with announcements in the third quarter. We have letters-of-intent from those clients, but we typically announce on the execution of a contract.", "We're making good progress in the Healthcare front with competitive wins of quality accounts. As you saw, we just announced signing Consumer Healthcare Technologies down in Fort Lauderdale. We are excited about that. We also have six letters-of-intent, and as we sign these contracts, we'll announce the details in the coming months and hopefully we can get that done fast.", "I thought it was interesting that last Tuesday, July 21, on the FOX News show on the record with Greta Van Susteren, she asked Newt Gingrich, \"What does the government need to do in order to reduce fraudulent Medicare and Medicaid fraud,\" and his answer was, \"You have to have an electronic healthcare system, and you need to hire a company like TSYS or American Express who specializes in monitoring transactions.\" I'm glad to hear that Newt is thinking about us, and hopefully, we can talk to the government one of these days about that. But we are making progress in healthcare.", "If you move on over to Europe, we have successfully completed the Deutsche Bank conversion. It's gone very well. I'm happy to report that we have also signed LOIs or letters-of-intents with four different European banks, all in different countries, which will certainly increase our footprint in the European region. ", "In France, we did announce a network branded prepaid money transfer card with TransCash Corporation and this card will be sold through Midi France Telecom. It will allow consumers to purchase the card in supermarkets and use them for international transfers to target markets like Morocco, Algeria, and Indonesia.", "Going down to Brazil, the Carrefour card conversion is fully underway. We've got about 24 people stationed in Brazil now. This MasterCard hybrid card, if you\u2019ll recall, act like a private label card when used at the Carrefour stores and the general purpose card when used at other retailers around the world. We absolutely believe that this announcement will continue to open new opportunities in the payment area for issuing and acquiring prepaid and retail services in Brazil.", "In Japan, we announced the signing of Travel Bank for a Visa prepaid program. Travel Bank has been advertising and aggressively increasing their sales agents for the product, for the use over the summer holiday season. Toyota Finance issued a new Tressa Style Plus Card, which is a hybrid reward prepaid contactless and micro payment card. We are working with Sony Finance to launched four new credit card products starting this coming November.", "I hope you saw the press release this morning, our joint venture with CUP Data continues to show very strong market penetration and we announced new contracts with Yaodu Credit Cooperative, Shandong Provincial City Bank, and Yunan Rural Credit Union, as well as Guangxi Beibu Gulf Bank, and also a cargo card, which is a stored value, reloadable gift card retailer out of Malaysia.", "There was a lot of other information about progress that we made in China included in that press release, and I would urge you to read it. I think it gives you a feel for what we have going on in that part of the world.", "Also, I would like to, just in a general statement say that, over the past six months of 2009, we have quietly converted eight new clients, with over 8 million new accounts added to the overall portfolio here at TSYS. On the acquiring services that business is growing transactionally. We are working with a number of large major merchants in their organizations to improve the profitability of those organizations through efficiencies. With this new Infonox technology we are engaged in late-stage discussions with 12 significant prospects. I think that gives you a feel for we are continuing to win. We are feeling good about where we are at, and we do think that we are starting to see maybe just a little light at the end of the tunnel.", "So, with that, I'm going to turn it over to Jim Lipham, who is going to give you some updates and he will go through the slides with you.", "Jim Lipham", "Okay, thank you, Phil. Before we get started on the slides I thought I would just refresh you from where we were at the Analyst Presentation back in May. But there are two main things that we're going to be talking about, and the first one being from an operating perspective. As you know, we continue to face the headwinds of currency translation, as well as the economy and where it's at.", "But the good part about the current quarter is that our new clients, revenues from that as well as our internal growth are more than exceeding the loss of the revenues from clients that de-converted since last year. So, from an operating perspective we are seeing growth there. Obviously the strength in our cash flow continues to be impressive and we'll talk a little more about that in a minute.", "I will start on slide 7, and on that particular slide, what we are looking at here is a comparison both sequentially and year-over-year for the second quarter. As you noticed in the press release, we did have growth on the sequential quarter basis. Total revenues increased mainly due to a slight easing in the exchange rate and you can see on the constant currency basis we were pretty flat, but it was up 1% prior to the currency change.", "When you look at operating income, we were up 6%, and that's just an indication of how well we've done so far this quarter, this past quarter controlling expenses as they remain flat quarter-over-quarter. Total transactions you see have increased 4% for the first quarter and mainly due to seasonality. When you look at the same client transactions per billing days that we talked about previously, they are up 6.5%. So we got some good growth going on in our transactions.", "When you look year-over-year on the right-hand side, you will see revenues are down. This impacted by negative currency translation of 17.8 million and we also lost about 12.3 million in revenues from de-converted customers. These will offset the loss in the de-conversion customers were offset by international growth from new clients as well as our internal growth in North America. Also the Merchant segment Philip mentioned a while ago is showing growth of roughly 8% for the quarter and for the year-over-year numbers.", "Operating income, it decreased as we continued to accept the short-term risk on our margin targets as we continued to expand in the international front. Transactions, for the second quarter compared to last year is down 8.1%, but when you get to same client transactions, they are down 1.5%. That takes out the effects of any conversions and de-conversions.", "So, overall a good second quarter and very good numbers sequentially. If you look at slide 8 you can see the numbers themselves for the sequential quarters, revenues being up 1.5% at 350.7 million and operating income, it increased 6% as expenses were basically flat as [we say], they are basically 329 million. Our operating margins increased quarter-over-quarter 100 basis points up to 23.6% from 22.6 in the first quarter.", "Our basic earnings per share as you can see there is and Phil mentioned at $0.27 a share it's inline with what most consensus was.", "I didn\u2019t want to mention here as a result of an accounting pronouncement back at the first of the year there is some confusion amongst analysts and investors as to the number of shares to use in calculating our earnings per share. Effective 1st of January, the new regulation required companies to treat non-vested awards of stock that received dividends as participating securities.", "So the impact of that announcement resulted in an increase in our number of shares to approximately 197 million shares, which is 1.5 million more than the average common shares outstanding. I'll call your attention to page 6 of the press release where there is more information on that, but I did want to get that cleared to you out there.", "As we go to slide 9, you take a look and see how we've been impacted by the negative currency for the first six months, little over $40 million. We did have some easing in the second quarter about 5 million coming off of that. So, hopefully it is going to continue to ease as we go through the rest of this year.", "On slide 10, this is our second quarter '09 compared to '08 by segments. North America you does represent about 63% of our revenues and the revenues were impacted by the lost clients to about 12.3 million as I stated before. Our segment headcount has been reduced by 70 people, not including discontinued operations. As we continue to control and reduce expenses in the second half, we expect the margin in this segment to increase. Our same client transactions, as you can see there at 1.5 billion, decreased 1.6%.", "On the international front, revenues were impacted by currency translation of 17.8 million, as I stated earlier. On a constant currency basis our revenues internationally were up 17.9%, very strong growth in the second quarter. We added 468 people in this segment, mainly due to a combination of new business, such as Deutsche Bank and Carrefour, (inaudible). We converted contract labor to employees and then we had international expansion in Russia, as well as India. As you can see in the international our same client transactions, they decreased 0.6% as they came in at 263.1 million.", "On the Merchant segment, revenues increased mainly due to the acquisition of Infonox, an approximately 2 million, and then we had increased charge back and debit network volumes coming from a large customer we put on the first part of this year.", "Operating income was impacted as we continue to integrate Infonox, both with their people and their systems that we brought on, as well as purchase accounting adjustments, such as amortization of goodwill. We did add about 105 people and these are basically from Infonox and with pulling out of their point-of-sale transactions at 1.3 billion are up slightly about 0.4% year-over-year.", "Just flip to slide 11, you'll see a sequential quarter. There is lot of good things going on this page in all of the segments, mainly North America first of all is showing a down revenue, but that's mainly reimbursable revenue, which has no profit margin to it and that's about down about $3 million.", "(inaudible) the margins all improved. We expect them to continue to improve in the second half of the year, as we continue to monitor our expense growth and put some things in place to control that growth in expenses.", "International, revenues increased as a result of conversions late in the first quarter. We had Home Retail Group come onboard and in the second quarter we converted Deutsche Bank. We did add 47 employees in this segment, half of which were added in Brazil and also impacting our margins here was the build up of other new business such as Carrefour prior to our [process] of revenue starting in 2010 with those guys. ", "From a Merchant perspective, revenue increased mainly due to POS volumes. They are up 7%. It's mainly due to the seasonal fluctuations and we did not add any new employees there. I might add, last year, the sequential quarter growth from first to second for '08 was 8%. Then if you look at all of the margins there, all of them were up, and as I said before, we continue to move toward our target, those for the year of 24 to 26%.", "We move to slide 12, this chart is - I wanted to fix our internal growth, new clients, lost customers and CTA impact. As you can see from new clients and internal growth, that was a 6% increase in the electronic payment process and this is North America, (inaudible) electronic payment process and represents 67% of our total revenues. But that was up 6% and then we lost clients so fast, so we showed that we were able to grow our sales past what we lost in customers, and obviously, look forward to these lost clients anniversaring of them being gone.", "Let's see on price concessions, if you remember back in New York, we talked about, first quarter we had 6 million negative impact on price concessions and we said it'd cut down in half for the second quarter which it did. It came in about $3 million, down from the 6 previously. But, overall, without the lost clients we'd be break-even. The CTA is down 6%, [costing us] 6%.", "Flip over to slide 13 and this is a follow-up from the slide we had for the first quarter and showing our same client average card holder transactions per billing day. As you can see here, we talked about how we had a bigger drop of 8% in the first quarter of '09, sequentially from the fourth quarter of '08, bigger than what we had in previous years, but the seasonality of this chart shows that we did rebound in the same percentage. It's just that we are about 1% below where we were a year ago. So, as economy is impacting people's uses, though, we still see the same seasonality growth from quarters and expect that as we go forward.", "Flip over to slide 14, we'll talk about the cash balance and spin off and this chart shows sequentially our changes in our cash balances for the last seven quarters. Operations continued to generate very strong cash flow as we did year-to-date $219 million. Our free cash flow year-to-date is $163 million, which increased 60 million or 58% compared to last year.", "With, this total balance of cash is around 344 million unrestricted and we also have available to us the 252 million. We borrowed a portion of that credit facility, which is priced at LIBOR plus 60, which is now at about 0.98%. So we have the financial resources to fully support the executing (inaudible) strategies and include acquisitions and/or stock repurchases.", "Chart 15, slide 15 operating cash flow to sales ratio. I want to show that again. It improved from where we were at the first quarter. It's now at 27.7% compared to the 24.3 in the first quarter and this does show the ability of the company to turn sales into cash and it continues to improve and exceed those people in our group.", "We'll note for the year-to-date numbers free cash flow grew 58% while our GAAP net income decreased 16.5, which shows us some good growth in cash there.", "In closing, I'd like to mention the positive trends again that we are seeing in our business and there is good internal growth, which combined with a new client is offsetting our revenues from de-converting clients and the trends sequentially are very been favorable. Our margin goals that we have are achievable by year end. International expenses are truly an investment for future revenues as Carrefour comes on in the first of 2010, and we see the currency impact is starting to ease.", "Also our merchant business is growing 7 to 8% and there again our cash balances continue to increase. So, our strategy as I mentioned in New York we plan on strategically using our cash for operations and dividends and then looking at acquisitions and also any stock buyback.", "With that I will turn it back over to you Phil.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thanks Jimmy. Anthony we are ready to answer any questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen the floor is now open for questions. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from Jason Kupferberg. Your line is live.", "Jason Kupferberg - UBS", "", "So it's encouraging to see that the worst may be over here. Just wanted to delve into a couple of questions. First of all, I was hoping you could give us an update on a couple of specific accounts. First of all the fate of Wachovia if you have any update there and I think last quarter you had mentioned that there was one fairly large customer renegotiation that you were budgeting for from a pricing perspective. I wanted to find out if that's actually been completed and if so how did the outcome play out versus your expectations?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Sure. It's nobody's surprise. Wachovia has told us that they will move that business to Wells and I think it's about a 1.5 million accounts, somewhere in that range. So on the large customer that we were talking about last time, we think it's down to getting the signature page done now. It has been a long drawn out process, but we feel good that we are there. It's not something that I am losing sleep about anymore. I think it's done. It's just a matter of getting the final as dotted and the [Tees] crossed and getting the signature.", "Jason Kupferberg - UBS", "", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Any color you can offer on July transaction volumes based on what you've seen so far relative to how you exited the June quarter?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Not on July, Jason, but we are certainly just like you. We are hopeful, but there's nothing I can really tell you on July at this point.", "Jason Kupferberg - UBS", "", "Okay. Then finally any update on your debit strategy going forward? I know it's a relatively small piece of the business, but I think last quarter\u2026", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Well, I will tell you that one of those Canadian customers that we hope to get a contract out of that I was talking about earlier is a pretty significant debit deal. It's not signed yet, but we are hopeful that that's going to happen and as soon as we do get it signed, we'll be the first to talk about it if we can.", "Jason Kupferberg - UBS", "", "Okay. Thanks for the color. Good luck guys.", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Our next question is coming from [Julio Conntearous]. Your line is live.", "Julio Conntearous", "Hi, guys. Really quickly just on the updated guidance and the Bank of America comments that you guys had made a couple of weeks back. Does the updated guidance which is unchanged include that or are you guys still not incorporating that into the numbers?", "Jim Lipham", "", "[Julio] this is Jim. The bank's deal will have no effect on '09. Now the contract as we said was up in 2010. I mean, we are still waiting on is a meeting I think in August coming up to sheer up some transition plans, but we don't envision having any problems before our guidance in '09.", "Julio Conntearous", "Okay, got it. Then, you watch your couple of pieces on the $3.2 million loss. I think you said that that was revenues in clients. But then you were able to offset that with new clients and I think you mentioned merchant acquisition growth. There's a really nice chart that shows the accounts on file changes. Can you just walk back through that, the offsets to the revenue losses if you will, with the growth that you saw either in new clients, merchants or some of the other areas?", "Jim Lipham", "", "The merchants are up about $8 million. Then under our internal growth we saw roughly $12 million pick up there. Then the new clients in Europe is up 23 million, it is an array of those things and makeup whatever the drop from de-converted clients, but I don't have all those numbers just laid out. ", "Julio Conntearous", "Okay. Then just to be clear, the constant currency revenue number up 1%, does that include or exclude Infonox?", "Jim Lipham", "", "It includes it.", "Julio Conntearous", "Okay. The contribution from Infonox was how much?", "Jim Lipham", "", "For the year-to-date around 3.9 million.", "Julio Conntearous", "Year-to-date?", "Jim Lipham", "", "Right.", "Julio Conntearous", "Got it. Okay. Great. Thanks guys.", "Jim Lipham", "", "Thank you, William.", "Operator", "", "Our next question is come from Timothy Willi. Your line is live", "Timothy Willi", "", "Thanks and good afternoon. A couple of things, just going back to your earlier comments about the regions and the letters-of-intent that, that you've secured or feel real good about, as you move through Canada, Europe, et cetera. You talked about one large customer in response to the first question. Are there any of those others, you talked about Canada, four firms Europe's four letters-of-intent. Are there any of those that you would definitely say would catch people's attention in terms of size or would these be more sort of garden variety retailers or banks that bring a couple million cards, but nothing that would bring sort of double digits in terms of the number of cards on file any single contract?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Tim, I might as well just tell you who they are with that question. I think that you would be very pleased to - they will be names that you would know very well.", "Timothy Willi", "", "Okay. In the US, any updated thoughts around conversations you are having with issuers that are currently your customers or not as they have had a little bit more time to look at the landscape, look through the legislation, think about the strategic direction of their card businesses and their propensity to either deepen relationships with you or decide to just give up the ghost and out source it? Have you seen any kind of shift in conversations over the last handful of months?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Not particularly. We are still having lots of conversations, but I think people are really trying to figure out, one, what this new card law means and how they are going to deal with it, and we spent a lot of time, we just had a webinar the other day, where we went through, where we are at. It is a huge project and I think a lot of people who were processing in-house I'd have to say are struggling with it. I think we would be struggling with it if we didn't have the technology that we have with TS2 in particular, but we are moving forward with it, feel good about it. There's always a lot of conversation going on in the US marketplace, but I'd have to say that you notice I didn't say much about the US. I mean, it's almost like the US business, it's so beat up right now that nobody is really making any serious decisions on anything like that at this point in time.", "Timothy Willi", "", "Okay. Then last question, just in regards to the M&A environment, the cash flow and your capital structure, again didn't buy back any stock this quarter, assuming, we should take that as the M&A pipeline is very active with potentially large deals that would keep you from buying back stock, can you make any comments around that?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Well we - as a matter of fact, we had a Board meeting earlier today and I talked at length to the Board about that issue, that we had had some questions about why wouldn't you buy back stock? We do have an M&A discussion process that's going on. It is very busy, and we would certainly need the cash. I think we've said on several occasions in the past, several quarters, that one, we felt like it was prudent to hold on to cash right now, but at the same time we truly had rather spend it on something that would add new product and new value to this company. But we are not ruling it out. We still have a plan in place, but we don't have to -- you are just going to hold on to that one. We have not made a decision there. At this point we are not in the market I'll tell you that.", "Timothy Willi", "", "So our M&A pipeline is pretty active I mean I think.", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Yes, that's pretty active and nobody has rather closed a deal than we have right now.", "Timothy Willi", "", "Okay. Thanks I'll drop out of the queue and let somebody else have a turn.", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Thanks Jim.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Darrin Peller. Your line is live.", "Darrin Peller", "", "Just a quick question. If you could first just walk us through a little more detail on the announced additions in the conversions over the next few quarters, we talked - I mean we know about WaMu, we know about Wachovia , maybe just a timing around those and just anything we are missing. I Know Deutsche Bank, Nordstrom, just help us understanding exactly how many accounts on file, when and how much they will come in and out?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Well WaMu is gone.", "Darrin Peller", "", "So that was about 20 million right?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Yes.", "Darrin Peller", "", "That was at the end of the first quarter or...", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "I'm trying to see if I've got that information with me. I'm looking for some advice, we've got about 6.5 million accounts that we hope to de-convert this year.", "Darrin Peller", "", "Okay. Is that Nordstrom or \u2026?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Yes that's Nordstrom. Predominantly most of that is Nordstrom. That's Nordstrom.", "Darrin Peller", "", "Wachovia I guess?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Wachovia. We've got a debit card program.", "Jim Lipham", "(inaudible) in 2010.", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Yeah. Wachovia goes out in 2010. I'm sorry.", "Darrin Peller", "", "Okay. That's right. ", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "I apologize.", "Darrin Peller", "", "So this year all that\u2019s remaining in terms of terms of -- sort of\u2026", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Most all of that, right at 5 million of that is Nordstrom. That goes out in August.", "Darrin Peller", "", "Okay, that goes out in August. Then what about the, you know everything else. The additions when is Carrefour, that\u2019s third quarter or\u2026?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "It should be in late '09, really early '10.", "Darrin Peller", "", "Okay.", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "I would say you could count on that in the first quarter of '10.", "Darrin Peller", "", "All right. So net-net as far as you know, I mean, all we see now is 6.5 million kind of moving out and then from an addition standpoint you have Carrefour, you have -- anything else that I'm missing?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "We've got about 10 million that's in the pipeline that is signed and ready to go.", "Darrin Peller", "", "The only name we know is the Carrefour. Is that Carrefour all right?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Right. I will tell you this, Darrin, we tried very hard to get several of these clients to -- I might as tell you who it is and they wanted to wait till after the conversion had gone well or \u2026", "Darrin Peller", "", "I understand.", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "They had for several different reasons.", "Darrin Peller", "", "When we look at the sequential change in accounts on file, what I found interesting, an interesting increase from in the stored value cards. I know you guys went in general for about 340 million to 349, but it looked like about eight of that was stored value. Can you just explain what those were and how kind of sustainable those are, how long lasting they could be in these numbers?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Well, a lot of that is, as a result of this Wachovia -- not Wachovia, I've got it on my mind today but the Wal-Mart prepaid card that is issued through Green Dot. That card has turned out to be very successful, and they've had a good deal of growth there. I can't get into a lot of detail about our clients, but in the digital, the analog digital conversion from --", "Darrin Peller", "", "The cable cards you are talking about?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Yeah. That was a -- part of that earlier in the year.", "Darrin Peller", "", "I guess the question though was all right, so does eight million increase the stored value. I mean especially if some of these are the cable cards. How long are these going to last in your numbers?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Most of that is, you know, we pretty well have played out with the cable business. Those cards were used and gone.", "Darrin Peller", "", "Okay, so next quarter at least some of that eight million increase will be gone?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "It may already be gone.", "Darrin Peller", "", "Okay.", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "I forget when that program ended, but it is over, and I think most of that is through continued growth in the prepaid business through our clients like the ones I've just talked about.", "Darrin Peller", "", "Okay so at least some of it can be sustainable?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Right. I don't know if you've ever gone out and bought a prepaid card like that. I did it about a month ago. I just wanted to do it, and you do wind up with a reloadable card. In about a week you get a regular Visa and/or MasterCard. You can take it back into the stores reload it and so I think time will tell as to how, what kind of usage we'll get with those and what percentage of them will be reloaded, but they will be on file. I mean, they'll come and go just like regular credit cards will.", "Darrin Peller", "", "Okay. Just if you don\u2019t mind, really if you can just touch a little bit more on the margin improvement internationally. I mean, obviously there's been some cost controls. Can you just give us a little more color on which costs are being pulled out? Will you still expect to be pulled out from a cost standpoint? Maybe granulize the operating expense line which dropped?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "From the international perspective, I don't think we'll see much drop in costs, as well as we will see an increase in revenue as these conversions take place. We mentioned Deutsche Bank came on this quarter and then we had home retail group and there's a couple of others coming on during the year, but by the time we get to the fourth quarter we'll see some improvement there. I think the margin was up about 400 basis points for the quarter. So I think more revenue additions.", "Jim Lipham", "", "The big ramp-up of course was some of this credit and customer service or customer care in collections work that we do. Some we do it all [form] others we do partial work and starting up a center like that has got a pretty heavy front end cost.", "Obviously in Brazil we've got some startup cost to make the software work in Brazil and do all the things that the Brazilian market has to have, which is in every country that we go to, there's on the initial client there is a startup cost. I mean, just like with Deutsche Bank in Germany, we had to do some things to make those cards work, to make our systems work in Germany.", "We've done that now and so the next person that we sign in Germany will be much easier for us to do and the same way with Brazil and the UK. If you look at TSYS's history, you'll see that we grow in clusters as we go into a country, as you can see in Canada, we just continue to grow once we get into a country. The same thing has happened in the UK and Ireland and starting to happen in Europe and you'll see a lot more color on that in the third quarter and I'll predict to you that it will also happen in Brazil.", "Darrin Peller", "", "Okay. All right. Just lastly then when we look at the margins, I guess looking at the whole first half the margin was roughly 23%, if you think about the two quarters versus your guidance of 24 to 26 for the year. Just to verify, you are really looking to get there by scale more than anything else. No more cost cutting or really -- very little of that, it's really more just revenue growth?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "We like what we've got coming onboard, so we certainly have cut cost where appropriate, but we do think we can get down scale.", "Operator", "", "Our next question is from John Williams. Your line is live.", "John Williams", "", "Good evening, guys. Two questions, just first in terms of modeling, I noticed the subtle difference in the way you are framing your guidance. In the past you've talked about reimbursables a bit and this time you just used revenue and net income. Should we assume that the guidance or the color surrounding reimbursables is still the same or should we just really go with just the revenue and net income being as the thing that you are sort of pointing us towards to right now?", "Jim Lipham", "", "On the reimbursables we have seen a drop obviously in the first part of the year with the loss of WaMu and some other things, but the postage is the biggest issue there. We still like to talk about revenues before reimbursables, because they just don't make anything on the other piece of revenues. But then, of course, GAAP makes you talk about revenues with them in there, so we are trying to cover both ends of the spectrum.", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "We are trying to keep the lawyers and the accountants happy. We hate talking about reimbursables honestly, because it is true, it's just a past through.", "John Williams", "", "All right. So, that implies then that we should just take your guidance right now as being what is out there and in effect, just the two lines that you - revenue net income that you talked about in this quarter's earnings release?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "That's correct.", "John Williams", "", "Okay. The other question I had was on Brazil. I know you guys have talked about that opportunity. I was hoping you could frame it a little bit more clearly what you see as some near-term issues in that market? Also, if you see that as an opportunity to really do mostly in-house conversions over to your platform versus really going out and competing with other large processors?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Well, I think we'll be competing with other large processors. We are not going to Brazil just to try to get the guys that are processing in-house. Obviously, we are confident in what we can do as it relates to competition, but the truth is, we've to go to Brazil get our feet wet, make sure that Carrefour is happy, and then, I think that overtime I am very hopeful you'll see us have some success there.", "John Williams", "", "Is it your sense that the regulatory environment there being a bit potentially more interesting now given the government's desire to get more companies involved? Do you see something that you perhaps will move a little more aggressively to take advantage of?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "I think that could be helpful, but the truth is, I mean whatever the regulatory environment is in any country that we go into, we just have to deal with it, particularly, as it relates to how you can charge for cards and merchants.", "John Williams", "", "Okay. Thank you, guys.", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Our next question is come from James Friedman. Your line is live.", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Jamie?", "Operator", "", "Hello, Mr. Friedman, your line is live.", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "He must have dropped off.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This is [Meghna] on behalf of Jamie. Just a question regarding with your bank customers, have you seen any pricing pressure there? I mean, just trying to compare it from the last quarter. Has it increased, has it stabilized? Just some color on that front.", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "I think it's fairly stable. I mean, we've said before, we are always under price pressure, but I don't think it's any worse than it was this time last year, two years ago. I mean, we've gone through and dealt with a couple of customers, and we've baked that in into the numbers, and we've said in the first quarter we had $6 billion worth of price concessions compared to prior year and the second quarter is down to three. So it's getting better.", "James Friedman", "", "Maybe if I could just tag team with Meghna here, this is Jamie. Another way of asking that Phil might be, are new customers more profitable than old customers or is the revenue contribution (inaudible) rates, let me phrase it that way, that the bill rates for new customers are higher than the bill rates for the old customers?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Jamie, there is just no way. Every customer is different. I will tell you this as customers have been on the books for a while, we typically can cross-sell them new services and new products which helps the profitability issue, things that they probably didn't think they needed when they first came on board, but now they've had a chance to look and see in value-added services, new products, new programs. So, maybe they are more profitable after they've been here for a while, but there is just no way to compare them. It just depends really on what people buy.", "James Friedman", "", "Yes. Okay, if I could segue over to the accounts on file for a second, I'd like to compliment you on the increased disclosure in the deck is really fascinating and helpful.", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Good.", "James Friedman", "", "I guess this subtext in some of the questions that seem to be on this call is, you had 349 million accounts on file, I am sorry - yeah, 349 million accounts on file and analysts are always looking for more detail. Could you take a grander as to what number the international accounts on file might be? As a related question, do you think that 349 is going to go up or down by year end?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "I think it's going to go up, but just based on what we've said is going to happen, we do have a hold here. I mean look at this piece of paper. About 74% of our business is -- of those accounts are domestic and about 25% and there are some basis points there, but is international.", "James Friedman", "", "Okay. Then the last question with regard to Canada that you had alluded to is if I could just probe there, is there interact related or is that part of the new initiates that we read about from visa and master?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "I don't think I could answer that.", "James Friedman", "", "Okay. Maybe that's too much detail. All right. Well, thanks for taking my questions guys..", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Thank you, Jamie and [Martha].", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Our next question is coming from Craig Maurer. Your line is live.", "Craig Maurer", "", "I'd just like to follow-up on John's question. More specifically will you compete in merchant acquiring in Brazil now that that market is clearly going to be opening up following the dissolution of exclusivity at visa [net joys] of visa coming next July? Thanks.", "Jim Lipham", "", "Craig, good question. It is not something we would very much like to do but it's a gleam in our eye right now.", "Craig Maurer", "", "Okay. Thank you.", "Jim Lipham", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Our next question is coming from Robert Dodd. Your line is live.", "Robert Dodd", "", "Hi, guys. Two questions, first on, looking at the revenue per account, I know there is a huge mix issue here, if we looks domestically, I mean it was up very modestly on the net basis from what I can tell. Given that you have a lot of growth is coming -- way your growth is coming from the store value which is typically lower price cards. Could you give us a little bit more color on kind of what's driving your pricing mix and are those Green Dot cards without naming the cards much more profitable than a typical store value card, for example?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "I wouldn't say that they are more profitable than a typical stored value card. I mean, I've said before I think the most profitable cards that we would you know its economy and order and I hope I get this right would be commercial card, consumer card, consumer branded cards, and then private label cards, and we are certainly fairly new to the prepaid business, but prepaid would probably be somewhere between the consumer and the private label cards.", "Robert Dodd", "", "Okay, got it. Then if I can ask you about the Bank of America First-Data Deal. When you gave the update a couple of weeks ago I guess, it was revenue impact 50, 55 million and the earnings impact only $0.02 which was obviously lower than I thought it would be. Can you give us an idea that would imply that you got to reduce the cost base by 45 to 50 million almost automatically with that revenue going away? Is it something different about the cost structure of that contract in terms of much more variable versus fixed cost or can you give us a little bit more color on exactly how you come up to that low contribution?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Well, the lower contribution was what the effects were for '09 and obviously as you go into '10, there would be some fragment termination there. But, yeah.\u2014the transaction cost comes from TSYS for them because we process for them, but we'll have to make some cuts in the and we'll have time to do this and the equipment arena as well as the client service reps that deal with Bank of America, obviously the size of the analyst are large number.", "Robert Dodd", "", "Okay, got it. Thank you", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions)", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Anthony?", "Operator", "", "Yes, there are no questions in queue at this time?", "Phil Tomlinson", "I was about to say these folks are not bashful. So I would really like to go ahead and close out and tell you how much again we appreciate you being on the phone with us. We know there is a lot of earnings calls going on right now and it means a lot to us. We want to assure you that we are working harder than we've ever worked in our life to make sure this company continues to be successful and we believe it will. So keep your eye on us and keep your eye on the press releases coming and thanks for being with us today and good night.", "Operator", "", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

At this time all participants have been placed on listen-only mode and we will open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Shawn Roberts. Sir, the floor is yours.", "Shawn Roberts", "", "Thank you and welcome everyone. As you can see we have again provided slides with our call in an attempt to better communicate our story to investors and explain what we believe are the key metrics that drive TSYS. ", "", "As we start the formal presentation I would like again to call your attention to the fact that we will be making forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS's actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in TSYS's reports filed with the SEC. ", "", "As you can see on some of the slides we are going to get started on we will have an agenda will include presentations by Philip Tomlinson and Jim Lipham and conclude with our Q&A.", "", "At this time I would like to introduce TSYS's Chairman and CEO, Phil Tomlinson.", "", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Thank you, Shawn, and welcome to everybody that is joining us today. I know there was some scheduling conflicts at the last minute. We are certainly pleased with our results for this quarter and our CFO, Jim Lipham, is going to cover them in a lot of detail a little bit later. ", "We are focused on several key things these days. We are working harder than ever on our domestic and international sales pipeline and that is both organically and externally. When I say organically we are talking about value-added products. We are also focused on dealing with overcoming the large loss of several large clients, or the loss of several large clients primarily to financial difficulties and credit issues with the banks. Third is just overall expense management which is certainly something everybody is looking at these days. ", "Three other areas I would like to talk about are; one, the pending launch and successful delivery of our next generation payment processing system, TS Prime. We are in the process of going live with Carrefour in Brazil later this year with a friends and family type program and are confident it is going to be one of the real keys to our continued success as we continue to expand into other parts of the globe. We expect to complete that total conversion in early 2010. ", "Second, we have some huge efforts going on to support our clients in regard to the new regulatory changes as they go live, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Canada recently passed a new regulatory bill in some ways similar to what the U.S. has passed, the two that the U.S. have and they are massive projects and they are going well here at TSYS and we are into the testing phase. ", "Third is our ongoing M&A efforts. We continue to work overtime and believe the environment is really improving on a day-to-day basis. We are certainly anxious to put together a deal that makes sense both strategically and financially. We are looking for targets that provide long-term growth. We have looked at numerous deals. We have passed on many and we have bid on a few. We don\u2019t have one to talk about today. We believe it is a time of disciplined opportunity and we are certainly disappointed we haven\u2019t run across one that made sense yet. ", "Some recent events, let me go back to TS Prime in Brazil. First, Carrefour is a huge win and will make an immediate impact on our processing capabilities in Brazil. We think Brazil is one of the prime markets in the world. We haven\u2019t talked a lot about the details of the system. It is a server based, end to end outsourcing model that supports credit, debit, acquiring, loyalty, pre-paid, private label, commercial cards, installments, ATM and consumer finance. That is all on one single server platform and it enables a client to manage its entire card business to a single web interface and then to be securely connected to a TSYS state of the art data center. This one happens to be in Brazil. ", "It will certainly allow Carrefour to be super competitive the first day they go live and I predict this product is going to be a big success in Brazil and ultimately TSYS will. ", "We also just recently announced the formation of what we call TSYS Program Solutions which offers turnkey credit card solutions designed for U.S. based community, regional banks and credit unions. We are going to be competing with others in the market to win business in this sector. It represents a large market consisting of thousands of prospects. ", "You might ask what sets us apart from others as we provide this program development implementation and ongoing delivery to make it easy and certainly cost effective for these banks and credit unions to enter, or re-enter\u2026we believe we are going to see some folks re-entering the card market, or what would cause them to move from another platform. We absolutely believe we can demonstrate to these banks a compelling business opportunity that is an alternative to the traditional agent/bank relationship you are familiar with. That agent/bank relationship certainly exists today by the thousands and we think this is a real win/win deal for TSYS, the banks and the credit unions. ", "We have hired some very talented people to come in and take this business to the next level. We are very excited about it and we believe we are going to show some progress really soon. I want to give you a quick update on the regions. ", "First in North America we renewed long-term contracts with Green Dot for prepaid services, U.S. Bank for commercial card customer care and internet services, Trust Mark and Whitney Bank. So we are working hard on finalizing contracts and converting to our systems. Four letters of intent we mentioned last quarter and two new letters of intent that we have received in the last 10 days. ", "We are now operational with four of the top issuing banks in the healthcare market and our new healthcare clients have all been successful take-aways from other providers and I think it provides a real market validation that our solution in the healthcare sector is a good one.  We have also signed on the healthcare side an additional three new letters of intent and certainly we will continue to work hard on these final contracts and then their ultimate conversion to TSYS. ", "In the merchant services side with total acquiring solutions we expanded the services we provide to Global Cash Access which dispenses cash in over 1,100 casinos around the world. We renewed three acquiring contracts. We are engaged in late sales discussions with over 15 prospects that we look to close by year-end and announce in early 2010. Prospects have certainly picked up in that segment. We have also launched pilots for two self-serve kiosks in two very large shopping malls. Initially these smart kiosks will have basic ATM functions and then we will introduce additional financial services on these machines for our customers in 2010. ", "Internationally I have already talked about Brazil. In China CUP Data has extended multi-year contracts or agreements with two of China\u2019s top ten banks including the China Minsheng Banc and we will also announce re-up here in the near future. In Japan we have started processing Japan\u2019s first Visa Prepaid Travel card in July. This card is issued by Travel Bank, a subsidiary of JTB. It is the largest travel agency in the market and it is valid for use at point of sale terminals and ATMs outside of Japan. The Japanese are large users of traveler\u2019s checks and we think this is going to be a highly desirable product for our international Japanese travelers. ", "Also we have a large Japanese digital electronic equipment manufacturer that has adopted a pre-paid product as their company\u2019s corporate T&E card. They have sales and manufacturing locations around the world and they believe this is a way for them to streamline their back office operations and reduce costs for settling travel related expenses with each employee. ", "In July we talked about internationally we signed four letters of intent in the second quarter. We have since added four new letters of intent for a total of 10 on the international side. So again we have a lot of contracts that we are trying to get negotiated but we have already started on the conversions for most all of those folks. ", "I know you want to get into the financial details and I am going to turn it over to Jim Lipham for a review of the slides and he will cover the rest of the TSYS financials. Jimmy? ", "Jim Lipham ", "", "Thank you Phil. I will be starting on slide seven. Before I get there just to bring you up to date again like I did in the second quarter that we are still facing some currency headwinds as well as the economic crisis Phil mentioned as it affects our customers as well as their cardholders. ", "I will say we are really excited about the numbers and the fact that our new customer growth and internal growth has helped offset all our lost customers or the revenue from our lost clients. Then I will probably have to go on to the majority of these slides and talk a little bit about our cash flow which continues to show good strength through the three quarters. ", "If you look at slide seven, sequentially the first column there you will see the third quarter compared to the second. We have shown improvement in just about every category there. We did on a constant currency basis show total revenues up 3%. One thing of note here is something new with Visa as they raised their merchant access fees during this quarter. They raised it up $0.005 to $0.195 and it is a pass through item for us but it is going to amount to about $12 million more dollars a quarter in reimbursables than what we have had in the past. So that is what you are seeing in this third quarter and going forward. So that is about $40 million a year in revenues we will pick up there. ", "On a constant currency basis we are up 3% and that is strictly Visa\u2019s fees. The currency improvement for the third quarter was about $7 million over what we had in the second quarter and we will talk a little bit about that in a minute. As you come down to your operating income you will see it is up about 6% sequentially which shows we had some pretty good control over expenses. We are still watching those pretty tight.", "Before reimbursables, expenses were up 1.2% so we are proud to have operating income of 6% and when you look at transactions in the third quarter to second they are up 3% so sequentially we are seeing some growth in transactions. On the right side, I will get into some more detail in a minute but if you look at the third quarter versus last year you will see total revenues down. That is currency again of around $10.3 million and then lost revenues from customers of about $17 million so when you put it on a constant currency basis it looks good in light of we were able to show 1% growth which was really the increase we have had on new customers and internal growth helping to offset our lost revenues. ", "Operating income we are down 8% in addition to the lost revenues we have had increased expenses as you will see in the international arena. As far as our growth in Brazil and Japan and it has negatively impacted that margin over there about 399 basis points. We will talk some more about that too in a minute. Operating income is down 8% and then of course our transactions year-over-year are also down 6%. ", "If you flip to slide eight this is the P&L first of all showing the third quarter compared to third quarter of 2008. Total revenues before reimbursables were down 3.7%. There again there is currency of $10.3 million and the de-conversions of lost revenues for de-conversions of $12.6 million so those are the big items that affect us there. We did also have good growth in the merchants for the quarter versus last year and also on the international segment as far as revenue goes. We will touch on that a little bit more in a minute. ", "Total expenses if you look at those they are flat year-over-year and what we have there is kind of a growth in expenses in the international sector as well as a little bit into the merchant sector with Infonox coming onboard. Then we had a decrease in North America as we have managed to reduce headcount and other expenses in North America as we have been lacking on growth of revenues. ", "During the quarter we completed the sale of TDM and recorded an after-tax loss of approximately $3.3 million. It shows up on the P&L as $2.9 million because we had about $400,000 of operating income for the quarter before we made the sale. As you see here basic earnings per share 28% but if you take out the loss from TDM our earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.29 which was pretty much in line with consensus of where people thought we would end up. ", "You see on our here our operating profit margins of 24.5% versus 25.6% last year. If we pro forma that number to take out the expansion expenses we are incurring in Europe for future revenue growth that number would be 25.5% so we would be pretty much in line with where we were last year. Right side, sequential basis, as you can see there everything is up pretty good. Of special note is our operating income from continuing operations being up 10.1%. I think that is pretty strong. We did have positive productivity as far as revenues being up 4.9 versus expenses growing at a lesser rate of 4.6. ", "Flip over to slide nine and give you a little color around our client movement. We have talked about de-conversions and purges a lot in the past. We have decided to come up with this slide and hope it helps. If you look at the top consolidated you will see where what has happened to our account on file numbers from September of 2008 to the end of September 2009 and we have gone from 355 down to 342. You can see off to the right of there the client adds, purges and clients lost. We still see some good gains coming from the Wal-Mart card at Green Dot. However, the additions there are not quite enough to offset the de-conversion of WaMu and Nordstrom out to the right. ", "When you look at the next category by portfolio you will see it broke out the consumers we have lost year-over-year as well as retail. That is the two I just mentioned; Washington Mutual and Nordstrom. Sequential we are down about 7 million accounts from where we were at the of the second quarter. I want to mention on purges, we talked about that at the beginning of the year. We have purged off 31.3 million accounts so far this year. We are expecting another 6.3 in the fourth quarter but overall the effects on revenue are pretty immaterial. There will be about $3.3 million for the whole year as far as what that has cost us. ", "Flip to slide 10, this is the currency slide. You can see we made about a $7 million improvement there in the third quarter over second. Year-to-date we are about being punished about $50 million in currency translation. We are expecting the fourth quarter to approach the level it was in the third quarter of last year and get closer to being muted to not having a big effect on us. We will pull for that. ", "The next slide on page 11 is the segment information starting with North America. I hope this helps. This is a little more info on the slide than we normally give. You will see revenues of $261.6 million. We did lose $17.7 million associated with de-converted clients and lost revenues and that was pretty hard to break away from. You see also there at the bottom of the same client transactions we are excited about that being almost breakeven, down about 2% year-over-year but when you look at operating income at $60.7 million that is a margin of 23.2%. We have controlled some expenses. We have moved out about 404 people in our workforce just by attrition and moving around. The operating margin actually increased 104 basis points over prior year and then of course the margin before reimbursables is up 73 basis points at 27.6%. ", "Overall, that is good. We have the 5,000 full time employees; 302 million accounts on file for North America and then year-over-year we suffered a cardholder transaction fee in the amount of about 8.1% due to fee conversions. ", "The next slide is on international. Again revenues are 86.2%. On a constant currency basis they were 96.5% so we had negative currency of 10.3 but we also had revenue growth of 10% on a constant currency basis mainly coming from new business that we signed. We talked about Home Retail Group and Deutsche Bank and we had some Barclay Card commercial accounts came on board during the third quarter. So we have had some good growth in that business. ", "Operating income at $9.7 million with operating margin of 11.3% and we mentioned here about the expense of Brazil and Japan negatively impacting\u2026the data center in Japan as well as the one in Brazil as we started both of those growth. If you didn\u2019t add 399 on margins excluding reimbursables would be at about 15.7%. ", "The same client transactions on international are up one but year-over-year they are up 10% and we think that is pretty good and that takes into account all of the account growth we have had there. ", "The next slide is the merchant side which has also done good also during this quarter. Revenues are $93.8 million mainly coming from internal growth growing at about 4% on the point of sale. New clients offset lost clients so that is kind of breakeven. You had the acquisition of Infonox which brought in some $4-5 million in revenues there. Operating margin decreased 430 basis points. This is mainly attributable to that growth I told you about on the Visa access fees that is on the reimbursable side because when you look at the margin without the reimbursables you will see it has decreased 1.92%. Still at a good rate of 27.4% and it is mainly due to bringing on Infonox and the increase in headcount there with that and purchase accounting adjustments associated with that. Then again POS transactions increased 3.8% so there was some pretty good growth there and we were glad to see that. ", "Flip to slide 14 and this is a new one that we have been asked to put in to show the transactions by segment; North America, international and merchant. You see good growth in merchants and international. Obviously new business there plus no problem on point of sale as we have in cardholder transactions in general in North America. Third quarter we are down about 8.1% year-over-year. Sequentially North America has been down 6-9% first quarter and second quarter and now 8% so a little bit of improvement but you can see sequentially on the international and merchant point of sale it has been positive this year first quarter through the third. ", "With that flip over to slide 15 and we will look at the segment of electronic payment processing. As you know this represents 67% of our revenues before reimbursables. Of note here is we have had internal growth of 3%, new clients representing 2% of revenue. That 5% offsets what we lost so we are really faced with a CTA hit we took and the 6% of revenues. There again once we get the CTA out of the way we are breakeven so that is a good sign that new growth is offsetting what we have lost. ", "If you look at the next slide on merchants you will see internal growth is up 4%, new clients 1% and then the acquisition of Infonox brought on 3%. That is good growth there of roughly 8%. Our loss clients and gain on CTA for the [GP] net in Japan and has offset each other so we ended up with a 8% increase. I will note that merchant represents about 20% of our revenues before reimbursements. ", "The next slide is our same client quarterly transactions. We like to show this. It is kind of puts everybody on the same, level playing field. What you see here is first quarter and second quarter of 2009 we had pretty good growth of 3% in the second quarter and 2% going on into the third. This is steeper growth than what we have had in the prior year. Then when you look year-to-date we are down 1.5% from the volume levels of the third quarter of 2008 and year-to-date. Then for the quarter we are down 0.2% which is showing we are getting closer to leveling out and having positive growth there. ", "If you look at first quarter we were down 2.8% year-over-year. The second quarter was 1.6% down and now it is 0.2%. So sequentially going in the right direction. ", "Now to speak just a little bit towards cash. This is the same chart we have shown before and as you can see there has been good growth in our cash balance. Cash flow from operations was pretty strong. Year-to-date $333 million. We did finish the September quarter at $420 million of unrestricted cash and that along with our revolver of $252 million puts us in pretty good position for needing resources to implementing strategies we have in place. So we feel real good about the growth there in cash. ", "Chart 19 reflects the trailing 12 months of operating cash flows. You can see still good growth there then EBITDA had a little drop in the EBITDA in 2009 and that is mainly due to about $20 million worth of currency fluctuation we have had there. Overall we still have very strong operating cash flow. ", "The next chart shows where our cash flow from operations continues to increase. We are now [5]% greater than our net income which is good. Then the free cash flow also continues about 30% greater. So this just shows how the ability to generate cash is in our operations through the 12 months. ", "The next slide is one we have shown before. We just updated it again to show how efficient we are at generating and turning sales into cash. You can see we at the high end of 28.8 with global payments is pretty close to us at 24.2. ", "Our free cash flow we reported 3% year-to-date through nine months and our GAAP net income was down 15.7. That is outstanding. I think in closing we feel pretty good about where we are and the sequential quarterly trends we see going on. We continue to see good internal growth in a range of 3-4% of new clients and new clients offsetting revenues and de-converted clients. ", "The margins we think we will stay in our goal of 24-26% although we will probably be in the low end of that. We hope to pick up a little bit in the fourth quarter as we continue to see good expense controls and hoping for some bumps in revenue. Currency impact we think is going to ease a little bit in the fourth quarter and going forward as the dollar condition improves. ", "Merchant business is growing good. Infonox is in there pushing the numbers up. We continue to look at acquisitions as we continue to show a good cash balance and with that, I will turn it back to you. ", "Phil Tomlinson ", "", "I think we are ready for questions now, operator. ", "Question-and-Answer Session ", " ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Analyst for Brian Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse. ", "Analyst for Brian Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse", "I was wondering if you could comment on any changes or any legislation in the Card Act or whatever and how you think that might affect your business going forward. ", "Phil Tomlinson ", "", "I think it is certainly pretty massive when you have the Federal Reserve come out with a pretty large changes and then you have Congress come back behind them and put in another set of changes. It is pretty large. We are fortunate that our systems are pretty, very capable of handling changes like that mostly with option sets and we feel very good about where we are at. I think what you are going to see is people trying to re-trench and innovate or you will have a lot of this back to the future and I think you are starting to see some new products come out of Chase in particular I have notice\u2026and you have probably noticed also, three new branded cards coming out. ", " I think as issuers really start to get comfortable with these new regs they are going to come out with new products and new pricing schemes and they will have to adjust to the new environment. I think it has hurt growth. I don\u2019t think there is any question about it. When you lay those new regs on top of what is going on with this market and the credit market and unemployment I think any straw you lay on top of all of that is not good for business. I do think the credit card market will come back. I think there are some very bright, innovative people in this market and the ones who are not aggressive about it will be what I call back to the future. That is what we did 15-20 years ago when we just had pretty high interest rates and annual fees. You will see some of that. It is a very rich product and I think as some of these banks clear out their charge offs they are going to start being more aggressive in this business. ", "This unemployment right at 10% right now is a huge problem for the card business just because of the law of large numbers. A lot of people that are unemployed are carrying cards around. I think it is a negative up front. I think we will get through it. We had originally felt that it might help us some and I think it would have if we had just had the Federal Reserve Act which is due in early 2010. When we laid the Card Act on top of it, it really forced a lot of issuers to hunker down and focus on nothing but this and we still have a lot of that going on. Our issuers are I think in good shape. ", "By the way, then Canada came back and did something similar to what we have done in the U.S. so our Canadian issuers are going through some of the same issues; not quite as big but they are going through similar issues. Not quite as much change, I should say. We feel very good about where we are at. We feel good about where our customers are at. We are in the user-acceptance business right now. The user acceptance testing and we think we are going to get through it fine. ", "Analyst for Brian Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse", "As long as we are talking about Canada I think last quarter you had said that four firms were supposed to sign sometime this quarter. Did those ever happen or did they\u2026", "Phil Tomlinson ", "", "No, we are working hard on getting them converted. I don\u2019t know what is going on with getting contracts signed. I think people are more sensitive. They are harder to deal with. Harder to negotiate. I think it is just a sign of the times but we have four new clients in Canada that will be coming on at some point. We may have five. We are close to another one. We feel good where those are at and they will be names that you know. We are moving right along with it. That is one of the big frustrations that we have right now. We have 20 or 21 letters of intent. What we need is 20-21 contracts signed so we can tell the world about it because I think it would be helpful.

Can you talk about how pricing has been affected or was it just kind of business as usual with no push back? ", "Phil Tomlinson ", "", "I think it has been business as usual. Obviously everybody these day are wanting you to cut prices and we probably are being a little tougher than usual frankly. Primarily because we just don\u2019t have the growth to go with it and we are pushing back and saying what are you going to give me for this? What kind of new business if this is what you really want. We are having some success with that. Sometimes we get in a hurry to renew contracts. I don\u2019t know that we are in a big hurry to renew any right now that are not coming due for another year or two. ", "I think there are a lot of banks out there and you know it better than I do that are really struggling for every penny and certainly we have always struggled for every penny because we are in the penny business. It is just tough times for issuers and we are doing the best we can. I mean we are trying to barter and like I say you give me something and I\u2019ll give you something. So stay tuned. I think we came out of the ones I just talked about in pretty good shape and that was Whitney, and Trust Mark Green Dot and\u2026I\u2019m going to get in trouble here. I think that was it. We had a couple that don\u2019t want you to use their name. Anyway, we are rocking along there. We don\u2019t have any big ones coming up any time soon. ", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from the line of Analyst for Julio Conntearous \u2013 Goldman Sachs. ", "Analyst for Julio Conntearous \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "A quick question on what headwinds you might see going into 2010 that are still out there. Maybe you can give us a little detail on what you are expecting? ", "Phil Tomlinson ", "", "I think I said last quarter that we will just be glad when 2009 gets over. We just want it to be done because there has been nothing pretty about it other than we have signed a lot of business. Or at least we have signed letters of intent for a lot of business. But I hear just what you hear, the recession is over but I don\u2019t believe the consumer believes it and I don\u2019t think our organic growth is going to be a big issue for us until the consumer comes back to the table. This unemployment where it is pushing 9-10% is a real negative for us. I think it is pretty interesting, the U.S. market as far as our business is really fairly dead. I think everybody in the U.S. is worried about getting these regs implemented. We have got some good prospects but I don\u2019t expect any of those guys to make a firm decision any time in the next few months. ", "So we are moving along there but I don\u2019t know, this economy\u2026I have been with TSYS 35 years and I told the board today every other recession we had been through was a speed bump compared to this. We have never quite seen anything like this. You have seen the other banks report. You have seen Visa and MasterCard, the transactions which are what we get paid by are just not there yet. I think we are going to have to see the consumer get more confidence where people will start feeling like it is safe to go buy something. Frankly I think the consumer has had the hell scared out of them and it is going to take a little while for them to come back. My guess is no better than anybody else\u2019s but I am certainly hoping by second or third quarter it might start improving. ", "Analyst for Julio Conntearous \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "To play devil\u2019s advocate, to the world is ending thesis, what sort of positives do you see? Are things like prepaid really going to be a catalyst for the near-term for you? ", "Phil Tomlinson ", "", "I think pre-paid is helpful. We are really delighted with what is going on in healthcare. We are thrilled at this business that we are in the process of getting signed. I am really an optimist but you were talking about the things that would slow business down. We are very excited about what is happening internationally. Prospects are good. We have several things lined up in Japan and the fact we do have the ability to if we can close something on an acquisition we have the ability to do that quickly. ", "We have the cash. We have the financing. That is not a big issue. This TS Prime is hot as a firecracker. We have prospects all over the world wanting to see that. So we have a lot of really, really positive things going on. We just kind of like a lot of people we want to see the consumer back. We want to see unemployment start to decrease a bit; and I guess you could say it is holding its own now. It is not going up any more I don\u2019t believe. We want to get this regulation behind us. I don\u2019t think the card industry has ever seen this much regulation at one-time in its history. Now if you look back years ago when we did Reg Z that was a pretty big deal. It was all new. ", "I think the other thing we have been pretty thrilled at is the products we acquired through Infonox they are also really hot. They are allowing us to go into some spaces that we were having a hard time getting in the front door. As we show these products we are getting a welcome, come on in. So we feel good about that. We think we have got everything lined up, ready to go. We are like a football team that has been practicing through spring practice. We are chomping at the bit ready to go and we just need a little help from the economy. ", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from the line of Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens Inc.

I would like to dig in a little bit. You mentioned 21 LOIs and that I think is up from 14 or 15, correct me if I am wrong, last quarter. ", "Phil Tomlinson ", "", "I think that is right. ", "Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens Inc. ", "It seems like LOI\u2019s can be very close to actually signing or a little bit far away from actually signing. Can you give us a sense of those 21 you had mentioned you started converting even some of those. Can you give us a sense of the color on that? It isn\u2019t backlog yet but it seems close. Can you give us a sense? ", "Phil Tomlinson ", "", "I think some of it is very close. Honestly I am almost embarrassed that we haven\u2019t signed contracts on some of them. I am looking straight at our General Counsel as we say that. He is not sure how to take that but he knows how to take it. I am surprised that we didn\u2019t finalize some of them in the third quarter. I will say this though, it is a different environment out there today. Truly I think everybody is a little paranoid these days and so there is more lawyers on the deal. There is more service level agreements you have to work your way through. It is just a little bit more difficult than it has been and of course people are\u2026.this business is notoriously slow anyway through the sales cycle and through the contract cycle and I think what has happened is this tsunami that we are all sort of wrapped up in has slowed it down a little bit more. I think we are very close to some of this and I promise you there is nobody that wants to announce it any more than I do. ", "Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens Inc. ", "Can you give us a sense of, I think last time you gave us a sense of what cards or the accounts on file you can see given signed business that have yet to hit the books. I don\u2019t know if you can or want to talk about that. ", "Phil Tomlinson ", "", "I don\u2019t have it in front of me. We will see if we can get it up. I can tell you this, we know this is excluding any of the LOIs, we know we have about 9 million accounts sitting there in the process of getting converted. New accounts. ", "Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens Inc. ", "You expect that by year-end? Or what is the timeframe on that? ", "Phil Tomlinson ", "", "I probably told you more than I know already. ", "Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens Inc. ", "On the debit side I know you have been working on some things. If I recall correctly, did some of the Canada opportunities are debit related? ", "", "Phil Tomlinson ", "", "That is correct. ", "Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens Inc. ", "Is that sort of the best prospect right now for a meaningful debit entrance? ", "Phil Tomlinson ", "", "Yes, probably so. We have one in the U.K. region. ", "Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens Inc.

", "Darrin Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital ", "A quick question on the legislative changes we are seeing across the board can you remind us is the expense associated with that on you or do the issuers bear the expense? ", "Phil Tomlinson ", "", "It is kind of a sharing. We do some of it at our cost. They do have some expense. The truth is, as I said earlier, I wouldn\u2019t want you to think there is no effort here because there is a big effort here. This is something that has got to be right and it has got to be tested so there is a lot of time involved. It is not something that is creating a lot of revenue for us. It is a people expense for both of us and that is just one of the things that we do on Federal regulations as an ongoing way of doing business. ", "Darrin Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital ", "So I guess this past quarter was that seen at all on the expense lines and where do you expect a peak of that to be? ", "Phil Tomlinson ", "", "Some of it, I can\u2019t give you a number, but we did have some in there. Maybe we capitalized. As time goes by it will be less and less. Certainly we have seen, I believe we have seen the peak of it. ", "Darrin Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital ", "With regard to just de-conversions and purges just review with me real quickly the Wachovia and Nordstrom. Are those already out of the numbers? Or is that kind of in the fourth quarter still. ", "Phil Tomlinson ", "", "No. No. They go out into the first quarter. WaMu is out. Nordstrom is gone and I think Wachovia goes in February or March. Wachovia is pretty small. ", "Darrin Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital ", "But Nordstrom accounts are already out of the numbers. ", "Phil Tomlinson ", "", "That went out in late August. ", "Darrin Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital ", "", "Wachovia you should see early next year and Carrefour also at the beginning of next year, right? ", "Phil Tomlinson ", "", "Carrefour comes on. They are much bigger than Wachovia. ", "Darrin Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital ", "I think when you had spoken last quarter on the call you had mentioned that you expected the accounts on file in general to end the year at a higher level than it was in the second quarter. Is that still the case? ", "Phil Tomlinson ", "", "I don\u2019t remember what that was in the second quarter off hand. ", "Darrin Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital ", "I think it was about 349. ", "Phil Tomlinson ", "", "Why don\u2019t we let some folks figure on that. Do you have another question? ", "Darrin Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital ", "The sequential increase in technology and facilities expense, that was associated purely with the infrastructure changes in Japan?", "Phil Tomlinson ", "", "That is correct. We have got a data center and office in Brazil. We have got a significant development going on in Japan taking TS Prime to the point where we can process multi banks in Japan. So a little more difficult than your average development. We think we are in good shape there. ", "Darrin Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital ", "One question about conversion from letters of intent to contract, after it has already converted to contracts how long does it generally\u2026I just remember going back and looking at Capital One when you had the conversion there it took about a year I would say, right? For the systems? ", "Phil Tomlinson ", "", "That is right. Frankly it depends more on the client than it does us. We have done them in 90 days but you wouldn\u2019t do one that large in 90 days. They have work they have to do. There is a training issue. So again depending on the situation and the knowledge base and everything else as bad as I hate to say it, it is anywhere from typically six months to a year. ", "Darrin Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital ", "What I am trying to figure out is you have about $30 million or so of purges and about $37 million or so over the past year of fee conversions. So you have lost something like 60 million accounts and new client adds of about 25 or 30 also. With the 21 letter of intent, is there enough expected to offset these kinds of losses you have had or will have over the next year in the domestic market given all the pressure, the purges and the de-leveraging going on? ", "Phil Tomlinson ", "", "We think so. We don\u2019t know what the future holds with the shape of some of these financial institutions. We are hoping that if another WaMu type failure happened we don\u2019t have that plugged in obviously. ", "I think if you look at our de-conversions this year I don\u2019t know if we will have that high a number of accounts next year. We don\u2019t know of any that you don\u2019t know of. ", "Darrin Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital ", "Anything else in the next couple of quarters besides what we just discussed with regards to Wachovia and Carrefour that we should be aware of just in terms of modeling? ", "Phil Tomlinson ", "", "No. I think that is pretty much it for the short-term. Like I say, we will certainly announce these as soon as we possibly can. ", "Operator", "", "There appear to be no further questions in queue. Do you have any closing comments you would like to finish with? ", "Phil Tomlinson ", "", "I do. We certainly appreciate your attendance and interest in the questions. We certainly have been trying to be as transparent as we can. We have seen indications of slight improvement but I don\u2019t think this industry is out of the woods as you could tell. We have some pretty strong headwinds and as I said earlier I really think we will until the consumer returns. ", "With clients I think I probably talked plenty about that with this regulation and it is taking a lot of effort. I do think that clients are trying to reinvent themselves, re-engineer their strategies and I think that is starting to happen. As we talked about the loss of WaMu, Wachovia, Charming Shops and the eventual loss of the Bank of America merchants. By the way I don\u2019t have any new details I could add to that about a time of departure or anything. We just don\u2019t have that yet. But it does create a big hole for us there. I think everybody in this industry is working harder than ever to ensure strong future growth and strained as the U.S. growth market is the international remains just the opposite. It is really moving fast and we are having great success there. ", "As I mentioned earlier TS Prime is just a great success story and we think it presents us with virtually unlimited opportunities. We have talked about the numerous letters of intent. I know you are curious about who that is. We were disappointed we didn\u2019t get some of these signed and announced but I am confident you will start hearing about them in the fourth quarter. We are still very positive about our long-term success but certainly we are trying to be realistic. In spite of the issues we believe that we still have many great strengths and we have solid cash flow. We have a pristine balance sheet. We have a passionate, diverse workforce. ", "We have a very unique service culture here. We have world class technology and products. We have an ability that we have proven to manage expenses. We believe we are recognized for our leadership in this business and we are being really aggressive right now to diversify the company more and as you would expect we are on the prowl for something we could acquire that would make sense. ", "I think all of these plus others are helping us weather the storm. I have full confidence in our ability to make smart decisions to ensure we stay strong and competitive. I do think that our financial leverage and our strength there is helping us through this. We thank you for your interest. We appreciate your support and we look forward to hearing from you. If you have any follow-up questions Shawn Roberts will be listening out for you. Again, thanks and I hope you have a great week. ", "Operator", "", "Thank you ladies and gentlemen.

At this time all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and we\u2019ll open the floor for your questions and comments following the presentation.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Shawn Roberts. Sir, the floor is yours.", "Shawn Roberts", "Thank you Dan and welcome everyone. We\u2019re going to do the call a little differently today. First, our CFO Jim Lipham will review the 2009 financials and 2010 guidance with the slide show presentation provided. Our Chairman of the Board and CEO, Phil Tomlinson will then add color to both 2009 and 2010 and then of course we\u2019ll open it up for Q-and-A.", "I would like to now call your attention to the fact that we\u2019ll be making forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS\u2019s actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in TSYS\u2019s reports filed with the SEC.", "At this time I\u2019d like to introduce TSYS CFO Jim Lipham.", "Jim Lipham", "", "Thank you, Shawn. Before I get started on the deck I\u2019d like to go over just a few things that are themes of this 2009 year for those that have not participated before in the call, but obviously you will hear a lot about the negative currency exchange we\u2019ve had and face this had year, the economic crisis on the credit card industry in general.", "As well as our customer base where we have lost customers to acquisitions and just sometimes programs just get canceled, but overall we have pretty pleased with \u201809, it ended up inline with our guidance and also inline with consensus both for the quarter and year-to-date, and I think you will also see as we go through here that we had another great year in generating cash flow, about $253 million from operations, and we ended the year at cash at $450 million unrestricted and that\u2019s more than double from what it was at the year end of December of \u201808.", "With that I\u2019ll get started on slide six where we\u2019re got analysis here for quarter-to-quarter comparison \u201809 to \u201808 and also year-to-date, just some highlights there. If you look at the quarter for total revenues, you will see that it is up 1%. We did have positive currency during the fourth quarter for the first time in several quarters. It was up about $3.9 million and on the constant currency basis that made us basically flat. Of note during the quarter is we lost $16.1 million in revenues associated with client deconversions.", "We offset it with growth in new business as well as some internal growth and we also had a termination fee around $9 million, in our international business that helped us there. When you drop down to operating income you\u2019ll see we\u2019re up 3% or $2.8 million for the quarter and currency played about $700,000 impact of that $2.8, but the non-recurring fee helped and as you will see going forward in here, we continue to have infrastructure build out on the international front as we keep expanded in Brazil, Japan and U.K.", "This is all preparing ourselves for the future in Brazil to get up and running here in 2010 and we\u2019re pleased to have that happening. Also, you will see here transactions for the quarter they\u2019re up 4%, and if you look at our same client transactions, which we talk about a lot, meaning they were customers here in the fourth quarter of \u201808 and the one that is are here now, we take out the normal these of new customers coming on and some of the customers leaving, but if you looked at that for the quarter, first time it has been up year-over-year in a little over 2%.", "As you know, we started the year with those quarters being down on same client transactions of about 2%, but overall good quarter. We\u2019re up at $0.31 a share and feel pretty good about where we ended up. When you look at the year-to-date 4 to 12 months, total revenues, we\u2019re down 2%. We were suffering through $46.8 million of currency translation in addition to the lost business.", "We lost approximately $69 million due to deconversion of portfolio sales, so overall we did pretty good in coming up and offsetting that and getting on the constant currency basis we actually up 1%. So, felt good about holding our own during the year. Operating income, we\u2019re down 7%. We had a negative impact of currency there of a little over $7 million, so that took a little stanch out there.", "When you look at transactions for year-over-year were down 6% on a just transaction basis, total transactions, but when you look at same client for the year were slightly down 4.9% after starting the year down 2.78%, so pretty good growth on internal revenues and new customers to help offset the loss.", "If you go to the next slide seven, you will see slide on our client movement since last year. First column you have Client Adds summary of 352.5 million accounts at the end of \u201808 and how that figure has changed during the year with internal growth at $25.2 million, 8.7% growth there. We had new clients of $28.1 million and you can see out to the right there some of the adds that we had with retail group Barclays and Deutsche Bank.", "Purchases and sales lost $34.1 million. We\u2019ve talked about that before. We did have 6.5 million accounts purged off in the fourth quarter and just to let you know, the overall impact in \u201809 of purged accounts is really immaterial, about $3.6 million as we said before. Those accounts usually when they get purged they\u2019re not very active at all.", "Deconversions, $26.9 million; you can see to the par right there clients lost to Washington Mutual and Nordstrom. Those are the two big ones and we talked about that. On the summary down below by segment you\u2019ll see consumer is the biggest loss we had during the year of 18 million accounts from deconversions and retail group was followed up 10 million accounts from deconversions and purges.", "Now these are the two high dollars per account categories that we have. The big offset coming in there is from stored value, which doesn\u2019t carry quite the revenue stream these others do. Sequentially of importance is since September, we\u2019ve grown 2.3 million accounts, and that\u2019s a good story there from the growth in new business.", "On the next slide if you look at the currency, just a good graph to show you what\u2019s happened to us over the last two years. Obviously, \u201808 we were hurt $21 million and currency exchange, and this year we finished out at $46.8 million and you can see for the fourth quarter we were up $3.9 million, which is first time in five quarters, we\u2019ve been there six quarters. You finished \u201809 at average exchange rate on the pound at 1.63 and we do have in comparison to \u201808 that was 1.58, so 5.9, so pretty close. As we go out into \u201810 and I\u2019ll talk about it again later, but we\u2019re using 1.65 as our exchange rate for 2010.", "On the next chart on the fourth quarter just a segment for North America just talk briefly about that. Revenues $253.6 million, represents 59% of our total revenues. We went through a loss of $16.1 million there for deconverted clients. We were able to maintain our operating margin by reduction in headcount and managing expenses down 230 people in this segment, and that\u2019s not including the discontinued ops that we did with TDM. There was another 170 people we lost in that. So overall, out of these numbers you saw in year-over-year comparison 230 people reduction.", "Operating margins at 22.7%, as I said maintained what it has been. When you exclude the reimbursements, we\u2019re actually went down 35 basis points to 26.9, but year-over-year excuse me for the quarter same client transactions year-over-year $1.57 billion, they\u2019re up 1.9%. Total card holder transactions are down 6.6, which takes into account the loss of Wamu and Nordstrom.", "On the next slide, looks at international revenues of $101.4 million; on a constant currency basis, we dropped down to $97.5 million. We did have a positive currency there of $3.9 million. These revenues represent 20% of the total revenues, and this growth here in the international is about a 21% growth on constant currency basis, which is very good for the new business we put on there in international segment.", "Operating income at 18.3, currency played a part there for about 700,000 as I mentioned earlier. One thing of note on this segment this quarter, we did have the $10 million fee roughly for termination fee on a customer that canceled a program that they had going and that came in the fourth quarter.", "If you took out the fees operating margin with the fee in it is 18.1% without the fee it would be 11.6% and Europe or the international sector has been struggling a little bit with their margins as we build the infrastructure you will see more about that and hear more about it as we talk about 2010.", "If you look at the same client transactions in Europe, $286.8 million up 2.9% or 2.8%, and then year-over-year we got transaction growth of 12.6 which shows effects of the new business coming on board. We did cut about 27 people during this year in this segment. This is in light of the fact we have added people for growth in Brazil and for Carrefour and Deutsche Bank in Germany.", "We flip to the next page and look at the merchant segment revenues are $88 million. We had internal growth increasing revenues about 3% and our new clients we have had several of those come onto help offset the lost class that we had with some business would be a value in NPC, but the operating income is 17.4, very good number again was operating increased 24 basis points.", "Infonox is in these numbers that helped grow the revenues also and if I look at the operating income, excluding reimbursables, we\u2019re up 29.6% there or at 29.6%. If you remember, reimbursables is a pretty large number as a result of Visa changing their access fees structure and it pumped a lot of reimbursable revenues into our merchant segment.", "Point-of-sale transactions at 1.3 billion up about 6% for the quarter which is very strong, and a lot of that is coming from new business with GLC and new customer of theirs and the SA side of the point-of-sale traffic, and this segment here we dropped 64 people down with 800 employees.", "With that we\u2019re going to the next slide, just gives you an idea on the electronic payment processing fees about what the make up is it represents 67% of our total revenues before reimbursables and we have shown this the last three or four quarters and if you look at the chart we\u2019re finished the year 1% internal growth, which is historically quite low for us, but that\u2019s what it ended up in \u201809.", "We had new clients come on board to create about 3% and then we saw lost clients 5% and CTA 4% was drop of about 9% to get us down to our 5% reported change down year-over-year. I\u2019ll say purges in the fourth quarter I mentioned that a while ago of a little over $6.5 million and then we had the termination fee that came into help also on the electronic payment side, but with that we\u2019ll flip over to the merchant side and you will see internal growth there is a little stronger at 3%, point-of-sale traffic is good.", "New clients on board at 1% and the acquisitions, which is Infonox of 2%, some of the new clients are really ISOs with Merit bank and you had Aruba bank stuff that\u2019s new for \u201809. Lost business, lost clients 2% I mentioned that awhile ago, NPC and banks transactions before they do the deconversion next year, and then that\u2019s positive pick up of CTA with GP that in Japan.", "So, overall they\u2019re reported change year-over-year is up 6% and pretty good growth, and I think we continue to see growth in our merchant segment into 2010. Talk a little bit about cash on this next slide, if you look at the growth in the cash and pretty good through \u201808. We bought some things at the end of \u201808 and paid off a loan, bought Infonox for $50 million and then will paid off a loan for $54 million and finished up the year at $450 million I mentioned the cash flows from operations at $238 million.", "Free cash flows at $302 million it increased $92 million or 44% compared to last year which is very good. Might mention here that in light of this cash we still have our undrawn revolver portion of credit facility of $252 million and today that debt would be at line or plus 60 basis points, which would now be about 0.88%. So we have the financial resources really available to us to execute the strategies we\u2019re looking at and in the acquisition world and if need be any stock repurchase.", "We do have 6.9 million shares left on our stock repurchase brand, which is set to expire in April, and we will continue to remain active in the world of acquisition opportunities in looking at those things as we go forward.", "Next slide is cash flows measurements, operating cash flows, as I mentioned $423 million at the end of \u201809, \u201808 was $353 million, so pretty good growth there year-over-year. We continue to show good EBITDA numbers also. The drop from \u201808 to \u201809 really resulted from the change in our operating income year-over-year. So we hope that will pull itself backup pretty quick. Currency also played a part there in $13 million worth of currency.", "Flip over to the next page. We have cash flows again chart on operating activities of free cash flows. If you look at the operating cash flows, they continue to increase about 97% greater net income, and if you look at the free cash flow, it also continues to increase and is about 40% greater than net income, so very good. Free cash flow, as you know is amount without the property and equipment and all of the CapEx and stuff that we have there. So these are pretty good numbers on cash flow side. ", "Last chart on cash flow had to do with amount of cash flow to revenues numbers, and we have shown this before. We roughly bring to cash about 29.8% of each dollar of revenue, which pretty good compared to the industry and the other players in the unit. When you look at free cash flow growing at 44% for the year in December \u201809 and our GAAP net income is declined 13.9%, it\u2019s just speaks well for how we\u2019re able to grow our cash.", "With that, I will move into our 2010 guidance and start off with the some of the assumptions that we have in this 2010 guidance, concerning the changes with our customer base. We don\u2019t see any dramatic changes from what we have seen lately. We\u2019re pretty optimistic last year as we went into \u201809 and had to go in and change our guidance at the end of the first quarter. So this year we\u2019re really watching what is going on with the customer base and we\u2019re just not certain when that economy is going to change.", "We anticipate for 2010 as I mentioned before, the pound exchange rate is we\u2019re going to use 165 in our guidance, and then the euros we\u2019re going to use a 1.45. These are inline with what we\u2019ve been seeing here at the end of the fourth quarter. Also, the forecast is not going to assume any acquisitions, although we still remain active in that area, but if they come, they will come.", "We continue to be impacted by lost revenues from deconverted portfolios, and the customers sold and also a difference in onetime nonrecurring fees and I talk a little bit about the revenue side of this in the next two slides. From an expense perspective, we continue to build out of infrastructure needed for our planned conversions in 2010 and \u201811 on the international front as well as the US, but the main part being in the international and continue to be somewhat of a headwind on the international operating profit margin. We do anticipate a benefit of favorable currency, but it isn\u2019t going to have a huge impact at all on our operating income.", "On the next chart as far as the revenue change just gives you kind of a graph of what we\u2019re facing in 2010 with internal growth. We\u2019re using 1% or 1% to 2%. We\u2019ve been more aggressive in the past as I mentioned and we ended up having to come in and adjust guidance for things kind of not turning around like we thought it would in the mid year.", "We\u2019re estimating the new clients\u2019 growth of 3% to 4%, and as I mentioned currency would be favorable next year, but only to the tune of 1%. Then you get into the lost business of non-recurring items, price compression that are build in next slide, but that\u2019s cost us 11%. That\u2019s how we get down to the 6% to 4% down in revenues for reimbursable.", "If you flip over to the next slide, you\u2019ll see how that\u2019s made up. We start the year off at a $1.418 billion and we have lost business of $114 million. We\u2019ve talked about these before. You got Charming Shoppes, Nordstrom, Iowa WaMu, CLC, RBSG, just a multitude of customers there that are going to affect us during 2010. We also have some non-recurring onetime fees of $10 million. We had termination fees from WaMu and Scott Card and in \u201809 we\u2019ll have Charming Shoppes in Wachovia in 2010, but the net will be we\u2019ll be down $10 million.", "Then we have price concessions of $29 million with pretty large number with one big piece of that coming in the fourth quarter as far as us finding out or getting knowledge of that. I will say that during this fourth quarter we had about $22 million we were notified of lost business, about $22 million of this number during the fourth quarter, and then we had another $14 million due to timing on deconversions or not deconversions, but timing of conversions getting pushed out, took longer to sign the contract and delayed the timing on the conversion.", "When you look at the additional customers, or add on new business in internal growth, I mentioned we had 1% worth of our internal growth or organic growth in there that\u2019s about $14 million. We talked about in the past back before \u201808 our organic growth averaged 10% to 14%, it could be a lot to do with the customer base we had with WaMu, B of A.", "It\u2019s fast growing business, but irregardless of that if the internal growth was 7% I think we would be at what I think what consensus has in the market of $1.21 a share, but we feel like 1% is better for us as to what we\u2019re seeing right now and depending on when the economy turns. With that said, if we\u2019d used internal growth instead of 1% of $14 million and used 7% would be $95 million more dollars in here than what we had.", "Currency we mentioned this going to be around $13 million, somewhere give or take there, so we got a range of $10 million to $16 million. So overall, you\u2019re look at revenues being down $54 million to $81 million or 4% to 6% for 2010. With that we\u2019ll flip over to the next page.", "You can see the guidance is in the press release itself and the margin that we\u2019re looking at consolidated 21 to 23 is less than what we\u2019ve been doing in the 24% to 26% range, but there again we got infrastructure build. I will tell you that in the 2010 guidance what you\u2019ll see as a reduction in the salary category of roughly $30 million from the level we had at \u201809. We also had other category will be down about $11 million from \u201809\u2019s numbers.", "Both of those were in the 5% down range, but you\u2019ll see technology and the occupancy side of the house being up $28 million, which is indicative of the buildup in the infrastructure that we are having to do for the plant growth in the latter part of 2010 and \u201811 as well as continuing to enhance what we have in the Europe and Brazil. Brazil will be roughly about $5 million of that.", "I think with that I mentioned that the margins are going to be kind of depressed as we go forward in the international arena. We do see continue to see modest internal growth. Our trends sequentially have still been modestly better, but as we get into the drop off of these customers in the first, second quarter of next year, we\u2019ll see some pressure on our margins also, but the merchant business continues to grow.", "We continue to look at acquisitions as our cash balance continues to grow and feel pretty good. I mean if the economy turn or the organic growth would improve, obviously it comes with very a little costs associated with it. With that, Phil I\u2019ll turn it back over to you.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Thank you, Jimmy. Obviously, the guidance is less than stellar and I can assure you that we\u2019re not satisfied with that. As a 30 year veteran of this industry, this recession continues to rock the core foundation of the banking and card industry among others. From a macroeconomic level there\u2019s obviously far or less credit available and far fewer cards in the market. Consumers are spending less in general, and certainly on credit cards and they\u2019re saving more, which is a good thing.", "We believe until we see unemployment start to fall in people regaining jobs and feeling more secure and beginning to spend again. We expect some level of continued constriction. It is no surprise that we now believe and you\u2019ll recall last year about this time I made a statement that I thought we would see improvement in third and fourth quarter of the 2009, me and a lot of other people said that, \u201cI\u2019m not going to say that again this year.\u201d ", "We believe it\u2019s going to be a slow recovery and as the economy and the card industry in the economy and the card industry is reset to some new baseline, probably going to be somewhat different than what our historical numbers have been. As Jim described, entering 2010, we face a significant revenue hole unlike everything we have ever faced, and we faced some pretty big ones over the years.", "In the simplest terms we start the year with a reduction in revenues of $153 million. The add back somewhere between $72 million and $99 million in 2010 and that is with no growth and no acquisitions, and that represents a net revenue decline in the $54 million to $80 million range. There\u2019s a number of reasons that we find ourselves in this situation.", "As you know, revenue loss has come from several areas and we\u2019ve experienced unexpected client losses through deconverted portfolios. As a result of bank failures and portfolio sales like Charming Shoppes, every year and we did it in 2009, we made price concessions client renewals and those have averaged pretty well into the norm, about 2% of company revenue before reimbursables, which 1% to 2% is what we look for. Those are in historic range.", "We have reductions from onetime termination fees, which is a good trend, but as Jimmy said, it has a negative effect in 2010, and of course the currency impact. As a result of this regulation of this industry and the continued economic problems clients have, they continue to delay projects or they stopped them altogether and organic growth has been anemic at best. We talked to all of you for years about organic growth over the past ten years prior to 2008 and 2009 as Jimmy said again it ranged from 10% to 14%.", "At the end of 2007, it was better than 13.50, and I can\u2019t recall exactly what the number was, but it was the best organic growth we\u2019d ever had. You heard what would happen if it just were to move from one to seven. It cures a lot of problems. The infrastructure and investment in development to position us to grow this thing internationally has certainly placed expenses ahead of revenue growth.", "This is normally a great problem to have, but it\u2019s a financial negative in 2010. We\u2019ll refill this revenue hole to some degree in 2010, but we won\u2019t refill it completely this year. For transparency, I want to try to review North America, international and merchant segments separately.", "So, let\u2019s start with North America. North America accounts for right at $93 million of the total revenue loss that we have been discussing. While we have always been at risk with bank consolidation, the current crisis as facilitated even greater consolidation, with the very largest players dominating much of the payment business, but now as everybody in this industry and I think you would note TSYS is perfectly suited for these largest of issuers.", "Some of them prefer to do it in house or in sourced, and operate multiple systems with what we think would be high over head, but we\u2019re approaching these guys of very largest with customized solutions, flexible options that they can choose from or they can select a combination to fit their specific operational needs.", "For example, we do the processing for probably the top 20 commercial card users in the world and that would include the very largest financial institutions. The problem we had is the US market for all practical purposes has been dead in 2009. We had no significant wins in the US which will contribute to 2010 revenues. We do have some wins coming that you will that hopefully you will see soon.", "In some respects we do believe that market conditions offer smaller players an opportunity to get back into this business or start their own card program or to be a little bit more aggressive than they\u2019ve been historically and when I am talking about the smaller players, I am talking about smaller community banks and regional players, credit unions. Most all of those, particularly the credit unions that appear have been exempt from these massive losses and they seem to manage their customers pretty well.", "We have a solution for this sector in two of the 21 LOIs that I referenced last quarter from this group and hopefully we can announce those soon. We\u2019re continuing to make good progress I believe signing clients in Canada. This market represents four of those 21 letters of intent.", "We have two of the four contracts signed, which are well recognized brands, but we have not announced them yet and two of those have decided that we go through this all the time they do not want to announce until the program is live or two of them want to do that and we think we\u2019ll be able to announce the others in some reasonable timeframe we\u2019ve just signed those contracts.", "So, we\u2019ll be able to partially refill the revenue hole in North America after these additions, but most of this will come later in the year. We will include the onetime termination fees to be received in 2010 and with a very minor organic growth number like 1%. Many of the funded sees base or predict to pickup in consumer confidence in the third quarter just like we predicted last year and we just going to really wait and see because we\u2019re just not sure any more.", "On the international front we gave price concessions to a couple of large existing customers as we extended and renewed contracts out through 2014. We have talked about that before. We also lost a large co-branded deal from a large bank partner in the U.K. and but we will still serve the bank partner, but we did lose a probably one of the largest co-branded deals in the U.K. So we do have a nice pipeline of additions let me go back and say so internationally we going to enter 2010 with a $33 million revenue hole.", "So we have these new additions we have currency, some organic growth, and we expect revenues for international services to be up slightly. We recently announced the signs of Degussa Bank in Germany and if you recall last quarter I talked about how history indicates that we have a success in a region or country, we tend to add new clients and create clusters of business like Ireland and the U.K. and the Netherlands and we\u2019re certainly hopeful about and the U.S. and Canada and Mexico, and we\u2019re hopeful about Brazil and China and Japan.", "So we\u2019re looking forward to that. I think you\u2019re going to see more to come in Germany. We\u2019ve also signed the most successful internet bank in Japan for a card program. We\u2019re going to announce several new clients signed in the coming weeks and months of the 21 I referenced earlier nine of these are international. We won every single competitive bid that we were involved in internationally.", "When we won those in a two-month period, we received confirmation on all nine of these prospects and frankly we completed the analysis on the development and infrastructure required to bring this business on. We realized the effort will be greater than we had anticipated, and we\u2019ve had to recalibrate or adjust our conversion schedules. The worst thing we can do is have a bad conversion.", "Last quarter, we talked a lot in 2009 about Carrefour down in Brazil, and we talked about the conversion plans scheduled for early 2010. I just want to clear that up. The date has been pushed out by about four months, and we\u2019ve scheduled, we and they together have scheduled a staged approach beginning in March. We do have several hundred accounts friends and family out now with a major push in May and the final push to be converted in the fourth quarter.", "We have key milestone dates coming up, and we\u2019ll keep you up to-date if anything changes on that. We got a great team dedicated to this project, and we think as this Carrefour conversion becomes successful, and we make those folks happy, it\u2019s going to lead to again a cluster in Brazil. I want to take just a minute and talk about Card Tech which is where this prime software has come from.", "We acquired Card Tech in 2005. We have a software licensing business in over 70 countries today. We took Prime, which was the software that was designed to be licensed to issuers anyway we took Prime, the licensed payment software and we have created a server based multi-card management outsourcing model for new and emerging markets.", "We\u2019re creating a fully integrated system that manages debit, credit installments, prepaid merchant acquiring retail services, and we\u2019re coupling on top of that other support services such as customer care, fraud, risk, reporting, and internet based reporting tools and reports.", "The amount of work invested in this infrastructure requirement and the development of ours to get TS Prime ready or market ready has taken longer than we first estimated, because we\u2019re building a completely new system for new markets and new clients, and we are convinced we\u2019re going to do it right. The technology investment necessary to support TS Prime in new markets will be incremental costs spread over years.", "We\u2019ll continue to invest as we deploy this model on a country by country approach. What we have found and what we talked about on earlier calls with you is every country is pretty dramatically different in the last one.", "On the merchant processing side overall revenue growth will be down slightly. We enter 2010 with a revenue shortage on the merchant front of approximately $26 million. As Jimmy said, about half of that is, Bank of America and their new agreement. Again, we will be adding new client additions, have new client additions. We have some organic growth built in, very little, and it is going to partially refill that revenue gap in this processing sector.", "So with decreasing revenues, our challenge becomes how to balance the need for near term results that meet the demands of the street while not sacrificing muscle that\u2019s needed for future growth expansion, diversification, and so on. We just have to figure out how to balance that, and we\u2019re in the process, we\u2019ve been in the process of doing that. We\u2019re doing it today.", "We have announced here internally that effective immediately bonuses, salaries, and discretionary retirement plan contributions or frozen until we see some improvement in this economy. New hiring is frozen indefinitely, again until we see improvement. Through attrition and a reduction in force in 2009, we reduced our overall workforce by approximately 5% in the U.S. and we plan to doing the same thing in 2010.", "So when you add 2009 and 2010 together, we will reduce our headcount by about 10%, which is headcount makes up 54% of our expense base. We will also realign and redeploy a greater position of our technology workforce from mainframe to server based technologies.", "We will focus even more markets outside the U.S. and accelerate the deployment of our PRIME solution and when I say that, we\u2019re doing that primarily because while there is some activity going on in the U.S., and it is by far the largest card market in the world. We still have not seen the U.S. market pick up to historic prisoner organizations.", "Now, we do believe it will pick up after the UDAP settles down and all of this re-regulation settles down. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re asking why after all talk about international expansion, the great success we\u2019ve achieved internationally, why haven\u2019t the international wins refilled revenue bucket, creating a global company is difficult it takes time.", "It\u2019s got a lot of obstacles, but we\u2019re confident the payoff is there. It\u2019s just going to be slower than we expected in this $150 million plus deficiency is very, very hard for us to overcome in a year and so 2010, if nothing else is going to be a year of transition for TSYS, but we believe that the recession and employment will make some progress. We\u2019re not predicting it is going to cure itself.", "We are certainly hopeful that banks and retailers health will get better. We don\u2019t know of any clients that are close to the tipping point as compared to last year, we did know for example that Wamu was in serious trouble. So delinquencies are running through this cycle and charge offs are going to have to run through this cycle and reset to a new norm that banks can tell you better than I can when that cycle kind of flushes itself out.", "Our industry is certainly going to have to adjust to this new regulation and develop new schemes to improve profits and products, and I certainly believe that we will do that. We do have the flexibility to do most anything you want to do on a credit, debit, prepaid, any kind of card like that. We\u2019re going to continue to win in the marketplace, and the U.S. opportunities will improve at some point and we believe that we have a compelling option.", "The consumer\u2019s preference for electronic payment will start growing again because it \u2018is easier, it\u2019s more secure than cash or checks and I have no doubt that activity will pickup. Several things I wanted to assure you of today. We hate giving this guidance. We\u2019re tired of sounding like we\u2019re offering excuses on how hard things are these days in spite of the fact they\u2019re hard.", "We\u2019re tired and I am tired personally of no salary increases or bonuses and we\u2019re totally committed to getting this off side of the ditch. The TSYS team will manage through 2010 and we\u2019re going to come out 2011 stronger, leaner and much more diversified.", "In closing I want to leave you with three things. One is our pipeline of new business continues to improve over the next several months you will start seeing a string of announcements that will bring more comfort. The second is our balance sheet and cash flow continues to be strong and it really provides us with the ability to do most any acquisition we want.", "We made really good progress on several fronts regarding acquisitions and I would be badly disappointed if we\u2019re going to make some positive announcements on this front early later this year. No acquisitions as Jimmy said are included in the 2011 guidance. We continue to have the gold standard in technology, a great team with a will to win, I recurring revenue model and an aggressive expense reduction plan.", "So, we believe with what we\u2019re doing we can be an even stronger force in this industry that we know and love. I regret any disappointment in today\u2019s guidance and we hope we have been as transparent as we know how to be and that you\u2019re able to see the future opportunities on our plate.", "So, with that I will open it up for questions-and-answers.", "Question-and-Answer Session ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Adam Frisch - Morgan Stanley.", "Adam Frisch - Morgan Stanley", "", "Let\u2019s get into the numbers a little bit trying to get a sense of normalized run rate here. In the last few years what kind of negative impact with the lost business non-recurring items and price compression of add on rest versus the 11% you\u2019re forecasting for 2010?", "Jim Lipham", "Probably, Adam this 5% or less in prior years I mean it and never been this big.", "Adam Frisch - Morgan Stanley", "Is there anything we\u2019re seeing now in terms of regulation or secular changes in the industry that may not be coming back where you would expect that number to not be restored hopefully when things normalize a little bit in the future?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Adam, I mean I would be kid you if I thought I could tell you exactly what the effects of this re-regulation, this UDAP as we call it will be I think it will put a cloud over the card business for sometime, but the card business is a very profitable business for the issuers, and as I said earlier, I believe that we will come up with new schemes and well projects and products that the consumer will want.", "I think that our customers are just dealing with these and you have seen the results of some of these credit card programs here in the last few days and just continue to deal with this rash of pretty massive losses and they\u2019re really having a hard time thinking about growing much of anything right now.", "I don\u2019t I hope and pray that the position that this economy is in is not the norm, and I just don\u2019t believe that I believe it will improve although its obviously going to improve a lot slower than most everybody on this globe had predicted.", "Adam Frisch - Morgan Stanley", "On the 11% again, how much of that number is already known and announced versus new challenges that may not be public yet? Are you expecting other losses or know of other losses that may have not been announced yet?", "Phil Tomlinson", "We don\u2019t know of anything else. We have told you everything that we are aware of.", "Adam Frisch - Morgan Stanley", "I\u2019m assuming BAMs is in that 11% as well?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Part of BAMs is in that 11%.", "Jim Lipham", "All the back end on BAMs has been taken out at the end of April. I think we took about $9 million roughly.", "Phil Tomlinson", "We took some front end out. We took twelve out.", "Adam Frisch - Morgan Stanley", "We\u2019ll follow-up with Shawn after the call on this one. Two quick last ones because I know it\u2019s getting late here. Can you give us a sense how long the growth rates will progress through the course of the year because the comps do get easier as we go through, but are we going to start out low and get higher as we go through or is it going to be a steady negative four six throughout the whole.", "Jim Lipham", "It gets better in the third and fourth quarter as far as recurring business goes.", "Adam Frisch - Morgan Stanley", "Then I know it\u2019s a touchy subject, but I have to bring it up, Phil, because speculation has been out there now for a while. You talk about you doing the acquiring, but aside from the obvious answer of it depends on the price, would you consider at this point partnering up with someone? Do you feel like you need to offset more weakness you\u2019re seeing with maybe partnering up with somebody of size?", "Jim Lipham", "Listen, we like our independence, and I wouldn\u2019t want to get into that today.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse.", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "Just hoping to get some color on the international term fee in the quarter, was that a surprise or did you guys already have that factored into the quarter?", "Phil Tomlinson", "It was a surprise as far as when we gave guidance at the early part of the year. We did not know it.", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "The term fee was $9 million. How much in annual revenue and earnings will be lost heading into 2010 from that client?", "Jim Lipham", "We had roughly $13 million of revenue that we\u2019ll lose in 2010 outside of that fee that we had in \u201809.", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "So that\u2019s net then?", "Phil Tomlinson", "That\u2019s before the termination fee, that\u2019s right.", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "Then is there an earnings impact there?", "Phil Tomlinson", "There will be. Obviously, I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s going to be offset. I think a lot with growth as far as the infrastructure with this program. The computer equipment stuff like that probably nothing will leave and I mentioned earlier that we had 24 headcount reduction and international, and that\u2019s part of it. We do have to hire some people for Carrefour and Deutsche Bank, but overall headcount is down in Europe for next year.", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "Just wanted to look at those 21 LOIs that we were talking about last quarter, you talked about a few of them, but just looking to get a total sum above of where we are in terms of how many LOIs are still out standing and how many were actually closed in the quarter?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Let somebody add that up. I thought we went through most of that, but we let somebody try to add it up as of daily use.", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "I know nine international and then two in Canada and two in the U.S.", "Jim Lipham", "Four in Canada, two in the U.S., and I think I accounted for 15. I didn\u2019t try to give a status all of them.", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "As the others still out standing and hope to be closed about\u2026?", "Jim Lipham", "We still have the LOIs in effect, yes, I am sorry.", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "When we look at the guidance, when you talk about new business, how much of that is from these LOIs or does some of this from these LOI account conversions, there are accounts conversions spill over to 2011?", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "What was that again?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Say that again. I miss that question.", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "I am just trying to get a sense of are all of these LOIs that we know have closed, I guess how many accounts is that and are they all in the 2010 revenue guidance or is only some of that in 2010 and then a part of it gets pushed into 2011, Just trying to get a sense of that.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Most of it will be pushed into 2011. I mean, as we talked about before, it takes six months to a year to get these conversions done. We\u2019re trying to get the contracts signed. As we get the contracts signed, we get aggressive in trying to put these conversions processes together, but I think most of it will rollout to 2011. Better than 75% I would guess, and I\u2019m waiting for some nod either not they head and tell me that is right.", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "Last question for me, it sounds like because of getting ready to ramp up these contracts internationally, margins will be depressed in this segment. Can we expect to get back to more normalized operating margins as we head into 2011, especially in the international segments?", "Phil Tomlinson", "You\u2019ll get better than what you\u2019re going to get in 2010, because we\u2019re looking in the high single digits in the international. It will get better when it gets into 2010, but it won\u2019t reach the margin levels of the U.S.", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "We\u2019ll get back to historical international margins?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Probably not that quick, Bryan.", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "The goal is to eventually even beat those original margins?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Yes, because that\u2019s the long term goal, but the truth is, we think there are a huge amount of opportunities you outside of the U.S. and we\u2019re going after them, and it\u2019s going to cost us some margin short term, but we believe we need to strike while the iron is hot, we\u2019ve got the systems, we\u2019re spending the money on the infrastructure, and it\u2019s time to move on forward.", "Jim Lipham", "Bryan, you know the mix over in the international world in the U.K., a lot of its managed services, which is not the margin of the credit card processing fees itself.", "Phil Tomlinson", "As we expand internationally, if we get into Japan and get doing some processing there in a little bigger way, it\u2019s just a lot of influences on that margin.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason Kupferberg - UBS.", "Jason Kupferberg - UBS", "Wanted to hone in a little bit on which piece of the guidance equation for 2010 has kind of taken you guys most by surprise? I know you talked about the loss that you were notified of in Q4 and that\u2019s $22 million if I\u2019m not mistaken. The other losses I think were generally known already. ", "It sounds like some of the conversions the LOIs that you\u2019ve closed are perhaps progressing slower than expected. Then you\u2019ve got the cost of the international infrastructure build out. Maybe that\u2019s a bit more than you envision, so is it really a combination of those three factors that in aggregate have taken you most by surprise or\u2026?", "Phil Tomlinson", "It is an absolutely a combination of those, and some of it has taken us by surprise, honestly. It has taken us by surprise to some degree. We are moving with our Canadian customers\u2019 right on target. Those are no issue. We\u2019ll be in great shape with the Canadian wins Brazil we have a little set back there. I talked about it earlier. We\u2019re going to be about four months late there.", "We obviously had never expected to win nine out of nine in Europe, and we have had to kind of step back in adjust and figure out a conversion process for that. As we finish this software and as we get better at TSYS Prime and as we understand these countries better, I think this process may pick up some, but I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to promise that today.", "As we said a second ago, we don\u2019t know of anybody that is teetering on the edge. You guys know more than we do. I don\u2019t know of anybody that\u2019s about to get bought by somebody who would want to move the business. So we think we\u2019re past that cycle. Jimmy talked a little bit about purges, pretty well purged all you can purge. We do have some retail guys that will probably purge some stuff this year, but its not a massive number, its not a massive amount of dollars.", "Most all of it revolves around it was a good surprise, but it has created the European thing was a good surprise, but it has created some problems for us that we will overcome because I have no doubt we\u2019re the very best in the world at doing this and too, this organic growth thing is just so bad. I mean if we could get 5% organic growth, you would see a different set of numbers as Jimmy talked about earlier.", "Jason Kupferberg - UBS", "Right and can you talk a little bit about the circumstances around the Q4 termination did the customer go back in house or was it a vendor switch or what occurred there?", "Phil Tomlinson", "We process this Affinity Group for a bank and them for whatever reason, I just I can\u2019t get into the details, but they had a falling out and decided they would separate their relationship and they have basically shut down that program. Nobody was made at us if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking. We didn\u2019t have it one a service problem or somebody upset with us. It just I think a sign of the times, honestly.", "Jason Kupferberg - UBS", "Then free cash flow outlook for 2010 relative to net income and maybe in conjunction with that can you talk about how big of an acquisition would you realistically be willing to consider based on your capital structure strategy and obviously you have been building up a lot of cash on the balance sheet and clearly the strategic intent seems to be there but wanted to get a sense of how big could a realistic acquisition be?", "Phil Tomlinson", "After today we would consider a really big one.", "Jason Kupferberg - UBS", "How would you define really big?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Well, we\u2019ve talked about that before. I mean, we think we can go up to, what, Jimmy?", "Jim Lipham", "We\u2019re looking at I think we\u2019re comfortable with 2 to 2.5 times EBITDA.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Generally there is a lot of things out there that are for sale and I know that we\u2019re a conservative company and you can say, well you guys have just not been willing to pull the trigger, but we just haven\u2019t found anything I mean, it takes just as much discipline not to buy something as it does to buy something.", "Jason Kupferberg - UBS", "Fair enough and 2010 free cash flow outlook and then I am done.", "Jim Lipham", "Should be inline with what we\u2019re seeing today. I don\u2019t have that number here about $302 million.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tim Willi - Wells Fargo.", "Tim Willi - Wells Fargo", "", "One on expenses Jim, could you go over your commentary about how you think about the expense lines in 2010? I think you talked about other would be potentially down a little bit but then you made comments around the FTEs and occupancy and technology?", "Jim Lipham", "The headcount reductions that Phil talked about and where we are with attrition going forward, you should see a decrease of $30 million in the total for 2010 compared to \u201809 in the personnel side and then we\u2019ll have roughly $28 million increase in technology, which in occupancy, which is the huge infrastructure we have we got it in India.", "We got it in Russia, we got it in Japan, we got it in Brazil, we go some in the U.K. as far as disaster recovery and things that we had to build up there, but overall that\u2019s going to be the real Achilles Heel is $28 million hitting the international area, and then we\u2019ll have about an $11 million reduction in the other category, which is where our professional fees, and travel, and this kind of thing are.", "Tim Willi - Wells Fargo", "", "Then on the technology and occupancy equipment, is there anything there in terms of that incremental 28 that you would view as maybe a cyclical or onetime kind of spend or is that going to be a permanent part of the expense structure going forward?", "Phil Tomlinson", "We know the $5 million with Brazil is going to be a recurring item going forward. For me to say about the other $20 million as far as onetime or not, I\u2019d have to really take a little harder look at that, some of the disaster recovery which will be going forward. I just don\u2019t have that breakout.", "Tim Willi - Wells Fargo", "Then going back to B of A, you guys had articulated about a half a year ago, what their revenue contribution was and EPS contribution or anticipated EPS contribution for \u201809. So just sort of as you think about this 12 million-ish that you said was in the sort of the revenue goal, I guess if you had any additional discussions with them and what\u2019s your comfort level that by the time we\u2019re done with \u201810 that your estimation will be accurate and just sort of thinking about the rest of all that revenue, which I think is sort of towards $70 million based upon the press release you guys put out awhile ago?", "Phil Tomlinson", "In looking at what we did with the $12 million, obviously we said about $3 million of that is from the front end point of sale and the other has to do with the back end piece of the processing and then obviously that $9 million is a lot of that to go straight to the bottom line, I mean after taxes obviously, but we feel good about what we\u2019ve done there. We know they can pull the back end as soon as they want to do in April and the contract termination date at this point.", "We\u2019re in negotiations on the front end as to whether we already do, they are a customer of TSYS already on the front end point-of-sale or at least FDC is I\u2019m talking about, and if it\u2019s just very hard for them to move the terminals, especially the dial terminals out there. So we know we\u2019re probably lose incremental business coming on board after April, but as far as point-of-sale, but it will be very hard for them to take away from us what we already have. It will be very slow.", "Tim Willi - Wells Fargo", "So if your original commentary was roughly around $70 million, I think you said 4% of the \u201808 revenue, 12 million you\u2019re expecting to leave, which leaves another 58 sitting out there and you\u2019re saying that that seems pretty sticky or\u2026?", "Phil Tomlinson", "Pretty sticky.", "Tim Willi - Wells Fargo", "You really think that once they put this thing together you\u2019re still pretty important vendor to that joint venture?", "Phil Tomlinson", "I think so.", "Jim Lipham", "At least for some period of time, probably not forever, it is a strange world we live in these days, they\u2019re already a customer.", "Tim Willi - Wells Fargo", "I know that it is. Can I just ask one last thing going back to Bryan\u2019s question about letters of intent and contract try to keep all of these numbers straight? Did I hear you say, Phil, you have signed nine of those letters in Europe into actual contracts?", "Phil Tomlinson", "No. We have nine letters of intent. We\u2019ve signed several of them in the contract. I know we\u2019ve signed two in Canada in the contract. That\u2019s eight LOIs and two contracts and then four contracts internationally.", "Tim Willi - Wells Fargo", "I guess it would be helpful if you had any color at point in time, whether it\u2019s this call or the next one of what you actually contracted\u2026?", "Phil Tomlinson", "We can give you a slide on it.", "Tim Willi - Wells Fargo", "What\u2019s you contracted and what sort of a base run rate might be, and obviously \u201810 is a challenge, but I think it would be helpful on the visibility thinking about the likelihood much \u201811 showing growth is to what sitting out there that signed, but you won\u2019t really comment for a while directly, but at least giving us a feel for it?", "Phil Tomlinson", "That\u2019s fair point.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Glenn Green - Oppenheimer.", "Glenn Green - Oppenheimer", "I guess just the one question I want to drill down is sort of the revenue hole for 2010. I kind of looking at the three piece parts, the price compression makes sense and I think that was inline with historical, about $29 million, the non-recurring fee grow over that makes sense as well. I guess I am having trouble reconciling in the 114 million deltas on the lost business.", "We\u2019ve talked about a few of the piece parts being roughly 12 million which is manageable and then the 13 million on the international client the way you alluded to from the fourth quarter loss. Obviously Nordstrom you have another half year run off. WAMU I would have thought you would have lost the bulk of that in 2009, so I guess the big question I am getting at is trying to understand the order of magnitude of the lost business.", "Phil Tomlinson ", "", "Let me see if I can help you with Charm Shops is about 26 million.", "Jim Lipham", "Its Nordstrom, Wachovia, WAMU, still there.

Which are the big ones beyond Charming Shoppes that we haven\u2019t early addressed.", "Phil Tomlinson ", "Sky Card, Nordstrom, Wachovia.", "Jim Lipham", "Wachovia I thought was only perhaps 1.5% of revenue, that order of magnitude. Alright since basically you sort of add these all up and kind of get there basically a bunch in the 1% to 2% of revenue range?", "Phil Tomlinson ", "Glenn that was I may have misspoken there. I think that may have been the cards. I can\u2019t tell you the number of cards.", "Jim Lipham", "1.5 million cards is what it was.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer", "For Wachovia.", "Jim Lipham", "Yes.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer", "Any idea percentage of revenue directionally, the only reason I ask is I heard different numbers overtime.", "Jim Lipham", "It is small. I don\u2019t have it in front of me.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer", "I thought it was small. Okay. Thank you.", "Jim Lipham", "Trust me it adds up to 114.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer", "I believe you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paul Bartolai - PB Research.", "Paul Bartolai - PB Research", "Just some of the termination fees, just a lot of moving parts. I\u2019m wondering if you guys could quantify the term fees in fourth quarter and for 2009 that you recognized.", "Phil Tomlinson ", "Quantify the term fees? Termination fees?", "Paul Bartolai - PB Research", "Termination fees, right, just help to get a comparison to understand kind of what the run rate is in 2010 and how much impact we\u2019re going to see next year.", "Phil Tomlinson ", "Did roughly about $42 million in \u201809 we\u2019ll do about $32 million in 2010.", "Paul Bartolai - PB Research", "So and in that\u2019s included in the guidance, the $32 million?", "Phil Tomlinson ", "Yes, it is.", "Paul Bartolai - PB Research", "Then the price compression you talked about I mean is that something that\u2019s been increasing in magnitude in recent months or is that something that remained pretty steady?", "Phil Tomlinson ", "Well, we\u2019ve always been in the business of price compression and I think it probably has increased somewhat, particularly as the big guys started to renew. They\u2019re under tremendous pressure and we\u2019re under pressure to keep it to a reasonable amount, so that\u2019s one reason we signed long term contracts and these contracts do have pricing trenches in most of them and so as they that are given out as a growth incentive. Yes, I think everybody is under price pressure.", "Paul Bartolai - PB Research", "Then the Charming Shoppes I think is probably decent chunk of the term fees. Is that going to be kind of spread out like we saw with WAMU or kind of a one timer in the first quarter? The Charming Shoppes termination fee, the termination fee related to Charming Shoppes, I am guessing that\u2019s a big chunk for the total for 2010 because that going to be onetime fee that\u2019s you recognize or spread out throughout 2010 like we saw with WAMU?", "Jim Lipham", "It is going to be onetime in the first quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Craig Moore - CLSA.", "Craig Moore - CLSA", "A couple questions first, to follow up on the previous question, looking out as issuers sort of process how they\u2019re going to deal with Card Act? Then the possibility of a tax on the banks coming on, I mean, wouldn\u2019t you think there could be an increase threat down the road further price taking by the banks?", "Jim Lipham", "Further price taking?", "Craig Moore - CLSA", "Basically, the banks trying to push even further on pricing to try to recapture some of the profitability, whether it\u2019s Card Act or possibly a tax on bank earnings for the next twelve years?", "Phil Tomlinson", "You mean pushing us?", "Craig Moore - CLSA", "Yes.", "Phil Tomlinson", "I don\u2019t know that they could push any harder. We\u2019ve been negotiating with issuers for 30 plus years now, and while it\u2019s not that easy, it\u2019s something that we are accustomed to as best you can become accustomed to that, and I don\u2019t think the numbers wouldn\u2019t make a big difference with them whether they got a 5% decrease or a 10% decrease in the scheme of things.", "It\u2019s not a huge number when you start looking at what these programs generate in revenue. Certainly, they\u2019re going to continue to press, I mean that\u2019s just the way everybody is in, and we fully expect that, and we\u2019re willing to own some of these, move some, and others we\u2019re not willing to.", "Craig Moore - CLSA", "So are you expecting to complete any renegotiation on large contracts this year that might have an incremental effect on the following year?", "Phil Tomlinson", "We have one that is in process, but it\u2019s already been factored in.", "Craig Moore - CLSA", "I\u2019d like to shift fronts. In Brazil, obviously you built infrastructure around Carrefour. With the dissolution of exclusivity down there on the merchant acquiring side, is there any opportunity you see, or is it still a question of being restricted by lack of scale and the need for a large banking partner for merchant acquiring in Brazil?", "Jim Lipham", "Well, I think you would have to have a banking partner. I don\u2019t know how large they would have to be, but I think it\u2019s a credibility issue for us right now. We\u2019ve got to get there.", "We\u2019ve got to make Carrefour happy, and as that happens, as they become satisfied with what we\u2019re doing, we are absolutely convinced we will gain more market share whether it be in the card processing side and we certainly think there\u2019s some opportunities in the merchant acquiring side whether it be processing or even possibly be Internet business. Let me clear that up. That is not something we\u2019re worried about right now. We are worried about getting Carrefour converted and happy and being a great reference site for us down there.", "Craig Moore - CLSA", "Back in the U.S. in terms of what you\u2019re building into guidance for this year, what kind of estimates you\u2019re looking for in terms of volume rebounds basically in a same store sale for credit cards?", "Jim Lipham", "Minimal, low organic growth and we don\u2019t have currently outside of some of the business and LOIs Phil talked about, we\u2019ll have new business come onboard. You still got to overcome these lost customers that we have in North America.", "Craig Moore - CLSA", "That wasn\u2019t necessarily what I was asking. Beyond lost customers, I\u2019m talking about in terms of same-store sales year-over-year and in terms of credit card volume, do you expect any type of rebound in 2010 excluding lost customers?", "Phil Tomlinson", "We have not built in any significant rebound.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Greg Smith - Duncan Williams.", "Greg Smith - Duncan Williams", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve given this, but do you have an estimate you can give out for accounts on file at year end 2010?", "Phil Tomlinson", "We don\u2019t have the international at this point.", "Greg Smith - Duncan Williams", "Do you have a domestic estimate? North America?", "Phil Tomlinson", "No, the thing I got here is consolidated, but I don\u2019t have the breakout by international in the U.S.", "Greg Smith - Duncan Williams", "Then looked like commercial accounts. I don\u2019t think you talked about this. Commercial accounts fell pretty significantly sequentially from $46 million to $41.1 million. Was there a single large client responsible for that or something else going on there? ", "Phil Tomlinson", "It was an account purge on B of A was the big drop.", "Jim Lipham", "GSA, I believe, their accounts that dropped off.", "Phil Tomlinson", "Let me try to explain that. As you may recall reading last year, we processed all of the GSA work for the government and the government services administration, and so B of A decided they were going to get out of that business and all of the banks that we processed forbid on it, and it was awarded to a bank, and so for a short period of time we just kept the accounts on file and those accounts transferred over to the new bank that won the bid.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Williams - Goldman Sachs.", "John Williams - Goldman Sachs", "Wanted to just drill down a little deeper, when you look at your revenue versus your EPS guidance, it implies that you guys aren\u2019t really able to chop out the expenses quickly enough to keep up with what you\u2019re seeing on the revenue line, which is a bit surprising. We\u2019re trying to figure out how we need to think about the expense leverage in the model going forward. I think the sense was that it was higher than it seems to be, so maybe you can give a little more color on that?", "Phil Tomlinson", "We historically have been able to plan ahead for some of this as we would lose a piece of business and on a couple of occasions we had some big business setting in the wings, but it is just like these computers. I mean, if you don\u2019t know well ahead of time, you cannot just turn this stuff back in.", "We have leases and we have to stay with them until the leases are up. Jimmy can probably add more to it than I can. We haven\u2019t had organic growth and we kept thinking that based on everything that we read and heard that organic growth would start returning to some degree more so than it has and of course we have put in a lot of new infrastructure, particularly really all in international.", "Jim Lipham", "I think I\u2019d add to that on the part about that as soon as and equipment stuff. The more you get in business, I mean it\u2019s scalable. I mean, when you start one up, you don\u2019t get to scale it. So it\u2019s distorts your cost obviously and then Phil mentioned organic growth. Organic growth goes straight to operating income. It doesn\u2019t have any cost really associated with it to speak of and then you\u2019ll have a little mainframe costs, but not much.", "John Williams - Goldman Sachs", "So it\u2019s a function of the scale that you\u2019ve built in anticipation of adding future accounts?", "Jim Lipham", "In the scale you can go up just as easily as it can go down. We talked about 10% or 7% organic growth we used to experience 10%, if we used to do just about $120 million, when you look at that on your bottom line and you all of a sudden up 20% next year instead of being down.", "John Williams - Goldman Sachs", "Actually to your point, Phil, when you think about the last few years where growth rates you could arguably say that growth rates were a little higher than they really should have been or at least sort of bolstered by everything else going on in the market, when you think about long term trends and what your long term run rate is going to be on growth. Are you thinking low to mid single digits or is it something above that back towards the 7%? Do you think that\u2019s doable again?", "Phil Tomlinson", "I think that\u2019s doable again, but I do think that we\u2019ve got to get back to some normal economy where the consumer has some degree of confidence. We\u2019re very consumer driven, I mean if you look at these retailers or airlines.", "We have a lot of the same problems those guys would have because if the consumers not out spending, that\u2019s where the vast majority of these transactions are generated as well as we are the largest by far commercial card processor in the world and as you know and probably in your own organization businesses have cutback on travel and entertainment and so while we\u2019re fortunate in some ways that we don\u2019t make a fee on the amount of the transaction. The transactions themselves have slipped down a lot.", "John Williams - Goldman Sachs", "When you\u2019re thinking about your account breakdown by type, is there one particular area that we should think about focusing on in terms of where your growth is going to be over the next few years I know you\u2019ve talked about commercial card, but debit obviously is something that growing pretty high generally. Where do you see most of the growth coming from that do you think it will be at least when you look at the whole big picture is consumer still going to be what drives you guys or are you going to able make that up in the other segments..?", "Phil Tomlinson", "I think consumer will return to help as the economy improves. I think we\u2019ll do better in stored value. I think that this international business will continue to grow and I think we\u2019ll probably do better in the retail business. I think you will see some interesting things there over the hopefully the next several months that will be announced.

I wonder if you gave us kind of a headline number in response to an earlier question on free cash flow that are you looking for it to be about the same level as \u201809 if you can give us a bit more granularity on that, obviously in 2010 you will loosing $20 million, $25 million in net income.

I mean one that is capitalized software. We have been running kind of 6 million bucks a quarter for a while looks like it came in about 12. I mean was that project work in the fourth quarter or is that a new run rate?", "Phil Tomlinson", "This just project work mainly in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s usually when a lot of the capitalization goes on for those things. I mean, on the length of the project, how long it takes, but we did have a spike up in the fourth quarter.", "Robert Dodd - Morgan, Keegan", "Right and then the other item that picked up, contracted acquisition costs, is that been a theme in these contract renewals you mentioned pricing pressure, but are you seeing demands for more contract renewal bonuses or is that just new accounts that are getting those contract acquisition payments?", "", "Phil Tomlinson", "I don\u2019t know that we have seen any we got prepaid conversion costs and stuff that we have that we see with new clients, but renewals we don\u2019t have payments.

We have more to do for Canada.

I don\u2019t have anything with me that break that down, but I think you can see on a consolidated basis like I said I think your margins and all on the first quarter are going to be around 20%, and we\u2019re going to head toward 23% by year end. So maybe you can build something there to deal with your, I told you we had a big termination fees.", "I think overall, you would see a lot of hits in the first quarter outside of that termination fee, but because of the termination fee you\u2019ll see still our margin being in the 20% range.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna", "What seemed like a brighter note, the equity investment, equity and income of equity investments, I think that\u2019s China Union pay that did seems to tick up sequentially there may be other things in there, but if you can give us color around that. That\u2019s all for me.

I know that you guys clearly have looked intently at making a number of acquisitions, but you\u2019re looking at least according to the guidance that you\u2019re giving here today of roughly $1.50 per share in free cash flow this year.

Why don\u2019t you consider that or have you considered that at all? Secondly, what type of returns on capital are you potentially looking at when you\u2019re going out and making one of these acquisitions? What kind of hurdle rate do you have? How does that compare to what you can potentially get just by simply going back into the market and buying back some shares?", "Jim Lipham", "Well, I think I mentioned earlier, we have about 6.9 million shares left in our buyback program to terminates in 2010, and we obviously talk about that quite a bit, and as the cash has built up as you said, in the 450 range, all that\u2019s been growing at the same time these acquisitions are getting closer and closer, and we have always thought that the value of the stock.", "I mean at the right time we would buy some, but we would rather spend the money on an acquisition that can return on the investment much like what we have today in our business, which is something that will grow going forward. We do realize that stock purchase is a onetime fix.

It is a onetime transaction.", "Jim Lipham", "As you go through these acquisitions, all of them that you\u2019re looking at are cash deals and you\u2019re going to be highly levering your company and cash will be a key important thing going forward.", "Operator", "There appear to be no further questions in queue, but if anybody should have any remaining questions or comments please indicate.

(Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Shawn Roberts.", "Shawn Roberts ", "Welcome everyone. Before we get started with the formal presentation, I\u2019d like to call your attention to the fact that we\u2019ll be making forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS\u2019s actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in TSYS\u2019s reports filed with the SEC.", "At this time, I\u2019d like to introduce TSYS CEO, Phil Tomlinson.", "Phillip Tomlinson", "Thanks Shawn and welcome everybody to our first quarter earnings call. I\u2019m going to keep opening comments relatively brief this afternoon so that we can have plenty of time for questions. ", "Certainly, the most significant event for the quarter was the announcement of our joint venture with First National Bank of Omaha, Nebraska and the creation of First National Merchant Solutions, which is a full service merchant acquiring company. As you know, we do own 51% of it. This new venture really represents the first of what we hope to be many, many steps we\u2019ll take in the continued diversification of TSYS.", "As we said in our earnings release, FNMS, we are now referring to it is expected to be accretive to TSYS in 2010 after deal costs and we have modified our 2010 guidance accordingly.", "FNMS is led by its President, Diana [Hosko] and she is a very talented leader and a veteran of the merchant acquiring space and she certainly has a very experiences and equally qualified team of real professionals that help her with this business.", "Another change joining Diana and I in our merchant services segment of our business is the new President of TSYS Acquiring, which as you know is located in Tempe, Arizona. Mark Pyke is the new President out there, and you may have met Mark or talked to him. He\u2019s been in this business a long time. He\u2019s certainly an experienced executive in the merchant acquiring industry.", "Diana\u2019s resume includes experience at Chase Payment Check and NCR and more Marks' includes most recently experience at both NBC and Bank of America Merchant Services. These two executives today oversee a team reviewing the synergies and efficiencies we hope to derive from these two businesses over the next year or so, and Mark\u2019s team is going to focus on the processing side while Diana\u2019s team will focus on growth.", "I think it\u2019s important to note that FNMS has a strong and healthy direct sales team and they target large national merchants as well as mid market and small merchants. They also go after ISO\u2019s, independent sales organizations and value added resellers and certainly agent bank referrals. We believe there are a lot of great opportunities to cross sell products and to increase innovation on the product development side now that FNMS puts us much closer to the merchant. ", "I think one of the other real significant developments in the first quarter was a couple of things. First was the 4.3% increase in same client transaction volume on the credit card issuer processing side of our business for the first quarter of \u201910 versus the first quarter of \u201909. That is a pretty big move for us given that we\u2019ve seen decreases on this metric for the fourth and third quarters of 2009.", "I guess I have to say I\u2019m encouraged that the bottom of this great recession as we call it around here has been reached and we\u2019ve started to move forward, however small it might be. Also at Total Acquiring Solutions, we saw point of sale transactions up 8% for the first quarter of 2010, versus the first quarter of 2009. Again, a positive sign and hopefully it\u2019s a signal that consumer confidence is starting to pick up a bit. ", "We\u2019ve made and continue to make significant investments in key international markets including most recently Brazil. Today as you probably will remember, we are in the process of the three-phase conversion of the [Carfor] business in Brazil. While this conversion has certainly had its challenges, we expect to have this conversion accomplished and completed by the fourth quarter, and I\u2019m happy to report that last week we successfully converted the first phase.", "I think, we\u2019ve talked about it before but we view international opportunities and selected markets as one of the real key paths to the future success of our company. And against that backdrop, I wanted to note that bringing up new processing accounts in new international markets is certainly complete, expenses in time and resource consuming, and as we talked about on many occasions, it\u2019s certainly more difficult than adding a new client to an existing, proven, time tested processing environment like North American or even the U.K.", "We\u2019ve stated before, but as we build up our international footprint which we think we have an opportunity to be a dominant player on the international side, it\u2019s going to take some time to grow the scale and markets to make them as profitable as we are used to and historically have enjoyed.", "During that build up we have, and as you\u2019ll hear from Jim Lipham, will likely continue to experience some margin compression internationally, but as we\u2019ve said again many times, it will improve with scale.", "With that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Jim Lipham, our CFO and he\u2019s through, we\u2019ll go to questions.", "James Lipham", "Before I get started on Slide 7, I\u2019d like to add a couple of comments to what Phil said. The positive trends we\u2019re seeing in the consumer side of the credit card transactions in the port of sale transactions in TAS are very encouraging as this is the first time they\u2019ve shown some sparks in increasing.", "In addition to that, as you know the first quarter we had a positive influence on currency translation. Last year we were hit something like $22 million. This year we\u2019re up about $5.9 million. Then when you look year over year, we\u2019re still struggling through the de-converted business that we\u2019ve talked about before with Thomas Shops and Nordstrom.", "But we do have a large de-conversion fee that hit us in the first quarter that helps offset some of that, so when you look at net of termination, we\u2019re about $12 million down. Also, we had price concessions that are still chasing us and we had about $7.5 million in this first quarter that hit us and we\u2019ll continue to see that through the remainder of the year.", "If you look at Slide 7, I\u2019d like to talk a little bit about the two changes we had in our release. We made a change on the income statement in the format to present our operating expenses in the two sections, cost of services and selling, general and administrative expense. This change was done in order to present this and align it more closely with SEC regulations and also with others in the industry.", "We did provide schedules for this change and for the next for the 2009 restated numbers, so hopefully you got all those.", "Along with the incomes statement change, on the operating segments, we created a new one where we added the corporate and administrative functions. This is the executive finance, accounting, legal, human resources, investor relations, mergers and acquisitions, all these types of expenses in all the segments were pulled out and put into one segment.", "The reason this was done was so that the operating managers of these segments can now better control and be in charge of their operating results. It will make a change in the margins going forward, but we\u2019ll talk about that as we go through here.", "Slide 8, is the consolidated numbers. I\u2019m not going to go through a whole lot here, but we are at 1.6% in revenues. I mentioned the de-conversion fee. Also, we had the loss of revenues, so it kind of offset each other when you look at revenues before reimbursables were down about 3%.", "That\u2019s also showing that in the total revenue number we had a big increase, about $13 million of Visa access fees that were increased last year that hit this quarter, but wasn\u2019t out of the first quarter last year. As you go through and look at the revenues before reimbursable items, you\u2019ve got price concessions, you\u2019ve got de-converted [inaudible] we\u2019ve got volume growth, and we mentioned on the transaction side, and then the termination fee and new business helped offset it all. So overall, we did pretty good in this first quarter.", "Look at operating income, we\u2019re up 1.2%. Our margin for the quarter is at 23% compared to the same rate roughly that we had last year, 23%. When you look at the operating income, we did implement a work force reduction during this first quarter where we expect to eliminate 400 positions, and we anticipate half of them are going to come through attrition through the year, but we did get it in place in the first quarter. We did have some severance that hit us in the first quarter. ", "Go down to our net income attributable to common shareholders, you\u2019ll see we\u2019re up 10.3%. Remember last year we had the discontinued ops in the first quarter but overall we did pretty good.", "Our expenses, the SG&A and the cost of sales were pretty flat to down just a little bit, so we had pretty good expense in the first quarter to help us do these numbers and then you can see at the bottom of the schedule the transaction volumes that Bill mentioned awhile ago, from a total transaction deal and same client.", "The next page, Slide 9 is the chart we normally do showing our internal growth, how it gets offset and new plants and currency all with price concessions and lost business. I mentioned the price concessions are going to be there for the next three quarters to about the same amount of money $7 million.", "Next page is the summary on the portfolio. I\u2019ll mention two things there. First, on the retail section, you can see from last year at this time that\u2019s our biggest drop in this de-conversion obviously related to Charmin Shops and then you also had a big purge that went on with Target.", "You look at store value, and it\u2019s the biggest growth that we\u2019ve had since last year, and that\u2019s a results of Green Dot and our Wal Mart card business and it\u2019s grown pretty good since prior year. But overall, we\u2019re down year over year in accounts about $17 million. We did have about $24 million from internal growth. That was an increase and new plants added about $29 million. Overall down due to the de-conversion and purges.", "On the next Slide 11, is North America segment. You see revenues at $254 million down 5.4% when you compare them to last year and the comments out there pretty much sum it up with the lost business from de-conversions and the price concessions that we had.", "New class pretty flat. Internal growth is up 2%. We did talk about that. Go down and look at the margin. Operating margin excluding reimbursable items at 32.4%. Last year the margin was around 24%, so by moving out those other G&A expenses, our overhead type expenses, we\u2019ve increased that margin now and it should be running in that neighborhood of that percent for the rest of the year.", "When you look year over year on the quarter, we actually are up when you restate last year to this year about 46 basis points on that so overall that\u2019s good performance, the de-conversions that we faced.", "The next slide on international we had revenues of $79.4 million and they\u2019re up 7.6% when you compare them year over year. This increase came from new business of roughly about 9%. Currency was up at $9 million, up about 8% and internal growth grew about 3%. We did have the Sky card de-conversion which offset it and some price concessions there in Europe on the renegotiated contract which knocked it down about 12% so pretty much revenue was flat for the quarter on a constant currency basis.", "Margin is up to 14.8% from where we were because of the new class of the expenses. Last year at this time, we had a margin around 9% on the international front. Made some improvement year over year at 129 basis points. You can see the transaction growth is positive in our international business.", "You flip over the Merchants at $89.2 million, pretty flat internal growth. New clients are pretty much offsetting all the lost business we had. Our margin is up at 29.5% which is pretty close to  where it was last year and we didn\u2019t have that many overhead expenses allocated in the merchant segment.", "We had some lost business. As you remember, we lost NPC last year. Part of the revenue growth you see here is the Visa fees increasing and then again, we had the point of sale transactions up around 8% which was very strong performance.", "On the next slide is a little information on First National Merchant Solutions and we did close a transaction on that April 1. The big impacts of this acquisition will show up in the second quarter. We\u2019re expecting to add $95 million to $97 million in revenues which we adjusted guidance for.", "Net of acquisition costs we\u2019re expecting to add $2 million to $3 million in net income which is $0.01 a share. The acquisitions cost was actually $4 million but two-thirds of that will come in the second quarter and so you can do the math on that, and if we probably picked up $0.025 to $0.03 a share had we not had the acquisition costs hit and that\u2019s a onetime item.", "Operating margin when you exclude the amortization of acquisition intangibles which happens to be about $11.2 million for the remaining nine months of this year. The margin would range between 26% to 29%. We own 51% and there will be a 49% non-controlling interest that will be backed out when we get the net income.", "Just to mention a few things about FNMS and that is, the average size ticket for \u201909 was $71.00 a ticket and it\u2019s looks like it\u2019s going to be flat to $72.00 to $73.00 a ticket as we go forward into 2010.", "Of note I guess on the makeup of their business, about 71% of their revenues come from the small business segment and the acquiring business. Overall, we\u2019re excited about having them. They\u2019ll be accretive as Phil said in 2010 and beyond.", "If you flip over to the next slide, it\u2019s the corporate and administration segment which is $19.3 million total expenses for the quarter and as I mentioned in that slide we\u2019ve only got $1.2 million by acquisition adjustments showing up in the first quarter with the remainder coming next quarter, that\u2019s the $2.7 million on top of that.", "The next slide has to do with our cash flow, a trailing 12 months dealing with EBITDA cash flow from operations, free cash flow and net income, all in the same ranges of what we\u2019ve had and been showing all along so we\u2019re still generating good cash. We finished the quarter as you can see on the balance sheet a little over $500 million and in pretty good shape there.", "The revised guidance that you see, we did put the $95 million to $97 million in revenues in our range. Net income $2 million to $3 million which was net of acquisition cost of $4 million. That $4 million is obviously a pre tax number, but EPS is $0.01 like I said. It could have been $0.025 to $0.03 probably if we hadn\u2019t had the onetime adjustments. With that said, the margins on this business of 26% to 29% and that\u2019s pretty good.", "I don\u2019t have anything to add. I\u2019ll close with just currency impact, we\u2019re not sure where that\u2019s going to end up this year. Right now, we did a little worse than the first quarter than we thought we were going to do, but the merchant business is continuing to grow. The acquisition of FNMS is really going to help. ", "Mark Pike and Diana are really going to form an admirable team in that merchant area. So we\u2019ll continue to look at acquisitions and what to do with our cash as we go forward, and with that, Phil, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you.", "Philip Tomlinson", "We\u2019re ready to open it up for questions now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Bryan Keene \u2013 Credit Suisse.", "Bryan Keene \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "I might have missed it but how big is the non-recurring de-conversion fee in revenue in North America?", "James Lipham", "$23 million. We had last year around $7 million in \u201909, so the net is about $16 million.", "Bryan Keene \u2013 Credit Suisse", "$7 million in the 1Q number?", "James Lipham", "Right, of \u201909. $23 million in 1Q 2010.", "Bryan Keene \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Is that all that $23 million drop to the bottom line or is there a cost associated to it?", "James Lipham", "Well there\u2019s still some cost on the books for the de-conversion of those customers we didn\u2019t get rid of so obviously that\u2019s replaced the revenue stream that was there, but the cost was still there on the mainframe side so it did have costs associated. I don\u2019t have that broke out.", "Bryan Keene \u2013 Credit Suisse", "But I assume the margin was a lot higher because it was a onetime termination fee than the normal business.", "", "James Lipham", "That\u2019s correct.", "Bryan Keene \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And that\u2019s part of the reason EPS was $0.26 but you\u2019re expecting if you back into the guidance you expect that to step down for the next several quarters.", "James Lipham", "", "That\u2019s correct.", "Bryan Keene \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Can you talk about, you mentioned there was some purging at Target. Can you talk about what was happening there and is that anything we should know about going forward at Target?", "James Lipham", "They\u2019ve been doing it for over a year now, just purging some accounts off. I think they\u2019re moving from a Visa card to an internal card and that\u2019s private label card, but they\u2019re mainly inactive Visa cards and this type thing. Very little revenue associated with them.", "Philip Tomlinson", "It\u2019s the same story that we\u2019ve had now for probably 18 months. As we\u2019ve said before, we have automatic purge programs that are set by the clients and then periodically just because they want to cut some expenses, they\u2019ll come in and get more aggressive with it and these are as Jim said, inactive accounts that have very, very little revenue associated with them and probably have been inactive for at least a year or so.", "", "Bryan Keene \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Any contract signings? I know we had quite a few LOI\u2019s. Any signings in the quarter or any new de-conversions we should know about going forward?", "Philip Tomlinson", "I don\u2019t know of any new de-conversions. We did do several press releases. I don\u2019t have that list in front of me here, but I know we had Caterpillar, BNS in Germany, Degussa in Germany. There were several others. I apologize, I just don\u2019t have it with me.", "I think I confused the whole industry when I start talking about letter of intent a quarter ago so we\u2019re going to get out of the letter of intent business because at least talking about it, because it\u2019s so confusing about what  a letter of intent really is, and as we get these contracts signed and we have a good number coming that we\u2019re working on, and hopefully several others will be signed in the second quarter and certainly more in the third quarter but we have a lot of potential candidates out there to do business with.", "Bryan Keene \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "Okay, maybe just the total amount of new accounts signed in the quarter with Caterpillar and the others combined. How many accounts does that account for?", "Philip Tomlinson", "The new clients were $29 million from a year ago. The pipeline I\u2019m being told is about 11 million to 12 million accounts right now.", "Bryan Keene \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "That\u2019s already signed and ready to be implemented. In the process of being implemented.", "Phillip Tomlinson", "That\u2019s right.", "Operator", "You're next question comes from Jason Kupferburg \u2013 UBS.", "Jason Kupferburg \u2013 UBS", "I wanted to ask a question on the JV looking out to 2011. I know you said you have a team who\u2019s looking hard at the synergies presumably both on the top line and the cost side, but any initial thoughts to  how accretive to earnings the JV could be in 2011 even some kind of rough range? I know you\u2019re picking up $0.01 over the last three quarters in 2010 but any framework we can think of for 2011 along those lines?", "James Lipham", "From 2011 depending on when synergies as I\u2019ve said before, it could be in the $0.04 to $0.05 range earnings per share. I\u2019d hate to have to say what it would be right now with synergies because we don\u2019t have and we don\u2019t give any guidance really on \u201911 at this time, but there again, we\u2019ll wait till we see what we\u2019ve got.", "There\u2019s some duplicate business in there with terminal business, obviously running the back end accounting systems, settlement systems, so I\u2019d hate to speculate exactly how large that could be at this point.", "Jason Kupferburg \u2013 UBS", "The new share buyback program, 10 million shares. Is that effective \u2013 I think your old program was expiring. Did it expire with the seven million shares still open on it so essentially you\u2019re kind of up three million now going forward over the next two years? Is that the right way to think about it?", "James Lipham", "That\u2019s correct.", "Jason Kupferburg \u2013 UBS", "On the pre-paid side, restored values you guys call it, I wanted to follow up on your comments there. I think you were at about 13% of accounts on file now and it\u2019s probably less than8% a year ago. You talked about Green Dot, Wal Mart. How big could store value get for you over time as a percent of your total portfolio just given a lot of the ins and outs here that are happening in the other parts of your business?", "Philip Tomlinson", "We think it has an opportunity to be a significant piece of our business. As a matter of fact, we had the pre-paid crowd down here today talking with several of our directors explaining this business. There\u2019s a lot of opportunities out there. There\u2019s a lot of players out there. There will be some rollup in this industry.", "We have some very strong software and some very good people running this operation and we probably have been in the store value business about as long as anybody now and I think what we\u2019ve done is build a very clean operation and we feel good about it and we feel like we can add to it.", "So while we don\u2019t have a number, a year or so ago I told you that I thought international business could be a big part of our revenue stream. This could be significant and it certainly will never be as large as international because there\u2019s not as many opportunities to build revenue. But pre-paid, we like our position in pre-paid.", "Jason Kupferburg \u2013 UBS", "2010 free cash flow outlook with the JV now onboard, any update on that figure?", "James Lipham", "We\u2019re still thinking in the range of $300 million to $310 million.", "Operator", "You're next question comes from Timothy Willi \u2013 Wells Fargo.", "Timothy Willi \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Did you talk about the size of any of the severance costs in the quarter and where those were amongst the various segments?", "James Lipham", "We did not break that down by the segments. I don\u2019t have it by segments, I have consolidated. It was $1.5 million.", "Timothy Willi \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Do you envision any additional or would that probably be it for the year as far as you think about staffing?", "James Lipham", "That would be close to it.", "", "Timothy Willi \u2013 Wells Fargo", "In terms of the marketplace, can you talk about where you think your customers are in terms of their business plans? We\u2019re all hearing that solicitation are maybe picking up a little bit. Volumes seem to be coming back and credit, we\u2019ve moved through Card Act and got some resolution around other issues. Just sort of what\u2019s the mood and the conversation look like now versus even the last time we had a call.", "Philip Tomlinson", "Well at least people will talk about it now. We had an internal meeting Monday and it was pretty encouraging. We sort of talk about a lot of new business opportunities and while we\u2019re not blowing doors off, we\u2019re finally starting to see people wanting to talk again to some degree. I wouldn\u2019t want to mislead you and think that they\u2019re lined up at the front door, but we are talking to people about new products.", "We are talking to some potentially new customers in the U.S. and if you recall last time we talked I think I said that the U.S. market was virtually dead. So that\u2019s picking up a bit. Mexico is still, we  have good prospects in Mexico and Canada and Europe.", "We\u2019ve got a lot going on. We just need to close some and get some contracts signed and we\u2019re slowly making progress on that. I will tell you that people are still fairly cautious, but I\u2019m encourage to see folks like Capital One on television at night. It\u2019s been awhile since I\u2019ve seen anybody other than I guess Chase started about 90 days ago doing some advertising on television.", "That\u2019s encouraging. You just saw Bank of America actually make some money on the card business. It has been a rough 18 months or so, but I do get the feeling, and this is more of a gut feeling than anything else, that we\u2019re starting to kind of come up from the bottom a little bit.", "Timothy Willi \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Just to go back to the topic of capital a little bit, obviously First National does use a bit of your excess cash. I know there\u2019s some things out there you probably can\u2019t comment a whole lot specifically on, but are you still very much in the hunt for an opportunity to put a decent amount of capital to work in terms of potential targets out there that have been put out in the press? Just your thoughts on the pipeline on the M&A front.", "Philip Tomlinson", "One or two deals have been so public it scares me but we\u2019re absolutely in the market and willing to spend some money and we\u2019ve been kind of public about that. We aren\u2019t going to get stupid on it, but we want to be aggressive but at the same time want to be smart.", "We think FNMS thing gives us a base. It also gives us some smart and talented people that we needed in this organization on the merchant acquiring side.

We have totally committed and believe we  have the people and the technology to continue to win and grow in this business.", "In closing I wanted to remind you of the upcoming analyst day in New York, May 17 and if you haven\u2019t already, I\u2019d invite you to contact Shawn Roberts for more details, and hopefully we\u2019ll see you there.", "I\u2019d like to say thank you for your attention and your interest and we hope to see you in New York.

(NYSE:TSS) Q2 2010 Earnings Call July 21, 2010  5:00 PM ET", "Executives", "", "Philip Tomlinson \u2013 Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer ", "James Lipham \u2013 Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Shawn Roberts \u2013 Director of Investor Relations", "", "Analysts", "", "Bryan Keene \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Adam Frisch \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Ramsey El-Assal \u2013 UBS", "John Williams \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens, Inc.", "Greg Smith \u2013 Duncan Williams", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Paul Bartolai \u2013 PB Investment Research", "Craig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities, Inc.", "", "", "Operator", "", "Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the TSYS Q2 2010 earnings conference call.  At this time all participants have been placed in a listen only mode; we\u2019ll open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation.  It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Shawn Roberts.  Sir, the floor is yours.", "Shawn Roberts", "", "Thank you, Anthony, and welcome everyone.  In the call today our Chairman and CEO Phil Tomlinson will provide highlights on the Q2 events, and then turn it over to Jim Lipham, our CFO, who will review our Q2 financials.  And after that we\u2019re going to open it up for Q&A.  ", "I\u2019d like to call your attention to the fact that we\u2019ll be making forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS.  These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, factors that could cause TSYS\u2019 actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, as set forth in TSYS\u2019 reports filed with the SEC.  At this time I\u2019d like to introduce TSYS CEO, Phil Tomlinson.", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "Thank you, Shawn, and thank you to everybody on the phone for being with us toady.  We\u2019ve got a lot to cover and I\u2019m happy to say that most of it, we feel, is positive and shows improvement.  ", "I\u2019d like to take a few minutes to talk a little bit more about our merchant acquiring joint venture with First of Omaha, and we call that FNMS \u2013 First National Merchant Services, which we closed on April 1st of this year. Frankly, we consider this to be a really significant step towards TSYS becoming a real full-service payment solution provider. It broadens the entire scope of TSYS much beyond providing the core card processing services that we\u2019ve become so well known for over the years.  We can now create and package end-to-end payment solutions for users, acquirers and merchants.  And I certainly understand that FNMS represents less than 10% of our revenues today, that\u2019s before reimbursables.  But it certainly does not represent business as usual. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll look back at this transaction in a few years and think of it as a watershed event as it does get us closer to the merchant and ultimately the end customer.", "Out of the 407,000 merchant locations served, 70,000 are owned by FNMS with the rest being processed by FNMS.  They focus on creating solutions to reduce expenses and complexity of accepting electronic payments.  It uses direct sales to focus on small businesses, national sales for the mid-market and national companies, and we also do business with third-party companies or referrals through banks, associations, VARs or value added resellers, ISO sales as well as backend core processing acquiring services.", "FNMS has services that complement and enhance niche areas that TSYS has defined as targets of focus, particularly in this healthcare and prepaid market that we\u2019re very excited about.  The great thing is we\u2019re now able to refer merchant leads and will ultimately create efficiencies and synergies between our TAS operation (Total Acquiring Solutions) and First National Merchant Services that are still somewhat in the discovery stage.  As you know, we\u2019ve only owned this quarter now, but we are delighted with what\u2019s happened so far and with the team and their strong leadership group, and all the efforts that they\u2019ve put forth in this first quarter of ownership.", "Now I just wanted to direct a few comments on TSYS and other reporting segments and the current economic and regulatory environment.  On a positive note I\u2019m really happy to report that during the Q2 2010 versus the same quarter in 2009 that our same client transactions increased 4.9% and that the TAS point of sale transactions increased 8.5%.  On a year-to-date basis same client revenue growth increased 3.6% and the same client account on file growth increased 8.1%, which we are very impressed with.", "We also have some good news from the new business side of the house.  During the Q2 we began processing for two very well-known retail brands in Canada \u2013 President\u2019s Choice and Wal-Mart of Canada, and we have not put out press releases on those yet but I just wanted you to be the first to hear that.  Those have been converted and they are customers today.  Also we\u2019ve signed a contract directly with Tesco Financial in the UK.  We've been processing that business through Royal Bank of Scotland and Tesco decided to go out on their own, and we bid on it and we will continue to process that very, very good piece of business.", "We continue to make good progress on the Carrefour conversion in Brazil.  We still have several key milestones and decision points facing us over the next few days, and we\u2019re working very diligently to meet Carrefour\u2019s needs. We believe we\u2019ll have this conversion completed pretty quickly.  This success will give us the opportunity to add additional clients in the Brazilian market as we go forward, which is one of the world\u2019s top five markets for cards.", "Remember, you\u2019ve heard us talk about clustering when we enter new markets, and that is as we add one customer it\u2019s easier for us to add additional customers and we do a good job of selling into additional customers.  As the latest example we now have signed our fifth client in Germany over about the last year and a half, and we\u2019re very excited about that.  ", "I know that you have some questions regarding our relationship with Bank of American Merchant Services, or BAMS, and we are actively engaged in discussions with BAMS to extend our relationship beyond 2010.  However a definite agreement has not yet been reached.  They have been and continue to be a valued TSYS client.  We don\u2019t anticipate any change to our current earnings forecast for 2010, and really beyond that we won't have anything to add to the BAMS discussion today.", "I know that a lot of you are very aware that the President signed the Financial Reform Bill today, and that regulation along with the regulations that we have seen in the past will place more challenges in the US-based banks and card issuers to adopt to another round of regulations. And if you'll recall, the Card Act which we\u2019ve talked about a lot here before was considered to be really the most sweeping reform in the card industry\u2019s history.  By the way, we\u2019ve retooled for the Card Act and for all practical purposes it\u2019s done.  We\u2019ve closed this chapter in our history.  The software has been rewritten, tested, installed, and is now being used on a daily basis by our clients.  There are still a couple of pieces that have not become effective yet, but like I say we\u2019re closing the book on this chapter in our history and we\u2019re glad to have this behind us, and I know our customers are, too.", "In addition we\u2019ve got new regulations for the card business that\u2019s becoming underway in Canada and some parts of Europe. And you know, when we stop and think about what we believe that this heightened industry regulatory environment in the card business that we now find ourself in, our value proposition for outsourcing is even more enhanced.  And we have believed this for a long time but we are now energized about it.  We believe we can do it faster, better, and cheaper than any in-house operation and we\u2019ve confirmed that we can do that with several large issuers.  And I\u2019m comfortable that we\u2019ve added even more value to our proposition as a result of these ongoing and past regulations.  It\u2019s just hard to do and it takes a lot of time, a lot of effort, and basically you get no real payback for it unless you\u2019re someone like us who can do it for multiple clients.", "But let me be clear \u2013 we don\u2019t feel that any more regulation is in any way good for our industry.  We think the industry has had and seen enough regulation.  I\u2019m thrilled to death to see everything you read indicates that banks are back in the hunt for card customers, as the US credit card acquisition mail offers surged for the first time in more than a year.  Offers were down 1.53 billion for the same quarter in 2008, but were up 136% from the volume from the year earlier.  Personally, I don\u2019t know about you but I received five offers over the past four days in my mailbox at home. ", "I don\u2019t need to waste your time today reminding you of the economic issues that we all continue to face. We think the economy is showing signs of a slight improvement but we\u2019re certainly far from jumping up and down with excitement over the short-term and the prospects for the average card-carrying consumer out there.  And until we can get people back to work, banks lending more and businesses investing in the growth, the economy, we believe, will continue to be sluggish. It is however, in our side of it we do feel like it is picking up, and we hope this trend will continue.", "Now with that I\u2019m going to turn it over to our CFO, Jim Lipham, who\u2019s going to review the numbers.  Jimmy?", "", "James Lipham", "", "Thank you, Phil.  I want to start on slide 7 for those that have the slides in front of them, and give you a little commentary on the numbers here as to a few things that are included in these statements that you don\u2019t see.  You can tell that our Q2 revenues are up 5.3% and also revenues before reimbursables are up 4.2%, and that\u2019s real good in spite of the loss of net revenues from deconversions of $16.7 million for the Q2 as well as we had a $1.3 million loss in currency exchange.", "Expenses were flat pretty much if you remove FNMS, and you\u2019ll see it in a few minutes as I talk about them, that they\u2019ve had about $25 million in expenses.  But during this Q2 we ended up with $6 million worth of one-time, non recurring expenses that set us back a little bit.  As you can see, operating income is down 4.2% for the quarter. If you put the $6 million back it would be up 3% which in fact is very good.  ", "Also in the quarter you can see down there on the bottom the total cardholder transactions are up 3.8% which is a good economic trend that it shows; also our same client transactions were up 4.9%, so that\u2019s good also.  And if you remember back in the Q1 that total cardholder transactions were only up 1.5%, so we\u2019re actually seeing better growth during this Q2 from transactions.", "When you look over at the full year numbers, of course revenues are still up.  The year-to-date loss from deconverted customers and net of termination fees is $20 million.   And then the currencies, as far as year-to-date we\u2019re positively at around $4.5 million.  And you can see, too, down on the transactions year-to-date up 2.2%.  Operating income by the way is down 1.6%.  Our margins are now 22.3% for the six month period; last year they were 23.1%.  Now if you took FNMS out and the $6 million that we had in one-time changes we would have a margin of 23.1%, which would be in line with what we had last year.", "With that I\u2019ll go slide 8, which is the net acquisition impact of FNMS, and we say net impact because of the third line down, the third party acquisition fees as part of our one-time charges for the quarter or for the six-month period of $3.6 million, and that\u2019s recorded in our GMA section, or corporate overhead section.  But you can see that the revenues for FNMS came in at $29.8 million.  That was a little better, a little over $1 million better than what we had anticipated they would do. Their operating profit of $4.851 million shows a margin of 16.2%.  This does include $2.7 million of amortization of intangibles.  And if you restated the number of net income without that they\u2019d have a margin of 25% which is still, it\u2019s a good margin but a little bit below where we were with TAS.  But all in all it was a god first quarter with FNMS and we were pleased.  They exceeded their guidance that we had for the quarter.  Dollar volumes as far as transactions, transactions up 8.5% for FNMS year-over-year, and then their dollar volumes are up 10.2%, so good growth there from their merchants.  ", "Next slide, 9, is just the chart that shows you how, what really made up the 2% growth in revenues for the six-month period, and you can see internal growth at 3% and new clients and then the acquisition of FNMS.  But we still get hurt pretty bad with lost revenues from customers, pricing concessions and then they\u2019re offset a little bit with termination fees.  But all in all it\u2019s a pretty good quarter, and I think as we get on into next year we\u2019re looking right now at really only the firs two quarters, if we\u2019ve got any type of deconverted revenues or stuff that we have to overcome, which is the termination fees that we had in these first two quarters here of 2010.", "The next page is a chart on the portfolio and a summary of where our account growth is compared to last year, to June of 2009.  You\u2019ll see we lost 16.7 million accounts or 4.8% down.  And Phil mentioned some of the new clients awhile ago, but the clients lost, just to refresh your memory, is Nordstrom, Wachovia, Charmashops (sp), Barclays SKY CARD, and First Equity.  So we did have internal growth during this period of time of 22.5 million. That\u2019s roughly 6% internal growth, and new clients added about 31 million.", "We did have a lot of purges during this period of time and they mainly came from Target was the big one, and we mentioned before a lot, we don't have a lot of revenue associated with these purges.  And so, but it just looks bad on the number of accounts.  On the right hand side you\u2019ll see sequentially we actually grew 9.5 million accounts for the Q2, which is up 3% sequentially.  So that\u2019s some good growth there.", "Flip over to the next slide, 11, and we\u2019ll talk a little bit about North America.  And you can see revenues - $236.8 million.  They\u2019re down 9.4%, and then the revenues excluding reimbursables at $202 million are down $10.6 million.  The big contributor there is the lost revenues of $22.7 million from the deconverted customers.  We were able to improve our operating margin.  As you can imagine we went through the year really trying to control expenses, and operating expenses before reimbursables decreased $23.8 million, which helped offset that revenue shortfall, and it also enabled us to move our margin up a little bit as you can see here.", "Same transactions are up 5.1%, which is good growth; and then year-over-year the total cardholder transactions are up for the quarter, the Q2, 1.563 million, an increase of 2.7%.", "On the next slide, which is the international segment, $78 million in revenue.  That\u2019s up 2% and so is the constant currency basis revenues, up 2%.  We did mention awhile ago we had some negative currency impact during the quarter. Their revenues, we did have a decrease in revenues of about $3 million on the SKY CARD that we mentioned before.  New clients added about $2 million; we had a great quarter for Japan and GP net revenues, and the base one and two volumes were really up about $1.5 million.  And then our same client revenue growth was 1%, and then if you took out price concessions it\u2019d be about 3% just like it is in the US.   So it was a pretty good month other than the deconversions and price concessions.", "Operating expenses, they increased 4.3% here and that again is mostly due to our increase in technology spend along with other expenses in support of our expansion in Brazil and elsewhere.  Operating income was down 9.1 from last year and our margin before reimbursables of 15.61% is in line with our expectations, and ahead of Q1\u2019s margin of 14.2%.  Total cardholder transactions - 279.9 million, an increase of 9.9%; same client transactions are up 4%, which is good also.", "On our next slide, the merchant segment, $126.8 million in revenues and then revenues excluding reimbursables of $94.7 million.  You know, the big difference between those two numbers is Visa access fees.  But if you look at those revenues, they\u2019re both up over 50% respectively over the prior period, and that's mainly due to FNMS\u2019 $29.8 million in revenues.  If you back those out you've still got revenues of, growth of 20.6% and revenues before reimbursables would be up 4.4%.  ", "When you look at the same client revenue growth, it was up 4.7% for the merchants, so the volume growth that we\u2019re seeing here is good.  I mean if you look at the point of sale transactions they increased 8.5% and I mentioned awhile ago what FNMS\u2019 growth has been. So all in all it was a good quarter in the merchant segment.  We were proud of the acquisition of FNMS and how they ended up.  We did renew five clients in the merchant segment during the Q2 and signed up two new ones, so things are moving pretty good in the acquiring arena.", "On the next slide we have corporate administration, and it\u2019s up $4.2 million.  And I mentioned the acquisition costs.  We did have $2.6 million during the Q2 on top of the $900,000 that we had in the Q1, so over half of this increase had to do with that acquisition cost.", "Then the last slide, on slide 15 I was just going to touch on the EBIDTA is $496 million.  Our cash flow from operations of $400 million is down $23.4 million, and we did have some changes in our balance sheet as far as receivables with FNMS and some other accounts that caused our cash to go down.  Free cash flow - $268 million.  It\u2019s down $34 million, and a big part of that is the international expenditures, expansion that\u2019s going on internationally with the equipment expenditures, software and the like.  And our trailing 12 months net income of $223 million, pretty much in line with what we\u2019ve been showing.  ", "With that, Phil, I\u2019ll turn it back to you.", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Thank you, Jimmy.  Anthony, we\u2019d like to open it up for questions now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "(Operator instructions).  Our first question comes from Bryan Keene.  Your line is live.", "Bryan Keene \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "Hi, good afternoon, guys.  ", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "Hey, how are you, Bryan?", "Bryan Keene \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Doing well.  Just thinking about the guidance, it sounds like you guys are reentering guidance of 1% to 3% and $0.96 to $0.98.", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "That\u2019s right.", "Bryan Keene \u2013 Credit Suisse", "I just want to make sure that\u2019s right.  And we were talking a little bit ahead I think in this quarter, so I\u2019m wondering if we should expect maybe the higher end of the range in revenue.  And then the second piece on the earnings part, already we\u2019re at $0.51 for half of the year and that would mean that we\u2019d have to actually have declines sequentially in the next two quarters in earnings in order to hit the target.  So I just want to make sure I\u2019m understanding that as well.", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "Bryan, on the guidance issue we are a little bit ahead through two quarters as far as where ya\u2019ll were in getting to our numbers, but I think we are looking more at the $0.98 per share number.  I think what you\u2019ve got to remember is when we started the year with our guidance we had no promotions in there, we had no expenses for merit, we had no bonuses in our guidance at all.  We just were pretty much bare there.  And as we\u2019ve gone through this quarter with the BAMS discussion and they\u2019ve hung around for a little bit longer than leaving at the end of April, so we actually booked some merits and some promotional expenses, and are preparing to do that through the remainder of the year.  And that\u2019s going to most likely eat up what the revenues are that we would probably maintain with BAMS.  So I would think that the termination fees are over, and as we go forward we\u2019re going to be pretty close I think to what ya\u2019ll are seeing.", "Bryan Keene \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Just a question on the BAMS relationship. It sounds like they want to continue the relationship so there won\u2019t be any loss of revenue compared to the current run rate, or is it a different relationship that will have some impact on the annual revenue run rate?", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "Well, I think we\u2019ll continue it in some form or fashion.  We\u2019re trying to work that out right now, Bryan.  And I\u2019m not trying to be cute about it - we just haven\u2019t worked it out yet.  But as you can see they have not gone anywhere and we\u2019re certainly excited about that.", "Bryan Keene \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, and the term fee \u2013 how big was it in the quarter?", "James Lipham", "", "$9.8 million.", "Bryan Keene \u2013 Credit Suisse", "$9.8 million.  Okay, and then my last question is is there a target number of accounts on file that we should think about next quarter?  I know sequentially we had almost a positive 10 million in accounts.  Is that a good run rate to think about going forward or are there some other things, you know, maybe purges or deconversions that would change that number?", "James Lipham", "", "We\u2019ve had a slight decrease a little bit.  We finished up here at about 332.  I think we might have some more purges and be down to about 5, bring it down about 5 million accounts, something like that. It\u2019ll be back up around 330 by year end.", "Bryan Keene \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "", "Our next questions come from Adam Frisch.  Your line is live.", "Adam Frisch \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Thanks, good afternoon, guys.  I wanted to ask you, you gave a lot of detail on your business but I\u2019ll get to that in a second.  I wanted to start my first question relating to the Durbin Amendment, and obviously you guys have a lot of contact with some of the biggest issuers in the world but certainly in the US.  Have there been any initial discussions yet on how they plan to respond to the Amendment?", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "Well, you know, I think the rules have certainly not been written yet.  We talked about this a little bit at our Board meeting today.  We\u2019re not quite sure when those rules will be written and how much the debited interchange could possibly be reduced.  And you know, optimistically maybe it won\u2019t be reduced, just somebody will manage it other than Visa and MasterCard.  But I mean obviously, and we also worry about whether it will migrate over to credit at some point in time.  We spend a lot of time in Washington talking to the powers that be up there, and it\u2019s all over the board frankly.  And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt in my mind that should, it\u2019s a direct point of income to card issuers and you know, if they do make a dramatic reduction in that fee it\u2019s going to hurt.  It\u2019s just another thing that in my opinion would be piled onto a lot of the regulations that the card industry has had over the past couple of years.  ", "But I think what you\u2019re going to see, frankly, is I think you're going to see higher pricing, more fees, higher fees.  You\u2019re going to see some more creative products come on board and we\u2019re working on some of those right now.  I think that credit, you know, credit card credit will be a little bit more difficult to come by because you will not be able to take the risk that people have been willing to take in years past.   So I think there\u2019s a lot of unintended consequences here as a result of the Durbin Amendment. I don\u2019t think a lot of people in Washington really frankly understood it as well as we would have liked for them to have understood it.  But you know, it\u2019s done and we\u2019ve got to live with it, and hopefully sometime between now and maybe the end of the year we\u2019ll find out exactly what it means to the industry, how many dollars it means.", "But you\u2019ve seen the same things that I\u2019ve seen in the press.  I forgot either Citi or B of A, one of them the other day said they thought it might cost them $600 million.  Now we\u2019re not a big debit processor as you know, but you know, we don\u2019t think things like that are good for our industry and we certainly are adamant that we don\u2019t think the government ought to be setting pricing for the industry.", "Adam Frisch \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Right.  Thanks for that, Phil \u2013 I just wanted to get your view on it.  On the, first of all on your side, you\u2019ve had a bunch of signings over the last several months.  Two questions related to that: One, can you help us quantify the timing of the contributions to revenues from these accounts and what kind of order of magnitude are we looking at here?  And then secondly, are they causing any changes to the margin outlook as you bring them on board?", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "Well, I don\u2019t know that I can-", "Operator", "", "Our next questions come from Jason Kupferberg.", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "Wait a minute, Anthony.  I don\u2019t know that I can give you that information off the top of my head here.  I was trying to-   I\u2019ll tell you what, Adam \u2013 let us do a little figuring on this and before this is over we\u2019ll come back to you on that question, if that suits you.  You still there?

Your line is live.", "Ramsey El-Assal \u2013 UBS", "", "This is Ramsey El-Assal for Jason Kupferberg.  Last quarter you talked about your pipeline loosening up a bit, especially in the US.  Has there been any change to that dynamic, due to either macro concerns on the issuer side or because your customers are now focusing on maybe adapting to the Financial Reform Bill just as they finished work on the Card Act?", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "Well, I think that when I say it\u2019s loosened up, we talked about earlier the growth and particularly when you start thinking about the same client accounts on file growth.  We're seeing some good movement there. That\u2019s the first time in probably a year or so that we\u2019ve seen any real growth to speak of.  We think that people are interested in getting back into the business on an aggressive basis.  We just, you know, there\u2019s a process that they\u2019re going through to figure out how to stay in this business and remain profitable.  And again, a lot of it\u2019s about what I talked about earlier, is unintended consequences when you-  As the regulations come into play you know, it\u2019s kind of like a water balloon \u2013 you push in one side and it pops out the other.", "So I do think that people are becoming more aggressive.  As I said earlier, I probably have received, these solicitations at home are starting to pick up \u2013 I\u2019ve had five in the last four days with pretty good deals, really.  What\u2019s been amazing to me is I really thought I would have some with annual fees attached to them and I haven\u2019t seen one yet, but I know that\u2019s coming.", "Ramsey El-Assal \u2013 UBS", "One other follow-up or one other quick question, rather.  The Wal-Mart announcement that you just made, that\u2019s processing their house brand, co-brand product, rather, that they're issuing themselves.   So that\u2019s not a conversion, per se, but more just over time that will impact your business as they add accounts?", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "They\u2019ll be adding accounts and it is a branded card.", "Ramsey El-Assal \u2013 UBS", "I see.  Thank you very much.", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "And they\u2019re in the processes of bringing that up.  We think that\u2019ll, could be significant.

Your line is live.", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "Anthony, we can\u2019t hear anything from Adam.", "Operator", "", "Our next questions are coming from John Williams.  Your line is live.", "John Williams \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Good evening, guys.  We were wondering if maybe we were on, I didn\u2019t realize.  Thanks for taking our questions here.  First question was regarding the accounts on file portfolio.  It looks like you\u2019ve had pretty substantial pressure on the retail side over the last few years, which is understandable and it makes some sense.  I\u2019m curious if you could give some color on what was responsible for the dip you saw just now from March to June, and what your general thoughts are regarding the retail side.  Because obviously year-over-year it\u2019s been down actually.", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "Well, we don\u2019t process a lot of retail as you know, and certainly the biggest one is Target.  And that\u2019s what Jimmy was talking about a littlie earlier, is they have regular purges and they have enough accounts, when they have regular purges the purges are pretty big.  He also talked about the fact that if this is an inactive account on file, we\u2019re not making any money to speak of on it in any way and neither are they; we just charge a very slight storage fee for it.  ", "And our systems, you can come in and you can ask for a special purge program or we have automatic purge programs that happen every month, and we\u2019ve done that for years and year and years.  It\u2019s only become an issue over the last couple of years when clients were really struggling as a result of this economy, and were looking for virtually any way to cut expense.  Historically, clients have wanted to keep older accounts out there with the hopes that they would figure out a way to reactivate them at some point.  ", "John Williams \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay.  Question on the stored value side.  This is obviously something that year-over-year has actually been pretty positive.  What are the pricing dynamics in that particular segment versus the others, particularly versus sort of a traditional credit card?  And in terms of the mix is it more sort of prepaid cards or store brand prepaid cards, gift card type products?", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "You've seen what\u2019s happening with Green Dot, and they\u2019re by far our largest customer.  We do have some other customers that are doing very well, but most of what we\u2019re doing is reloadable cards where you go into a Wal-Mart or a CVS and you buy a card.  And you can reload it, and they\u2019re typically sold to folks who don\u2019t have banking relationships, the 25% to 30% of this country who are unbanked.   And they\u2019re using it just like a regular consumer Visa or MasterCard, like you would use it.", "John Williams \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And on your side of things are the pricing dynamics on those cards different just because\u2026", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "Well, there are some different pricing points, but as they start reloading these cards the pricing, you know, you\u2019d basically charge for a lot of the same things.  You may not have statements but you\u2019re charging for activity and reloading, and transactions, authorizations \u2013 a lot of the same types of transactions but certainly not all of the\u2026 There\u2019s more pricing points than there is say with a debit card.", "John Williams \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Right.  And one last thing. On I think page 9 of the slide deck you talked about the price compression you\u2019re seeing.  And I know over time you\u2019ve talked about that 2% to 3% compression.  Is that still generally what you\u2019re seeing, or is there some other factor at play?  Because it looks like, just in the waterfall that you\u2019ve constructed there, it\u2019s a little bit of a big-sized drop from what you\u2019re getting on the left to what you\u2019re seeing on the right.", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s-  I mean, I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s all pricing compression.  That\u2019s lost business, it\u2019s about 2% of that 8.  You\u2019ve got 9 recurring items.  We have, you know, hopefully, and I\u2019m feeling pretty good about this, I think that things have settled down and I don\u2019t really know of any clients that we have today that are close to failure or in big, big trouble with the regulators.  I\u2019m sure some are dealing with regulators on a regular basis, but we went through that period there where we lost several top-five clients and it's taking some time to replace that revenue. But we still think it\u2019s a 2% to 3% on an annualized basis.", "Now that varies with the size.  One year you\u2019re going to have really big customers, and we\u2019ve had one in the last twelve months that we\u2019ve re-upped and the dollars are bigger, but the percentages stay about the same.", "John Williams \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful.  I appreciate the color, guys, thank you very much.", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "It\u2019s not an exact science, though, John.", "Operator", "", "Thank you.  Our next questions come from Brett Huff.  Your line is live.", "Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens, Inc.", "", "Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions, guys.", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "Hi Brett, how are you?", "Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens, Inc.", "Good.  Jim, I wanted to go through and make sure I understood merchant, the merchant operating margins, x reimbursables, came down and that was primarily because of the one-time fees that were associated with the FNMS that you called out \u2013 what was it, $3 million?  Is that right?", "James Lipham", "", "Yeah.  You had all of the one-time adjustments, well not all of them.  We had $3 million of the $6 million one-time adjustments hit in the merchant section.  We had FNMS come in with really a 25% margin.  The $3.6 million acquisition costs are all in corporate overhead, so they\u2019re not in the merchant sector.", "Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens, Inc.", "Okay, that was my next question.  I wanted to make sure.", "James Lipham", "", "Yes, but the real deal is you had $3 million one-time charges that hit in there that brought that margin down, along with FNMS \u2013 you know, you had $4.8 million of operating income.  You\u2019ve got $2.7 million of acquisition costs, amortization that came in there.  And their margins would run, well, they\u2019re running 16 when you consider the amortization of the intangibles.  So that would bring the total margins down.", "Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens, Inc.", "Okay, that makes sense.  And then I wanted make, the comments you made on guidance were helpful in response to a prior question.  Just to make sure I understand it, the fact that BAMS is sticking around longer than you\u2019re thinking is largely going to be offset by the relaxing of a more stringent standard you had when you gave original guidance, meaning you\u2019re going to give some more bonuses out and you\u2019re going to do some more promotions for your business.  Is that the right way to think about it?", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "And it\u2019s merit, and as you know when we started out the guidance year, we didn\u2019t feel like BAMS could move their front-end business very fast at all.  We were concerned about the, you know, the backend which could be moved pretty quick.  So we took out $13 million I think in the beginning of the year in our original guidance.  We put 3 back in the March guidance when we changed it.  We had 10 left, and I told you that we would, we would regularly take it out over the three quarters.  Now, if we gave 100% bonus, we gave promotions, we gave merits, we gave the whole thing that\u2019s $15 million, so we\u2019re not going to be able to do it all.", "I think one thing on the guidance that you need to keep in mind is that during the Q3 and Q4 we\u2019re going to be showing lost revenues from deconversions without termination fees; where we had $16 million this quarter you\u2019re going to be looking at roughly $24 million to $25 million a quarter for the next two quarters that we\u2019re going to be trying to overcome.", "Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens, Inc.", "I see, so you\u2019re talking net when you talk about those revenues.  You\u2019re talking net revenues, netted term fees. ", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "Right.  There\u2019s no termination fees in the last two quarters. ", "Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens, Inc.", "Okay.", "James Lipham", "And it\u2019s going to all pretty much amortize, I mean we\u2019re going to anniversary all that stuff this year so next year will be a little bit better, except overcoming the big termination fee we had in the Q1, you know \u2013 it was around $25 million.", "Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens, Inc.", "Okay.   And then last one.  Can you give us an update on Carrefour?  I apologize, Phil, if you talked about it in the first couple minutes. I was late getting on.  But did you give us an update on that?  And if not, could you?", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "I did talk about that.", "Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens, Inc.", "Okay.  I\u2019m sorry.  I apologize.", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "Oh, no problem.  We\u2019re moving forward with that.  We\u2019ve got a couple milestones that we\u2019ve got to get through.  We, you know there\u2019s two more segments left \u2013t he big one is coming up and we\u2019re expecting that to happen here in, well, next thirty days or so.  And we\u2019ve obviously got to do a great job and make it happen.  And I talked about you know, the fact that we believe that that will be our next area of clustering assuming all goes well, and we think it will.  Just like what I was talking about, Brett, is you look back at Germany \u2013 we now have signed five customers in Germany and it wasn\u2019t about 18 moths ago we were talking about our first client in Germany and the fact that we were having to gear up to deal with the German functionality.", "Same thing we\u2019re having to do with Carrefour in Brazil.  The big difference there is we\u2019re using a different software in Brazil.  We\u2019re using the Kartek (sp) Prime software, and we've had to make it multi-bank functional as opposed to single-bank functionality.  And that has been, that\u2019s been a challenge.  And anytime you go into a totally new country it\u2019s challenge, because there's a lot of changes. There're always typically language issues that you have to overcome.  And we think we\u2019re about there.", "", "Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens, Inc.", "Okay.  And then last question: Can you talk about capital allocation?  I know you have been focused, you did an FNMS deal and I suspect you\u2019re looking at other things. But also the cash is, you know, building up on the balance sheet.  Can you talk about buybacks?  I know you had an authorization put in place last quarter.  Just give us your current thoughts on that.", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "Well, I don\u2019t think our thoughts have changed any.  We have always said that we would much rather invest as opposed, in something that\u2019s going to help the company grow as opposed to buying it back.  We did spend $151 million in this past quarter.  We do have some opportunities out there, and as I said last time, I think when we get to the point where we don\u2019t think there\u2019s some live targets out there we\u2019ll have to look hard at some significant buy backs or a dividend increase.", "Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens, Inc.", "Okay.  That\u2019s what I needed.  I appreciate your time.", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "You bet, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next questions come from Greg Smith.  Your line is live.", "Greg Smith \u2013 Duncan Williams", "", "The equity income in joint ventures perked up a fair amount; it\u2019s been fairly volatile.  Is that just cupped data in there?", "James Lipham", "", "That\u2019s correct.  It\u2019s cupped, it\u2019s doing really well and they really cranked up their process.  And as you know in the past, they started out with a lot of investments as they were signing up these banks and getting started.  But they\u2019re making some good progress now.", "Greg Smith \u2013 Duncan Williams", "Okay, so we can expect sort of profitability near these levels going forward?", "James Lipham", "", "I think so.", "Greg Smith \u2013 Duncan Williams", "Okay.  And then I\u2019m a little confused.  Jim, you said there\u2019s $6 million total of one-time expenses in the quarter?", "James Lipham", "", "That\u2019s correct.", "Greg Smith \u2013 Duncan Williams", "", "And $3 million of that was related to FNMS.  What was the other $3 million?", "James Lipham", "", "It was in TAS.  It was a reserve.", "Greg Smith \u2013 Duncan Williams", "", "Oh, okay. Okay.  I missed that, thank you.  And then did you guys see any notable difference in volumes during the quarter?  There just was sort of a sense that things might have slowed later in the quarter, in the month of June perhaps? I mean it doesn't sound as if you\u2019re hedging on that at all but did you see any appreciable difference as the quarter progressed?", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "Yeah, we did.  We started out April, we had pretty good volume growth when you looked at the transactions per billing date.  And then it dropped off in May and then came back in June, and actually was growing at a faster rate than it was in April.", "Greg Smith \u2013 Duncan Williams", "Wow, okay.", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "So actually it dipped down in May and came back in June.", "Greg Smith \u2013 Duncan Williams", "", "Okay.  That\u2019s very helpful, I appreciate those comments.  Thank you.  That\u2019s it for me.", "Operator", "", "Our next questions come from Glenn Greene.  Your line is live.", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Thanks, good afternoon, guys.  Phil, can you just give us some color on the pipeline prospects that you\u2019re seeing at a high level, both domestically and internationally, that sort of contrasted maybe to how you sort of felt maybe at the beginning of the year?", "Phil Tomlinson", "", "Well, I think that our prospect activity has gone up.  As I told you in the last quarter I made a mistake talking about letters of intent.  As you can see, some of those letters of intent that we were talking about have started to come to the contract sage, and even eh conversion stage.  We talked about three of them earlier,  which is Tesco and President\u2019s Choice which is- I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar with President\u2019s Choice but they're a large retailer in Canada, and certainly Wal-Mart in Canada.  Lat time we talked about another small bank, a smaller bank in Canada.  But our prospect list is very good and it\u2019s, it\u2019s gotten, I think it\u2019s gotten very good in the US, which is a pretty big change. ", "We\u2019ve signed letters of intent with several folks in the US and we are having some very strong conversations with some people in the US who could make a difference. You know, some are startup deals and some might be conversions, but they\u2019re large enough to make a real difference.  We haven\u2019t seen that in a couple of years.  The US market has been really just about as dead as a hammer.  The international market has really continued to do well and I think you\u2019ll see some good announcements coming out of that area over the next couple of months. ", "I talked last time about how it\u2019s gotten harder, frankly, to get a contract signed.  People have gotten for obvious reasons more cautious; everybody is trying to cover all their bases. And it just takes a little longer to get it done.  There\u2019s no fast deals done in this business anymore that I\u2019m seeing. But we do, we\u2019re continuing to win in the marketplace.  I would say we\u2019re winning 70%, 80% of the time.  We feel good about the activity that we have going on around the world.  I mean it\u2019s in virtually every place that has a major credit card presence.", "So you know, we long-term we feel very good about the activity. The prospecting business has picked up, and it\u2019s picked up in the US which is a really big thing for us, because we, as I said earlier that just has not been going on.  I don\u2019t know if that helps you any.", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "No, that\u2019s very good color.  You know, just going back to the pricing, and I know you sort of alluded to 2% to 3% annually.  Obviously there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty related to the Durbin Amendment, regulatory whatnot. And I think it was Bank of America that sort of had the most draconian sort of scenario, but I think it was almost a 70% fee reduction. But the question really is do you get any sense that once we get resolution, and let\u2019s say it\u2019s a very conservative, sort of draconian scenario where the debited fee interchanges are slashed pretty hard, that you're going to see increased pressure, fee pressure from issuers?", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "You know, I\u2019ll be honest with you \u2013 I don\u2019t know-  We\u2019ve been in this business for 35 years.  We have always seen aggressive fee pressure.  We have long-term contracts.  We always have somebody who\u2019s trying to renegotiate early, certainly we make a choice there.  But the fact of the matter is it\u2019s something that we live with on a day to day basis. I don\u2019t know how we can have any more pressure than we\u2019ve had over the past couple of years.", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Okay.  And then finally just to clarify, the $25 million a quarter lost revenue gogni forward in Q3 and Q4, will that sort of do it? Or is there a little bit of spillover affect in 2011 from lost client revenue?", "James Lipham", "", "That\u2019ll pretty much do it for lost revenues.  We\u2019ll have to overcome the termination fees we got this year in the Q1 and Q2.", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Got it, and that was $25 million in Q1 and $9 million in Q2?", "James Lipham", "", "That\u2019s correct.", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Great, thanks a lot, guys.", "James Lipham", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Our next questions come from Paul Bartolai.  Your line is live.", "Paul Bartolai \u2013 PB Investment Research", "Thanks, good afternoon, guys.  First question, just what were the term fees last year in the Q2?", "James Lipham", "", "Last year in the Q2, I don\u2019t think we had any.  All we had was, let\u2019s see.  I\u2019m trying to think here. I know we had some in the Q1.  I don\u2019t think we had any termination fees in the second.", "Paul Bartolai \u2013 PB Investment Research", "Okay.  And just to clarify on the last question in terms of the revenue loss being $24 million, $25 million in Q3, Q4 \u2013 there\u2019s no incremental loss.  You\u2019re just talking that you had $16 million net given the $9 million termination fee?  So there\u2019s no incremental revenues rolling off in Q3 is there, versus Q2?", "Philip Tomlinson", "I missed that question.", "James Lipham", "", "Sorry, I was looking up something.  Will you repeat that again?", "Paul Bartolai \u2013 PB Investment Research", "Sure. The $24 million, $25 million revenue grow over that you have in Q3 given the deconversions, that just is compared to the $16 million you had in Q2 because of the $9 million termination fee?  I just want to make sure there\u2019s no incremental revenue rolling off the conversions in Q3 versus Q2.", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "No.  In the $16 million we had in the Q2 we did have a termination fee in there.", "Paul Bartolai \u2013 PB Investment Research", "Right.", "", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "And going forward you won\u2019t have one so it\u2019ll be, it\u2019ll get back to the $25 million.", "Paul Bartolai \u2013 PB Investment Research", "Okay, perfect.  And then the higher comp you talked about, just what\u2019s going on in the business, was there any of that in Q2 or is that going to be something that's going to really start in Q3?", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "We had a little bit in Q2 but it will really start in Q3 and Q4.", "Paul Bartolai \u2013 PB Investment Research", "And will that be spread throughout most of the businesses or will there be any segments that\u2019ll be disproportionately hit from that?", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "It\u2019ll be across all of them.", "Paul Bartolai \u2013 PB Investment Research", "Okay, great.  And then just the last one.  Just looking at the margin improvement you had sequentially in North America - I mean I think if you backed out the term fees that revenues would be flattish - but you had a jump in op income.  Just wondering if you could give us any more color on that? Thanks.", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "Well, the drop in expenses is really in two areas.  Obviously it\u2019s headcount, and we are down around 500 people I think in North America year-over-year, excuse me, from year end.  And then you\u2019ve got some equipment that we obviously had a struggle this first half of the year ahead of us, so we kind of postponed additions, and we\u2019re not quite sure how much of that is going to get back in this year. But we do expect to show some increases in the in technology expenses as we go through Q3 and Q4.  But that\u2019s pretty much the two areas that it came from.", "Paul Bartolai \u2013 PB Investment Research", "Okay, great.  Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "", "Our final questions come from Craig Maurer.  Your line is live.", "Craig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities, Inc.", "Yeah, good evening.  I wanted to follow-up and ask you a hypothetical on the regulatory question.  So should you see the draconian cut in interchange on debit that is being suggested by B of A, nowhere in regulations is it suggested that merchant acquirers then have to pass on an equivalent cut.  Do you, what\u2019s your opinion on the merchant acquirer's ability to retain a material piece of the interchange cut to recapture some margin they\u2019ve lost over the years?", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "Well, historically they have not done, at least in my opinion have not done a great job at holding onto anything that\u2019s cut when you start talking about fees from Visa, MasterCard. And they\u2019ve also done a good job of passing along additional feel \u2013 they\u2019ve had to.  Now I think this interchange deal is, you have to be careful about it.  I mean, when you stop and think about it as I said earlier, most all of the larger merchants acquirers are priced at interchange plus, and there are some smaller ones out there that just have flat discount rates that include interchange. And those are the guys that are going to get hurt, and they\u2019re going to have to go back and reprice, and it\u2019s going to cost them money to do that plus it\u2019s probably going to cost, I think there\u2019s no doubt it\u2019ll cost them revenue.", "But I don\u2019t know.  I mean I just cannot imagine a draconian cut.  I mean one of the things that we spent a lot of time talking about while we were in Washington was the fact that you do have to consider the infrastructure of this business including people like us and really around the world, that allow this activity and this type of payment transaction to occur. It\u2019s not something that is cheap \u2013 it\u2019s got a huge backbone behind it, and it has to run 24/7 on a worldwide basis.  And the fact that there\u2019s a tremendous amount of fraud and losses in credit and debit, and it\u2019s picking up in debit. Mainly, it\u2019s picking up in debit, mainly beucas there's just so many more debit cards that have been issued in the past few years.", "So somebody's going to have to pay for it.   And historically it\u2019s been shared and I think if the folks in Washington can get educated well on this they\u2019ll see that the truth is we , you know, you want people to use these cards more.  And you don\u2019t want them making too many exceptions to the rules, because that\u2019s been the beauty of particularly the Visa and MasterCard systems. They\u2019ve been so well accepted that they, in some people\u2019s minds, have almost become commodities.  And you know, we should all be so lucky.  It\u2019s not a commodity \u2013 it\u2019s a great product and the banks have done a good job and so have the merchants.  But it certainly is not free.", "And there are a lot of costs associated with it, and somebody's going to have to pay. That's why I just have faith that the Federal Reserve, you know, those guys, if they\u2019ll maintain a hold of this they probably understand it better than you know, anybody else in Washington.", "", "Craig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities, Inc.", "To that point, B of A\u2019s comment was interesting in that they felt the Fed would have very little leeway to stray from the letter of the Amendment, which would indicate that it\u2019s going to be hard to count any other costs related to the traditional other than moving the bits and the bytes and fraud.  And if that is the case, and yo look at the, and B of A\u2019s assumption is right, you have to assume they\u2019re the most efficient player. Then you\u2019re looking at a lot of banks who would be operating at a loss.", "Philip Tomlinson", "Well, I think under a draconian deal, and of course this is all just supposition, as we\u2019ve talked about before that the key piece of income on a debit card is interchange.  And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any getting away from that fact. It\u2019s a great way to move a transaction. I think it\u2019s cheaper, it\u2019s got to be more efficient than a check, but at the same time it\u2019s-  If you take away that interchange it\u2019s going to in a big way, it\u2019s going to hurt it dramatically.", "", "Craig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities, Inc.", "", "Okay.  Thanks for the thoughts.", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "I wish I, you know, I just can\u2019t believe they\u2019ll just slash it.  But I don\u2019t know.", "Craig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities, Inc.", "We\u2019ve seen stranger things in other places.", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "You\u2019re absolutely right.  And it scares me to death.", "Craig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities, Inc.", "Okay. T Hanks for the thoughts.", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "Anthony, was that the final question?", "Operator", "", "Yes, there are no further questions in queue.  Do you have any closing comments you\u2019d like to make?", "Philip Tomlinson", "", "I do have a couple things I\u2019d like to say.  One is thanks for being with us today.  You have seen hopefully some trends that, we\u2019re starting to see some improvement.  We still think the economy has got a way to go so we're not exactly jumping up and down, but it's progress.  And we\u2019re happy to start seeing some internal growth.  ", "As I said earlier we can finally quite saying \u201cWhen we become an acquirer\u201d because we are an owner in a top-ten acquirer, and we\u2019ll continue to look for additional opportunities to expand our hold in the merchant acquiring business.  FNMS is not going to be our last acquiring acquisition \u2013 it\u2019s just our first.  So we\u2019re aggressively looking at other opportunities in this area.", "You know, we have the financial capacity to do that. There\u2019s a lot going on out there and you can count on us to continue to prudently manage and leverage our balance sheet, but also continue to capture greater domestic and international market share in the traditional card processing business.  We\u2019re pleased with our results \u2013 we\u2019re not as I said jumping up and sown.  And w think we\u2019re poised for growth as this economy improves.  We do need the consumer to get on board.  We\u2019re, like a lot of people we\u2019re, most cards are driven by the consumer.  And like I say, we think we\u2019ll continue to win.", "Our prospect opportunities are looking better and so we are feeling better than we have been now in quite some time about our business.  And I think what you\u2019ll see out of TSYS is you\u2019ll see it emerge out of this great recession, you\u2019ll see a leaner, a stronger, a more aggressive TSYS.  So again, thank you for your time and interest today, and if you have any more questions or if we weren\u2019t clear with an answer \u2013 and I know there was a couple there we probably didn\u2019t have quite as much information as you would have liked \u2013 don\u2019t hesitate to call Shawn Roberts.  Shawn told me just a second ago he\u2019s going to be up all night to answer any phone calls.

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the TSYS third quarter 2010 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions.] I would now like to introduce Mr. Shawn Roberts, director of investor relations. Please go ahead sir.", "Shawn Roberts", "Thanks operator, and welcome everyone. On the call today Chairman and CEO Phil Tomlinson will provide highlights on the third quarter events, and then he's turn it over to Jim Lipham, our CFO, who will review the third quarter financials. After that, of course, as you already heard, we\u2019re going to open it up for Q&A.

These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS\u2019 actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in TSYS\u2019 reports filed with the SEC. At this time I\u2019d like to introduce TSYS CEO Phil Tomlinson.", "", "Philip Tomlinson", "Thank you Shawn and welcome everyone. Good evening. We're delighted to be reporting to you today and think we have a good report. We believe we're seeing improving trends and we have some really positive news to share with you. ", "First, I want to talk about the third quarter of 2010 versus the same quarter of 2009. Same-client account on file growth increased 7.3%. That's a real high quality number for us. Same-client transactions increased 5.1%. On a year-to-date basis, same-client revenue growth increased 3%.", "Now I want to take a few minutes and talk about some new wins and some successes in each of our reporting sectors for the quarter. In our international sector, we announced earlier today that we've signed a contract to process the credit card portfolio for SwissCard, in Switzerland. We expect to convert these accounts from their in-house systems in mid-year 2011. ", "SwissCard, if you're not fully aware of it, is a joint venture between Credit Suisse and American Express, and is the only company in Switzerland to offer its cardholders American Express, MasterCard, and Visa credit cards. ", "I want to bring you up to date on Brazil. The second state of the three-stage conversion for Carrefour was completed August 15, with the last stage scheduled for mid-year 2011. The conversion was very successful, and the subsequent daily processing is going very well. ", "I think it's important to understand that we've delivered to Carrefour, and to the whole Brazilian market, a completely new server-based outsourced card system. We're confident that this strong relationship that we have built and continue to build with Carrefour will open additional opportunities and help us introduce new products and services, not only to our client there but other regional prospects as well.", "As you know, Brazil is the fourth largest card market and is enjoying really strong growth. Also, we believe that pre-paid is a huge opportunity for us to expand beyond credit. Brazil is predicted to be the second largest pre-paid market in the world, growing at a 20% rate over the next 10 years. ", "Additionally, on the international front we previously announced we had won the Tesco retail business in the U.K. and Tesco Bank is the U.K.'s most successful supermarket bank, with more than 6 million customers. And they're the sixth largest credit card provider in the U.K., with over 2 million accounts in circulation.", "Even though it was already on TS2 with another client, their decision reaffirmed the value that we think we bring to our clients over a competitor, and of course that decision as they went on their own was to stay with TS2 or TSYS. ", "We also just announced a contract renewal with the Bank of Ireland for its consumer and commercial card portfolios, and we'll continue to focus on Italy, which is the seventh largest card market in Europe with about 70 million credit and debit cards and over 8 million pre-paid cards. We think that is going to be a good market for us. ", "One I meant to tell you about when we were talking about Ireland was I'm also happy to report - and it hasn't been released yet, but they've agreed to let us talk about it - that we've just signed an agreement with Permanent TSB, which is a bank located in Dublin, Ireland. Our first European debit client, and we'll process both their credit and debit business and believe this will prove to be a watershed event for us that hopefully will lead to even more debit processing in Europe and the U.K.", "Now back to Italy, you'll remember that earlier this year we announced the signing of Cedacri. You might think of Cedacri as an aggregator model providing a host of payment related services to Italian banks and retailers and we're leveraging our newly formed relationship to provide a full end-to-end solution in this market and that should ramp up in about mid-2011.", "In the North America sector, we're seeing traction in our end-to-end card offer of community banks and credit unions through the TSYS program solutions, or TPS is what we call it, which we formed this  time about a year ago and we talked about it on this call about a year ago. We have just recently signed a partnership agreement with BancVue in Austin, Texas, to provide credit card products and related services to its nearly 700 community bank and credit union clients. ", "We already have four, five agreements into the final negotiations and they're principally startups, but one is a conversion from someone else. We expect to have these banks on our books by mid-2011.", "We think it's a terrific opportunity for us, and we're confident we have the technology and a market differentiating offer that's unavailable to this sector today. These volumes that we're dealing with are obviously smaller, but we believe that we can sell more services in a bundle package offer if you will. I think this is an area of potential growth of TSYS that you ought to keep your eyes on.", "Another win in the U.S. that I'm very proud of and want to talk about is the recent signing of Simmons First National Bank in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. Simmons First is a super-prime issuer whose customers have some of the highest credit scores in the country, and the reason I'm so happy about this one - we've been trying to sign them for about 25 years. They've been in house that entire time and they'll be coming out.", "We have an enterprise-wide relationship with Simmons and we'll process their issuing and acquiring as well as their loyalty card production, statement production, some of their fraud work, as well as the online customer service.", "Going up to Canada, Walmart Canada successfully launched its credit card program with us in the third quarter and certainly we expect big things out of this mega-retailer in Canada. Just to remind you, we signed a similar deal with Walmart in Mexico a little over a year ago.", "Also, you probably saw Monday's CIBC Visa debit card announcement and TSYS will be processing all of those new debit cards. Today I hope you also saw an announcement where we have signed a multi-year agreement with Bank of Montreal, one of Canada's top five banks and the largest MasterCard issuer in Canada. ", "The Bank of Montreal conversion process will start in mid-2011 and will continue into the first quarter or two of 2012. With the completion of that conversion, TSYS will enjoy what we believe to be a 60%+ share of the Canadian card market.", "Now if I can talk just a minute about our acquiring services. I know you're curious about the latest update on Bank of America Merchant Services, or BAMS as we call it. We have continued to work on a long-term contract and in the meantime continue to service BAMS and we have every reason to believe this service agreement will be agreed to in the very near future. So we're comfortable that we'll continue to process that business and if anything to the contrary happens we'll be in touch. ", "We renewed an agreement with Sage Payment Services out of McLean, Virginia to provide authorization, settlement, and terminal services to its 155,000 merchants. In addition, we signed Cynergy Data out of New York City, which is a leading ISO with approximately 120,000 merchants to our authorization settlement and dispute resolution services. ", "Of course, FNMS, our merchant acquiring joint venture with First National Bank of Omaha, continues to exceed our expectations and we're delighted with their performance, energy, and the new opportunities they bring to the table.", "Now, with that I'd like to turn it over to Jim Lipham who will give you much more detail on the financial side. Jimmy?", "James Lipham ", "Thank you Phil. Couple things I wanted to discuss. First of all is in the press release you saw where we announced the sale of TPOS our point of sale business in TSYS Acquiring, and we sold it right at the end of the third quarter. ", "It was immaterial as far as the amount of revenues as was stated in the press release, but we did book a loss in the quarter of $2.3 million and year-to-date it's going to be $3.1 million. And those will be losses that will be showing up in the discontinued operations on the P&L, but I did want to cover those.", "Phil mentioned that we had great same-client growth in our transactions and our accounts and we continue to see good improvement there, so as we go through these slides I'll try to pull some of that out to you. ", "Also of note is the way we were able to, in this quarter and year-to-date, we have now overcome the loss of the de-converted revenues and the termination fees associated with clients that we've lost. When you look at the third quarter numbers on slide seven, you'll see the revenues were both up. Revenues before reimburseables as well as total revenues. ", "We did have $24.4 million of termination fees and one-time revenues in the third quarter of '09, and during this third quarter of '10, we suffered about a $2.5 million loss in currency translation. But if you go down to the operating income you'll see we're down 10.6%. ", "We did book in the third quarter this year $26 million more in expenses associated with FNMS that we didn't have next year, but if you removed all that you'd see about a 9.2% decrease in expense this quarter-over-quarter. So overall we're continuing to do good expense controls and obviously the addition of FNMS has helped us on the revenue side. ", "Operating income - if you went in and adjusted the FNMS as well as these termination fees you'd be up 12.9% instead of down 10.6%. So this is all just part of trying to get to our core business and get rid of some of these one-time items between quarters that seem to cloud what's really going on with our company.", "If you get down to the bottom you see the growth in accounts and it's up, cardholder transactions I mean, it's 6.8%. If you remember, in Q2 we were up 3.8%, so we're continuing to show positive growth and increases there. Year-over-year you see it up 3.8% and at $5.582 billion. So great cardholder transactions, and in our same-client Phil mentioned a while ago for the quarter up 5.1%. During the second quarter that was 4.9%, so it's continuing to pick up.", "If we go to the next slide, just to highlight the impact on FNMS, and I say impact because we pick up in the third line there the acquisition fees, which as you know are on TSYS' books. They're not on FNMS'. But with that said, their operating profit for the quarter is $7 million and $11.8 for year-to-date. ", "Now both of these numbers have amortization of intangibles in it. The quarter has $3.6 million and the year-to-date has $7.4 million of intangibles taken out of it. If you put those back you'd be running in the 30% to 31% margin on FNMS, which is very good and as Phil said we're pleased with where they are and in line with our guidance.", "I will mention that - it's not on the slide - but their transaction volumes year-over-year when you look back at '09 for them, they're up 5% and their dollar volumes are up 6.2% year-over-year. So they're showing some good growth also in the direct acquiring market.", "If you flip over we have a graph here that just shows our growth in revenues year-over-year. We're up 2% on a year-to-date basis and this is the breakout. Internal growth is still 3%. That\u2019s the same percentage it was in the second quarter and continues to be a real positive force and something we look forward to seeing grow back into the high singles and low doubles like it used to.", "New clients added 2%, acquisitions added 6%, and then you've got the normal column of lost clients and price compression with lost clients making up the biggest portion of that 9% decrease, being roughly 7.8%.", "But the internal growth is still the key there. We hope as you all know we've got two quarters next year [inaudible] some of this lost business. But we do anticipate the first quarter being somewhat similar to what we've just come through here in the third quarter, because we'll have one quarter there that we didn't have FNMS in 2010 and it will help us offset the termination fees we got first quarter of 2010.", "Flip over to the next one it's our account on file summary. Not a whole lot to say here other than that we are pretty close to where we were last year at this time. We're down 2.9 million accounts from that point. When you look to the consecutive sequential quarters you'll see we're actually up 6.4 million or 2% over where we were at the end of the second quarter, so still seeing some good account growth to offset what we've lost in these deconversions this year, so we're very proud of that.", "Flip over to the first segment, North America. You'll see revenues $231.5 million, it's down 11.5% year-over-year. Same thing with revenues excluding reimburseables. They're down 12.3%, there again the big item being the $20.6 million loss in revenues associated with your deconverted clients and lost business.", "Margin, down 27.3%. That's a pretty good margin where we think we're going to be there. I know we're down a lot from where we were in '09 but that's because of those termination fees. It boosted the margin up quite a bit. I think it was up 32.8% back in the third quarter of '09. ", "But I will highlight the same client transactions again, growing at 5.3%, $1.582 billion. This is roughly the sixth quarter in a row that we've shown improvement in the same-client growth quarter-over-quarter. So sequentially we're doing real well in seeing the transactions grow.", "Over to the right, total cardholder transactions, $1.658 billion. That's also an increase of 6.6% and very good there.", "Flip over to the international segment. Sequentially we're at $85 million. We're up 9.4%. That's actually down 1% from year-over-year and again we had about $2.7 million worth of negative currency there and the operating margin decreased 205 basis points. But if you'll note, operating margin down at 15%, excluding reimburseables, is where we had anticipated it would be. ", "Some of the highlights for the quarter had to do with Japan. We had roughly about $3 million or $4 million pickup there based on base-one, base-two volumes as well as a little new business, new products. ", "Our new clients in Europe added about $6 million. If you'll remember we had Skycard de-convert the end of fourth quarter last year, and that cost us about $4 million on a comparison basis. But the same client growth was up 1.7% year-to-date and if you excluded the price reductions it would be up 3.2% so still feel real good about our international. ", "We did have a growth in our operating expense of about 2.1% and it's mostly associated with the technology spend and infrastructure we've built up for Brazil, which Phil mentioned that Carrefour has now started being converted and look forward to that being finished and growing our presence in Brazil to get some scale out of this infrastructure that we've built.", "Total same-client transactions up in the international 4.3% and see good growth there, and then 7.7% for the total cardholder accounts.", "Flip over to the merchants. Big numbers here. We're up 38.4% of revenues, up 57% in revenues before reimburseables there again. FNMS represents $33 million of the increase. We did have a good internal growth here in the acquiring space, 6.1%, and feel real good about that. If you look at the same-client point of sale transactions [inaudible] we're at $1.3 billion, an increase of 0.5%. If we bring in the FNMS transactions, they're up 5%. I mentioned that a while ago. In dollar volume, transactions were up 6%.", "The point of sale transaction's a little bit distorted as you know. They went up about 3% last quarter and if you go back and look at the same client point of sale transactions we've lost a very big merchant in this quarter and a lot of transactions there, but if you restated those transactions for then and the loss was clients that we had and the new ones that came on, you'd see a 4% increase in what I'd call same client point of sale transactions. So good growth here in the acquiring space and as we mentioned before the FNMS acquisition has proven to be in line with what we thought it would do.", "The last segment. Corporate administration. Nothing really to add there. It's just up $400,000 over last year and no real changes.", "The last slide here has to do with cash flow. In the trailing 12 months it's $489 million, down just a little bit from what we have had in the past. When you look at the cash flow from operations at $375 million, we are down about $32 million. It had to do with some pre-pay growth, prepaid accounts, and we did have an adjustment out of our deferred taxes from long-term into short-term which caused us a problem there, but we still feel good about where we are with cash flow from operations. ", "So free cash flow down $217 million. We have spent around $158 million on capital expenditures in the last 12 months and that's what brought that down, and this just happens to be the same number as net income. But overall we continue to have good cash and as you saw in the press release we did get it back in the market and bought our shares back starting on the first of September and I will tell you that one of the reasons that happened is we didn't have any active M&A activity going on at that time and we thought it was a great opportunity to get in there and buy some stock. And we did until we had to get out before the quiet period.", "With that, I will add one more thing that you probably saw on the equity and income line. It was down a little bit for the quarter and it had to do with [inaudible] data, and we had a fluctuation there and we had an adjustment in the third quarter that we made bringing them in line with GAAP on some of their revenue recognition this year but it will be just a timing issue. But it did knock it down a little bit in the quarter. But we don't see it, [inaudible] see year-to-date it's pretty close, so we feel pretty good about that.", "So Phil, I'll just turn it back to you.", "Philip Tomlinson", "Thank you Jimmy. We'd like to open it up for question and answers now if we could, operator.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Yes sir. [Operator Instructions.] And your first question is from the line of Jason Kupferberg with UBS.", "Jason Kupferberg - UBS", "Just a question on the full-year guidance. I know you're notching it up here on the EPS side by a couple of pennies and obviously we've just got one quarter left. It looks like if you back into the high end of your range at a buck for the year, maybe your Q4 EPS might actually be down a little bit versus Q3. So just hoping you could talk a little bit about some of the puts and takes there. Maybe you're just being a bit conservative, or was there anything one-time in the Q3 results, or any other explanations you might point to there?", "Philip Tomlinson ", "As you know, at the end of the second quarter we talked about, when we were $0.02 above also, that we were going to be booking some employee benefits things that we hadn't done in a couple of years, and we will continue that through the fourth quarter. We also had some revenues that we had originally thought would come about in the fourth quarter that got accelerated into this third quarter. There's obviously a $0.02-plus for the quarter and we're not real sure that this can hold up. We did have some good volumes, and if the Christmas season comes in it might be on the low end.", "Jason Kupferberg", "Okay, that's fair. And I guess just starting to think beyond Q4. I know it's a bit premature to actually offer formal full '11 guidance, but can you give us a general sense - how do you feel about your prospects for revenue growth acceleration, margin performance next year? You've got some sizable termination fees this year to still grow over, but you've got a good amount of new work rolling on next year, and probably a continued undercurrent of some pricing pressure. So again, not giving us hard numbers, but just directionally how should we start to think about what you guys are expecting '11 to shape up for the company?", "Philip Tomlinson ", "Quite a long question, Jason. [Laughter.]", "Jason Kupferberg", "Are we going to get a long answer?", "Philip Tomlinson ", "I'll tell you, we're working on '11 as we speak and I mentioned that about the first quarter because it's closer and it's very visible and the FNMS revenues will be there. They'll help offset the $25 million that we had in the quarter this year, in first quarter of 2010, but obviously we're excited about outgrowing the termination fees and as we look at internal growth and if this account growth continues to happen we'll feel pretty good. It's just not there yet to give you a number. ", "James Lipham ", "We typically give that number in January and I don't know that we can give you much beyond that today.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Bryan Keene with Credit Suisse.", "Bryan Keene \u2013 Credit Suisse", "So the margin in the quarter, the operating margins, kind of surprised me a little. I recall last quarter I think there was almost an $11 million termination fee that helped boost the margins and yet the operating margin was relatively the same without that big fee. So I guess my question is was there anything one-time that boosted third quarter margins to reach the second quarter level, or -", "James Lipham ", "I'm not sure what you're looking at. I know North America for the second quarter had a margin of about 32.8% compared to our 27% this quarter, and that's because of those one-time fees. But if you look at the year-to-date margin we're at 22% versus 23.9% last year, and what we're seeing a little bit is a drop in our margins because of an infrastructure build that we've had on the international front as well as the drop that we had - we were picking up good margin growth off of these termination fees, because they were going straight to the operating income line.", "Bryan Keene", "Yeah, I'm just looking at operating margin of 18.3% in 2Q and then of 18.2% in 3Q '10, so it didn't move much. So it probably has to do with some of those fees.", "James Lipham ", "That's in the fees in that third quarter of '09.", "Philip Tomlinson ", "Bryan, I told our board today it was just superior management. [Laughter.]", "Bryan Keene", "And going forward, though, in the fourth quarter it looks like just backing into the guidance the margins will drop back down, and some of that sounds like there'll be some benefits and things that will be in that fourth quarter number. Is that correct?", "James Lipham ", "That's correct.", "Bryan Keene", "Okay, and the minority interest balance that I think up a little to $4 million. I think you might have mentioned something about that Jim. Is that one-time in nature, or should we see that $4 million continue as we go forward?", "James Lipham ", "It will continue. You're talking about year-to-date I guess, and we did have a one-time adjustment this month for getting CUTDATA on an accrual basis on some of their fees for revenues, and so it's a timing issue.", "Bryan Keene", "So we'll see that bigger minority interest expense going forward as well?", "James Lipham ", "Well, the minority, that's not it. I was talking about the equity and income line. On the minority interest that's just a piece that belongs mainly to FNMS, and it will grow as we go forward, because that's the 49% that we don't own of FNMS. And then we have [inaudible]. So that's what's in the minority line.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Greg Smith with Duncan Williams.", "Greg Smith \u2013 Duncan Williams", "Just on the equity income, again, with CUPDATA - you're saying there was some one-time adjustment to get that in line. So are we going to recoup any of that, or as we think of 4Q and going forward can we get back to the $2 million plus number you put up in 2Q?", "Philip Tomlinson ", "It was just a matter of the way they had booked something and it happened to happen in the same month of August. It was right there in August and September, they booked in two months, and we had to go in and change some of it.", "Shawn Roberts ", "All we did was defer it.", "Philip Tomlinson ", "One month amortization instead of a one month recognition.", "Greg Smith", "And then are there any large deconversions still pending? Can you remind me?", "James Lipham ", "No. [Laughter.]", "Greg Smith", "Didn't think so. But just wanted to make sure. Glad we're past that. And then you talked a little bit about the debit opportunity in Europe with that win in Ireland. Can you talk a little bit about that opportunity and why is that emerging for you at this point?", "Philip Tomlinson ", "The truth is, we've been trying to sign debit business for years and just have not been very successful and we've talked about it on this call three out of four times. We now have some debit business going in Canada. We have our first debit customer in Ireland. And we've got something to sell and we're hopeful that this will be the reference point or the reference, whatever you want to call it, to where we can use these organizations as a sales tool. We've got a good product and we're hopeful that it will grow.", "James Lipham ", "It's not like that's going to happen overnight. That's going to be somewhat of a slow process, because we just don't have the big reputation in the debit business. But we can do anything that anybody can do in the debit business. So we feel good about it.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Adam Frisch with Morgan Stanley", "Glenn Fodor \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Hi guys it's Glenn Fodor for Adam Frisch. Congratulations on the nice stream of recent wins. In your eyes, does this signify that things are finally loosening up from a decision making perspective, and should we read into these as a trend that should continue, or -", "Philip Tomlinson ", "I don't know if this constitutes a trend, but we have seen some increased activity in North America in particular. If you think about it, over the last three years we've been fairly successful signing new business on an international basis, but the U.S. market just sort of dried up and the card issuers were typically in such bad shape that they certainly didn't want to take any risk, particularly with this CARD Act that has recently been implemented, by the way, which I'm happy to tell you went - I guess you would say - flawless here. I do think people are at least willing to have a conversation with you about doing something like this, like we do, where in the past couple of years it was just hard to engage anybody because I'm sure a lot of them were worried about whether the organization was going to survive, much less worry about whether they should do a card conversion of some sort. But I don't know if it's a trend. We're seeing a little light. It's not fantastic yet, but it's better than it has been.", "Glenn Fodor", "Presumably these wins have come from your pipeline. How is the backfilling going of those now? Are you bringing in more that will move through the pipeline?", "Philip Tomlinson ", "We've got a pipeline today of 12-13 million accounts as best I understand it and that's signed. And we've got, again, a long, long list of prospects, some very large, some pretty small. And as you know, thank goodness all of them don't take as long as Simmons did, but it's not a quick sell. It's a long, complicated process and that's why people are very careful about the decisions they make.", "Glenn Fodor", "And if I can just go with one more, I'd appreciate it. In our research we've laid out some alternative products banks may be exploring for a post-Durbin world. Recently we heard BofA come out with some vague comments that they're working on some things. Have you been actually working with the banks on some of these scenario analyses they've been doing? And if so could you - ", "Philip Tomlinson ", "We're working with several banks on some new products that hopefully will be coming out before year end that I think will be attractive to the consumer market out there and we're pretty excited about them.", "Glenn Fodor", "Can you give any color on what they might be?", "Philip Tomlinson ", "Well, one that we talked to earlier, maybe a couple of quarters ago, was this hybrid product that we have which is you can sort of direct how you want your payments to be handled, whether it be a pay now or pay later kind of product. It's got a lot of different ways for the consumer to be able to manage their credit or their now account if you will. Again, it's the first time in a while we're starting to see people want to bring out new products. I'm always checking my mail. As I've said earlier, I'm one of the few people that look forward to getting these credit card solicitations in the mail so I can see where they're coming from and how many are coming, and read them and see what's going on and they're picking up, which is a good thing.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Craig Maurer with CLSA.", "Craig Maurer \u2013 CLSA", "I was hoping you could comment - you mentioned you lost a large merchant and I was wondering if you can comment on the circumstances around that.", "James Lipham ", "I can't. It was a pretty large one. ", "Craig Maurer", "Was it price driven?", "Philip Tomlinson ", "Service and price. What it was was a large merchant, national merchant. ", "Craig Maurer", "Your new debit win in Europe - I just hope you can comment on when you look at the margins you'll earn on debit versus credit in the same customer relationship how do those compare?", "Philip Tomlinson ", "The debit would be much less. There's a lot of activity on a debit account, but when you compare it to what we actually do on the backside of it other than authorizations and passing those transactions back to the bank you don't have a lot of the activity that you would have on a traditional consumer credit card account. And so while it's important and the transactions are very easy to add on, I don't think you could seriously compare the two. I think credit would be a much more robust product as far as generating revenue for TSYS. And for the issuers too by the way.", "Craig Maurer", "And the last question I had was in relation to a lot of the changes that we're seeing out there and proposed changes. From your perspective do you think merchants will be successful in steering transactions from one product to another and as an acquirer are you looking into how you could help facilitate that steering? And does that in a way make you a foe to your biggest customers, which are the banks if you were to do that?", "Philip Tomlinson ", "We're certainly looking at those options but I'll answer that question as a consumer. And I think that's what I will certainly be at the point of sale is a consumer. And when I pull out my card that's the card I want to use, and typically I have a reason for using that card - I don't know, it's top of my wallet for some reason. It might be a loyalty program. It might be a great rate. It might be my best friend's bank. There's no telling. But there's typically a reason that I would pull out that card for that particular transaction. And I use several different cards as a consumer so I think it all sounds good but I think it will be difficult and you might be able to do it with some pricing incentives or something like that but - I don't have the answer to that to be frank with you.", "Craig Maurer", "Right. It just seems that the merchant risks too much by turning off the consumer.", "Philip Tomlinson ", "I just want to get through the cash register line and get out, and I think most consumers are that way.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Tom McCrohan with Janney.", "Tom McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Did you mention who you sold the point of sale business to and any kind of pricing around that?", "", "Philip Tomlinson ", "No, we didn't.", "James Lipham ", "I just mentioned that we had the loss recorded in the third quarter of $2 million.", "", "Philip Tomlinson ", "It was just a private sale to a private company.", "Tom McCrohan", "And the Simmons First win, is there any way that you can size that up in terms of number of cards, revenues, or both?", "Philip Tomlinson ", "I don't want to give the size of the cards. It's not a mega-issuer. They're just a very high quality, high end issuer. It's one we've been after for a long time and it's not going to move the needle a great deal but it's important to get those kinds.", "Tom McCrohan", "And Jimmy, just an administrative question for you on amortization of intangibles. The pro forma 38% margins in the merchant segment kind of imply over $5 million of amortization of intangibles this quarter in that segment. I think it was like half that amount last quarter if I'm correct. I'm just kind of curious what the phasing is, what we should be modeling for intangible amortization going forward =", "James Lipham ", "The intangibles you had for the quarter - $3.6 million would be what you'd look for going forward per quarter.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions.] Your next question is from the line of John Williams with Goldman Sachs.", "John Williams \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Had a question for you sir - a little bit of a housekeeping point, but on your merchant services business I was just curious to know why the point of sale transaction seems like a low growth rate just given what you've seen and I was curious if there was some sort of mix impact or if it was combining FNMS with the indirect business. What's the driver of that relatively low growth rate on the [POS].", "James Lipham ", "I assume you're talking about the 0.5%?", "John Williams", "Right.", "James Lipham ", "That was the one I was talking about with TSYS acquiring, where we've lost some business and added some business. When you take that out you'd see a 4% increase, which we'll see going forward as -", "John Williams", "Sorry, I missed that.", "Philip Tomlinson ", "John, I think it's important to understand, too, when we talk about TSYS acquiring, we don't own those merchants direct, so when Jimmy says we lost a big merchant, one of our clients lost a big merchant. Just want to make that clear.", "John Williams", "Sure. No, that makes perfect sense. The other question I had was on the accounts on file it looks like your growth other than in the consumer business seems to have stabilized reasonably well with commercial and [stored] value. Just wanted to get some color and I think I asked a similar question last quarter on the [stored] value side in the prepaid relationships. What are you seeing, and perhaps in the way of additional color, for demand in that channel. Obviously Green Dot and NetSpend now both out there. Pretty substantial news flow around those names. But are you expecting that that's going to continue growing at the rate that you've seen the growth in the last two or three quarters?", "James Lipham ", "I think it's going to continue to grow. I think these issuers will have to deal with this idea of who they can clear those transactions through, and obviously that was part of the issue on the NetSpend thing. And we know all those guys well and they're all good people. But we think it's a product whose time has come and when you start looking at where the government is headed with regulations and particularly how the financial services industry is dealing with the unbanked segment of the population prepaid is the answer. I think the thing that's hit us also is the fact that in a lot of these developing countries prepaid will be huge. I predict to you it's going to be huge in Brazil. It's going to be particularly large in China and India. It will be the card of choice I believe for some period of time until these systems to allow people to have credit or debit are really better defined in some of those countries.", "John Williams", "So do you think that you see any difference in what the bigger banks are requesting in the way of prepaid support? Thus far, I know a lot of the questions you've gotten on the prepaid space is how long it's going to take for the bigger banks really to start to push up their demand and push up just providing an attractive product to people.", "Philip Tomlinson ", "The truth is John, when we got in the prepaid business our strategy was that we would sell it to the banks that we process for. And that just proved to be impossible. Banks just were not very interested in selling that product. That is beginning to change a bit. I know that we are starting to have some conversations with some of the larger banks about actually doing prepaid work, and that has been a very frustrating thing for our prepaid group because it seemed like a natural process for us. But we were just unable to sell it. Now I think as we've gone through this recession and continue to go through it I think people, particularly banks, are starting to see some of the real pluses of a prepaid card on an ongoing basis. Of course, you've seen what has happened with Green Dot and they're our largest prepaid client. So we've got some great experience in that industry.", "Operator", "And Mr. Roberts, I'm showing that there are no further questions in queue. Would you like us to continue fielding for questions?", "Shawn Roberts ", "If there's no further questions we'll just turn it to Phil for a summary.", "Philip Tomlinson ", "Thanks Shawn, and thank you operator. You've done a great job today. ", "Our vision continues to be a leading global payment solutions provider. That's where we are headed, and that's what our goal is. And I think today we're far more than a credit card processor, but obviously card processing will continue to be a real cornerstone of our business. ", "Jim covered the quarter's performance and I think that's great. But that's a quarter. I still think that you should view TSYS from a long-term perspective as we've begun this diversification that we've been talking about really since we spun out from Synovus and as we've all tried to get through this recession.", "This joint venture with FNMS was the first step in that diversification and now we're in the direct merchant acquire business in the U.S. and through their Smart One program we're also in the prepaid issuer business and a program manager for payroll cards. ", "We've got the cash to invest and the determination to pursue acquisition opportunities not only in the U.S. but certainly on an international basis. We are continuing, every day, to mine for additional opportunities, to diversify this footprint in the payments business. We will always continue to grow and perfect our domestic business here in North America. ", "We continue to expand our business in the international markets, and I think we have really had some great successes, even during this terrible recession. And we'll continue to move on those home markets like the U.K., Ireland, Germany, and the Netherlands. And I think it's interesting that a year ago I couldn't have said Germany was a home market, but I can today. We're going to continue to focus on the emerging growth markets, particularly Brazil, India, Italy, and even Switzerland. ", "We will continue to repurchase shares as the opportunities come about, and it makes good sense to us. We will always have a strong balance sheet and a service culture that serves us well with our clients. ", "We appreciate the confidence you have in TSYS and I want to share with you year-to-date, including capital expenditures on equipment, software, and contract acquisitions, the investment into FNMS, into the direct acquiring business, and the stock repurchase program, we've plowed $314 million back into TSYS this year. ", "These investments, along with a great team, world-class products, and service are keys to our continuing to win in these industries. Frankly, it's easy to get caught up all the bad news, the recession, the financial reforms, etc., etc., but the truth is our news is brighter today than it's been since early '08. We're not out of the woods yet, but we believe we're starting to see a little bit of daylight. ", "I believe we paid a tough price to get our expense base prepared for what we believe will be the next growth surge that is coming sometime in the next year, so we believe. So again, thanks for your interest. Thanks for your time. Thanks for your questions, and feel free to call us if we can clarify anything and we again appreciate your time and being on the phone with us.

Inc.", "Operator", "Good afternoon. My name is Jeremy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the TSYS Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mr. Shawn Roberts, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Shawn Roberts", "Thank you, Jeremy, and welcome, everyone. On the call today, our Chairman and CEO, Phil Tomlinson, will provide highlights on the fourth quarter and 2010 year-end events, and then turn it over to Jim Lipham, our CFO, who will review our financials as well as our 2011 guidance. After that, we'll open it up for Q&A. ", "I'd like to now call your attention to the fact that we'll be making forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS's actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in the TSYS's reports filed with the SEC. At this time, I'd like to introduce TSYS's CEO, Philip Tomlinson.", "Philip Tomlinson", "Thanks, Shawn, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you being with us today. I hope your weather, wherever you're at, is better than it is here in Georgia. It's pretty rainy, and they're talking about snow in Atlanta tomorrow. I'd like to start off by saying that I really believe we ended a very challenging 2010 stronger than originally expected. We are seeing a gradual improvement in the economy, and frankly, I'm very proud of the way our team has performed during this very difficult last two and a half year period. ", "Our 2010 revenues remained strong despite a couple of client losses in the first quarter. We've continued to show we can manage our expense base during very difficult times. We announced several new wins in 2010. The new business we signed in Canada will increase our share of the market there to about 64% when we get Bank of Montr\u00e9al converted. With our wins in Germany, we now consider this a home market. We've secured three new wins there, one of which is, as you know, our biggest win there is Deutsche Bank in that market. We've also signed deals with iCARD in the prepaid business. We've signed a deal with BNP Paribas, which is our first contract in France for their home cash card, used for money transfer. And we did renew the BAMS Merchant Processing agreement. We also launched a new processing system in the world's fourth largest card market, with a new client, Carrefour, in Brazil. They are really our anchor tenant there, and we believe that, that's going to serve us well going forward.", "We entered into a joint venture with First National Bank of Omaha in the merchant-acquiring business by buying a 51% stake back in the March-April timeframe. And then on January 4 of this year, we announced we purchased the remaining 45% in FNMS, which is the 10th largest merchant acquirer in the U.S., and we have rebranded that to TSYS Merchant Solutions. We're very excited about that, and I think that's going to bode well for us, long term.", "Lingering economic indicators like unemployment, home foreclosures, slipping consumer confidence index, continue to cast a shadow on this economy. And ultimately, recovery has been slow, and yet our business model is showing signs of strength that we're very excited about. We've aligned our multiple business units that operate as P&L units into three business reporting segments, and I want to kind of go through those very quickly to let you know what we were thinking about. ", "The number one is North America. We want to continue to expand our outreach and really dive deeper into the community bank and credit union space, as we've talked about in several conversations earlier. And we want to focus more on large debit issuers, in addition to the traditional business that we've been working on for 30 years. Certainly, the challenges included in the North American segment would be the current regulatory environment and ongoing industry consolidation, but our prospect list continues to grow in North America. We're pretty excited about what it looks like.", "The second segment is the international segment, and we will focus on margin improvement. We've got to push to achieve operational excellence in our newly launched outsourced platform. And we've got to increase our leverage on both the TS2 Prime and TS2 in our target markets. We continue to grow revenue in both our Processing and Licensed businesses, and both are doing well. Our challenges, internationally, are really focused on successfully executing 14 conversions this year and improving the economies of scale, which ultimately will improve our margins. ", "And then third, and certainly not least, but in the Merchant Services segment, we're focused on growing this business and expanding our distribution and capabilities through the TMS or TSYS Merchant Solutions, as well as our Processing business, what we call TAS, TSYS Acquiring Solutions. We'll continue investing in new technology to enhance new products and to expand into select merchant verticals. We will continue to build scale as a direct acquirer, with more focus on sales, and we hope to continue to have meaningful acquisitions in that area. It's an area that we want to continue to grow. Obviously, challenges around further consolidation, data security, and again, never-ending regulation. ", "Jeremy, with that, I'm going to turn it over to Jim Lipham, our CFO, who's going to review the financials and share our guidance for the year 2011. Jimmy?", "James Lipham", "Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned, as we went into 2010, it was going to be a real challenging year. Just to put it in perspective, just to refresh your memory a little bit, we had roughly $73 million of revenue we knew we were going to lose. This is net of termination fees and everything as we went into 2010. So we went into the year looking to recover quite a bit of dollars in revenue and finish the year with double-digit growth in cardholder transactions, which hadn't happened in quite a while. So good momentum going into 2011.", "We would go to the first slide, I guess Slide 6 on the consolidated financial highlights. Looking at the quarter, you can see revenues are up a positive 1.7% for the quarter, revenues before reimbursables up 3.7%. The story here is the TSYS Merchant Solutions acquisition has helped offset the lost revenues and price compression and deconversion fees that we had in both North America and the International during the fourth quarter. When you look at the revenues being up 3.7%, if you added back the lost revenues of $12 million and the deconversion fees of $17 million that we had in 2009, revenues would be up 12.9%.  That was the outstanding growth. Also, in operating income, you see the same thing. We're down 24% there, but once you restated those numbers for those lost revenues and termination fees, that would be up 10%. So we did have a positive growth there from when you took out those one-time items that we had for '09. I mentioned the cardholder transaction growth of 10.2% for the fourth quarter, and that's the first time since the second quarter of '07 that we've had double-digit growth in transactions, and that's just   outstanding fourth quarter.", "When you look at the year-to-date, the same story is there for TSYS Merchant Solutions helping offset the lost revenues that we had for the year. The year-over-year, if you added back the deconversion fees and the lost revenues, we'd be up about 8.4% in revenues instead of the 2.5% you see there for revenues before reimbursables.", "Transaction growth there for the year is up 5.5%. And there again, that's outstanding growth. We haven't had a positive year-over-year increase since 2006, so it's good to see that starting to happen again. But overall, we had good results. We went a little out of  consensus and, as you know, we raised our target at the end of the third quarter, $0.02 a share, and we did successfully make that.", "Flip over to the next slide, I want to go over just briefly the effects of TSYS Merchant Solutions. What we had for nine months there and, well first of all, for the quarter. Revenues for the quarter are $34.9 million, operating profit is $6.9 million. As you know, we have amortization of intangibles there of 3.6%. So our GAAP margin is showing up at 19%, whereas if we added back the intangibles that we have that were amortized, and then we'd be running about a 30% margin, and that's what you would have year-to-date also. For the nine months, it was running about 15% on a GAAP after amortizing intangibles, and 30% prior to that. ", "We'll note down there the non-controlling interest of $9,122 million. Make sure you remember that next year this will not be there. It will be in our net income line because we completed the acquisition of FNMS on January 1. I will mention too, on the fourth quarter, year-over-year transactions were up 6.7% and their dollar volumes were up 8.6%, so they had a good fourth quarter also.", "Next slide is the one on our year-to-date for 2010, what made up our revenues. As you may have saw, 2.5%. Of course, we rounded to 3% here. And what made that up is 4% internal growth, which is the highest we've had here lately, and we finished the third quarter, if you remember, it was up about 3%. So we have actually improved a little bit during the fourth quarter. New clients being up 2%, and then the acquisition of FNMS making up 7% there. When you get to the lost business, it was roughly about 7.2% of this 10% reduction. Price compressions represented around 1.8%. So that got us down to the 2.5%, roughly the 3% that we have year-over-year.", "When you look at the next slide on account on file, you'll see sequentially we're continuing to see good growth. We're up $3.7 million accounts for the fourth quarter over the third. We're going to finish the year at $1.9 million shy of where we started the year out. So we've had pretty good growth in account on file, and look forward to next year to turning that around to be positive year-over-year growth. And obviously, we've had a little -- the guard [ph] of that pick-up is in the Commercial card area, year-over-year and store base, so good account growth and look forward to the next year when we can talk less about lost clients.", "Next slide is our fourth quarter segment information on North America. A couple of key drivers there. You see that we lost $10.2 million of revenues from deconverted clients and lost business. And we had a termination fee in '09 of $8.4 million, which -- both of those total $18.6 million. Revenues of $234 million and revenues before reimbursables at  $198.7 million. They're down about 7.1% year-over-year, and obviously, without the $18.6 million, we'd be up 2%. So from an operation basis, without the one-time items, we'd be up about 2%. Operating income is $56.3 million is down 20.9%. Would be up 7% without the effects of the lost revenues and termination fees. Margin, we are at 24.1%, we're up from where we were the third quarter, a little over 1%. And same thing for operating margins after reimbursables, we're up about 1% from where we were at the end of the third quarter.", "On the transaction, same growth, same client transaction growth. It increased 7.2% to a great number of $1.651 billion, with seven quarters in a row that this has grown, and we feel very good about where we were for the fourth quarter. And then it brought the year-to-date of the total cardholder transactions up by 9.7%, which is just outstanding growth.  Organic growth in the North America segment was around 2.6% for the year, and looking forward to that picking up as we go into next year.", "For the segment on International, the next page is -- there your key drivers are. And we had very little impact on the currency for the quarter. We did have some lost revenues of $1.7 million, to go along with the deconversion fee of $8.9 million. So roughly $10.6 million lost revenues when you compare the two quarters. ", "Revenues, they're down 9%. But when you add back the $10.6 million, you'd be looking at revenues up by 2%. Operating income is really down for the quarter at $7.4 million. What\u2019s happened here is the infrastructure costs. We've had less capitalization on software development for Carrefour, Orrville [ph], Swisscard, some of these other development projects that we had going on in the fourth quarter of '09 that we didn't have in '10. As you know, Carrefour has started revenue generation, which caused us to have to start amortizing the infrastructure costs that we have in place, and this conversion is going to go on through 2011, and we will have a lot of infrastructure costs going against not a full load of revenue as we go through 2011, and that's caused this margin to drop. ", "The total capitalization that we don't have is about $6.9 million, and we've got about $2 million worth of increase amortization. So in total, about $9 million when you compare the two quarters year-over-year. So margin drops down now to about 8.1%. We anticipate, through the first half of the year, at least that barge is still going to run at that level. And as we get the conversion schedule on Carrefour and some of these others in place, we'll start offsetting some of this infrastructure cost. The incremental buildup of revenues will be quite good as we go forward and add business. ", "The organic revenue growth here for the International segment for the year was like 4.3%, so that was good. We have the cardholder transactions, we really had good growth there, and the total cardholder transactions up 12.8%. And that's coming off of a third quarter where they were up 7.7%, so good growth there. ", "Merchant segment continues to still look good as FNMS has come in. Internal growth for the year is at 8.4%. Our operating margin, without FNMS, is 39%. So revenues were up 43%. Revenues before reimbursables are up 66%. Just outstanding operating income and margin production there.", "Just make mention, on the TSYS Acquiring Solutions, their same-store for sale transactions are up 8.6% for the quarter, so that's really outstanding. Margins suffered just a little bit in the fourth quarter. We did have a one-time charge of about $900,000 hit in that quarter. So one-time won't recur, and outside of that, we would've been at the same level we were in the third quarter, around 25% margins there. ", "Next slide, Corporate Admin is up $4.6 million. Nothing much to say there. I did mention during the third quarter that if our strength continued in our operations, we would now continue to book some incentives and employee benefits, which did happen here in the fourth quarter, and that's a good portion of this increase here.", "You flip that the page to the cash flow summary. As you can see, EBITDA is at $472 million, and cash from operating activities at $389 million, still real strong. We did suffer a slight decrease in our free cash flow, and it was mainly driven by about $39 million purchase of licensed software during the fourth quarter. And we also had some acquisition costs of around $40 million over what we had in 2009, but overall, without that, again, we're still generating a lot of cash, where big cash flow is running around $20 million a month, and we feel real good about the way we're generating some cash here.", "If you flip the page, you'd see what happened to our cash during the year, as we were very active and started out at around $450 million, and then operating, as I mentioned, created $389 million. CapEx, $217 million. That's about $96 million more than we normally do, and that was that software, as well, as we had a little hardware in the fourth quarter from Hitachi that we acquired, and that created a little higher CapEx than we normally run. Acquisitions of $144 million, as we did the FNMS. We had dividends, $55 million, and then we did the share repurchase we had in the third quarter for about $46 million. So we generated a lot of cash, spent a lot of cash, ended the year at $395 million, and then we, of course, on January 1 bought the remaining 49% interest in FNMS, and that took us down about another $169 million. So we are starting the year off with around $225 million in cash and continuing to grow.", "If you look over to the next page, we'll start with our 2011 guidance, and I thought we'd do a little chart on the revenue assumptions that we have. Internal growth, at 2% to 3%, represents about $36 million. New client revenues between the 5% and 8% is around $88 million, somewhere in that neighborhood. And then acquisitions, 2% to 3%, and currency at 0% to 1%. Makes up all the positive pickups for the year, and then we still have lost business. We had about $68 million of lost revenues, and then $33 million on top of that was termination fees that we have to -- price compression is not that strong for '11. We're only anticipating around $12 million, $13 million there. So our guidance is up in the 3% to 5% range. Obviously, if we took that termination fee out, we'd be up 6% to 8%, which would be some outstanding growth for 2011.", "The last page is the ranges that we have for revenues and revenues before reimbursable items. We will anniversary the 2010 deconversion fees in the first and second quarters, and we expect to have more favorable comparisons as we go in to the second half of 2011. I mentioned that revenues would've been up 6.8% without the deconversion fees or termination fees. And net income from operations would've been up 20% to 21%, which is just -- would be an outstanding growth for us, as we prepare to see some good growth in 2011. ", "With that, I will make one mention on -- that I haven't talked about, is CUP Data. And their fourth quarter was outstanding. Their revenues are up 23%, their operating income was up around 21% and continuing to show good growth in China. ", "So with that, Phil, I'll turn it back over to you.", "Philip Tomlinson", "Thank you, Jimmy. I hope everybody read and heard what Jimmy said. If you adjust out the termination fees from primarily Wachovia and Charming Shoppes. Jeremy, I think we are ready to open up the Q&A period if you will.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]  And your first question is from Bryan Keane. [Cr\u00e9dit Suisse]", "Bryan Keane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "I guess my first question, Jim, just looking at 2011, I see the guidance here. But how will that progress throughout the year? Specifically, I know we had some term fees in the first quarter and second quarter, so I assume the second half of the year is going to be much stronger than the first half? Maybe you can give us a little bit of guidance on what we might expect, or where we should be for earnings?", "James Lipham", "We don't normally give quarterly guidance, but you are right. I think the second half of the year is going to be the -- you'll see it gradually growing up through the third and fourth quarter. But we don't normally give guidance on the quarters.", "Bryan Keane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Any guidance on the tax rate for the year?", "James Lipham", "Yes, we're looking at 34% for this coming year. 34% to 35%.", "Bryan Keane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And just a couple other quick ones. Free cash flow for the year, I guess, $20 million a month. Is that a good number to use, or probably even a little higher than that?", "James Lipham", "It would be just a little bit higher than that, probably around $250 million.", "Bryan Keane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And then just on your latest thoughts on Durbin. What are you hearing from clients, and do you expect to see any benefits from the move towards more credit and prepaid?", "Philip Tomlinson", "Bryan, this is Phil. I'll try to answer that. They've got a pretty wide open comment period going on right now, and I think we have a chance to win either way. I mean, an awful lot of our transactions are debit card transactions. I was stunned to see, I think last week, or maybe it was early this week, where Barney Frank had indicated he'd be willing to work with the Republicans to reconsider that amendment. So I think there maybe -- I don't think all this is totally final yet, but we're feeling pretty good about some of these changes. We're not a big debit card processor, but I think I would say at least 55 or so percent of our transactions that we process on the merchant acquiring side would be debit transactions. And I do think that the reward programs for debit will certainly have to come down, the profitability will certainly come down. When you look at an average interchange of $0.44 versus somewhere between 7% and 12%, it makes it much less profitable. But there are some other -- I don't believe, and I said this last time, I don't believe banks are considering getting out of the debit business. It's still a great product, but I think they're just going to have to figure out a way to reprice it if it stands as it is today. And I think that some people will move to prepaid and to credit cards, primarily because it's just a better package, if you're not interested in having a debit card. It's really still pretty early in this game to tell, although the Fed is really into the details of the debit business. We had a presentation last week that -- it showed us the depth of detail that they're going into, and it was a little surprising, really. But I think we're going to be fine in this thing. Our transaction flow may move a little bit here and there, from debit to credit to prepaid, but we're in all three businesses and we don't really see the transactions slowing down.", "Bryan Keane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "The accounts on file has very little exposure to debit, if I remember correctly.", "Philip Tomlinson", "That's absolutely right.", "Operator", "Your next question is from David Scharf. [JMP Securities]", "David Scharf - JMP Securities LLC", "Maybe a couple of things digging into 2011. The new client growth that's anticipated, looking at revenue, I guess, 5% to 8% of it. Is that concentrated in the couple -- is most of that considered Deutsche Bank and Carrefour, for example, or how broad is that span of new customers that are starting to contribute more materially?", "Philip Tomlinson", "It's pretty broad. I mean, we haven't signed some mega deal as you know. I mean, it started last year with President's Choice, Carrefour -- and I don't have the dates in front of me, but we're looking at Swisscard, DNS Merchant Services in Germany, Cedacri in Italy, the rest of Carrefour in Brazil, Bank of Montreal, I just don't have the dates here in front of me. And there's been others. Caterpillar is an example, Simmons First National, they all just add up. And we would certainly like to sign a mega issuer, and we're always working on that, but it's just good, clean business.", "David Scharf - JMP Securities LLC", "Following up on the last line of questioning, in terms of new products, where debit's going and the like. Given so much of the discussion out there on prepaid, health savings accounts, other alternative payment vehicles, can you give us a rough sense maybe, now that it\u2019s sort of the beginning of the year, just how the revenue per account, on  average per card, per month kind of stacks up for credit versus debit versus Stored Value versus Commercial, just to kind of refresh us? I know it's not as -- you'd think that they disclosed, but...", "Philip Tomlinson", "I've said before, Commercial is probably generates the most revenue for us on a per account basis. And then the traditional consumer, Visa or MasterCard, and certainly debit would be maybe the lowest, because it's just -- you really don't use much of these systems that we have built on a debit card, other than just authorizing and producing cards. Jimmy?", "James Lipham", "Yes.  I can add a little color to it on a consolidated basis. I mean, we're running around $250 revenue per account. Just like Phil said, I think the lowest one that we got in here has to do with the prepaid world, as far as revenue per account, with the highest being your Commercial card.", "David Scharf - JMP Securities LLC", "But on a relative basis, the way they stack up against one another, is it fair to say it hasn't changed much over the last 12, 18 months?", "Philip Tomlinson", "Yes, yes. That's fair.", "David Scharf - JMP Securities LLC", "One last question, thinking about sort of bigger picture, other avenues of growth. How does all the talk of mobile payment play into TSYS? On the one hand, obviously, it's just another secular trend towards more electronic payments, but is there any risk that you can get this intermediated by mobile payments? Some of the announcement's with Verizon and others? I mean, how do you all see that playing out in the next few years? And you're thinking of a generation of consumers and kids that are walking around with just a phone and not a card in their wallet.", "Philip Tomlinson", "Sure. I mean, we process in Japan, and they've been doing that for 10 years in Japan. We do think it will certainly generate more transactions. I think that probably this Durbin Amendment has slowed down some of this discussion, at least on a big scale, with the likes of Verizon and AT&T and others, because -- they've got to figure out a way to make money. I think you'll see us involved. I think we feel good about where we are with mobile. As I said last time we talked about this, there's probably 600 mobile schemes out there today, and there are probably two or three that will survive, and we don't think that we will get this intermediated with on the transaction side. But now, will it do away with some portion of the actual plastic card? I think it will, at some point. I don't think it will happen anytime soon, because I believe that there's a transition period. If you took your mobile phone, if it was activated today, there are very few places that you could go use it. And so there's a cart before the horse sort of process that's got to go on. And it's going to take a lot of investment in the merchant community to initialize all of these terminals, if you will, to be able to accept some kind of mobile phone standard acceptance program. Do I think it's going to happen? Absolutely, I think it's going to happen. Do I think it's going to help us? I really do. And I do think we'll be involved in several programs.", "Operator", "The next question is from Brett Huff. [Stephens Inc.]", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.", "A couple of quick questions on large customers and renewals coming up. Can you refresh our memory on anything going on with Target, J.P.Morgan, Cap One? We haven't talked about renewals in a while. I know those guys are important customers. Can you give us an update on them?", "Philip Tomlinson", "They are important customers, and none of them are renewing this year.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.", "Are any of them in '12?", "Philip Tomlinson", "Brett, you always ask these really hard questions. Yes, I think Cap One comes up in about 18 months or so. I don't believe Target does. And who's the other one you. . .", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.", "J.P.Morgan?", "Philip Tomlinson", "Well, that goes through 2013, I believe. Of course, we did a commercial card for those guys too. And I don't have that date in front of me, but we got some big ones out of the way last year.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.", "And is that -- because you have the big ones out of the way, is that the reason the price compression is less severe this year?", "Philip Tomlinson", "Yes.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.", "Employee incentives that you mentioned were $4.6 million, I think, over the last year. How will those continue to flow through? I mean, I know you guys were tight on expenses for a while, like everybody else. Will that be a recurring-type cost, would go up, down, one-time?", "Philip Tomlinson", "We're still tight on expenses. We think it's kind of business as usual any more, but Jimmy, I'll let you answer that.", "James Lipham", "No, I think we're going to try to keep them and not be up and down like a yoyo, because we just had those tough years, and that was just kind of what we held back on. We did, I guess the best way to put it is we put about 66% or so of our normal incentives and benefits in this year, and we'll try to at least hold that going into this next year.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.", "And so does that mean that -- is the $22.5 million operating expense for Corporate the right number, or should it come back down?", "James Lipham", "I think that's pretty close to what it should be.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.", "And then in terms of -- as you guys look out internationally, Jim, you mentioned -- you've talked a little bit about just the changes in accounting that are going on, given go live dates. When we think about those margins getting better, particularly, I think, in the second half in some of the international business, the revenue, the transactions are coming on more, what's the kind of ramp we should expect in international? Will it be a bit of a step function or gradual? And where in the medium term, I mean, like late '11 to '12 do you see those EBIT margins going?", "James Lipham", "I guess, the best way to answer that is I think you're going to see a pickup in the fourth quarter, and this is providing that the conversion schedule is met. And then you'd probably see margins back in the 11% range fourth quarter, if that happens. If not, it'll be the first quarter of '12 before it does. Then it'll work its way back up to the 15%, 16% range during the latter part of '12 as these conversions continue.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.", "And then the North American EBITDA margins, or EBIT margins, were nice. Was there any particular driver there?", "James Lipham", "No, I don't think so. It's just transactions were really good, and good growth there.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.", "And then last question. The tax rate seemed low. Was there anything, I think I calculated 31% or so, any comment on that? It sounds like you'd still expect 34% or 35%. But wasn't there some one-time stuff that happened this quarter?", "Philip Tomlinson", "Well, we did have the, as you know, the RNE [ph] credits that got a pass, that were going to be disallowed, I guess. But anyway, they got passed. So that got booked all in the fourth quarter, it's about $1 million there. And then we had some international pickups that we had, about $1.7 million. So it all got booked here in the fourth quarter, at least enough to make it come down to 31%. But we should be in the 34% range next year.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Greg Smith. [Duncan-Williams]", "Greg Smith - Duncan-Williams, Inc.", "Just to start, the second First National Merchant purchase, the price was actually higher than the initial purchase, which gave you a controlling interest. I just thought it was a little odd that the second purchase was actually higher. Can just you give us the rationale for that?", "James Lipham", "Well, we had good growth, and it was tagged to an EBITDA number. And the growth indicated that, that's the best price. It was a pre-agreed-upon deal.", "Greg Smith - Duncan-Williams, Inc.", "That makes sense. It was already sort of pre-established. So there wasn't any real negotiation around it then?", "James Lipham", "Right. The negotiation was to talk them into go ahead and let\u2019s finish the deal.", "Greg Smith - Duncan-Williams, Inc.", "And what is the real rationale why you so quickly did that?", "James Lipham", "Because, as we've been saying, for about three years, we really want to be in the merchant-acquiring business, and we've been working pretty hard to try to get there, and this was a great opportunity for us. And we've got a great team, and it's a really fine bank to be. They've built a good program out there, they've been in business 56 years, I think, in the merchant-acquiring business. We just couldn't ask for a better way to start.", "Greg Smith - Duncan-Williams, Inc.", "And then, Jimmy, as we think about -- the balance sheet at quarter-end does not reflect the cash coming out for that second purchase, is that correct?", "James Lipham", "That's correct.", "Greg Smith - Duncan-Williams, Inc.", "So that's really the only adjustment that we need. And then going forward, the minority interest line will no longer have FNMS in there. What's left in minority interest? Is that the GP Net in Japan?", "James Lipham", "Yes, and managed services over in the U.K. is in there.", "Greg Smith - Duncan-Williams, Inc.", "Any idea whether or not the minority interest line is going to be significant in 2011?", "James Lipham", "No, it won't.", "Greg Smith - Duncan-Williams, Inc.", "And then just -- you guys obviously did the first merchant deal. I would argue your balance sheet is still under levered at this point, given your recurring strong free cash flow. How are you thinking -- it looks like you have no buybacks in the guidance. How are you thinking about acquisitions versus buybacks, and what can we possibly expect over the next 12 months?", "Philip Tomlinson", "Well, I think -- we had a board meeting today, and when I told our board, well, we still have a buyback in place. And I think we have the ability to buy back 7 million shares back through April, and I'm sure we'll put another one in place at our next board meeting. I would say you can look for us to be back in the market if we don't feel like there's a target that could happen this year.", "Greg Smith - Duncan-Williams, Inc.", "And as you stand right now, is there a target this year that looks acquirable in the next 12 months?", "Philip Tomlinson", "Yes, we're talking to several people, and we had one fall out of about three, four weeks ago. I don't want to say that there's definitely one there, but we're certainly talking to people. But I would say there's, frankly, there's probably a good chance of us getting back in the market anyway. Because we still think it's a good buy.", "Greg Smith - Duncan-Williams, Inc.", "And then it's fair to say any significant buyback is not baked into your guidance, is that correct?", "Philip Tomlinson", "That's correct.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Darrin Peller. [Barclays Capital]", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital", "Bottoming out and trends improving. Just had a quick question. There was a comment, I think it was made earlier on CUP Data. I was just curious. I mean, I saw some of the -- there was an increase in non-controlling interest on the balance sheet. Was that related to an investment in CUP? Or maybe just give some more color on kind of the opportunities that you see CUP Data playing into your business?", "James Lipham", "Well, CUP just had an outstanding fourth quarter, and they've had a good year, and they continue to grow. And obviously, we're looking for them to continue to bring us some good earnings out of China.", "Philip Tomlinson", "Darrin, this is Phil. I think you will also see -- I mean, we've really, with CUP Data as our partner, won the vast majority of banks that have put outsourcing RFPs out in China over the last three or four years. I do think that the next thing you're going to see is a big rush in the Prepaid business in China. And I think we're in a very good place there, and I think we'll benefit from that. So we're hopeful that some good thing is going to happen in China this year. I don't predict anything on China anymore, because it just doesn\u2019t work very well when you do that. But we're very hopeful that China is going to have some good things happen.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital", "It seems like you guys are pretty well-positioned in that area.", "Philip Tomlinson", "I think we are.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital", "We'd just seen an article around Kohl's. The Kohl's private label portfolio apparently is being acquired by Capital One. I think they have about 20 million accounts on file. I think I saw an article saying that was going over to First Data. And so just curious, I mean, is that...", "Philip Tomlinson", "The Kohl's process is in-house, and First Data has a, and I'm not speaking for First Data, but they have a big portfolio of private label business in -- I say, I'm not sure who have the ownership of the receivables work. Kohl's could tell you that. I just don't have any idea, but...", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital", "Capital One, I think, is the receivables ownership, and Kohl's manages the program.", "Philip Tomlinson", "I think that's right.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital", "But there's no -- I mean, they wouldn't imply any risk associated with Capital One's relationship with you though, right?", "Philip Tomlinson", "No, I don't think so.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital", "Obviously, a fair amount of the growth on the accounts on file is coming from prepaid. And that's -- I mean, again, you seem to be fairly well-positioned there, given your exposure with Green Dot. Can you talk a little bit about the economics on prepaid, specifically versus per se and perhaps the traditional consumer card or maybe the Commercial?", "Philip Tomlinson", "Well, that's what Jimmy was talking about a little earlier. It is not in the league with -- at least on the processing side. Our side, it is not in the league with the consumer and/or the Commercial card processing. It's more of a debit card-type transaction.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital", "Last question, just on cash EPS. I mean, you guys still report on GAAP. A lot of your competitors tend to report cash or some sort of adjusted number. Is that something you see in the near term?", "Philip Tomlinson", "Well, I wish we were reporting adjusted numbers today. Like I say, when you adjust out the termination fees, this 2011 looks absolutely wonderful. Jimmy?", "James Lipham", "I think as we continue to have increased amortization from intangibles and the like, we'll be probably moving to a cash...", "Operator", "Your next question is from Jason Kupferberg. [UBS Investment Bank]", "Ramsey El-Assal - UBS", "This is Ramsey El-Assal for Jason Kupferberg. What's your optimal long-term revenue mix between card processing and merchant acquiring, kind of on a go-forward basis?", "Philip Tomlinson", "I don't know that we think there's an optimal. I mean, we would certainly -- I think the last I looked, when you take the FNBO acquisition, it takes our Merchant business up to about 26%. We would like for our International business to continue to grow, and we've said several years ago, one of the goals we had was to get our international revenues to 30%. But the U.S. is such a huge market, and it's continuing to grow. So it's been difficult to do that. But we -- I mean, I think we would love to see it a third, a third, a third. It probably will never be that, but...", "Ramsey El-Assal - UBS", "Can you give us an update on Canada, where you are in terms of ramping up on some of the large new deals that you've announced there, like Bank of Montreal and President's Choice and Walmart?", "Philip Tomlinson", "Well, President's Choice is on the books. It was converted last year. Walmart has started up. It's on the books. And Bank of Montreal will probably go on the books early in 2012.", "Ramsey El-Assal - UBS", "And I wanted to follow up on something you said a little earlier, the Durbin-related question. It seems like no matter how the Fed interprets the Durbin Amendment, that issuers might de-emphasize debit and double down on credit and prepaid. Have you already detected this type of shift occurring with your customers? Are you sensing that issuers are sort of waiting for a final set of rules before they actually start changing course that way?", "Philip Tomlinson", "We haven't seen any big shift, if that's what you're asking. Frankly, I think the banks are just digesting the sticker shock on what the Fed initially proposed, and I'm sure that most of the major issuers are submitting strong comment letters, as we will be doing ourselves. But again, as I said earlier, I think we are in a pretty good position regardless. Now we would -- our biggest problem in the deal, and this is more of a philosophical one, we don't think the government ought to be -- the Federal Government ought to be setting prices between two commercial entities.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Magna Lata [ph].", "Unidentified Analyst", "Just one quick question. We have seen an increase in card solicitations recently. I mean do you have any color as to how successful have your bank customers been in converting these potential customers?", "Philip Tomlinson", "I think that solicitation is certainly picking up speed, as you heard me said before. A lot of that I gauge on a personal basis, and I'm averaging about one solicitation a day now. And this time last year, I hadn't had one in probably six months. So it's a lot of the usual suspects, and I'm feeling better about that. I don't have any specific numbers that I could give to you, Magna. But it certainly has picked up. And I think as a result -- we have to be a beneficiary of that.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Tom McCrohan. [Janney Montgomery Scott LLC]", "Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Can you just give a little more color about terms and conditions of the renewed contract with the Dna Merchant Services?", "Philip Tomlinson", "I can't go into any real detail, Tom, other than it has been done. It's for a five-year period. We don't expect those guys to stay with us forever. They've got their own joint venture. We're thrilled that we could do something at least for that term. And we're going to do everything we can to make sure they stay happy.", "Operator", "The next question is from Robert Dodd. [Morgan Keegan & Company]", "Robert Dodd - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "On your target of looking at more of the small banks and credit unions, et cetera. Is there an opportunity for you to get one of the two aggregators like CSCU or PSCU? Are there contracts there that you're aware of up for renewal and an opportunity in the next 12 to 18 months?", "Philip Tomlinson", "Well, Robert, I wouldn't comment on their contracts, but I can tell you we've been trying to sell into PSCU and the independent bankers for about 25 years, so we know them well and we're certainly continuing to think that would be a wonderful way to enter that business in a big way, and we're certainly going to continue to give that our best shot. They're a major aggregator, and anybody in that business would be crazy not to be thinking about them.", "Robert Dodd - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "On the contract acquisition payments as well. In the quarter, it was elevated again -- I mean, honestly, it was high in Q3, but much lower in Q1, Q2. I mean, are we seeing a new higher level, or is this just timing of when particular renewals and new business has been won?", "Philip Tomlinson", "I think it's timing. It's about new business that is won. We haven't seen any big change in that.", "Operator", "The next question is from Paul Bartolai. [PB Investment Research]", "Paul Bartolai - Credit Suisse", "First one, just on FNMS. It seems like the momentum is going pretty well there. Just curious if you can make any comments on the pace of customer signings? And then, just as far as you look at '11 in terms of the accretion, I mean. Is that, given the momentum there, I mean, it's something like maybe $0.04 to $0.05 accretion in '11 given the buying in the other half. Is that about in the right ballpark?", "James Lipham", "That's in the ballpark, right.", "Paul Bartolai - Credit Suisse", "$0.04 to $0.05?", "Philip Tomlinson", "Yes.", "Philip Tomlinson", "And then in terms of just any general comments on signing new business in competitive FX of that market?", "Philip Tomlinson", "I don't have any comments today, Paul. We probably don't -- or Paul, we're in the process of learning what we need to report there.", "Paul Bartolai - Credit Suisse", "And I just want to clarify a comment earlier on the margins. Jim, did you say for international margins getting back to around 11% by 4Q?", "James Lipham", "I think we've got a good chance of being there, with the conversion schedules being completed and all the time schedules laid out now.", "Paul Bartolai - Credit Suisse", "So first half, still staying kind of single digits and then kind of creeping double digits in the back half?", "James Lipham", "Correct.", "Paul Bartolai - Credit Suisse", "And then just kind of looking at the guidance. I'm just kind of trying to figure out the offsets there, given the investment spending. Any comment you can give on North American margins? I mean, is the 4Q kind of a decent run rate, or it almost seems like you have to kind of ramp up from there to get to the guidance range?", "James Lipham", "Well, I think the margin rate there in the fourth quarter is probably pretty good. As you remember, we've had lost revenues and deconversion fees and all. And I think in the fourth quarter there, we did have the termination fee and, what, about $18 million there that we had to take into account. But I think the margins in North America are going to maintain that level, going forward.", "Paul Bartolai - Credit Suisse", "Then Merchant, kind of the 32% to 33% as well for next year?", "James Lipham", "Yes.", "Paul Bartolai - Credit Suisse", "And then just a couple of more question on guidance real quick. As you look at kind of -- particularly in the Merchant business, I mean with BAMS, I'm assuming, you're just kind of assuming, that you keep kind of the existing base and the new stuff goes away. But what about just other situations like you have NPC, which seems like there's some issue around that contract. Just curious about any contracts like that, and kind of what you're assuming in guidance for next year?", "James Lipham", "We assumed on BAMS that we will have a reduction in revenues. It's not that material, but it will go down from where it was in 2010. And as far as NPC goes, I don't have any changes there at this point.", "Paul Bartolai - Credit Suisse", "And have you disclosed the other side of that business for you guys? I know it was a customer of TSYS Acquiring and FNMS.", "Philip Tomlinson", "No, we haven't, but it was immaterial.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Glenn Greene. [Oppenheimer & Co.]", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "A couple of questions. The first one is the new client, the growth from new clients. That 5% to 8%. Is that clients that have already signed and just need to be converted, or is it part of that new clients that you need to win?", "Philip Tomlinson", "Part of it is already signed.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "So part of it's signed, but part of it's new as well?", "Philip Tomlinson", "Right.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Could you, and maybe, Phil, you could give us sort of a follow-up to that, a sort of -- what's the pipeline looking at, looking like, what does it look like relative to a year ago? Are deals getting won and signing? Have things loosened up, and maybe sort of contrast North America versus international? Just sort of the quality of the pipeline.", "Philip Tomlinson", "I think the North American pipeline is bigger. I don't have that in front of me. I think we've got $7 million in North America. And this is the conversion pipeline, these are the people that are signed. And then we've got about $6.5 million internationally.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "And those are already signed deals?", "James Lipham", "Yes.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "And how about prospect pipeline? I mean, obviously, you've signed a lot of deals during 2010. It sounded like it was a good year for signings, but have you replenished the pipeline going into '11 for new prospects?", "Philip Tomlinson", "Well I think the prospect pipeline is massive, but I wouldn't want to give you a number there.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "And then just one more question, and sorry, it's related to Durbin as well. But there's some conversation theory out there that merchant acquirers could actually benefit as it relates to Durbin. Perhaps benefit from part of the fee chain reduction? Do you foresee that as an opportunity, or do you think 100% of the rate reduction on interchange will be passed directly to merchants?", "Philip Tomlinson", "Well, I think the vast majority of it certainly will. I don't -- typically, when you're pricing Interchange-plus, it is Interchange-plus. These merchants, they know what the Interchange rates are. And the merchant-acquiring business may pick up a few points there, but I don't think it's going to be anything significant.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "So certainly nothing that you're counting on or contemplating in terms of the growth prospects for your merchant-acquiring business.", "Philip Tomlinson", "No.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached our allotted time for questions. I'll now turn it back over to Shawn Roberts for any closing remarks.", "Philip Tomlinson", "This is Phil. I'm going to close this out. One, we appreciate you being with us today. You could tell, we're pretty enthusiastic about where we're at. It's really kind of fun to be looking at -- or at least to have tailwinds as opposed to headwinds. Certainly, we've still got issues, unemployment, regulation, you name it. But we are starting to feel better about our business. And you've heard me talk many, many times about our strengths, and why you should be interested in us, and I think what this shows, again, is we're a very resilient company. We have a great team of people here. I told our board this morning that we have people that the devil hates to see get out of bed every morning, because he knows they're going to do some good things. The other thing that I told our board, and some of you are going to think this is really corny, but this period that we're in sort of reminds me of when I was a kid, and my mother -- we'd have dinner, and she would say -- as she was picking up the plates, she would say, \"Now save that fork. Hold onto your fork.\" And to me, that always meant something better is coming. And so what I told our board this morning is we are holding on to our forks, because something better is coming, and we're starting to feel it. So we hope that you feel that way. We want to thank you for your continued interest in TSYS. If you have any additional questions, certainly feel free to contact Shawn Roberts in our Investor Relations area. We thank you for being with us tonight, and we will sign off.", "Operator", "And that does conclude today's teleconference.

Inc.", "Operator", "Good afternoon. My name is Jeff, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the TSYS First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded today, October 25(sic)[April 26], 2011. Thank you. I would now like introduce Mr. Shawn Roberts, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Shawn Roberts", "Thank you, Jeff, and welcome, everyone. On the call today, our Chairman and CEO, Phil Tomlinson, will provide highlights from the first quarter of 2011, and then turn it over to Jim Lipham, our CFO, who will review our financials. After that, we'll open it up for Q&A. ", "I'd like to now call your attention to the fact that we'll be making forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS' actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in TSYS' reports filed with the SEC.", "At this time, I'd like to introduce TSYS CEO, Phil Tomlinson.", "Philip Tomlinson", "Thank you, Shawn, and good afternoon, everyone. As I'm sure you've seen by now, we feel like we're off to a good start in 2011. We reported basic EPS, or earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.25, right in line, we think, with the consensus estimates. We have also deployed $205 million of our capital in the first quarter as part of our continuing efforts to increase shareholder value and grow this company.", "We completed the purchase of the remaining 49% of the First National Bank of Omaha acquiring operation, which we have now rebranded TSYS Merchant Solutions, and we continue in our stock repurchase program, and Jimmy will talk about these in detail in just a few minutes.", "I think it's important to note that the key metrics that we monitor in the case that our business is improving: Organic growth -- organic revenue, merchant volume, account on file and total cardholder transaction growth, all indicate the business is getting healthier.", "And I wanted to go through the 3 segments that we report. First, the North America Services segment. The strong growth in the increased market share in Canada has prompted us to open a call center operation in Sudbury, Ontario to support a lot of growing client interest in outsourcing call center and back-office functions. We'll host a ribbon cutting in early May, at our new Sudbury facility. ", "During the quarter, we signed BBVA Compass for a referral program for its correspondent banks, utilizing our turnkey credit card program developed by the program solutions team that we've talked about the last couple of quarters on this call.", "In the International Services segment, we're in the middle of a conversion process, with BNS card services for issuing and acquiring in Germany, and for issuing for Swisscard in Switzerland. ", "During the quarter, U.S. Bank also launched a European Corporate Card pilot with us, and we continue to see growth in our Licensing business internationally with the PRIME software.", "As you know, we have offices in Japan that service Prepaid and Credit Card Processing businesses. And the addition of 2 new issuer processing clients contributed growth to our efforts in Japan. We also operate and are a majority owner of a merchant services company, GP Net, which has about 120,000 merchants in Japan, or processes for about 120,000 merchants in Japan. Of course, when the massive earthquake and tsunami struck on March 11, our businesses remained intact and operational, and we continue to see good revenue growth in Japan from GP Net. ", "As usual, the TSYS family came together to support the disaster efforts there. We have regular conversations with our team in Japan, who continue to report that food supplies and power remain a concern, as they work to recover from this terrible natural disaster.", "I want to talk just a second about Brazil. We are also finishing up Phase 3 of our conversion of the Carrefour accounts in Brazil. And as you probably have read in late April, Ita\u00fa Unobanco, the large Brazilian bank, purchased a 49% interest in the Carrefour Consumer Card business. And obviously, we've been in close contact with the Carrefour executives and look forward to expanding our relationship with Carrefour. And I think it also gives us an opportunity to build a relationship with the Ita\u00fa Unobanco management. We strongly believe, we still believe in the Brazilian market, and the future of this region will be very profitable for us long term. ", "I want to move to the Merchant segment --to the Merchant Services segment. We are growing this segment by developing some great new products and services to meet the needs of acquirers and the merchants they serve. Our growth strategy is based on organic revenue growth and a targeted M&A approach, which includes select portfolio acquisitions, joint venture opportunities, and some smaller tuck-in acquisitions that seem to make sense to us.", "Today, we serve a mix of merchants well over 300,000 strong. We have an active direct sales force, agent-bank relationship management, plus relationships with many independent sales organizations, or ISOs, which are all focused on adding new merchants. We're committed to growing new and existing merchant channels, new vertical markets and further diversifying our revenue mix.", "Now with that, I want to turn it over to Jim Lipham, our CFO, who will review the first quarter 2011 financials. Jimmy?", "James Lipham", "Thank you, Phil. I'll call everybody's attention to the first Slide 6, and as you can see on this slide, we put a column on the right over there for Excluding Termination Fees, so you get an idea. And then we'll talk a lot about that just to show you the numbers and the percentage growth of what our normal operations were without the deconversion fee.  This is the next to the that last quarter where we have deconversion fees. We will have another one this next quarter, but it will be very small compared to what we have this quarter.", "But looking to the left, just kind of straight over total revenues were up 3.9%, and revenues for reimbursables are showing a 5.8% increase.", "Basically, what happened here is we had the termination fee that we had to overcome of about $23 million year-over-year, and then we had lost revenues from deconverted clients, about $9.6 million, a total of about $32 million. This lost revenue was offset by the addition of TMS, Total Merchant Services, the FNMS acquisition of $32 million in the first quarter. So both of those kind of offset. We had good organic growth of about 3.9% for the quarter. We had international operations. We had currency pickup of $3.4 million. We had some good growth from projects from existing customers. Bill mentioned growth in Japan and also revenues in Brazil. So we had a pretty good -- and I'll talk some more about that segment in a minute, but we had some good growth on the international front.", "Operating income, as you can see, was down 8.4%. The big item there, as you know, the expenses went up $22 million, but FNMS represented the total increase that we had there. So that's contributed to that. ", "Our margin, it was 17% on total revenues, and 20.1% on revenues before reimbursables, and without the termination fee, both of these were up about 250 basis points year-over-year. So some good numbers outside of the termination fee.", "Net income was down 5.7%, and then you could see it would have been up 32.7% without the termination fee.", "EBITDA for the quarter was $114 million. It was up 20% over 2010 when you took out the termination fee. And our margins this quarter were 31.5% on revenues before reimbursables, so a pretty good EBITDA growth there also.", "Then I'm going to split to the next slide, which gives a little more color and detail on the revenues before reimbursable growth. We mentioned internal growth of close to 4%. New clients added 3% also, and then the acquisition of FNMS brought us 9% growth in revenues quarter-over-quarter, and then currency is up 1%. So on a total, you've got about a 17% growth there, and then it was offset by the lost business and the one-time termination fee of 11% bringing that down to net growth of 6%.", "It shows you again what a difference in the year makes when you could think about last year, we were a year ago, talking about a decrease in revenues for the first quarter of 2010 over '09 of .3%. So good turnaround from where we were last year at this time.", "On the next Slide 8, we are looking at the account on file portfolios, some very good numbers here, and the fact that we're up, have grown 10%, on account on file year-over-year, even though it's a lot of the growth is in Stored Value, 64% of that growth, as a matter of fact, is in Stored Value, which a lot of those cards right now in the inventory stage, and they will become active, but they're not that active at this point. A year ago, there again we were showing a 17% decrease on account on file growth year-over-year, so good turnaround from year-over-year.", "When you look to the right on the Sequential for the quarter from December of '10, you see a 4% growth there, and starting to see some real growth in our Consumer business, being up 3.9 million accounts, or roughly 28% growth for the quarter, from where we were at the end of December. So that's very positive, and we continue to also, see good growth on our Commercial business.", "Next slide, we get into the first one of segments, which is North America, and you can see the key drivers there on deconversion fees. And my comments are going to be reflecting the current year's numbers to prior year, without the termination fee, and that's just more comparative of what's really going on in North America. ", "If you look at total revenues at $230 million, and revenues for reimbursables, $194 million. The revenue numbers are flat. The revenues before reimbursables are up about 1.3%. This is all because of new business and the organic revenue growth of the 4%. Had to offset the deconverted clients we have, and like I'd mentioned to you a while ago, it's about $9.6 million of revenue.", "The segment operating income, $55.2 million, is up 18.4%. And our margins were $28.4 million on revenues before reimbursables and $323.9 million of revenues, and both of these are up about 400 basis points year-over-year as you restate the 2010 for the termination fee.", "Then you'll see our total cardholder transactions, good growth there, totaled $1.6 billion, up 11.6%. And then our same client transactions were up 10% at $1.573 billion. So some very good numbers there as far as the metrics we look at, good growth in those accounts and transactions.", "Next slide is on international. We did have a  favorable currency of $3.4 million, but the revenues on international, they were up 14.3%, and then the revenues for reimbursables were up about 14.6%. The segment operating income, however, is down 2.3%, compared to 2010, and it's mainly again because of the increased costs that we've been incurring as we have expanded in the international front.", "The margins compared to revenues and revenues before reimbursables were 12.2% to 12.6%, respectively. And they're basically 2 percentage points lower than what they were in January of last year, the first quarter of last year. ", "And these margins are higher than what we ended the year at. And the fact, we were in the single digits at the year end numbers, and we anticipate that to continue in single digits as we go forward, as we've seen in this first quarter, a lot one-off items in both revenues and expenses that have pushed this margin up to the 12% range.", "So looking -- going forward through the remainder of the year, we expect it to go back down into the high-single digits until we get further into the fourth quarter, probably in the first quarter of 2012, as we've finish out these conversions that we have underway.", "Total transactions, good growth there, 15.9%, and then the same client transactions were up 7.5%. So pretty good numbers on the international front, and just caution on the margin as we go forward, continues to be depressed outside of these one-off items.", "The next slide, we have the Merchant segment. Obviously, very good numbers there in light of pulling in the TMS revenues, $32.6 million, which were not there in January of last year. We see here revenues of $86.5 million, excluding reimbursables, and approximately 66% of that is transaction-driven, predominately from our TSYS Acquiring, which was our point of sale business, and 33% of that is revenue numbers from the direct merchant ownership, which we've picked up with the acquisition of TMS.", "On the POS transaction, volume has declined. As you can see up here, they're down 8.3%, and this is direct result of some lost business, with the biggest 1 being a merchant processing client that we had lost a large merchant in the prior year, and had a lot of POS transactions not there. If you took the Bank of America deal out, as we have talked about them starting to deconvert and just looked at the rest of our clients, you would see an organic growth there on POS transactions of 1.3%. So small growth, but still positive growh there, and not down 8.3%. But the direct merchant ownership I mentioned that 33% of the revenue numbers are driven by dollar volume, and for TMS their dollar volumes are, for the first quarter of this year, about 4.5% higher than they were last year during the first quarter. So good metrics for that piece of the business. So operating income is increased 50.8% and margins were 23.3% and 31.1% as you look at it based on revenues, and revenues before reimbursables.", "Both of these margins, again are up -- the revenue margin is up 281 basis points over 2010. And I might add that the organic growth piece of this Merchant segment is 1.6%. So some good numbers there, but we have got to see -- continue to see good improvements in the economy with the merchants and the ability to grow that small merchant portfolio.", "On the next slide, is Corporate Administration, not much there, there. That's obviously, all the expenses for the Corporate Admin, and it's pretty flat year-over-year. ", "And the last slide I have here is on cash flow, the trailing 12 months. As you can see, we continue to generate cash with EBITDA at $468 million. Cash from operating activities ended $358 million. We mentioned last quarter about the free cash flow drop that we had and the fact that we had a $25 million payment on an incentive and roughly a $39 million software payment in the fourth quarter, which were unusual and drove the cash down. Free cash flow for the quarter, however, was $83.3 million. So we'll be picking back up that number as we go forward, and get away from the effects of the fourth quarter.", "Cash at the end of the quarter, as you could see in the press release, $252 million. And Phil mentioned, the decrease was mainly due to the purchase of the remaining 49% interest on the FNMS business. We paid $169.6 million there, and we have also spent about $35.7 million in share repurchases during the quarter, which leaves us roughly about 4.9 million shares left on our plan as we go forward. But we plan, as we go forward, to continue to look at acquisitions and to pull in our capital. And outside of that, as we grow it and don't have acquisitions, we will look at share repurchases.", "And with that, Phil, I'll turn it back over to you.", "Philip Tomlinson", "Thanks, Jimmy, and Jeff, if you're there, we'll open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Greg Smith with Duncan-Williams.", "Greg Smith - Duncan-Williams, Inc.", "Can you lay out what exactly is going on with Bank of America at this point? And sort of what the revenue exposure is? And what the earnings impact of that could be as it rolls off?", "James Lipham", "I mean I could tell you that they have decided to any type of deconversions they do, they're going to take that back-end and the front-end business at the same time, which is going to slow it down even more than we thought. And you might have a risk of about 10% drop in their revenues per year.", "Greg Smith - Duncan-Williams, Inc.", "Okay. 10% of the total Bank of America revenues?", "Philip Tomlinson", "Yes, for the remaining merchant.", "James Lipham", "Merchant.", "Greg Smith - Duncan-Williams, Inc.", "Yes. And what's the other revenues with Bank of America? You have the merchant's side, but then there's some additional revenues.", "Philip Tomlinson", "They're a very large commercial card client.", "Greg Smith - Duncan-Williams, Inc.", "Okay, and that business at this point is not at any risk?", "Philip Tomlinson", "No, we don't think so.", "Greg Smith - Duncan-Williams, Inc.", "Okay, great. And then just along those lines, you still got this sort of the JPMorgan Chase issue. I know it's a few years out, but any possibility you can size what that revenue is the amount of the license fee that they pay?", "Philip Tomlinson", "Greg, I don't think there is at this point, I mean it's not -- I don't think it's anything substantial enough that it would bring us to our knees or anything. I think it's something that we can handle when that time comes. So it's been slowing down year-over-year.", "James Lipham", "Yes.", "Philip Tomlinson", "Back then, it has slowed down over the years.", "Greg Smith - Duncan-Williams, Inc.", "So the actual pace, it's not just a fixed payment, every quarter same amount, it winds down?", "Philip Tomlinson", "No. Part of it is built on time and then built on size of the portfolio. I mean it's designed to be smaller towards the end of the contract, and we think we can handle that.", "Greg Smith - Duncan-Williams, Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. And then I apologize if you talked about this, but any comments about sort of the pipeline? I know international probably very robust, but in the U.S. specifically, how does the pipeline look for any new opportunities?", "Philip Tomlinson", "Well, I think our -- it's pretty interesting. Our prospects have really cranked up. I think we've got 14 million accounts or so that have signed during the process of being converted. But we are, I think I said this last time, for the first time in a while, we're starting to see people in the U.S. interested -- and when I say U.S., I really mean North America, which is a very positive thing. International is very active. We have a lot going on. We feel very good about our ability to sign new business.", "Greg Smith - Duncan-Williams, Inc.", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot.", "Philip Tomlinson", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Bryan Keane with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Bryan Keane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "I just wanted to ask about the North American revenues. I guess if you take out the term fees, or the $23 million in term fee or so, revenue was about flat, but transaction growth still grew up pretty nicely, up 12%. Just trying to figure out that delta there, and going forward, what should we expect in kind of North America for the revenues?", "James Lipham", "I think going forward, you going to continue to see them flat. I think the growth in the transactions obviously comes from some transaction mix that's inactive. I mean we talked about the Stored Value business that we had there but really, what we have is a lot of transactions that pertain to bundled accounts, what we call bundled pricing. And so you'll have probably 35% to 40% of the transaction growth within that group, which don't get any extra revenues for. So it comes a little less than the mix of what's going on, and where your growth comes from.", "Bryan Keane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Okay. And then on the International segment, I know you talked about margins will probably drop some there, but should we still see that type of revenue growth that we saw year-over-year, or something in that level?", "James Lipham", "It'll start dropping a little bit as you anniversary the initial conversion dates on those customers, but...", "Philip Tomlinson", "We do have several clients, good-sized clients that should be converted in the second half of the year.", "James Lipham", "But the mechanics for the first quarter with Japan and all, those will anniversary in different times during the year, but Phil mentioned 2 customers that converted. I think one of them was in the second quarter of last year.", "Bryan Keane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Okay. And then just last question for me on the operating margins, the first quarter kind of came in a little bit above than we were expecting. But just going forward, how should the margins trend kind of sequentially between 2, 3 and 4 quarters? Fourth quarter?", "Philip Tomlinson", "I really don't give guidance there on the quarters, but we've got our guidance out there. And I see -- basically where we are. I think you for the first quarter, we had a lot of expense control from when we looked at year-over-year stuff. When you look at what created the margin in the first quarter, it's pretty much indicative of our guidance.", "Bryan Keane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Right. The second half of the year, again, should be stronger, I assume than the first, because you won't have to at least jump through those term fees, but maybe you spent a little more on the expense side?", "Philip Tomlinson", "That's right.", "Bryan Keane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Okay. Thanks, a lot. Congratulations.", "Philip Tomlinson", "Thank you, Bryan.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Adam Frisch with Morgan Stanley.", "Adam Frisch - Morgan Stanley", "On the last call, I think you said you had about 14 conversions that were lined up. Just wanted to get an update there. Is this still the right number? I'm wondering if maybe the timing on some of these can offset the falloff in revs as the terminations/ deconversion fees ramp down and end after 2Q?", "Philip Tomlinson", "I mean, I think that you're going to have a little bit of ramp down in the second quarter because your termination fees are going to be less than half of at they were in this quarter. As we get through deconversion process, I know we have 3 or 4 still in progress in Europe and some to start. And I think all of those are going to contribute to a little more revenue growth to offset what you saw in the first quarter with the term fees. But I think as far as being in the range of our guidance on revenue growth, you shouldn't see any fluctuations quite bigger than that.", "Adam Frisch - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Sounds good. And then just in terms of this quarter, excluding reimbursables, you came in at the top end of the range in the first quarter, but didn't change guidance. Do you guys not see enough yet? I know, Phil, you talked about seeing a bunch of metrics that we're starting to look a little bit healthier. Can you just...", "Philip Tomlinson", "We don't think 3 months makes a trend. We looked at that pretty hard, and there's still a lot of issues going on out there with consumer, when you start thinking about price of food and gasoline and so many other things. And so we're hopeful that a trend is starting. And if it is, that's really good, and we're excited about it. But I don't think we're ready to declare that we want to raise guidance right now.", "Adam Frisch - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. No one's going to fault you for being conservative after what you had said so...", "Philip Tomlinson", "Thank you. We appreciate it[indiscernible].", "Adam Frisch - Morgan Stanley", "And then just one last question on Merchant Acquiring, being in the Direct Acquiring business now, this is a bigger initiative for you guys. Any chance of a conflict, or any kind of discussions you've had with the acquirers you already processed for? And then 2, when you're looking at acquiring assets, are they all in the direct model? Or would you consider ISO-based, or indirect franchises, I guess, that you're looking at as well?", "Philip Tomlinson", "Well, I don't think that we -- we were sort of the last holdout on the -- not competing on the Direct Acquiring business. And I think that bridge has been crossed a long time ago, and we have not had any real pushback that I'm aware of from any of our clients. I think everybody understands that. So we feel good about where we're at there. No, I think and on the M&A side, I think we're going to look at most anything that we think is high quality and has some growth potential, whether it's a good-sized ISO, or a tuck-in deal. We would like to find something substantial, I will tell you that. And we're in the market for that, and we've been in the market for that. And I do think finally, as I said earlier, things appear to be improving, and so we believe something will show up here that might make sense for us, hopefully, this year.", "Adam Frisch - Morgan Stanley", "Sounds good. Nice job, guys. I appreciate it.", "Philip Tomlinson", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "This is Steven Kwok filling in for Sanjay. Thanks for taking my question. We just had a quick question with regards to the operating margin. I know you guys don't give quarterly guidance, but I was wondering like over the longer to medium term, where you guys try to get the operating margin towards?", "James Lipham", "I think where we are today with the getting into the Direct Acquiring business, and where the margins are there, I'm looking at the 20% to 22% range on a consolidated basis.", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "And how long do you think it could take to get there? Is it over like 2-, 3-year period or...", "James Lipham", "Now we're there pretty much, I mean, on a consolidated basis, we are 20.1% marginal revenues for the quarter.", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "But to get to the higher end of the range, like you mentioned 20%...", "James Lipham", "We should be in the 20%, 22% range, as we get through year end.", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "Okay. And then in thinking about capital management, could you remind us how much capital you have? And are there opportunities that you see that's out there?", "James Lipham", "Well, the amount of capital we have, you see the cash on hand at the end of the first quarter, $252 million. We have a $250 million line of credit, so to speak out there, that we could draw down. We feel like because we have very little leverage on our balance sheet, that we could grow it a bit 2.5x our equity, and we don't see a problem with raising capital at this point. The market seemed to be very favorable.", "Philip Tomlinson", "We spent a lot of time here recently, talking to different bankers about how you would raise capital if you had a need to, and if we feel it's out there and we think our balance sheet is strong enough to get it fairly quickly.", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "Great. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Philip Tomlinson", "You bet.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tom McCrohan with Janney Capital Markets.", "Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Just looking at Page 8 of the slide deck that details changes in accounts on file and specifically, the $21-or-so million year-over-year growth in Stored Value. Well that's really great growth. I just wanted to confirm that last year there were some prepaid car purchase, I think that have adversely impacted the March 2010 account on filed number for prepaid. So I was wondering if there's any way for -- if you guys had it available to give us kind of a normalized year-over-year number for the growth in Stored Value account on file?", "James Lipham", "I don't have the numbers on what was purged off during the year. But I think -- I'd say that probably contributed some to that 21% growth, but we've seen a lot of growth over the last 2 months of that quarter end, one of our large customers and new programs that they have, and that may have been a little unusual. And I don't know how much it will keep up until we get through this second quarter but...", "Philip Tomlinson", "I do think that we are trying to find the norm for this Prepaid business. It's a business that has not historically been large. The numbers are now starting to become meaningful, and we've got 2 to 3 really, really large prepaid clients that really drive those numbers.", "Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "And so are you having increased dialogue with some of your bank issuers as they potentially explore issuing prepaid cards, and if you have any thoughts of them getting into that space?", "James Lipham", "We have had dialogue, and we do think that the banks, as time goes by, frankly, that's the reason we got into the Prepaid business several years ago, was we felt like the bank clients that we service would want to be in that business. That did not work out, particularly over the last 2 or 3 years. But we do think that they will issue more prepaid cards as time goes by. I don't think there's anything large as imminent right now, but we're having lots of conversations on prepaid.", "Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "And I guess my last question, Phil, your thoughts on the regulatory environment, specifically?", "Philip Tomlinson", "I think it's awful. I mean, if we weren't on a public telephone system here, I'd give you my real thoughts on it. But I mean, it's like it's trying to put us all out of business. This Durbin Amendment is a disaster. There's a lot of issues with Dodd-Frank. We just came off this CARD Act last year, which cost lots of money, not only for us to do it, but it cost our clients millions and millions in revenues. And I was telling our Board the last time we met, I just don't know where this is going to end. I mean, we just need some more relief from all these regulations. Our General Counsel is sitting over here looking at me funny, but I think it's a problem for business, period. And I'm sure it's a problem for you guys in the investment community.", "Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Do you have any thoughts on the Fed opining and finalizing Durbin on July, and do you think they're going to delay it further?", "Philip Tomlinson", "I wish I knew. I'm hoping that we can get -- or we can help get 3 or 4 more senators to come up, to get up for a vote against -- to delay this thing for a year or 2 to where people can really understand it. That thing is, in my opinion, was sort of past in the midnight hour, and I don't think anybody really understood what all was included in that Durbin Amendment. And I think as people have finally started to understand it, it's a pretty interesting coalition, that when you read all of the groups, and special interest groups that have out against the Durbin Amendment since people are really starting to understand what's in that bill. And we've said from day 1, it's a problem. It's bad for business. And I think we talked a lot about the law of unintended consequences, and this is a great example of it.", "Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "A few questions. I guess the first 1 is just sort of an update on where we stand with Carrefour, and I know that's been sort of a big issue in terms of the international margins, but when we may get some relief in terms of the margins and really, more importantly, when is the conversion going to be complete?", "Philip Tomlinson", "I was getting the latest date on that. That will be complete sometime between November and February. And honestly, I can spend an hour telling you the details of it. It's not an issue here. It's not an issue with Carrefour. We're in good shape there. It's an issue with the processor that had that business, and they've just been a little bit slow coming to the table, in my opinion. We think that will happen. It's just been a little longer than we had anticipated, and it represents a good amount of revenue for us. I mean we'd like to do it next week. But it's just something we're both having to work our way through. And there's no easy way to deal with it, other than just to grind it out, and that's exactly what we're doing. Jimmy, you want to talk about those margins again? I mean, we don't expect a miracle in the margins, but certainly, that would help.", "James Lipham", "It would obviously improve the margins quite a bit. But we're out into future years here for the real margin growth out of Brazil, as we -- as you know, got to get some scale out of that data center with some new business in addition to Carrefour and so...", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "And my follow-up to that was that the pipeline in Brazil that sort of bring on that second client and get some scale, what are the prospects?", "Philip Tomlinson", "Well, we've got some prospects, we don't have anybody signed. And I can't wait to announce whenever we do get someone signed. But I think the truth is, you've got a lot of people in Brazil sitting on the sidelines, watching this deal, see if we can perform. I believe that we will. I think Carrefour wanted to be as good a sales group as we've ever had. And a lot of our sales over our history has certainly been done through our clients. There's a lot of activity in Brazil. There's a lot of opportunities in Brazil. But again, this is a -- as I've talked about before, the sales cycle in this business is fairly long.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "And then Jim, you had mentioned in the quarter, there were some one-off items in International that helped the margins to get to sort of double digits that weren't necessarily sustainable. What were the sort of the order of magnitude of those one-off items?", "James Lipham", "Well, I don't have the actual dollar amount of all of them, but it's things like project revenues, it's things like processing charges or [indiscernible] adjustments and this type of thing that came into the quarter.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Okay. And then another question, just for Jim, and it relates to a prior question. Someone had asked about the long-term operating margins, and I guess I was surprised at your answer of 20% to 22%. I sort of look at North America in the high 20s already, and Merchant Services are reading in the 30s, and International, we know is depressed for some of the reasons we just talked about. But I think longer-term, you'd certainly talk about high-teens, if not higher. And you're already obviously in that 20% to 22% range so...", "James Lipham", "Yes. We are in the 20% to 22% range, but you've got to be -- watch when you're talking about revenues, operating margins. Our revenue before reimbursable operating margins in that 20% that with the revenue margins.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Okay. So what would it be if we could talk revenue before reimbursables?", "James Lipham", "It would be roughly 24%, 25%.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Okay, a big difference. All right. Thanks for clarifying that. I'm good.", "James Lipham", "Thank you for clarifying.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.", "First question is I'm glad you're buying stock back. It sounds like you got more aggressive on that. It sounds like maybe $1 million a month for the last couple of months of that quarter. What's the plan going forward?", "Philip Tomlinson", "Well, I think you'll see us continue to be active in that. This is 1 of the few times we have an earnings call before our Board Meeting. We've got a Board Meeting next week. We've got our Annual Shareholders' Meeting. But I think you'll see us continue to be in that market. We still have some room in the current stock repurchase program, so we're okay there. But I would hope that long term, you'll see us increase that number.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.", "Okay. And will that be taken up at the Board Meeting, expanding that authorization?", "Philip Tomlinson", "I couldn't tell you today.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.", "Okay. And second question is, I think, Jim, you were talking last quarter about $20 million of free cash a month, is what I recall. First of all, am I remembering that right? And second of all, is that still about right?", "James Lipham", "That's still about right.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.", "And then in the down arrow, in whatever the slide is, it's a very helpful slide, that includes price compression. Could you call out price compression a little bit for us? What specifically it was in the quarter, and is that deviating from history?", "James Lipham", "It is deviating from history because it's smaller. It is about 1% of that number.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.", "And I know sort of in the darkest days, it was 2-plus, correct?", "James Lipham", "Correct.", "Philip Tomlinson", "Right.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.", "And that's just a function of big deals already being renewed, I'm assuming. Or is there other stuff that's going on there that we should know about?", "Philip Tomlinson", "It's just basically renewals, and we've got a couple of competitors that I think are a little irrational with the pricing, but that's just part of this business.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.", "And can you just go through the merchant transactions down again? Jim, I think the way you explained it is there's sort of 2 parts, there's the BAMS part, which we kind of knew about, and then there's another client from whom you processed that loss to large client, is that the right way to think about it?", "James Lipham", "Well, I think the large merchant we lost was with BAMS.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.", "Okay, so...", "James Lipham", "We have had others, I don't if we've ever talked about, which ones they were but they are with TAS and they were sort of direct merchant point-of-sale process indirectly with TAS, and we did lose some point-of-sale traffic there. But the majority of that decrease was with that large merchant.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.", "And so going forward, on kind of a same store sales, it seems like that should be growing, or I guess if you take away sort of the noise, should it be growing similar to the other transaction growth you guys are seeing in different parts of your business, I mean high single-digits?", "Philip Tomlinson", "It should be, I think. It will get there.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.", "And then when did we see that sort of cleaner number, I guess? Or could you opine on that a little bit when we start to see the same-store, if you will, and the actual trends and the total trends, sort of converged?", "Philip Tomlinson", "You kind of wonder about the amount of growth that was really been attributed to BAMS, and I haven't really looked at that as far as year-over-year in the past, or quarter-over-quarter. And I think as we go forward, the remainder of the merchants that we have in that Point-of-Sale business will have a little tougher time, maybe of growing its rate of a larger organization with a good sales channel to it. So I'd rather not just put some number out there at this point and let's go through another quarter and see if we can really pinpoint what's going on with BAMS.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.", "Okay. And then last question is, the purges and the sales of some of the portfolio, the cards, that still seems high to me relative to where we are in the cycle. And again, if I recall correctly, there's lots of purges back in the day when the crisis was happening as a way to sort of reduce the payments people were having to make to you, I assume that would taper more quickly. What's the outlook for that?", "Philip Tomlinson", "I think we had about, I don't know, $16 million or so accounts during the quarter that purged -- since last year in that quarter, but that's just year-over-year. And that's in the consumer space. I don't -- we had the retails that hit us last year pretty much, and I don't see much going forward, maybe about $2 million more as we go out through the year.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.", "So the next number we should see should be more on the $2 million side, rather than the $18 million side?", "Philip Tomlinson", "Correct.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.", "Okay. And then last question, as you're looking at the same store sales, the new account growth, the accounts on file, are the percentages that we're seeing, the 7% and 10% respectively, the right way to think about that going forward for the rest of the year, or will that be a little lumpier?", "James Lipham", "You'll see -- we have 4% for the whole quarter. So I would think that you're going to see pretty much that same -- it's not going to be much different than that as we go forward.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.", "Okay. That's what I needed. Thanks for your time.", "Philip Tomlinson", "Thanks, Brett.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of James Friedman with AIG(sic)[SIG].", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "Just to clarify, I didn't change firms. I'm still at SIG. So I wanted to ask Jimmy that -- could you give us a little bit more detail on the accounts on file, because my recollection is and my memory maybe fading, but this Other category used to be composed into Retail, Debit, Healthcare. So if you could kind of reconstitute that and share what was the strength in the accounts on file in the Other category?", "James Lipham", "Basically, in the Other category, we had Debit. It's about 5 million accounts. That's what it was last year, that's what it was this year. So it only grew about 300,000 accounts. Healthcare did have a little growth there. They went from about 200,000 accounts, up to 900,000 at the end of March. The Other category, I forget what else what's in there, let's see, I guess...", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "I think Retail?", "James Lipham", "Yes, the Retail, which is I got it grouped in here with Consumer. But it's not on the schedule, but it is down there, but it was pretty flat after we went through year-over-year with the growth, I mean the deconversions, the purges that we put in there...", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "So the Stored Value increased about $7 million, is that primarily prepaid?", "James Lipham", "Yes, it is.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "Okay, so that continues to be a good category for you?", "James Lipham", "Good category.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "Okay. And then last thing is, I just want to get your perspective on mobile. Is that a good or bad thing for TSYS? And if so, why? Do you have an opportunity to be a processor on the mobile side, when and if it comes about?", "Philip Tomlinson", "I think we do have an opportunity to be a processor of some sort here with mobile. I think it's going to take some time to sort all this out as you have seen 10 announcements a day probably, of different things going on in the mobile business. But I think long term, as your mobile phone is able to affect a transaction, that's got to be good for us because I think it will just create more transactions, and more transactions equals more activity, which equals more statements and authorizations, and all the things that go along with that. So I think long term, it's going to be positive for us. We are working very hard to be a player in that business. It would be a good way for us to be able to clear a lot of transactions. And I think it's like a lot of new products. It's going to have to sort itself out, and there'll be some winners and some losers. And we think that we manage enough transactions to be a net winner in it.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "Phil, thanks for the clarification. I appreciate it.", "Philip Tomlinson", "Okay, thanks you.", "Operator", "And our final question today comes from the line of Larry Berlin with First Analysis.", "Lawrence Berlin - First Analysis Securities Corporation", "Quick question going back ways, when you're -- I think in Bryan's question, you were talking about Stored Value, and then you went to other transactions, I think you said bubble transactions, or are my ears just getting really bad as I get old?", "Philip Tomlinson", "I think you're starting to get old, buddy.", "Lawrence Berlin - First Analysis Securities Corporation", "I think I am, too, but it's the weather here in Chicago. But you talked about other transactions, some of which you said you get paid for -- extra revenue for I thought I heard and some of which you'd don't. And that was in talking about the mixed transactions in North America?", "Philip Tomlinson", "What Jimmy was talking about is, we have a couple of issuers that we -- it was more than a couple, I think he said 30% of our Authorization business, instead of charging by the transaction, it's more of a bundled price. In other words, you pay x and you get an authorization, and you get your transaction posted. And it's more of something that we did to be able to compete with some of our competitors around the world. So there's not an absolute direct correlation with transaction growth, equals x pennies of revenue growth. So there is -- part of that business is bundled, and you did say 30%, 35%, right?", "James Lipham", "Yes.", "Philip Tomlinson", "And so does that cleared up any for you?", "Lawrence Berlin - First Analysis Securities Corporation", "Yes, it does. Bundled, as it bubbles. I was at least close.", "Philip Tomlinson", "Well, it started with the b, so you've got part of it right.", "Lawrence Berlin - First Analysis Securities Corporation", "Yes, exactly. But that does cleared it up a little bit, and that does explain to me why there isn't a correlation. I appreciate it, gentlemen.", "Philip Tomlinson", "Thank you.", "Lawrence Berlin - First Analysis Securities Corporation", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we have no further questions at this time, sir. Do you have any closing remarks?", "Philip Tomlinson", "I do. One is, I want to thank you for being on the phone with us today. And I'm sitting here thinking what a difference a year makes. Accounts on file growth is up 10% this quarter versus down 17% in the first quarter of 2010. Transactions are growing again. We have become a pretty good-sized acquirer, as we've been telling you we wanted to do. We think we'll be a lot larger as time goes by.", "I think it's encouraging that our clients are engaging in new products and projects, and beginning to focus on growing portfolios again. I hope all of you are receiving credit card solicitations in the mail. I am. I think that's all good news, long term for TSYS.", "Now I don't think anything's a slam dunk any more. I mean no doubt, our economy and the government have serious challenges and issues to work through, but we do believe that better things are ahead for our industry in TSYS. So we're feeling better. The numbers are starting to bear it out, and so stay tuned. And we think we have more good news to come as time goes by.", "We appreciate your continued interest in TSYS, and if you have any additional questions, feel free to call Shawn in Investor Relations. I think all of you have got his number. And he is available 24 by 7. ", "Thank you for being with us today, and we hope to talk to you soon.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded today, January 24, 2012. I would now like to introduce Mr. Shawn Roberts, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Shawn Roberts", "Thank you, Michelle and welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter year-end 2011 earnings call. On the call today, our Chairman and CEO, Phil Tomlinson, is going to provide some highlights on the fourth quarter of 2011, and then turn it over to Jim Lipham, our CFO, who's going to review our financials. And after that, we're going to open it up for Q&A.", "As every quarter, I'd like to kind of talk a little bit about the Safe Harbor. The fact is we'll be making some forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS' actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in TSYS' reports filed with the SEC.", "At this time, I'd like to introduce TSYS CEO, Phil Tomlinson.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Thanks, Shawn, and good evening, everybody, and happy New Year. We're delighted to be able to share our fourth quarter and year-end results with you today. And as I was thinking about the call this afternoon, I really was thinking back to last year about this time when I told a story about after a Sunday dinner, hold on your fork because something better is coming. I held on to my fork, and I hope you did too, because something better is here. And I'm really happy about these results that we've had for the quarter and for the year.", "We met or exceeded the high end of our revised guidance, with total revenues up 7.3% for the quarter and 5.3% for the year. Our EPS was $0.31 for the fourth quarter, up 29.4% for the quarter and $1.15 for the full year, a little over a 14% increase.", "Our holiday season was strong, and our issuance segment with overall transactions, up 13% both in the U.S. and the international side. ", "Point-of-sale transactions and our same-client merchant segment increased 6% in the fourth quarter, and that's excluding the BAMS transactions. ", "At a macro level, it appears to us that consumer spending on credit cards increased as the year progressed, delinquencies continue to fall. And electronic transactions, in general, continue to show growth, and we're obviously very excited about that.", "I wanted to take just a few minutes to provide you with some metrics that we're very proud of, and I think they speak to the overall health of the company and long-term value to our shareholders.", "When you look back at 2011, our total shareholder return was 29.2%. We increased our quarterly dividend by 42.8%. Our return on shareholder equity was 17.4%; return on invested capital of 21.4%; return on assets of 11.6%; free cash flow of $340 million. We repurchased 6.6 million shares at a cost of $120 million, and we spent $214 million in cash on acquisitions, which I think all of those numbers are really impressive. ", "Over the next 18 months, we have a net of approximately 26 million accounts in the pipeline to be converted. Much of it is under contract today, and we're optimistic about the rest. And the dates are more of a timing issue. As you know, you get into the fourth quarter and you get to the Thanksgiving time frame, and it's very hard to get anybody to move forward with the conversion through the holiday season.", "I think all of this adds up to great results for TSYS and for the shareholders for 2011. And we believe this will continue to pay rewards into 2012 and beyond.", "I want to give you a brief update on our 3 reporting segments before Jim reviews the financial details and our guidance for 2012. In North America, our momentum continued with a solid fourth quarter and full year. Accounts on file were up 10.3% over the fourth quarter of 2010. And if you include prepaid accounts, they were up 18.5%. Same-client transactions were up 13% for the quarter and 12% for the year, representing 9 consecutive quarters of positive growth.", "Total transactions were up 13% from a year ago. It's the highest number of transactions we've seen since the 2007 peak. On a different note, I'm confident that many of you saw the Green Dot announcement today where they bought the assets of a non-operating payment processing company, a prepaid payment processing company. And as I understand it, their plan is to move their processing in-house over the next several years.  ", "I think it's really important to note that they concurrently extended the TSYS contract through August of 2014. Green Dot's a great story and is a wonderful client. We'll continue to service them as they move forward with this strategy.", "In 2011, our international segment had a good year as we expanded our geographic footprint. We entered Switzerland, Italy, Brazil, and overall, successfully implemented 14 different conversions. We continue to focus more resources to support the technology and services in these markets, which is positive for our current and certainly, for prospective clients.", "In Brazil, we're happy to report that we're in the final phase of the Carrefour conversion, and that'll be completed in February, next month, which starts just a few days from now. We certainly believe that there are many additional opportunities in Brazil to grow our business. It's the world's fourth largest credit card market. We're excited about that. And we are still -- we are very focused on adding scale and managing expenses, streamlining operations and cross-selling additional products and services to Carrefour today and future clients.", "In the merchant segment, overall, revenues, transactions and operating income increased. In 2011, we continued our focus on building the direct merchant acquiring business and had quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year growth in our small business and national merchant sectors, certainly assisted by our acquisitions.", "The decline in our indirect business or the processing business for the other merchant acquires is primarily from the BAMS -- from BAMS continuing to shift this business into their JV. We're very focused on building an aggressive sales force, who value developing long-term relationships with their customer base and building solutions that bring integrity and transparency to the industry.", "Now Michelle, I'd like to turn it over to Jim Lipham, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review the fourth quarter and the year-end financials and our guidance for 2012.", "James B. Lipham", "Thank you, Phil. Before we get into Slide 6, which is the OpEx slide, I did want to make comment about the balance sheet, as we've had a change from where we were last year. And if you'll note in there, the term loan that we have of $168 million under our credit facility is now classified as short-term, due to it being due for payment in December 2012.", "Just to let you know, we're currently looking at that. We're trying to make a decision of paying it all, extending it or enlarging it. As we go forward through this first quarter, we'll make that decision. So look for that news later on in the quarter.", "Getting to Slide 6. If you look at the left side, the quarterly results, you'll see some very good numbers there with our revenues up 7.3%, $32 million at $472 million. And the revenues before reimbursables, it's the first time ever we've been over $400 million, at $407, 683, up 9.1%. That's just outstanding numbers and good growth, and we've talked about it with the volumes that we've seen, good organic growth. ", "We did have some contributions from our acquisition of TMS Atlanta and also, Brazil being -- kicking in  revenue during the fourth quarter. So we've had some good growth there. Value Added Services, up. GP Net in Japan was a good contributor  quarter-over-quarter, so just some real good growth in our revenues for the fourth quarter.", "Operating income, up 26.4%. Obviously, good positive productivity going on here with expenses not growing as fast as revenues. See our margin for the quarter was at 22% compared to 18.98% last year during the fourth quarter, and that's an improvement of a little over 300 basis points.", "Income from continuing ops of 26.7% growth, just outstanding at $59.8 million. And as Phil said earlier, we were $0.31 a share, up 29% year-over-year. So some good double-digit growth in our net income, operating income and just great fourth quarter.", "If you look at year-to-date on the right, as Phil mentioned, our revenues, revenues from reimbursables were both a little ahead of guidance. We're up 5.3% on revenues, and then revenues before reimbursables were up 6.8%. If you took the termination fee out of 2010, these revenues before reimbursables would've been up 9.3%, which is pretty good growth. I mean, we're up $91.4 million in revenues, and we did have the remaining purchase of the First National of Omaha during this year, and they've contributed more.", "CTA was up about $16.8 million for the year, but it had likewise pretty much same increase in expense, affected operating income about $1.2 million. But TermNet acquisition is in here. Carrefour was in here for a good half of the year, and then GP Net, as I mentioned, earlier in the fourth quarter, they've contributed quite a bit for the year.", "Operating income is up 4.2%. Obviously, without the termination fee in 2010, it would be up the 16.5%, which is good double-digit growth also. Margin for the year, 20.9%, compared to the actual margin of 21.5% last year. But if you took the term fee out, last year would have been 19.65%, so we'd had a pretty good increase there of around 130 basis points in our margin year-over-year without the termination fees. ", "So net income attributable to our common stock is up 13.7%. It's in line with the high end of the range that we put out at $220 million. So all in all, very good year. $1.15 compared -- up 14% compared to last year.  So I feel real good about that. We'll talk about that, again, later and the good cash growth that we had. ", "So turn over to Slide 7. When we take a look at the makeup of our 6.8% increase in revenues before reimbursables, you'll see the various features of it. Internal growth is up 4.4%; new clients up 3.4%; acquisitions added, at 2.9%; and then currency's at 1.2%. A total of about 11.9% increase from these sources of revenues. And then we have our traditional lost business, nonrecurring items and -- which is termination fee and price reductions at 5.1%, as a negative, bringing it down to 6.8%. ", "I will say that lost business last year in 2010 was about a 10% reduction, so it's gotten better in 2011. Hopefully, we'll continue this trend as we go forward with a lesser percentage of our revenues going to de-conversions and price concessions.", "Flip over to the next page, and we'll talk about accounts on file and our makeup for the year. Each category in here has shown positive growth for the year of '11 over '10, which is outstanding. This is the fourth quarter in a row that we've seen growth in all these categories, and look at the subtotal line that's highlighted there. You'll see that these normal accounts outside of prepaid/stored value are up 10.9%, which is more in line with what you see in our revenue growth. ", "Prepaid is up 53.9% at 85.1 million accounts. And we've mentioned this before, that's a tremendous increase, but these accounts are less active than all these others are only about a little 8.4% active. So they contribute a total of about 2.7% of our revenues before reimbursables. So they don't generate quite the amount of revenue these others do, but they are growing quite rapidly.", "With that, flip over to the North America segment. Let me just touch on what went on there in the fourth quarter. As you can see, revenues were up $12 million at $246 million, up 5.2%. And the revenues before reimbursables is up 5.5%. Primarily as you can see, that the key drivers are strong organic growth, increased volumes that we talked about and just a solid growth quarter for North America in their revenues.", "I will say, if you go year-to-date, you'll see North America's growth is kind of flat, and it's mainly the new business that was put on with organic growth during the year helped offset all these revenues we had that we lost from de-converted customers, including the termination fees. ", "So talk about the quarter. The segment operating income was up 18.1%. Our margins before reimbursables at 31.8%, good growth. They increased 341 basis points over prior year. And then you look at the total cardholder transactions to the right, they're up 13.6% at 1.9 billion. Accounts on file, 351 million , up 18.5%, Phil mentioned. But without the prepaid, they'd be up 10.3%. North America just had outstanding quarter and a good year, overcoming the lost revenues they had.", "On the next slide, with international, you see revenues there. They're up 15.5% at $106 million. Revenues before reimbursables are up 16%. Obviously, the key drivers here, conversion of new clients and Phil mentioned that, that we've completed those conversions, there's about 14 of them, strong organic growth and the revenues there, so just good solid quarter for the international segment.", "Operating income at $12 million. That's up 61%. So we've have a good quarter, with the margins at 11.7%, when you look at revenues before reimbursables. And that compared to 8.4% for the fourth quarter of last year.", "The total cardholder transactions are up 11.7%. Accounts on file were up 14%. And then the same-client transactions are up 3.9%, so you can see that the growth in transactions came a lot from the new customers that came on board. For the quarter, currencies only added about $129,000 to revenues, one less to speak about, and affected operating income about $200,000.", "On the next slide is our merchant segment. Good growth here. Our lease revenues for the quarter were up 3%. Revenues before reimbursables were up 7.4%. And what the breakout here is that TSYS acquiring, as Phil mentioned, we've lost  contingency. BAMS moved off of the front end that TSYS is acquiring. And  so their revenues are down about $1.7 million. TSYS of Omaha is up about $1.7 million, and then you got the acquisition of TermNet, which is an acquisition. So that's pretty much the story there with the acquisition of TermNet contributing the most of the revenue growth. ", "Now the $100.4 million revenues before reimbursables, approximately 58% is transaction driven predominantly by TAS and our other indirect business  and 42% is from the direct merchant ownership, which we acquired with TSYS of Omaha and then TermNet. POS transaction volumes, as you can see up here, they did decline 1.6%. But without BAMS in there, as Phil mentioned, they were up 6.6%. So good solid growth there from same clients.", "Direct merchant ownership, as I mentioned, is driven by dollar volume and not transactions for TSYS of Omaha, its volume was up 3.3%. That's on top of losing one of their major merchants. And had they not lost that merchant, their volumes would've increased 7%. So very good growth there in the dollar volume for direct merchant ownership.", "Operating income was up 10.7% at $33 million. That's a margin of 32.8% on excluding reimbursables, and that's an increase of 97 basis points from where it was for 2010. So simply good about our acquiring business and the direct and the movement that we see in there. We will anniversary or continue see BAMS as we go forward, drop off about $10 million a year. You'll see that in my guidance -- in our guidance for 2012 in a minute. But good merchant activity.", "Next page is our cash flow. We had a very strong cash flow for the quarter. It was $137.9 million from operations and a $106 million of free cash flow. As you can see from the chart, we continue to generate good cash with EBITDA growth of $492 million. ", "Year-to-date, cash flow from operations are $436 million, and free cash flow was up $116 million to $340 million. So when you remember last year in the fourth quarter, we had some big payouts. We had the software acquisition of about $50 million, acquisition costs of about $44 million, so knocked that cash down, so we're back to where we are normally.", "So cash at the end of the quarter at $316 million. Phil mentioned that we had purchased the remaining 49% interest of TSYS Merchant Services or Solutions and purchased TermNet for $39 million. We also spent $120.6 million on share repurchases of the 6.6 million shares that Phil talked about, 2.4 million more acquired in the fourth quarter. So we finished the year with total outstanding shares of 188.5 million.  And that will be our start for the coming year. ", "We do have approximately 5.3 million shares still remaining to be acquired in our share buyback plan, and that will expire in April of 2013. So we have another year to work on acquiring those shares.", "And as we stated before, that's our way of running the business is looking with these excess cash and acquisitions first and then share buyback second. ", "So now as you flip to the page on guidance 2012, let's start with that. As you know, reimbursable items are pass-throughs, and we, as management, consequently, don't look at that as much as we do and focus on our revenues before reimbursables. And you'll see that we've got that forecasted growth, 2% to 5% in 2012.", "We have included in there our organic growth rates between 3% to 5%. It's on the, probably, the high end of that range. Currency rates, we're using about $1.60 for the pound and $1.40 for euros. I know that's a little high from what's been happening right now with euros. I mentioned to you, we do continue to see BAMS migrate off our systems in merchant segment with another $10 million of additional revenues to be lost in 2012.", "We do expect our operating income margins to continue to improve and be in the range of 21% to 24%, but we're anticipating about 150 basis point improvement there in the margins for 2012.", "Our earnings per share growth at 10% to 12%, positively impacted, again, by the income growth as well as the share repurchase program. And I mentioned that we have some shares remaining as we go forward. But earnings per share, $1.26 to $1.28, 10% to 12% growth, and that's the main things that we got in our guidance for 2012.", "Before I turn it back to Phil, I did want to mention, though, in our guidance for '12 that we, in an effort to concentrate on our current footprints in our international segment and in the opportunities to improve our long-term margins by achieving scale, we've dedicated more internal resources, which were previously shared with North America. But we've dedicated more of them to the international segment and the development of the technology and services that we need to sell to the international customers and potential new customers.", "So we did lose some resources. This focus is necessary in order to increase our array of products, as well as cross sell the Value Added Services and improve long-term margins. So on a consolidated basis, there are no new additional expenses. To reiterate that, there's no new additional expenses. What we've done is moved partially allocated people to fully allocated to our international segment. This comes out of North America. And as we could do this, we increased the margins in North America, as we decreased margins in the international. ", "But the other thing on the international front is conversions were being completed or have been completed in Europe and you heard Phil mention about 14, especially in Brazil, as well as in Europe. Over the past 2 years, we've experienced some shifts in expenses that we capitalized as these conversions were going on. ", "Until now they're being -- showing up in operating expenses. So the combination of that, the combination of allocating more resources directly to the international is going to push those margins down in the 5% to 6% range. But there will be gradual improvements as we get on through the year.", "And then again, this will not have a negative impact on our consolidated margin, which we noted earlier is in the range of 21% to 24%. So North America will improve and international will suffer a little bit as we go forward over the next couple of years.", "And again, we believe our strategy of presuming additional clients and offering more services to our existing clients creates a sustainable differentiation for us in these markets.", "So with that, Phil, I'll turn it over to you and for questions.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Thank you, Jimmy. And Michelle, we'd like to now open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Smith from Sterne Agee.", "Greg Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Just wanted to get your take on Europe and just any read-through from the transactions you're seeing as far as kind of the health of the consumer relative to maybe North America.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "We were pleasantly surprised in the fourth quarter at how strong the consumer was in the countries that we are in Europe. It was virtually the same as the U.S., as far as transaction growth. Greg, as you know, we are only in a few countries in mainland Europe or western Europe, if you will. And I think we were looking the other day, I mean, there's been a lot of discussions about the euro. I think, our revenues are about 4.5% in euros, as I recall.", "James B. Lipham", "That's correct.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "But we've been pleasantly surprised at how strong the consumer in Europe, at least in the countries that we're in, had performed in the fourth quarter.", "Greg Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Excellent, and good to hear. And then was there any significant benefit from the Durbin Amendment in the quarter? And if so how should we think about that on a go-forward basis, thinking...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "There was some benefit, but it was not substantial. And I think we priced our way through that and feel good about where we're at. But it was nothing material.", "Greg Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then lastly, what should we expect for the tax rate? And also, any color on the CUP Data, as far as how we should model that in 2012? Both of those would be helpful.", "James B. Lipham", "Greg, on the tax rate, we have finished this year about 32%. We're expecting anywhere from 33% to 34% next year. And there'll be some opportunities, I think, as we go forward with discrete items. We possibly could get it back down but what we've modeled is 33% to 34%. And then on CUP Data, what we -- we have 21% growth there in that equity line, and we had anticipated about 19% growth year-over-year. Some of the quarters got out of shape when we try to get them converted to GAAP between the third and fourth quarters of '10. But as you go forward, I think, I'm modeling in about a 16% growth year-over-year. And this is going to be -- the quarters will be more even than what we've seen before.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Barclays.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just first question on guidance. If you look -- take a step back and look at your fourth quarter top line revenue run rate, you're running in the 9 -- or you grew 9%, I guess, for revenue before reimbursables. It would obviously suggest a much higher revenue growth rate than what you've guided towards of  2% to 5%. And I know there's some moving parts. But can give us some color on what may be included in that guidance range? And also, I mean, maybe some color on the Capital One will contract? I mean, I think  that -- did the pricing change? Or any impacts from that contract already show up in this quarter?", "James B. Lipham", "Let me talk to the maps in growth in revenues and what we guided to. As you know, we had acquisitions, the TMS acquisition. We've had Brazil come in for a couple of quarters this year. And obviously, in the fourth quarter, you'll compare them back to the prior year when they weren't there. So it was kind of a strong quarter when you go year-on-year, when you factor in acquisitions. I think, going forward, the 2% to 5% that we have out there is a pretty strong number when you look at not factoring in any acquisitions, the anniversary-ing of those 1-year jobs are over and so...", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Maybe just help us understand what the organic growth rate was for the fourth quarter then. Would that be possible?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I'm sorry, we couldn't hear you.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just to give us a sense of the organic growth rate for the fourth quarter.", "James B. Lipham", "Yes, it was a -- hold on a second.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "While he's doing that, Darrin, the Cap One pricing was in the fourth quarter.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. So that already had an adverse impact on the -- I guess, relatively compared to...", "James B. Lipham", "I only have year-to-date here with me, Darrin. It was 4.7% for the year to date so...", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Say that again.", "James B. Lipham", "It was 4.7% for the year to date.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, all right. That's helpful. One question also, when you look at the guidance, I mean, you have revenue, I guess, before reimbursables versus sort of top line revenue. It's increasing something like, say, about 88%. In other words, your -- the revenue before reimbursables as a percentage of total revenue from customers is obviously up. Is that also just sort of deal related stuff? Or just can you help us understand them? Or is there anything we need to understand there around the moving parts?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I think it's deal related. I mean, the pass-throughs that we have that are very straightforward is postage and data lines and basically anything that we're paying for, it could be equipment, that we just pass through. But the vast majority of it, I think, you get to accurately assume is just postage.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And then last question on the guidance, if you don't mind. Just when you look at the range, it's kind of wide. I mean, 2% to 5% is -- I'd love to hear your thoughts on your assumptions to get to 2% versus 5%. I mean, how much macro sort of uncertainty are you baking in to the 2% number versus the top end of the range?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I mean, I'd speak to the macro part of it being it we had kind of held our guidance for organic growth pretty much; in line with where we finished up this year. And one of the things that could happen going forward is that you continue to see improvement. We don't know how much of this fourth quarter growth that we had was discount-related one way or whether these people are going to continue to exercise these cards like they did in the fourth quarter, then we'll probably have growth of 4% to 5% organic growth we have in there.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Got it. All right, that's helpful. Just last question for me, and I'll go back of the queue. On the free cash flow and sort of the capital structure questions, if you look at the amount of free cash flow you're generating right now, I mean, you have about $340 million that you said you generated for the year. Obviously, that's up from the $250 million you expected back in your investor day. It's up from $300 million you did last quarter. You still really bought back about $100 million of stock, and I know that you consistently say you're looking for deals. But I think we had the same question last year at the end of the year around guidance time, and maybe I'll frame it to you again this time now just as we go into 2012. What do you think, Phil, we should expect or we should really rely on before we start seeing more meaningful pickup in buybacks relative to getting a deal done, just timing wise?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, I mean, I don't know that I can give you a time-wise number. We've still got a little over 5 million shares we can buy back in this current repurchase agreement or I say agreement program that we have. We feel like we were fairly active in the fourth quarter. We certainly have always said, and we say this really every quarter when this question gets asked, that we'd rather invest our money in something that's going to add long-term value. And certainly, if we cannot find that, we would certainly go to the repurchase route. That may not seem like a huge amount of buyback to you. It's by far massive over anything we have ever done in the past history. But it's something we're looking out at. We're going to talk our board next week about where we're at in all of that. And I think you should always look to us to try to find something that adds value long term. And then on a secondary basis, if we can't get there, we'll go in and -- off the top of my head, and I shouldn't say this -- no, I'm not going to say it. I'm sorry. I might say that next time, Darrin. I was about to give you a number, but I'm not quite ready.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim Willi from Wells Fargo.", "Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just wanted to get a question in on sort of business development and pipeline activity. I apologize if you have mentioned it earlier. But could you maybe characterize -- I think talked about pickups and activity, customers looking at growing their businesses in the U.S., but also just curious what the sales environment and things look like in Europe.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "We did talk about it a little earlier, and we didn't talk about the current customers, but we did talk about our pipeline over the next 18 or so months of about 26 million accounts. And we're very comfortable with -- I think, we are seeing customers trying to grow their business. We're seeing customers acquiring programs. We also talking to various people around the country about large regional banks about reentry into the business. And particularly as these banks come out of TARP and they get healthier and healthier, I think that, I'll talk about it a little bit later, but cards is a very strong revenue and earnings product, and they all know that. And I think a lot of them are really -- kind of hate the fact that they've got out of that business and wish that they were back in it. And so we're starting to talk to a lot of people there. And I go back to what you heard me say 100x, is look in your mailbox. I mean, you're starting -- again, it started 6 months ago or so, 6 to 8 months ago, starting to see solicitations in your mailbox. We went 3 years and didn't see any. And a lot of those, the same banks over and over. But we're starting to see some different players in there, and I think it's becoming much more important, and they're becoming much more active. So we feel good about that. I mean, we have people that are asking us to work on a lot of special projects now. We went for 2 or 3 years and that was just they just didn't do that because everybody was watching every single penny that was spent. So I think we're optimistic on where we're at. We love -- I mean, 2011, we're very excited about the year. We're very excited about the fourth quarter and the trends that are starting to take place. The economy is still is a bit of a question mark, but I do think that it's a slow grind but it's grinding in the right way. And so that's a good thing.", "Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "How do you think about Europe from the sales perspective? And I'm also just curious for any insights specifically around how you think M&A will work out given that there's so many banks that do things internally or actually own processing businesses or cooperatives amongst themselves. Do you think we'll see a shift in activity one way or the other on either?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I do. I think that third-party processing is a very positive thing. I believe that even people who have thought that they had to do it in-house and have been through some very difficult times that they're  starting to look around and think that there may be a better model out there where they control expenses and know what is going to cost them and not get hung in things like the CARD Act and some of these -- the Durbin Amendment where -- the CARD Act, as an example, was incredibly expensive to do for banks who are processing in-house. Most of them were processing on older software. And it made it much more difficult. Our banks, that process with us. Effectively, they didn't pay anything unless they wanted some sort of special reporting or maybe their audit group or something like that, but I mean, went without a hitch. So we think there's a lot of very positive things happening that are good for TSYS. Now Tim, you know that any time you start selling, the larger the bank, it seems like the longer it takes, whether it's in the U.S. or Canada or Europe or South America, that process is not like going out and buying a new car. It takes months because it's a very complex process, and our prospect list is thick as it's ever been. When we win them all -- no, we won't win them all, but we will win more than our fair share.", "Operator", "Your next question was comes from the line of Brett Huff from Stephens Inc.", "John Campbell - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "It's John Campbell in for Brett Huff. So 2 quick questions here. Back to guidance, as it relates to 2012. Can you, guys, maybe just provide a little more color on your assumptions for the same-store sales and new account growth, maybe just where you're seeing the biggest opportunities?", "James B. Lipham", "Well, I mean, the biggest opportunity is in our organic growth in the commercial card consumer area. And our merchant area has got some good growth in it. So it's across the board, really.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "And John, I think, the idea that we'll be adding new business is very positive and this guidance is without any acquisitions.", "John Campbell - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. Lastly, you guys, touched on the Capital One renewal. But any commentary on any other large renewals might -- should be considering for the models?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "No, I think we're in good shape. We've got renewals going on all the time. But the Cap One was pretty high profile, and it was important, and we feel very good about that renewal. And I think we have a really good relationship with those folks there. They're a great client, and we love doing business with them. But we don't have anything -- I mean, we -- again, we have a waterfall report that comes out periodically that we know what we're working on but there's no -- there's nothing out there that\u2019s just giant, and we think we're in good shape with all our renewals. I mean, obviously, there may be some banks out there that are in worse shape than we think, but I don't think we're in trouble with anything that could make a difference. What I'll say, we're in trouble -- that the bank might be in trouble. I think we're in good shape with all of our clients.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I wanted to find out what -- Green  Dot, I think, Green Dot is one of your fastest-growing clients. I know you mentioned that maybe it's 1% to 2% of revenues. But in terms of them converting off your system, is that a steadily reduced revenue stream? Or is that sort of big bank conversion that we don't have to worry about?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "The truth is, we don't know. And I hate to speak for Green Dot, but I think they just acquired this company. They've signed a 2-year extension with us. And over the next couple of years, they're going to try to figure that process out. And what they would do, dribble it out or do a Big Bang, we honestly just don't know at this point in time. And I don't know what else to tell you, honestly.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Now I mean, that's -- obviously, as this progresses, we can talk about it later. But in terms of Cap One, going back to that, the renewal, did that price impact foresee sort of the potential for their portfolio acquisitions with ING, HSBC? I mean, when will they close it? Did they extend on the 12 and 18 months conversion on those?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "It's pretty public. I mean, our model is  volume-driven at certain tranches, and we've never publicized any tranches like that. But I mean, nothing would please us any more than for them to be successful in these 2 acquisitions they're looking at. They don't share that information with us, where they're at with that. But certainly, that would be very helpful.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "So you're not saying it's a done deal for you guys?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "No, no.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. The last question...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "When it's a done deal, we'll let you know.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Yes. So the last question is what is your implied organic revenue growth estimate for '12? I know you're not counting new acquisitions, but obviously, there's flow-through revenue from the ones that you already made.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "It's around 4.5%.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "4.5%. So from the 2% to 5% guidance that you gave you, what of that is organic versus not?", "James B. Lipham", "I don't know what the specific percent of that growth is organic. I don't have that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer from CLSA.", "Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "I just wanted to ask you a question about the U.S. environment post-Durbin. If we look at some of the big banks' reports and their trends in their purchase volume, we have seen some trend where debit has slowed growth, and credit has accelerated. I was wondering if I can get your thoughts on that whether it's you think it's specific to those major banks. Or has there been an impact from Durbin that has shifted volume due to the elimination of rewards or something else?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, as you know, we're not a big debit player or debit processor. But I mean, we do know of a lot of banks that have sort of started to push to credit cards. As I've said before, I don't expect debit cards to shrink. But I think there has been some of that, whether it's enough to make a difference, Craig. I mean, your guess is as good as mine. I think, it's probably going to take a little more time. A debit card is dramatically different than a credit card. And the utility is somewhat the same but it has different requirements as to how do you get one. We certainly are hopeful that a lot of transactions would be pushed to the credit card. I know all of mine did.", "Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Regarding your core business, obviously, the credit card, like you said, you have very little debit. When I think about the banks that have reported, what's clear is their yields might be trending a little lower because competition has increased dramatically. Does that portend additional future pressure on your contract pricing at some point when these contracts are up for renewal?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, I think that we are always under pressure. We have, I think, been very transparent about that over the years. We've always been able to hold or increase our margins over time because we're pretty good at becoming more efficient. But it was a lot of pressure in '08, '09 and '10. We've renewed a lot of contracts. We typically don't renew them very early unless there's something in for us. So I think you can count on -- I think, we have historically said, we'll get back about 2% a year, and I think we would like to probably stick with that estimate at this point.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank..", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Is that -- 26 million accounts, is that -- those are accounts ready to convert in the pipeline?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, we're working on some contracts. We feel good about them. Some of those on the contract, what you get into is this fourth quarter of 2012. And as I said earlier, you just don't get it. You just don't -- nobody wants to convert during that time frame, and so we pushed it out into part of 2013. And as I said earlier, our prospect for this is, I think, very exciting. I was looking at this morning. It's -- there's a lot going on. So we're pretty pumped about all of that. And I wish I could give you some names. As we get everything signed, we'll give you the names. I mean, you saw, I guess, Monday of this week, we announced BancorpSouth over at Mississippi. That was a good win for us, and we're certainly in the process of getting that finalized and getting it on the books. Not a huge win, I mean, but they're a great bank and great people and we're thrilled to call them a customer.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. But the 26 million does not include the prospect list? Just wanted to be clear. Or it had some prospects in there?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "No, no. Your head would spin if I added up that prospect list.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes. Well, it sounds like there's a few big fish in that prospect list. And if we can get them across the finish line this year, that could be some nice momentum.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Listen, we're dragging, pushing, you name it, trying to get them across the -- anybody across the finish line. People are talking again.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes. And then just looking at the guidance, I back into the number for fourth quarter for lost business, nonrecurring items and price compression, about down 3.1%, if you back into it. And then yet the guidance is for down 5% to 6%. So I guess, I'm trying to just be able to figure out what's the difference there. Obviously, Capital One sounds like it was in there for full quarter or it wasn't, and then maybe some of the BAMS business runs off.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "It was in there for a full quarter. I mean, obviously BAMS reduces each month.", "James B. Lipham", "Price reductions were about 7% for the whole year -- excuse me, not 7% but 0.7%. So you've got, like Phil said, we did have Capital One in the fourth quarter.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "But lost business for the year is about 2.1% of that 5.1%. Termination fees is about 2.3%. So it was a big termination fee that we had to overcome.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes. But what about the breakout of the 5% to 6%? Is there a way to look at that? Because that's just looks higher than your run rate is on the fourth quarter. So the question is, is there is some new things that you guys are planning on that's in that number?", "James B. Lipham", "Just BAMS is all that I'm thinking of. I mean, that's...", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So it's only BAMS? All right. And then just lastly then, can you just give us BAMS, how much has come off -- how much came off in 2011 and how much is expected in 2012 and maybe total impact?", "James B. Lipham", "It was just like what we said, it was about $10 million, and we anticipate it will do the same for '12.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And then total impact, is still about -- I guess, from start to finish for BAMS, it's, what, $40 million to $50 million, somewhere in there?", "James B. Lipham", "That's close to what it was, yes.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. Actually, let me sneak in. And then BAMS margins were lower than your overall corporate margins?", "James B. Lipham", "Correct.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Yes", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore Partners.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "A quick question for you on your EBIT margin outlook for 2012, can you bracket your expectations for us for North America, international and merchant?", "James B. Lipham", "We don't normally talk to that. I think we have our EBITDA number pretty much out there at around $492 million on a consolidated basis but...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "He said EBIT.", "James B. Lipham", "Well, EBIT is pretty much the same. I mean, it's not a whole lot different, I think figure the depreciation.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Can you give us some insight into what should we expect from an operating leverage standpoint international? It looks like that business is just starting to show some nice operating leverage and earnings are outgrowing what we're seeing in North America.", "James B. Lipham", "Yes, I mean, I think they were getting there. And as we have completed these conversions, we just felt the need that we really needed to expand some of our technological opportunities over there to build value added products and try to enhance the revenue stream that we currently have, as well as having products available in those areas to put new customers. And so consequently, we're going to penalize them a little bit on the initial start of 2012 as we moved some headcount folks in there that were partially absorbed in North America last year. So just from a standalone basis, you'll see a drop in that margin. But from a consolidated perspective, remember, we're not increasing expenses, we're just reallocating them.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Was that just for the first quarter, international?", "James B. Lipham", "No, we made a move for those people to be there as we go forward. It's longer than the first quarter.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I would say after this year, it's just on an upward spiral, spiral if you will. And you're looking at our international guidance -- I'm waiting for him to start shaking his head. Yes, he's smiling now. So I guess, yes.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "How material to revenue is finishing up the Carrefour conversion in February?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Now that's about, what, 1,200,000 accounts or something.", "James B. Lipham", "Yes, it's not that material.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "It's not huge.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Just final question...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "But just the fact that we will complete it and move those people off to something else and be done with it and it's -- we think that kind of it opens up the opportunity for us to start trying to sell to other folks. I mean, this thing has sort of been in -- one of those things is just sort of hanging out there on us, and we're thrilled to be finishing that up.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Is your strategy in Brazil to expand in private label specifically? Or do you see opportunities on consumer credit card?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I think it's both.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Anything near term?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Not that I'd be willing to talk about.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Just final question, Jim. You referenced an expected increase in the tax rate for 2012. But international has been outgrowing North America from an earnings perspective, maybe that slows a little in '12. But I guess, why would the tax rate increase so significantly in 2012?", "James B. Lipham", "I mean, the international is kind of small, as far as that goes. But I think our growth in North America is contributing a lot of that. And the reason why it's going up in the 33.5% or so range, I mean, we're hoping that we can come up with some things during the year with some discrete items that will push that back down, but it's mainly North America.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Julio Quinteros from Goldman Sachs.", "Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "It's actually Roman Leal in for Julio. It's really good to hear the positive commentary on the credit recovery, and I think it's pretty clear to understand why the appetite for banks to issue credit is coming back. But do you have any insight on what the demand for credit looks like? It seems like that's the missing piece of the puzzle here, just given consumer deleveraging and then some pretty high APRs.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Yes, I mean, I don't know that I have any great insight on it. You're reading the same things I'm reading. I mean, we've finally started to see some banks report besides the really huge ones. And there's some demand picking up. But I think that the beauty of the card business, it's a very high margin business, and a lot of the bad debt has been flushed out. And we're starting to see people come back to the cards and use it. As I said earlier, there was a time there when uses dropped off so bad that we went negative on transactions, and that's never happened in our 40-year history.", "Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Sure, okay. On the merchant acquiring side, just give me your focus on direct side there. And you made some commentary on beefing up the sales force on direct side. How should we think about your buy versus build strategy going forward?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, I think you should probably think about we will buy. We're building, but we're certainly in the market to buy. And there are some properties available, and we run into a few that didn't get sold or didn't get bought by anybody because their price expectations were just too high. And I don't know if that's going to improve or not. Only time will tell. But we're certainly are in the build and buy side of that business.", "Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then just last 2 quick questions on the outlook, one on the Green Dot announcement. Just to make sure we're clear here. You said it was basically 1% or 2% of the existing revenue base of 2012.", "James B. Lipham", "Yes, it's about 1% of our revenue stream and revenues before. As Phil mentioned, we did extend the contract for 2 years. So it's not going to be material. If they go ahead and move things off, I'm sure it will take a while to do that.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I think, though, to be clear, they have every intention of doing that. Now they're going to have to go through this process and look at that software package and see what it takes. And of course, they've been a great client. We want them to be happy.", "Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Right, right. And then is it pretty safe to assume that with a little over 5 million shares left in the buyback, you'll use up that before or through April?", "James B. Lipham", "I'll say if we don't have an acquisition, we'll use some of it for sure.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "So just wanted to circle back regarding a couple of earlier questions. I know there was some questions about organic, percent organic, et cetera. If -- I'm just looking here at Slides 7 and 14, which contrasts your 2011 with your 2012 guidance. If we're looking at the numbers right here, it would seem to me if you take out acquisitions and currency, you guys are basically saying that growth will be just as strong in '12 as it was an '11. Am I reading that right? Or anything else we're missing there?", "James B. Lipham", "I guess that's pretty close to it. I mean, we don't know that we're going to get that many of new clients. But then again, you got organic growth, that's going to be pretty strong at 4.5%,. You can make that assumption.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Right, right. Okay, that's helpful. I don't know if I missed this earlier, but did you guys give free cash flow outlook for 2012?", "James B. Lipham", "We did not. But we're comfortable it's going to be in the $20 million to $25 million a month range.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So basically, if we think about it...", "James B. Lipham", "About $275 million, $300 million.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Yes, okay, okay. So you're down a little bit year-over-year. Is that just timing on the working capital side? Or is that CapEx?", "James B. Lipham", "I imagine it's more CapEx. We were pretty low this year.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, okay, got it. And just an industry question for you guys. There's been some chatter in the marketplace, one of the potential outcomes regarding the ongoing merchant litigation versus the banks and the networks could be elimination of the networks and no surcharging rules. If that were to occur and merchants were allowed to surcharge consumers, what do you think the impact would be on the marketplace?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, I don't think it's good for the marketplace and pretty interesting. I think there's already a lot of surcharges out there. I bought gas, Sunday, out on the Interstate 85, and it was like $3.31 for cash and $3.37 or something like it per gallon for credit. But I don't think any of these new regulations are good for the business. I think there's a lot of folks that may think that a lot of that gets passed back to the consumer. We haven't seen it, and we haven't read very many cases where anything gets passed back to consumer. But I read something yesterday or this morning that should that happen, I mean, I think probably the consumer would just get less rich products. And I don't know that they truly understand that, but time will tell.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of David Scharf from JMP Securities.", "David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "I hope these questions aren't redundant. But back to the international margins front, I just wanted to make sure I wrote this down correctly because I think in your prepared remarks you commented that sort of the diversion of assets, internal resources, to international will take operating margins down to 5% to 6% for the year? Was that correct?", "James B. Lipham", "That's correct. That's part of it. The other part is that as we're doing these conversions, like Carrefour and the like, we have to get capitalized expenses. And once these conversions are through, those capitalized expenses turn into operating expenses. And what you've got to do at that point is you got to get some scale going pretty quickly or you're going to have a lower margin like we've got going well on that now. As these things turn from being capitalized to operating expense, 2 things.", "David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Just segment reporting, when I think about that full year profitability level, will international be profitable in the first quarter? I mean, is this something that's going to make breakeven and ramps to 10%, 12% by the end of the year? How should we think about the absorption of those assets?", "James B. Lipham", "They'll be profitable. We'll start those expenses right there. I mean, you'll see them show up as far as the reallocation in the first quarter. As far as the conversions, those are completed expenses that have started and they should be pretty much even through the year, I mean, on this margin. I think it could improve a little bit by year-end, in the fourth quarter.", "David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And on the pipeline of to be converted -- signed but to be converted and implemented, the 26 million, I think I have written down in Q3 that figure stood at 12.5 million. And I don't know if that 12.5 million went down from the number of Q4 implementations. I'm just trying to get a sense for sort of Q4 sales activity, kind of what was booked or signed this quarter because it sounds like they have been as much 20 million new accounts.", "James B. Lipham", "We're not in a position to go through the details of it, plus I don't have the third quarter nuts and bolts with me.", "David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "Got you. That's fine. And then that's about it, I guess. Well, one last thing. I assume that just based on the nature of prepaid accounts, the...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I'm sorry?", "David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "I said I just want to confirm. I assume based on the nature of the prepaid accounts, the lack of activity and so forth, Green Dot well maybe 1% of revenue. I'm assuming it's even less amount of operating profit.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I don't -- I can't answer that.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "This is actually Steven Kwok filling in for Sanjay. The question I have was with regards to seasonality. Aside from the movements in the operating margins on the international and the North American side, how should we think about the EPS on a quarterly basis? Should we expect it to kind of steadily rise? Or are there ups and downs due to seasonality?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "We don't do it -- we don't provide that guidance on a quarterly basis. I mean, there's obviously some seasonality with holidays and summer vacations and back-to-school and all of the things that you would normally think. But we've never tried to provide it by quarter.", "James B. Lipham", "And I think,  if you look back at our history, you'll see what's been going on for the last couple of years, and that rolls from quarter to quarter. It's pretty much self-explanatory there.", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Sure, sure. And then I know that you said that within the guidance there isn't any acquisitions baked in. I was wondering. How about on the share buyback fund, are there baked in with regards to that?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Not at this point, no.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Robert Dodd from Morgan Keegan.", "Robert J. Dodd - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division", "A question on the international side. I mean, obviously, you talked about the pipeline except that we hear Carrefour, it's coming online, shortly. Just how much do you think there is some pent-up demand in terms of your prospect list or however you want to characterize it? How many of you guys are kind of lining up watching Carrefour to see how that goes in Brazil? And what potential prospects that you think you could see -- or do you think you could see something of a -- I don't want to say tsunami or anything like that even though I just did, but could you see a significant pickup in activity in that region if Carrefour goes well?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I guess you could say, sure you could see that. I don't know if that's accurate. I think that the idea that we we'll finally have this conversion behind us and we've explained what the issue was there on several occasions. We just couldn't get the data. I do think it will put us in a much more enviable position to be able to sell into that marketplace. Now I wish there would be this landslide, but typically, this business doesn't operate that way. We have to pick them off one at a time. And whether it be in Brazil or U.S. or Canada or Europe, I mean, we just kind of look at it one on one. And we sticking to the basics at this point.", "Robert J. Dodd - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. Just lastly, on Cap, obviously it should be less volatile from what you've said in terms of the contribution this year. Can you characterize how much of that was from the reconciliation to GAAP versus is there some volatility in that business? Or is there a lot of short-term project work and it's just, by nature, a volatile business? Or is it just the accounting changes you had to go through with 2011?", "James B. Lipham", "I mean, it's really the accounting changes. I mean, we've been saying for the last couple of quarters that look for these guys to grow 19% year-over-year. We came in at 21%. So they're pretty much in line. They've got a great business that's growing, and we're looking at a 16% increase next year.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "This year.", "James B. Lipham", "In 2012.", "Operator", "And there are no more questions at this time.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Thanks, Michelle. And I thank all of you for your questions. I'll take just a few minutes and close this out. We tried to answer everyone's questions. ", "And I hope you can sense our growing optimism. Our belief is that the economy will continue to inch forward and recover and that consumers are feeling better. And as you know, we are, by far, the largest corporate card processor also and the businesses who are out using their cards. And I think if we see that by the increased spending there in the holiday season, and I think, people or consumers are actually demonstrating more control over their financial destiny. We believe the card business is one of the more profitable products in any financial institutions' quiver of things that they can offer. And that they're, in so many ways, a necessary extension of the relationship that FIs have with their customers\u2019 base. Pay with plastic, and I've said before, use yourself as an example is one of those things that this is just what we do. And whatever the type might be, whether it's commercial or consumer or debit or whatever, it's a great payment tool of choice based on speed, security, convenience and just overall, general utility of the card that we've all become accustomed to. And in '12, we are placing an increased focus on product innovation. We just created a global product strategy team. We brought some great talent in, and they're going to enhance the offerings we currently have and offer. And we believe we can drive new products into new markets and new verticals really, around the globe. We'll continue to, obviously, to keep a sharp eye on expenses. It's just something that we have all got to continue to do. It's important. And I think when you step back and think about how difficult the past few years have been, especially since the great majority of our clients are banks, which have been negatively impacted by things like the CARD Act and overdraft pricing and Dodd-Frank and the Durbin Amendment and the real estate and mortgage crisis. And billions have just been taken out of their revenues streams, and of course, when the banks suffered, we suffered. We've lost several top 5 clients during that time. But on numerous occasions, you've heard me talk about the core strength of TSYS. And we believe we've got a fortress balance sheet, and that's the term that gets used a lot, but we believe we've got it. We've got a very strong free cash flow. We've got a recurring revenue model with strong organic growth. We've got improving operating margins. We've got long-term contracts with blue-chip clients. We've got the gold standard in technology, and we've got the will to compete and to win. In TSYS, we operate on 5 basic core values: integrity, relationships, excellence, innovation and growth. And we have operated with those 5 values since day one. They've served us well in the U.S., and it's pretty interesting, they have certainly served us well in every country that we've entered over the past 10 or 12 years. They are universal values that people appreciate no matter where you're at. And of course, last but not the least, our secret weapon, our secret sauce is our team of 8,300 strong people. Throughout this recession, they've been totally dedicated to our clients through thick and thin. Their work ethic has been as strong as ever, and they've consistently delivered as asked. They demonstrate a real passion every day for excellence with our customers.", "Now we realize we're not out of this great recession. But I can tell you, it feels great to deliver good numbers for 2011 and double-digit EPS guidance for 2012. I told somebody earlier today, I feel like we kind of got our mojo back, and I look at it this way, we touch someone's life or business about 48 million times a day, and we do it right. And with that, I want to thank you for your interest in TSYS and your time this evening. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to call Shawn Roberts in Investor Relations.

Factors that could cause TSYS' actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in TSYS' reports filed with the SEC.", "At this time, I'd like to introduce TSYS' CEO, Phil Tomlinson.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Thank you, Shawn, and good evening, everybody. I'm excited to share the report of the first quarter results, which were really good, as you've seen in our press release. The key metrics that we used to measure our business exceeded our expectations, which we believe is a direct reflection of an economy that's picking up the pace of improvement, at least in our business. While one quarter doesn't make a year, we think it's a good start.", "Results were positive in EPS, revenues and net income for the quarter. EPS was $0.30 for the quarter, an increase of 18.6% over 2011. Revenues were $461.2 million, up 7.4%. Revenues before reimbursables were $395.2 million, an increase of 9%. Operating income was $84.8 million, up 16.2% over the same quarter last year.", "At the enterprise level, we saw healthy increases in transactions, both on the issuer processing side, as well as increases on the acquiring side, in the processing and the direct acquiring. Same client issuer transactions for North America and international combined were up 14.4%. Excluding deconverted accounts, same client point-of-sale transactions in our indirect acquiring business were up 11%.", "Sales volume for our direct acquiring business was up 20.9% over the same quarter last year. And looking at the economy from a macro level, we see continued healthy decline in both credit card delinquencies and charge-offs quarter-over-quarter. Charge volumes on credit cards have trended upward over the past 3 quarters, which, again, indicate improved consumer confidence, and we see a renewed interest among our issuers, in particular, in offering new credit cards and new products.", "As you know, the unemployment rate slowly continues to decline yet the job market and mortgage situation still remains pretty fragile, and consumers continued to carefully manage their finances. ", "I want to take just a few minutes and give you a brief update on our 3 reporting segments before Jim gets into the financial details.", "First, let's take North America. We had some strong wins this quarter, and you may have seen today's announcement that we signed Huntington bank for issuer processing. And we're also happy to report that we recently entered into a long-term issuer processing agreement with Regions bank to be their payments partner as Regions reenters the credit card business or the card business in general. And we'll be converting that portfolio that they've acquired later this year.", "We continue to win in the regional banks sector as more of these institutions look to credit cards as a business driver and really a necessary product for their customer base. Also, during the quarter, we successfully completed the BancorpSouth's consumer credit, commercial and debit card portfolio conversions.", "On international, we're delighted, and you saw the announcement, I hope, Monday afternoon, that Royal Bank of Scotland has extended its issuer processing relationship with us. Our relationship for the U.S. business has been extended for 13 years and the U.K. business for 12.5 years, taking both of them out to the 2025 range. RBS has been a client of TSYS since 2001, and our first client in the U.K. or Europe, and is a real anchor tenant for TSYS, and we couldn't be more proud of this relationship and this extension.", "Post the Carrefour conversion, the reaction in Brazil has been very positive. We've had some interesting -- we have some really interesting prospects in this market, which continues to see good economic growth. Our joint venture with CUP Data in China UnionPay had a strong finish in 2011. We expect to see an equally strong performance in '12, which is worthy of mention and is a noted addition to our net income.", "In the quarter, we saw growth in our license business, with upgrades to, and the addition of several new banks to our PRIME 4 card management system in Africa, Europe, the Middle East and in Russia.", "On the merchant side, we saw overall growth across the indirect and direct merchant business. Total revenues were up 8.4%, primarily attributable to higher transaction volumes.", "In our indirect acquiring business, we won 2 new contracts for authorization and capture service, one with Merchant Warehouse and the other is a top 45 ISO, which moved from a competitor. In addition, we signed BluePay for back-office clearing and settlement services. We extended full service contracts with Veracity and First Hawaiian Bank and extended a clearing and settlement agreement with Maneres [ph].", "We also signed a National Account business of Aflac, the insurance company, who is our neighbor here in Columbus, so that their agents can accept cards for insurance premiums.", "During the quarter, we entered into 7 new partner agreements with value-added resellers, financial institutions and associations that are now referring new small businesses to us for their payment acceptance needs.", "I also wanted to share some 4 significant awards or recognition that we have recently received that we're really proud of.", "In March, TSYS was recognized as one of 2012's most ethical companies by the Ethisphere Institute, which is a leading business ethics think tank. This week, we were notified by FORTUNE magazine that we have now moved into the Fortune 1000, which is a real high watermark for us. In April, Visa awarded TSYS 2 service quality awards for our timeliness and authorization responses and our system uptime. TSYS is the only multinational payments processor to receive this recognition from Visa based on 2011 performance. And also this week, we were just recognized by the Military Times EDGE Magazine as one of the top 40 companies for veterans in America.", "Now I'd like to turn it over to Jim Lipham, our CFO, who's going to review the details of the quarter's financials. Jim?", "James B. Lipham", "Thank you, Phil, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we get into the operating results in more detail on the segments, I want to touch base first of all on our credit facility. As I mentioned last quarter, we were looking at it as to whether we will go renew it, pay it off or whatnot.", "So just where we are today, we worked hard during the quarter, but we're still looking at a new credit facility, and we're trying to determine the appropriate size. We think it's going to be a little higher than what we had. And we're choosing the lead and we expect to complete it in the second quarter. So we'll have the results of that at the end of the next quarter.", "Now going into the quarter, as Phil mentioned, we were very excited about the positive trends, both that we saw in our revenue growth, as well as our volumes in all 3 segments. And we did a good job in all 3 segments of maintaining our expense growth, keeping it down, showing positive productivity and, thus, having a higher growth in our operating income than we saw in revenues.", "Now on the first slide, on Slide 6, which is the consolidated results for the quarter, Phil mentioned revenues were up 7.4%. Revenues before reimbursables are up 9% or $32.5 million. Of that amount, North America contributed 39% of that growth. I'll get into more of their detail in a minute.", "Merchant segment was up, that represented 33% of that also, and international was about 28%. So we had some good growth in revenues, operating income was up $11.8 million or 16.2%. We showed a 1.5% increase in our operating margin before reimbursables, up to $21.5 million. So just had an outstanding quarter and organic growth as you'll see in minute was up 7%.", "We'll flip over now to the second slide. You'll see a breakout of our 9% growth in revenues before reimbursables. Internal growth\u2019s up 7%. It\u2019s a little higher than what we had anticipated at the beginning of the year. But then again, we had some one-time revenues this quarter, as well as a leap year day, which is one extra day of processing. And so it contributed a little bit of that, too. So new clients up 4.2% and acquisitions 1.5%. And currency was minor down 3%. But all total, that was about 12.4% of growth there, which we had, that was offset with 3.4% for the lost business and price concessions and some nonrecurring items.", "The price concessions, which not a lot of folks like to -- is about $6 million or represents about 1.6% of this number. So that's kind of in line with what we've been experiencing and what we thought we'd have for the year, so no surprises there.", "On the next chart, we go over our accounts on file summary. And as you can see, accounts on file totaled is up 16.6%, which ties into what we saw on our transaction growth Phil mentioned a while ago.", "But then again, you go back up before prepaid and store value, and you'll see we're growing 11.2%. Every category of our account segregation here is showing growth. This is the fifth quarter in a row that we've shown growth and just speaks volumes for what you're seeing in the market today, with all of our financial institutions growing their portfolios.", "Currently, we have about 33 million accounts in our pipeline. We expect to see these numbers continue to grow as far as adding accounts year-over-year. And then again, prepaid continues to grow, but not quite at the same pace it has been growing but still at 42%. And we are still seeing about 7% of that -- of our prepaid accounts being active. So just less than right around 3% of our revenues and still waiting for the activity in those accounts to really pick up.", "The next slide. We get into the North America segment. You can see the drivers there, the organic growth, increased volumes. Revenues, excluding reimbursables of $204 million. They're up 9.5% or -- excuse me, $9.5 million or 4.9%.", "Biggest contributor of that comes from our transaction growth, account on file authorization and fraud services, which is our electronic payment processing fees.", "Outside of that, we had managed services. It grew pretty strong. It's mainly our Canadian operation with the new business we put on there at the end of last year and the new call center business that we have up there.", "Operating income, up $13 million or 23.5%. There again, it shows that the expenses grew at a less rate than revenues to contribute that kind of growth in operating income. If you look at our margins at 33.4%. You see they\u2019re up about 500 basis points from where they were last year and if you remember, we had the realignment in December we talked about, where were moved about $6 million worth of expense from North America to international.", "If you adjusted our expenses for that, North America will be at about a 30.4% margin as to the 33.4% and be up only about 200 basis points. But still, overall, good growth in our margin there. Accounts on file at $361.8 million, it's up 16.9% and, as we said, good growth there.", "Same-client transaction is up 15.6%. It's pretty much mirroring what you see in North America as far as total transition growth is. Last year, you remember, we had a lot of growth in new clients from the international sector. Overall, North America\u2019s very strong.", "Next slide is international. Some good organic growth also. Conversion of new clients that we put on last year. And then, of course, we've had the dedication of these resources. But revenues, excluding reimbursables, is up $9.1 million or 10.4%. Big portion of that is electronic payment processing, which is all of our accounts on file transaction volumes. We will make note, GP Net, in Japan was up $2.8 million, which was a good growth for them, 25% growth in revenues, as they continue to show good expansion.", "Managed services in international was up by $2.3 million. So it was a good contributor also. Operating income was $4.1 million. It is down 62.7%, and as a result mainly of this new dedicated resources to international. If you took those out, they're operating margin will be up about -- will be around 10.6%. So we do anticipate this to continue to improve as time goes on, and we'll get the margin back up as we get later on in the rest of this year and next year.", "Same-client transactions at 8.4%, they're at $352.7 million. The accounts on file at $54.1 million, they're up 14.6%, showing good growth as a result of acquisitions -- I mean, new clients that came on board during the year last year that were not there at the first part of the year.", "Currencies had a very little impact on us on the operating income line. It was only about $176,000. Although it didn't [ph] make about $1 million decrease in revenues for the quarter. But international sales showing some good growth in revenues and look forward to getting on top of those expenses and getting the margin back up.", "Next segment is our merchant segment. You'll see the acquisition of TermNet is in here. They were not here the first quarter of last year and that represents about $4.6 million of this revenue increase of $11.8 million or 13.7% on the revenues before reimbursables.", "TSYS of Omaha represents about $7 million of the increase. It's all higher transactions, volumes, compliance fees, income tax reporting and a very small amount had to do with Durbin. Partially offset by the deconversion going on with BofA has held down our transaction growth on the TAS side. We\u2019re only representing about $800,000 pickup there in those revenues.", "But of the $94.8 million, about 60% of it is transaction driven, and obviously, that's predominantly TAS, our direct business, and 40% is  direct merchant ownership.", "On the POS transaction side, you'll see the note there, without the deconverted class, it'd be up 11% instead of 1.1%. So we had pretty good growth when you consider taking out the deconverted customers and effects they had.", "The direct merchant ownership is driven by dollar volume, and for TMS of Omaha, this volume increased 20.9% over what it was for the first quarter of last year. Operating income is up 27.1% at $34.2 million, and our margin before reimbursable was up 367 basis points over last year, and it\u2019s at 34.8%. Good volume growth there and some good margin improvement, and we continue to see growth in the market from sales and the macro environment, I guess, of people buying. So we look forward to continuing to see that during the year.", "Last slide here is the trailing 12-month cash flow and the strength that we have. We did have cash flow during the quarter of $98.1 million from operations. Free cash flow was at $81.3 million, and you can see the cash flow from operations of $432 million. EBITDA was $503 million and then $338 million in free cash flow.", "We did finish the quarter at $371 million in cash. That's an increase of about $55 million since year end and obviously, driven by operating activities, less dividends and debt payments.", "We still have 5.3 million shares in our plan to buy back stock over the next -- over the rest of this year and we are planning on deploying that capital through acquisitions and share purchases as we have done in the past.", "We have been busy during the quarter, like I said, on M&A front, looking at some direct acquiring opportunities. We still are looking at some, and that's the main reason we are not buying back any stock although we've had a pretty good quarter with our stock appreciation since the first of the year. ", "But with that, Phil, I'll end my comments and turn it back to you.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Thank you, Jimmy. Vineda, we can open it up to Q&A now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Let me just start off on the Merchant Services line, again. I know we touched on this. I think you touched on it during the call or Jim, maybe I think you're the one who got a little more detail into it. Can you give us some more idea exactly what drove the big numbers there? I mean, the top line number for the Merchant Services was little a bit -- or meaningfully, I should say, above our estimate. I think you mentioned TermNet, but that's been there for a little while now. And transaction growth was a little better than we thought, but was there anything going on? Was Durbin a bigger part of that revenue number than we maybe anticipated?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Not really. I mean, TermNet has been here for a while but they were not here in the first quarter of last year. And then you've got 20% growth in your dollar volumes, which is creating some good dollar volume there. Appliance fees, there were some new fees that were implemented that obviously will anniversary off here pretty soon. But there's not -- I mean, it's just good volume growth.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And then, I mean, on the cost of service line, I mean, that was also a little bit higher, such that the benefit we're seeing off the higher Merchant Services didn't really pass through, I mean, to your -- to the bottom line, I think as a result of the cost of service being a little higher. What was the driver there?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, a lot of that cost is volume driven, obviously, with the TAS accounts. But when you say it didn't get to the bottom line, our operating income did grow a lot faster than our revenue did as far as a percentage but...", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Right, I mean, I guess this is versus our -- the Street's estimate or our estimate. All right, just another quick question, on the overall business mix, I mean, the underlying drivers in North America are still very, very strong. I mean, we're seeing a lot of the issuance among the card industry, obviously, help quite a bit. Accounts on file growth very strong. Processed transactions growth up again in the teens, mid-teens. Yet revenue growth is still -- it's good, but it's obviously only in the mid-single digits versus your teens kind of growth rates in the underlying drivers. I think last couple of calls, you've mentioned pricing being a point or so and capital I know had a renegotiation, it wasn't that impactful. What is -- can you just explain, really, the major delta between what we see in these underlying growth drivers and the actual revenue growth? I mean, understanding that some of the merchant [ph] prepaid as part of it?", "James B. Lipham", "I think you're looking North America, the 9%. We had about -- lost business was about 2.5%, so that made it about 11.5%. And then price reductions were about 1.6%. So I mean, you get close to the 13%, 14% growth without those 2 items. So you still got that in there. You remember ABN AMRO's leaving us.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Is that -- that delta, should we expect that? I mean, is there anything anniversary-ed in there, we should expect the gap to narrow to some extent over time in the near term?", "James B. Lipham", "Not sure about the lost business off hand. But I think price reductions, we'll see pretty much the same thing typically [ph] the rest of the year.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And then just last question for me. On the commercial AOF [ph] side, another area, another very strong quarter of growth. I mean, is this a new trend of growth rate for that area? I mean, Commercial up sequentially 5%, year-over-year up 27%, very, very strong growth rates? Is that something we should expect to continue?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I would. I mean, I think it is a high-growth area of ours and the corporate accounts, are really expanding and I see no reason for it not to.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman with SIG.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "So my first one is you had a flurry of contract renewals, meaningful ones, late in this quarter and obviously, last quarter. Are you seeing any differences in the characteristics of contracts when they renew in terms of the products that customers may be taking? And if -- are there any margin differences in your renewals relative to the prior contracts that you signed?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, let me see if I can explain it. I mean, we've said on numerous occasions that basically, we signed long-term contracts that allow a client, as they grow, to take advantage of some of their growth. So if a person signed 5 years ago when he was smaller, in theory, the unit price may be somewhat less but we don't think that's actually hurting our margins at this point. Now when you renew a Cap One or Royal Bank of Scotland, they're big enough, they might -- can make a little difference, but we continue to add at the middle or smaller size accounts and commercial card accounts where the margins might -- are probably better. I think you could conclude that they are better than at the very highest level. So I think what we see in most cases, we've said over several years now, maybe that you probably should expect us in margin pressure to 1% to 2%, somewhere in that range. But a lot of that depends on who we're renegotiating with. And getting this RBS deal behind us, we're not negotiating with any other large clients right now. I mean, we don't have any contracts coming up anytime soon. The Cap One and RBS deal have -- RBS has lingered on for -- we've been working on that for about one year. And I can say, we\u2019re happy to get that one behind us. Now we can go focus on trying to help them grow.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "So you're off to a great start here in 2012, especially on revenue. And I guess, the math would suggest that if you just kind of run rate your Q1 revenues with no quarter-over-quarter growth the rest of the year, you'd be at the top end of your full year guidance range. So are you just being conservative at this early juncture of the fiscal year in terms of not raising the revenue range? Or I know you did mention there was some one-time revenues in the quarter, maybe you can quantify that. I know the leap year helped a little bit. So maybe just walk us through the thought process there because it does seem like you've got a great jump on your full year guidance at this point?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Let me start that and Jimmy can finish up. I do think that we had a good quarter and we're excited about it, and it's very promising. As I said earlier, a quarter doesn't make a trend, but we're encouraged by it, and we're optimistic about it. But we're certainly not ready to change any guidance at this point. Jimmy, you want to talk about any...", "James B. Lipham", "I think that we have several million dollars of one-time items. I think as you go and look at taking the quarter and just averaging that out over the year, you might get close to the top line, but we are working on some things that will take clarity during this quarter. And as you said, it's -- I mean, we're close to the top end of it, but then again, it's not for just a 4x what the first quarter was to get there. So I think we'll have more clarity here in the second quarter and see how these volumes continue to hold up.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Truth is, we'd like nothing better than to raise guidance.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Yes, but you'll do it at the right time, that makes sense. And maybe just to stay on the topic of top line here. I mean, if some sizeable opportunities in your pipeline go your way and maybe you get a little more tailwind from the macro environment, I mean, what's a reasonable longer-term organic revenue growth rate? I mean, you just did 7% here in Q1 and again, a little bit of help from leap year and some one-time stuff. But is something in that neighborhood sustainable as you look out longer term?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, I know you know we had in our guidance the 3% to 5%. Obviously, we're pushing the high end of that right now with the growth internally, where it is. So, yes, I mean, it could get higher than that if we continue to have this kind of growth. Our accounts on files continue to grow year-over-year. It'll approach the 7% to 10% range.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "7% to 10%, okay. And then just lastly for me, conceptually, how should we think about the eventual move of the U.S. to EMV? How might that impact your business? New card issuance on that side of your business or helping merchants plan for EMV migration on that side. Any other factors we should be thinking about? I mean, is this a meaningful potential net positive over the next few years as we approach that liability shift that the networks have outlined for 2015?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I think it's a net positive for us. I mean, obviously, it requires a lot of work on both sides of the transaction, and we will perform a lot of that work and hopefully, we'll get paid for it. We've been through that in the U.K. and Europe. We've been through it in Canada, and now we're looking at it, obviously, in the U.S. We've got a couple of banks that have come to us. I'd say, a couple, 4, that have come to us and want to get in the EMV. But it's not like, they're knocking down the doors yet. I think a lot of people have sort of a wait-and-see attitude. But we absolutely believe it will happen. But to answer your question, it will, long term, be a net positive for us.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "The 33 million accounts in the pipeline, can we get some sense on when those rolls through? Will be some in 2012, 2013? Just give us an idea of when to expect those coming in.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, I don't have that list in front of me. But that's all due to come on within the next 12 to 18 months. Within the next 18 months, some will come on later this year. Don't expect anything really in the fourth quarter. People just don't convert in the fourth quarter. We've got some big ones coming on in the early part of next year that we're excited about. And these dates move around by -- they're subject to move 90 days either way, up or back.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Is there anything coming on substantial in the next 2 quarters of this year? If the fourth quarter...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Not substantial, no. Not substantial.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So you're back-end weighted for 2013?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "We've got a few process [ph] coming up, some smaller conversions. But I think for your planning purposes, I would look at the first quarter of -- and the second quarter of 2013. And obviously, if we were to get lucky and sign something big over this next quarter, that would move into probably 2013.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes, that was going to be my follow-on, is just an update on some of the big fish, any more movement there?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, we got a lot of hooks in water. We've got some good bait on them. So stay tuned is all I can tell you. We're keeping our fingers crossed and working hard.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And I guess, just 2 more quick ones for me. Just an outlook on operating margins? There was obviously some decent leverage in the quarter year-over-year. How do we think about margins going forward?", "James B. Lipham", "Well, I\u2019ve always said, on consolidated, we're going to stay in the 22% to 24% range, and I think that's where we should be from a consolidated perspective. We moved around the margins between International and North America, but they should stable out.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And then just another crack at the guidance. I mean, guidance is, I think, 2% to 5% revenue growth, if I remember correctly, and you did 9% in the first quarter. So is there anything besides FX, I know, will be a bigger factor in the second and third quarter that will drag revenue growth that we should keep in mind?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Just the economy and I think that we still come for...", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "The economy. In the normal pricing and deconversion that we were talking about earlier, but just economy, there's no large deconversions or large one-time fee that we don't know about?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "No. That's correct.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim Willi with Wells Fargo.", "Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just 2 questions, I apologize, I jumped on a bit late if you'd already hit them. But one was that I wonder if you could just maybe talk about the regional banks. Obviously, we saw the announcements and I heard you mention Regions in addition to [indiscernible] of the pipeline and then a sense of how...", "[Technical Difficulty]", "Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, let me try again. If I'm breaking up, I'll just drop off and get you offline. So with the regional banks that you've won, I'm curious about how you would characterize other hot prospects that are like Regions or Huntington, if there's only a couple more, if there are many more? And then what your sense is as to sort of how aggressive [indiscernible].", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Tim, I got the first question about how many more are there, and I would say there are probably 2 or 3 more that we are aware of that we'll have a shot at. I couldn't -- I didn't get the second part of your question.", "Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I'll drop off and catch you offline. I don't want to interrupt...", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens Inc.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "A couple questions on the one-time stuff, Jim. You mentioned there was about -- I think, you said several millions, is that $2 million, $3 million revenue that was one time?", "James B. Lipham", "Yes.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "And then you mentioned there were some one-time things in the costs that's within that -- your bucket of lost business, and et cetera. Can you just detail what was one time in that dollar wise?", "James B. Lipham", "Well, the lost business was roughly about $9 million total, consolidated.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "And the rest was one time?", "James B. Lipham", "Yes.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "And then I think somebody asked a little bit about this before but I want to dig in, 20% volume growth is really nice on your direct acquiring business. What's the driver there? I know that there's some good cyclical trend across the industry, but what specifically is getting you from that sort of high-single digit that we're seeing in a lot of places to more  the 20%?", "James B. Lipham", "I really don't know other than the make-up of the merchant base. I think we're maintaining and growing merchants. We've added some merchants. We lose a few from attrition, but I think the ones we're putting on are a little bit higher-volume, dollar-volume merchants than what we are losing.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "So bigger merchants?", "James B. Lipham", "Yes.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "And then the -- one of the things I was trying to understand is your new account on file growth was better than we expected. Same-store sales account growth is about where we thought. Does that mix -- is the margin on those 2 different types of accounts differ meaningfully? I assume it does. And did that impact the margins in the quarter given that the new files are pretty good?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I mean, I think commercial cards carry a little more weight than others but, yes, I mean, just the makeup of that growth.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "And then last question, Value Added Services. Those are -- those seem to be growing. How big a business is that when you guys think about it? And how fast did it grow this quarter?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I think it's about 11%. But how fast, I don't have it in front of me.", "James B. Lipham", "I don\u2019t already have that. I know we have gone away because of the segment business. We just talk about value-added on a consolidated basis, and we kind of got it spilt up now between the 3 segments and it's...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I think it's about 11%.", "James B. Lipham", "But it's 11%.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Of total rev?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "It's pretty steady right now.", "James B. Lipham", "If you take for all services, they're up quite a bit this quarter. It's all about a 9% growth.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "And is that 11% of total rev or net?", "James B. Lipham", "Net.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Net.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Fodor with Morgan Stanley.", "Vasundhara Govil - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "This is Vasundhara Govil for Glenn. I just wanted to go back on the comments you made on regional banks about more banks getting aggressive on new card issuance. But it's kind of hard to imagine that overall appetite for consumer credits is going up given that consumers are still in a deleveraging mode. So in that context, I'm just trying to understand if this new card issuance is really incremental to the whole market or is it just coming out of market share shift from within existing issuers?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I think that -- truth be known, it's probably coming out of the market. I don't know that there's an incremental demand for cards, but I think people have -- are coming up with better products, better ideas, better loyalty programs. I mean, I've read some here recently where they're really aggressive on it. And when you have new clients reentering the business, they\u2019re going after their own customer base, which they have some leverage with, we would think. But I do think that it's going after some of our competitors\u2019 cards is where these folks are going. But they're going really after their customer base when you talk about regionals. And by the way, I mean, I think you've all read where regions bought their old portfolio back from Bank of America 3 or 4 months ago. And so they've already acquired a lot of their customers back, and we'll convert that later this year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dave Koning with Baird.", "David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And I guess, my first question is just on the Merchant Services line, you've done a great job growing revenue per transaction. And I know quite a bit of that is probably from Durbin and some PCI compliance or tax IDE fees. There's just a lot of benefits right now to the industry around some of those things. Is this something that by late 2012 or into 2013, starts to flatline or even decline a little bit? Are these some, I guess, transitory benefits that go away at some point?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I think you'll see those decline to some degree. I mean, obviously, as competition continues to move forward, anybody that had big wins with Durbin, I don't think we had a huge win, it is incremental with us. But that's going to, at some point, virtually go away. And same way with some of these other fees. Now some of these fees will go on long term.", "James B. Lipham", "But they will anniversary in.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Yes, they will anniversary as Jimmy said.", "David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "On the international side, revenue per transaction was down about 6% year-over-year. The last few quarters, it was up kind of mid-single to even double digits year-over-year. What, I guess, changed this quarter? Maybe that was just the anniversary of something as well?", "James B. Lipham", "I don't really know other than the mix and the Call Center business as I mentioned. Managed services was a good growth for international and normally, it carries a little lower growth rate.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "By the way, just for what it's worth, in March, we did eliminate 182 positions in that international side in various countries around the world.", "David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And then my last one, just on credit trends. I guess, month-to-month, were there big differences? Obviously, February had the leap day benefit. But growth month-to-month, were there any differences I guess through the quarter?", "James B. Lipham", "In?", "David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "In transaction growth, in credit?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "No, I think it's just been pretty strong the whole quarter and it's been in the double-digit range as far as transaction growth in the 14%, 15% range in North America. And International is a little smaller than that. But it's been pretty consistent for the quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.", "Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "It's actually Roman Leal in for Julio. The organic growth in your accounts on file look really strong this quarter and your portfolio contains various card types and you service banks, both large and small. Can you share perhaps where you're seeing the greatest strength in organic growth. I guess, across the card types, is at all commercial or is it different pockets? And is it all large accounts -- or large banks versus regional banks?", "James B. Lipham", "It\u2019s Commercial and large banks -- we've had some good growth from some of our specialty issuers like fuel cards. But for the first time -- I mean, not the first time, but over the last quarter or 2, we're finally starting to see some growth out of the regional and smaller banks. But I think the vast majority so far has been either larger issuers and the Commercial card issuers.", "Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So is it safe to assume that you're seeing more activity in the regional banks? And as that picks up, first with accounts and then with revenue, you'll start seeing some delta -- sorry, that delta shrink? I mean, some more revenue per transaction on smaller banks' side? It's more of another crack at a question that was already asked, but there is a pretty big delta between the transaction growth and revenue growth? Do you think that shift towards regional banks helps that?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Oh, absolutely. I absolute think. I mean, the truth is, every card that we get out the door, helps it.  And it takes -- when you get a new -- when you get approved for a new card, it takes a while for that volume start adding up for us. I mean, we've got post the transactions, authorizations. You get in that regular cycle, and that's when we sort of hit the sweet spot after your account's been on a while.", "James B. Lipham", "One of the things we haven't talked about as far as what your question leads to is that 30% of our cardholder transactions, they're from bundled accounts. So as you see that high growth in transactions, it may not equate back to revenue being it is a bundled account. So you get back to some of your revenue growth has to be new accounts added. And then you could start talking about transactions.", "Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes, it makes sense. One last one on the merchant side, you talked about looking at some potential acquisition opportunities there. Maybe can you help us think through what type of opportunities you're looking at? Are these top 50 ISOs that perhaps you have a relationship already on the processing side? Or are these other third-party acquirers that perhaps you don't have a relationship with?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, it's both, honestly. And there's some areas that we would really very much like to be in. Obviously, one of the areas we would like to, that we're chomping at the bit to get into is the Internet space for transactions. We're not very large in that, and we would certainly like to be in that, in a much bigger way. And we have relationships with a lot of people in this business, and we have a lot of opportunities to look at things. We just -- we're a careful buyer and I don't mean that to sound facetious, but I mean we really think that as we build this merchant acquiring business up, we've got to buy good property. We don't need to buy something that we've got to rebuild. So we're looking for good people, good property.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Steven Kwok with KBW.", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "I just had 2 quick questions. One was on the share repurchase. Was that due to both M&A activity and then also potentially renewing or getting a new credit facility?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "It's mainly due to the M&A piece. I don't think it had anything to do with credit facility. I mean, we are -- we still pretty strongly generating over around $25 million of -- a month in free cash flow. So it's just a matter of -- I mean, we had the M&A activity going on and it didn't make much sense right now, especially with our stock price appreciating every month, we ought to get in there when we had the high likelihood of doing something.", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "But on the International Services side, for the operating margins, how fast can it get back to the historical levels?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, as I said last quarter, we've got a get-well plan. I talked about the jobs that we'd eliminated in March. It's going to take probably 2 years, at least.", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "And then last question on the...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Let me add one thing there. If we can -- additional business will make that easier. In these countries that we're already in, as an example, we signed something of significance in Brazil or Germany or the U.K., that will make a big difference. Because we've already built the infrastructure.", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "And then final question. And notice the tax rate, it was a bit high this quarter. Is that just due to seasonality? I know that was the case in the first quarter of last year.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I noticed that too and waiting for Jimmy to explain it.", "James B. Lipham", "It's just that we had some discrete items last year, which were -- brought the rate down, but it's pretty normal. Going to be what you see the rest of the year, probably.", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "So it should be 35% for the rest of the year?", "James B. Lipham", "No, it should be -- drop down around 34%.", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "34%.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "See what the rate was.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I guess, many of my questions have been answered. I had a clarification. If you could provide one on Capital One with ING and I guess eventually HSBC kind of behind them, what's the [indiscernible] pulling in those accounts on your platform? Is any of that contemplated this year? And then, is there any risk of not getting a part of this, that\u2019s associated with the private label?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, I think there's certainly risk of all that. We certainly would not anticipate anything [indiscernible]. And you said ING, right? We wouldn't anticipate anything out of that. I mean, we -- of course, on HSBC, they haven't even, at least as best I know, they haven't consummated that deal yet. We're hopeful that they will, and we're hopeful that we'll get a good chance at it.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I was kind of trying to figure out the timing for the sake of AOF [ph]  because that can provide, if it comes next year, provide a pretty good continued year-over-year benefit. I guess, the second question, I think you just answered this, but a clarification. You didn't -- I mean, you have a very healthy balance sheet. So I mean, is this an either or if you're considering M&A from a compliance perspective not allowed to do a buyback? And if you continue to look at M&A, then does that preclude a buyback for a long time?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "No, I don't think it precludes this. If you recall, I don\u2019t know if you were on the call in the last call and I said, maybe what you should do in your annual model is factor in somewhere between $0.01 and $0.02 per share as a buyback.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "So the 2 things can obviously happen together?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I think so. I mean, obviously, if it were -- if we found something that was in the $1 billion range, it might not. But there's not a lot of those floating around.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Greg Smith with Sterne Agee.", "Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Let's say you\u2019re successful on your fishing expedition. What kind of -- how should we think about pricing, revenue per account, if you were to reel in something very large?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, I mean, it would be probably -- it will be very good pricing. I mean, you have to think of it as very good pricing. We're not going to give it away. We are in the business to make money and -- but we can -- we certainly -- one thing we do understand is economies of scale, and scale really helps us. And so I think you would see us make a good profit on it. It might be somewhat less, depending on how big. I mean, we're always fishing for big ones out there and you've got to make sure you don't get pulled underwater by them. And we're not planning on doing that.", "Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "And how much customization work is typically required with the realty [ph]?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "It really just depends. I mean, some issuers, there\u2019s very little, others, there\u2019s more. I would think on a really big guy, they\u2019d  be -- I mean, I don't know how to judge it. I mean, that'd be 50,000, 60,000 hours maybe of development, just for special products and interfaces that they need. But then we're used to that. I mean, we build all that into the deal.", "Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "And does that get booked? How does that get recognized as revenue?", "James B. Lipham", "Well, normally, when we're converting special projects like that, we'll capitalize them and then amortize them over the life of the contract. And the estimate of hours and all gets priced into the transaction price.", "Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "And then the joint venture income, it stepped up nicely, I think, as you guys have been saying. I think we were looking for $10 million for the full year. Is that still a good number, the CUP Data joint venture income?", "James B. Lipham", "I had them -- I don't know if that was $10 million or -- we grew 19% last year, they should growth around 15% this year, year-over-year.", "Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Yes, maybe it was a growth rate, gets you to close to 10%. And then just the transaction activity in April, any notable change in what you've been seeing the past few weeks versus the first quarter?", "James B. Lipham", "None so far.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "I guess, the first one, just you sounded somewhat excited about Brazil on the pipeline prospects there. Just figured I'd go there, get a little bit of color and maybe an update on kind of how Carrefour is going at this point as well?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I'm pretty excited about everything, honestly. Not particularly Brazil. I mean, we -- after the last 2, 3 years, it's just very -- it's just a lot more fun having good calls as opposed to explaining why we're down. I mean, I think Brazil is a very strong growth market. They have some great banks down there, some great issuers. There are some opportunities in Brazil. I think there's probably more, and I think I said this last time, last quarter, there's probably more opportunities in the U.S. right now than there is anywhere in the world, which, again, when you go back and think over the great recession, the U.S. went absolutely dark for about 36 months. You couldn't get anybody to even think about talking about a conversion, much less doing it. And if you'll recall, during that recession, we continued to add business internationally, and in Canada, which is part of our North American numbers. So we think we have some great opportunities out there. Now it takes a lot of work to get these folks signed and it takes even more work to get them converted. But once you get them converted, it's a -- we have a really strong business model that says, unless something out of the ordinary happens, they're going to be here a long time. Just like the RBS announcement, I mean, they've extended 12.5, 13 years, out to 2025. And by that time, I'd probably be on a beach somewhere, and one of these young guys will be handling this. But we're extremely encouraged by what's going on, not only internationally, but certainly in North America and in the merchant business, on both sides of the merchant business.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Well, let me just sneak in a couple of number questions, real quick. Maybe for Jim. Could you just quantify the BofA roll off, what was the negative drag in the quarter? Or was that the $9 million in lost business in the quarter?", "James B. Lipham", "No, that was not BofA. BofA is -- for the quarter, did about what we thought was -- we said they would probably run off about $10 million a year and they went in line with what we figured they would have for the first quarter. Actually, they -- they actually had about $400,000 worth more revenues that we have anticipated. So they were a little slower than we thought in deconverting.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "And then the slide you have where you sort of go through the lost business of 3.4%, this is sort of another crack at a component of the guidance. But for the year, you had guided to 5% to 6% for lost business and pricing. Any reason to think that this 3% revenue -- 3% line during the quarter is not a good run rate? Or is there any reason to think it would step up toward that 5% to 6% or even higher to get to there on a full year basis?", "James B. Lipham", "It did have a one-time nonrecurring item, it was a positive in there that would have -- and it represented 4% and 6%, so it's about $2 million. So if you haven't had that, it's been up a little over 4%.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "So it would have been about 4% was kind of the normalized run rate?", "James B. Lipham", "Yes.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "And then just finally, the $33 million conversion pipeline, is HSBC contemplated in there or is that not contemplated at this point?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, we've set aside a slot for something like that, hoping that --,  it's not a done deal. So it could be -- and I just wouldn't want to get into any details there. We've set aside a slot. We've got people ready to go work on it should we be -- should we get that business. I mean, I can't tell you how many accounts it is because I don't know. I've just read in the press same thing you have. But -- and again, like I said last quarter, we would hope that we have an opportunity there. I mean, we do their Visa and MasterCard processing and certainly, at least on the Visa, MasterCard side, we think we would have a good opportunity there.", "Operator", "At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Tomlinson for closing remarks.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Thank you, Vineda. I just have a few things that I want to say. One is during the quarter, we introduced our new corporate purpose brand \"People-Centered Payments\", which defines our reason for being and our belief that payments really should revolve around people, not the other way around.", "I know that some of you probably think that I get a little corny about some of this stuff once in a while. But people have always been at the heart of TSYS. And frankly, I think it's what makes us different. And I truly believe it gives us a competitive edge. And this idea that we are really talking more and more about putting people at the center of every decision we make, in every product, in every solution that we build, provides a real clarity of purpose for our folks and a real focus on the over 38 million times each day that the people of TSYS touch somebody else's life, whether that's an authorization or a phone call or whatever it is.", "And this concept really has resonated well with our people. So when you see that, it's really more than a slogan or a marketing campaign. It's a way of life. It's the way we do business. And it's really our secret sauce, and I think that, that is being amped up, and we're feeling better about it and we are really excited about our business.", "On another note, I want to let you know that we just mailed the agenda and registration forms for the Investor Day in New York that\u2019s going to   be held May 22. If -- we would love for you to be there if you can, we think we've got a good day planned for you.", "And with that, I want to thank you for your interest in TSYS and your time this evening. We appreciate the questions. If you have any additional questions, again, please feel free to call Shawn Roberts in Investor Relations, and we hope you have a great evening. And again, thank you for your time. Good night.", "Operator", "This concludes today's teleconference.

Incorporated, Research Division", "Operator", "Good afternoon. My name is Shannon, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the TSYS Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded today, July 24, 2012. Thank you. I would now like to introduce Mr. Shawn Roberts, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Shawn Roberts", "Thank you, Shannon. And welcome, everyone. On the call today, our Chairman and CEO, Phil Tomlinson, will provide highlights from the second quarter 2012; and then turn it over to Jim Lipham, our CFO, who will review the financials. And after that, as Shannon said, we will open it up to Q&A.", "At this time, I'd like to call your attention to the fact that we'll be making forward-looking statements about future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS' actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in the TSYS' reports filed with the SEC.", "At this time, I'd like to introduce TSYS' CEO, Phil Tomlinson.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Thanks, Shawn. And I'm excited to report that we had another good quarter. I hope you've been able to read our press release. And obviously, as you know, last Thursday, we were delighted to announce a new long-term agreement with the Bank of America to begin the processing services for its U.S. consumer credit card portfolio. And also, to continue providing processing for their commercial card credit portfolio.", "As is our long-standing practice regarding client-specific information, we won't be discussing revenues regarding the new relationship with Bank of America, but I will tell you what we're going to be doing. We'll be handling the transactions, authorizations, processing and billing for Bank of America, but they'll continue to do their own card issuing or card production, their statement production and their reward programs, and all of which we were doing for them when they left us in our previous contract that ended in 2006. So it's not an apples-to-apples comparison.", "Again, the planned conversion date is mid-2014, so I look at any associated expenses along the way as a long-term investment in our future that I believe we can handle. You might remember that Bank of America previously outsourced its consumer business to us from '96 to 2006 when we acquired MBNA. Bank of America decided to take that processing in-house on the MBNA legacy system. We believe that their decision to transition the consumer business back to TSYS after 6 years says a lot about our ability to build strong and long-term relationships.", "So when the world's third-largest issuer decides to outsource their processing, I think it's a clear confirmation that large issuers will outsource, and I think it debunks the theory that I've heard over the years, that many people believe that large issuers believe they've got to do their own processing in-house. I just have -- still have never believed that's the case, and I believe this is another great example of it.", "It's a huge win and I believe it sends a very strong message to our industry. It also gives me great comfort to know that in 24 months, this business will be coming on board and I hope you feel the same way as the investor. It goes a long way in helping ensure our long-term success over the next 3 to 5 years. Once we convert this portfolio in mid-'14, we believe our U.S. market shares of the Visa and MasterCard credit card market will be in the range of approximately 40%. And as we've said before on the commercial card side of the house, we believe that is in the 80% range.", "I strongly believe this -- that this decision to outsource is a continuing indicator, a leading indicator that large and small issuers around the globe see real value at TSYS in their -- and really, a never ending requirement for competitive pricing, service, new and innovative products that have to be faster, better and cheaper. Personally, I continue to believe the issuers competing with banks that are TSYS' clients will find themselves at somewhat of a disadvantage, not only technically, but in customer service product development and speed-to-market as we continue to invest and enhance and improve our products and quality each day.", "From a quarterly perspective, the key metrics we used to measure our business were all positive. EPS was $0.35 for the quarter, an increase of 26.5% over the second quarter 2011. Total revenues were $462.7 million, an increase of 3.4%, and operating income was $92.1 million, a 17.3% increase over the second quarter of last year. It's a quarter we're really proud of.", "I want to take a few minutes and give you a brief update on some of the business highlights from our 3 reporting segments. In North America, during the second quarter, we were fortunate enough to sign Fleet One, Oregon Community Credit Union, Scotiabank in Mexico and KeyBanc, which is also another big win for us.", "In last quarter's call, we mentioned the signing of Regions Financial and Huntington Bank, which are 2 institutions that are helping to take back ownership -- that are working to take back ownership of their card programs and grow their portfolios. I know that sometimes our pipeline can be confusing, so I'm going to give you a little bit more detail than usual this quarter. Our total pipeline including Bank of America exceeds 100 million accounts. We've scheduled several smaller conversions and startups for the third quarter, and as you know, we do very little conversion startup business in the fourth quarter because of the holiday season.", "We're scheduled to convert another 20 million accounts in the first quarter, and we have another 10 million scheduled for the third quarter of 2013. Of course, these numbers are all subject to the usual issues, people will be adding new accounts, they'll be deleting accounts and -- but they should work fairly well for your models.", "In the international side, we mentioned last quarter in -- on last quarter's call, the contract renewal with the Royal Bank of Scotland, which extended our processing relationship through 2024. During this quarter, we successfully moved the Tesco accounts to a new direct relationship and are having good success in cross-selling additional products like mobile apps and online card management tools, to new clients like Swiss Card and ING.", "In the past 2 weeks, we announced that we've signed the largest PRIME license agreement today with SpareBank 1 in Norway. In the Merchant segment, as Jim will address in detail with you later, same client point-of-sale transactions in our indirect acquiring business in dollar volumes and sales from our direct acquiring business continued to increase. We've continued our positive market momentum by signing 3 new indirect processing agreements and extending our agreements with 3 existing clients.", "On the direct acquiring side, we've added new -- 2 new large national merchants and we have extended agreements with over 20 existing clients. The merchant advocacy sales group we created with our -- with the direct merchant sales group is seeing what we think is healthy productivity increases, and we're gaining traction from new referral partners and we're improving the sales from existing partners. Our sales per sales unit are increasing every month.", "So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Jim Lipham, our CFO. And when he gets through, we'll have a Q&A, then I will have some closing remarks for you. Jim?", "James B. Lipham", "Thank you, Phil. Before I get into the slides, I thought I'd take a few minutes to touch on a couple items that I know you saw in the press release, that we raised our guidance to the upper end of our range for our net income of $243 million and earnings per share of $1.28, respectively, there.", "We have experienced quite a productivity coupled with internal growth during this first 6 months of the year, which were the primary drivers of our stronger income before tax number. Year-to-date, revenues before reimbursables were up 6.9% and operating expenses were up 4.3%, driving our productivity gains higher than we had expected. We were very pleased with these results and but however, due to things we have to pay some adjustments in the last half of the year, and I know Phil kind of mentioned a little bit, but the adjustments include a pricing concession in the last half of the year related to a large client. And then we had 2 clients that requested delays in their conversions, and we were expecting to convert them in the last quarter of 2012 and they've now been moved to 2013. And these pricing concessions and conversion delays amounted to, roughly, $17 million of decreased revenues in the latter half of the year.", "We expect our original productivity gains that we've experienced in the first 6 months of this year to continue for the last 6 months, and they will help offset the pricing concession and the revenue loss from the deconversions being pushed out.", "Also, during the quarter, we had a discrete item in our income tax section where we recorded a $6.2 million tax benefit, and it was in our guidance numbers. It was old so $1 million greater than what we had thought. It represented about $0.03 a share. As Phil mentioned, we were up in the quarter to $0.35 per share. But I wanted to touch on those 2 items that are kind of really unusual as far as where we are with the results for the 6 months and inspection for the remainder of the year.", "If we'll flip over to Slide 6 and look at the second quarter results, you'll see that revenues before reimbursables are up 4.9%, and that's roughly $18.5 million, about half of this is coming from issuing business and the other half from the merchant side of the house.", "Our expenses during the quarter were up 1.4%, so you can see that the operating income really had benefits from good productivity and growing at 17.3%. Our margins for the second quarter were 23.1% compared to 20.7% last year at this time, a great improvement, continuing to show good strength there.", "Earnings per share, as I mentioned before, $0.35, up 26.5% year-over-year. I will say the same client transactions during this quarter were up 12.7%, and that's slightly down from where we were in the first quarter of 14.4%. So we did see a little drop off there from where we were in the first quarter.", "On a year-to-date basis, revenues before reimbursables up 6.9% or $51 million. There, again, it's just good organic growth, it's good programming. We've had TermNet in here. We've got a small deconversion fee during the second quarter. But overall, just good growth, organic and internal growth for the 6 months.", "Our operating income again, we get -- actually had our expenses grow at a lesser rate than revenues down 4.3%. So the operating income growing double digits at 16.7%. Our margin before reimbursables is up 2%, roughly, from where it was in 2011, and net income is up 20.1% year-over-year. It's just outstanding growth and for the 6 months, we're at $0.65 a share, up 22.7%.", "Just as Phil said, a great quarter and a great 6 months. On the next page, you'll see the revenue change for 2012 year-to-date and where it all came from. We got internal growth of 6.4%, that compares to a 7% internal growth number in the first quarter, just a slight decrease.", "We had new clients contributing 3.7% and then the acquisition of TermNet added another 1%. So all total, we had 11.1% growth for the year-to-date numbers. And then what happened to us was lost business was a big item on the column of 3.7%. It's about 3.3% loss for business and that was mainly attributable to cards we lost with BofA when we had the termination of ABN AMRO and had a little merchant loss there so that -- we did pick up the termination fee and -- but it all netted out to 6.9%. As I said, that stands us a little bit from where we were.", "Next slide has to do with our accounts on file, and as I mentioned in the Analyst Day in New York, we did put it in here this time the commercial card, single-use accounts. And as you can see there, the last category there about 34 million accounts and then, roughly, about half of what we had in commercial category. But overall, these commercial card accounts represent about 1.7% -- or excuse me, 1.2% of our consolidated revenue.", "So they're small contributors to revenue just like prepaid card and that's why we need to pull them out. Also I mentioned is, EBIT category was up. The total category has grown to 7.2%, which kind of coincides with our 6.9% growth in revenues. And so we're mighty proud to see all of these account categories growing year-over-year.", "With that, we'll go to the North America segment. Look at the key drivers there, strong internal growth and increased volumes. Revenues before reimbursables at $205 million, that's up 3.4% or 6.8% and this primarily comes from new business and organic revenue growth. So just good growth organically here, up about 6.9%.", "Operating income, $72.1 million, it's up 12.5%, and margins before reimbursables at 35.1%, that's an increase of 282 basis points from where it was last year at this time. Let me highlight the accounts on file, they are up 18% total at $387 million. I think the prepaid and the onetime use commercial cards out just see a 6.6% growth.", "Total cardholder transactions growing at 13.5%, a little over 2 billion. First time in quite a few years that we have broke 2 billion transactions, but that's down from the first quarter growth of 16.4%, so but overall, North America had a great quarter.", "Next slide on the International segment, you'll see good internal growth here. The deconversion fee from one of our customers, about $2 million, but it all attributed to our revenues being up before reimbursables of about 5.6% or up about $5.3 million and operating income at $9.4 million, that's a decrease of 6.8%, that's about $683,000. It's not really that great but the deconversion fee helped us there. As you know, we did move those expenses over in the first quarter as we reallocated resources to the International segment.", "But operating margin, revenues before reimbursables at 9.5%, that's down 1.2% from last year's 10.4%. The deconversion fee, if it hadn't been in this quarter, we would have been -- our margins before reimbursables would have been down to 8.1% or have been down about 2.6%. So if you look at the accounts on file, you'll see them up 11.11% -- 11.1%, still good growth there in accounts. Cardholder transactions were up 18.1%, which is in line with where they were the first quarter when they were growing to 17.5%. So same card transactions up 11%, so we're still seeing some good growth internally and internationally.", "Look at the next slide on the merchant side, you'll see the revenues for reimbursables up 5% at $97.7 million, that's up $4.7 million. Most of these growth is coming from TSYS Merchant Services in Omaha. They're up about $6.5 million for the month -- excuse me, for the quarter. And it's mainly due to compliance fees, new services, transaction volumes. TAS had -- was a -- our TSYS Acquiring out in Tempe, and our point-of-sale was down about $1.7 million in there, mainly it's because of that deconversion of BAMS portfolio continues to move forward.", "Acquisition of TermNet added about $1.6 million to the revenue line here also. Now the $97.7 million of it, about 59% of it is transaction driven, which is predominantly our indirect business and TSYS Acquiring, 41% belongs to the direct merchant ownership part of our business in Omaha.", "The point-of-sale transaction volumes, as you can see up here, are down or are growing about 0.8%, almost flat, but when you exclude the deconverted customers, you'd see a growth from everybody else of 12.4%, which is kind of in line with the other transaction growth we see. The direct merchant dollar volume, it increased 9.7% over the second quarter of last year. And as you know, in the first quarter, we had a bigger growth, but that was because TermNet was not in the first quarter of '11. But overall, operating income, it's up 28.2% at $33 million, and that's up 7.2% and creates a margin of 33.7%, which is up about 600 basis points over 2011. You might be interested, we did have some onetime expense items in 2011, which are showing a favorable effect on the margin. But overall, again, the Merchant businesses was pretty strong for the second quarter.", "The next slide, cash flow strength trailing 12 months. You'll see that we had very good cash flow, strong cash flow for the quarter with $105 million from operations, $64 million, $7 million of that's mainly is free cash flow. For the trailing 12 months, cash flow from operations of $440 million and free cash flow at $330 million. EBITDA at $518 million, still growing very strong, generating good cash.", "Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $419 million, that's an increase of $102 million since the year end. And as you saw in the press release today, that we -- the board did approve to extend our buyback plan and also to increase it to another 5 million shares to 10.3 million shares and move the date out another year to April of 2014. And we plan to continue to look at acquisitions and plan on that or share buybacks as we continue to go forward.", "I will mention here about our credit facility. I know we talked about we'd have it done by the end of the second quarter, the extension of it. And we had to hold off on it as we were waiting on the announcement on Bank of America, but we have been working on it. We have 4 lead banks in place today. We have commitments out there that have been committed of over $525 million and we will be launching the syndication of this in the next few days, hopefully to finish it sometime between now and mid-August, something like that. And we'll have it done before the second quarter gets started.", "So and the last slide I wanted to leave you with is a new one that we've put in. It has to do with showing you the shareholder return for the first 6 months of this year. You can see it's up 23.4%, very good stock appreciation and the increased dividends. And then if you look at the trailing 12 months, same thing, with a good shareholder return of 34.3% [ph].", "And with that, Phil, I'll turn it back to you.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Thank you, Jimmy. Shannon, we're ready to open up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from James Friedman of SIG.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "One slide that you didn't refer to, Jimmy, is this Slide 17 in the appendix. I don't recall you mentioned it in your prepared comments, but I wanted to ask you about the difference between the as-reported revenue and the constant currency.", "James B. Lipham", "And what was the question again?", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Yes, so how should we think about the foreign exchange impact on the reported revenue in the quarter?", "James B. Lipham", "Well, it hurt us. And as you can see, it's down, what was it, foreign currency was $2.6 million -- $2.7 million. So it was a negative for us during the quarter. But I think for the revenues, it's that much and then works out to be a better number for us on the expense side of the house and a positive when you get down to operating income.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. Just so I'm reading this right. Is the international -- are you breaking the international out from the total here? Or is this combined?", "James B. Lipham", "Well, this is -- I mean, it's just 2 segments, consolidated is consolidated, and then the international is by itself.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. So and then maybe turning back to the operating margins on a segment basis. So it sounds like you had a little bit of deconversion activity. But even when you net that out, it seems like that the trajectory, at least in 2 of the 3 segments look good. Where should be thinking about the operating margins going forward? If you could update us just to what Gaylon was saying at the Analyst Day on the international side, where we think merchant services in North America margin should be traveling through the end of the year?", "James B. Lipham", "I still think on the individual basis, they're going to track pretty much where they are today. I think international will improve a little bit more as it goes through the remainder of this year. And I think the merchant segment will at least hold its margin. Most of the growth in the international margin will come as a reduction in the North America margin, as they work those intercompany resources. So I think consolidated-wise, you'll still see us finish up in the 22% to 24% range.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "First question, if you wouldn't mind just giving a little more color on the contract with Bank of America. It's a great win for you guys. I know after a while it's been discussed. First of all, can you talk about the expenses that we should expect to be impacting the model over the course of the next, perhaps, year or 2 before it starts to truly ramp up and convert over? And then secondly, can you give us some color on the profitability, really just the competitive process, how -- bidding for it. What it means for the margins overall?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, I'll talk about it as best as I can. And Jimmy might be willing to add something on expenses. We -- there was not a big front-end payment on this so I think you can not worry about that. Obviously, for a deal this size, they had a very competitive price and it was a competitive process. And as you know, it took quite some time, but we were finally able to win that. And as a part of that process, we did go ahead and extend our commercial card portfolio, which is one of our larger, it's one of our top 3 commercial card clients, so we're very excited about that. Those contracts will be coterminous for 6 years out. So we're excited about that. On the expense side, we're going to work our way through the expenses just like we always had historically. We will capitalize what we can, which is a good portion of it, the rest will expense. We think we can handle that as we go forward.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And that's been factored into your guidance already, right?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Yes.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, good. Just one other question for me. On the overall environment -- 2. Well, first on the sort on the midsized and smaller banks, you had some great success, year-to-date, between Huntington and others that I know have been sort of looking into adding -- to growing their credit card portfolio business. Is there a lot of other opportunities like that out there? Because BofA was sort of a once -- bit of a one-of-a-kind large win for you guys. It was a great opportunity that you took it. But now just kind of going forward in addition to that, are we -- should we -- can we expect to see some midsized bank to keep coming down the pipe?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I think, Darrin, I think you can only because, I mean, the banks are under tremendous pressure when you start looking at the revenue stream that has been taken away between Durbin and overdrafts and all of the other things that you're well aware of. Cards is still one of the more attractive products that a bank can offer. And so I think a lot of people or a lot of the -- potential issues -- issuers have been looking at it. We -- I think I said earlier, we've got 4 startups coming along. We've got some very good prospects out there, some large names that you would certainly recognize, and we hope we'd be able to bring some of those to the table in the future. Certainly nothing is for sure but we see more activity today than we have seen in a long time, and I've been saying that all year. The one thing we continue to worry about is this economy in Europe. It's pretty amazing to me that our international transactions have continued to be strong in spite of what we're seeing of the economic news coming out of Europe, and the U.S. numbers are strong. So I fully expect more prospects to come out of the woodwork.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "I guess just the first question, maybe you can help us with this, is the -- the pipeline increase. I think you were sort of in the low 30s at the Analyst Day, and now you've suggested 100 million, obviously, a huge chunk of that is Bank of America. So it's actually sort of a two-part question. Is there a way to sort of frame how much of that is Bank of America? But also importantly, the organic growth that you're getting from other prospects outside of the Bank of America win?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Yes, Jimmy, you have the organic growth segment.", "James B. Lipham", "Yes, and organic growth is still running at 7%. So it's pretty good for the second quarter.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "I really meant the pipeline additions outside of Bank of America.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Are you talking about our prospects?", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Yes, yes, the 100 million accounts on file pipeline.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Yes. I mean, we've said 100 million, I think I said there was a few small conversions and some startups for the rest of this year. We had about 20 million accounts deconverted in the first quarter and in the third quarter, we've got another 10 million accounts to be converted, that's all 2013. And then the rest, you can kind of figure that it's mostly BofA. There are some other things sprinkled in there that will happen, but they're not significant.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So most of the increase is really, the large, large part of that, is Bank of America, that increase?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "The big part of it is certainly is. I mean 30 million accounts is nothing to sneeze at.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Oh, absolutely, absolutely. I wanted to understand sort of your outlook commentary, and understand first of all the delays in the conversions, and also, I guess, the pricing concession, a little bit of color on that. And then I think you alluded to in the press release some benefit offsetting that from the Bank of America win. And I was a little confused by that because I would think the conversion is scheduled from 2014 so you wouldn't benefit from that? So maybe I'm missing something.", "James B. Lipham", "I didn't -- that's in the press release, I got it.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Yes, we're -- Glenn, what was that in the press release you're talking about?", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "There were some reference to the delayed conversions and the -- it was -- would be partly offset by benefits from the Bank of America conversion. I guess more importantly, if it's not sort of like in front of you or on top of your head, maybe just talk about the deconversion activity, why that sort of happened, and also the large price concession that you sort of called out which seemed like it was not in your guidance.", "James B. Lipham", "The deconversion was a customer in the International segment.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Yes, we've talked about ABN AMRO, Glenn. We -- I mean, we also -- we did have this pricing was not in our guidance but the -- and neither was the...", "James B. Lipham", "Delay.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "The delays in these 2 conversions. And these were at customer requests. This is not something that we wanted to do. Our customers just weren't ready. They were supposed to go in the -- in late third quarter, early fourth quarter and they're just not ready. It's not a whole lot that we can do about that other than just try to make sure they're ready the next time. We were ready to go. And that happens from time to time. I don't think you should read any negatives into that whatsoever. I mean, it's just part of the business that we're in. These conversions are large and they're expensive and they need to go perfect. We don't want to get -- we don't anyone to be embarrassed and especially our customers. And so, they have the final say on when it gets converted.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Yes, okay. And then the pricing concession to the large client?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Yes, you said what that would mean.", "James B. Lipham", "Yes, I mean that was part of the...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "It's a total of $17 million, I think.", "James B. Lipham", "Well, yes. It was about $8 million worth for discounts in the third and fourth quarter, split between those 2 quarters.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Did that help?", "James B. Lipham", "It had to do with the extension of the contract.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Did the help you?", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Yes, it does help. And then just finally and I think it was a similar question, last quarter similar trends was kind of the revenue yield per transaction in North America was sort of a disconnect relative to the revenue -- the transaction growth was a lot stronger than the revenue growth in North America suggesting the yield. And I think the answer last quarter was paramountal bundling of transactions, was that the same phenomenon this quarter?", "James B. Lipham", "Yes. There's about 33%, 34% of our transaction are bundled. So you can take about 1/3 of that growth and consider it not reflective of revenue growth.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "So I just wanted to make sure we're all clear on the revenue growth outlook for full year '12. It sounds like you're not changing it, the 0% to 2% total revenue growth and 2% to 5% revs x reversible. So I just wanted to confirm that that's the case. Obviously, that implies deceleration in the second half. Is that just because of the client delays and the price concessions? Or what are the other factors that are driving the deceleration in the second half?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "That's the answer.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "All right. I love when I answer my own questions.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "We do too.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "So I mean just a follow-on to that is, if you hadn't had these unexpected delays in price concessions, you would have been in a position to...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "We'd raise guidance. Yes, we'd raise guidance.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "All right. And then any notable change in the trajectory of transaction growth, either domestically or internationally, either on the issuer or the merchant side month-to-date so far in July versus how you exited Q2?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I don't know. Not that we're aware of. I mean, we don't deal with that on a day-to-day basis, but I have not heard anything and -- I do think there is, everything you read in the press says that the consumer -- well, not maybe the consumer but the economy is starting to slow a bit. But if you're like me, you've read so much negative, I don't know. I guess we'll know at the end of the quarter. But we're certainly hopeful that the velocity will at least stay the same.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Right, that makes sense. And then just lastly on the tax rate. I think previously, as to the last quarter's call, you guys were thinking 33%, 34% for full year 2012. Is that still the expectation despite the help in Q2? Or does the full year rate now come in a little lower than you had previously thought?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "No, that still the rate. 33% to 34%.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "For full year?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Yes.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of David Togut of Evercore Partners.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Recognizing you're not going to disclose specific details behind the contract, maybe you could just help us bracket the contract relative to some of the average numbers that we see for your North American card issuer business. So if we were, for example, to just look at averages in terms of transactions for active account and annual AOF fee, calculated on our own, of course. I mean, how should we think of this relative to some of the averages based on the services you'll be providing versus what they'll keep in-house?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, I mean, we won't be providing a full array of services, although I'll assure you we'll be trying to sell those services to them. So I think those averages would be down, and I think it's important for you to understand that someone of that size is obviously going to get a little better price than the average guy out there.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Understood. Looking at that contract, you mentioned 30 million accounts in the pipe, is that a pure number for credit card in the U.S. for BofA? Or does that include other things as well?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "No, that 30 million I was talking about didn't include BofA.", "James B. Lipham", "I think you said, excess of 100 million.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Yes, I said we had our total pipeline in excess of 100 million. But I'm really trying to talk about what we have -- we've tried to keep it in a 1 year or 18-month period at the most.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Got it. Okay. And just finally, can you give us some more color behind the drivers and margin expansion in the merchant business in the quarter?", "James B. Lipham", "Well, it was still some good growth in revenues. And then again, like I said, we had some onetime expenses in the second quarter of 2011, as well as the first quarter, and they helped to bump the margin up a little bit.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, I think we also get the benefit of that reduction in force that we had internationally.", "James B. Lipham", "Of merchant?", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Yes, merchant.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I'm sorry. It's international merchant. So that's pretty much what it is. I don't -- you won't have those things continuing, obviously, as we go forward, because they were onetime expenses. Or if you remember, we had that litigation settlement in 2011. There's about $4 million, so that helped the margin a little bit.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Just one quick final question. Any update on HSBC North American card discussions, and when we might hear an answer there?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, I think that we're feeling pretty good about that. I mean, we don't have any official announcement, but we're feeling pretty good about it.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Greg Smith with Sterne Agee.", "Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Can you just give us the card number on BofA, how many cards it represents today?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I can't.", "Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay, no problem. And then just you said you're going to capitalize some expenses, some of it will get expensed related to BofA. But is there any match with revenues, or will the revenue not come in until cards are actually converted?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Unless they start up some programs, in the interim, the revenues will not come in until they actually get converted.", "Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just back to HSBC, so the HSBC North America is not in your 100 million pipeline?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I didn't say that.", "Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay, okay. That's clear then. And then the productivity gains you guys had in the quarter, which were pretty eye-popping, and you said actually going to continue through the rest of the year. Will that continue into 2013 or is there something you're pushing out from an investment perspective? Or are these truly sustainable on a go-forward basis?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, we believe that it's been pretty sustainable for 2 quarters. So unless something drastically happens here in the last half of the year, they should continue.", "Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then last question. The prepaid card, there's always typically a sequential jump, but it just seemed a particularly large jump in 2Q in the number of prepaid cards. Was that just organic or did you add a new customer?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "It's -- it's organic.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just thinking about the Analyst Day, we talked about the North America segment growing 8% to 10% between '12 to '14. Obviously, now with some of the pushout, it looks like North America segment is going to end up in the low-single-digit growth rate for '12. I assume, then, we're reiterating the 8% to 10%, meaning we're going to see kind of a spike in that number in '13, and I assume with BofA coming on in '14, we're going to see the biggest number in that year, is that correct?", "James B. Lipham", "Probably. I think so.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "But the 8% to 10% growth rate for North America between that period, that doesn't change just because of this pushout, obviously, we're just moving revenue from '12 into '13?", "James B. Lipham", "That's correct.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then, Phil, the prospect pipeline, it sounds like it's relatively healthy. How about some of the big, large deals that you we're working on, obviously, probably the biggest, BofA, was signed. But are there still others out there that you see in the prospect pipeline?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Yes, there are certainly others out there. I mean, obviously, BofA is about as big as you can get. So I mean, there's only 2 larger than BofA that we're aware of and one of them runs on our software and the other is in-house, so we're always working on them. But I mean there isn't a lot of prospects out there around the world.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then last question, and just on the merchant segment. Any update on the BAMS deconversion, where that stands this year and into next? And then second part of that, on the merchant segment, revenue per transaction was down a little bit sequentially. Was there any reason for that?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, I think that the BAMS business continues to fade away as per our projections. I don't know of anything that is different than that. We still think we've got several more years of that left. Jim, do you have the answer on...", "James B. Lipham", "The only thing on the revenues, we did have in the first quarter some favorable adjustments that came in from the previous year, about $1 million which could have affected the revenue per transaction which would have made second quarter a little lower. It was an adjustment from December. But outside of that, I can't think of anything else that would have affected in a negative way in the quarters.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Tim Willi of Wells Fargo.", "Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Two questions. The first question was, I don't know if you have any feel, if you could give us any thoughts on you talked about a bit of a deceleration in same-client transaction growth in North America. During the quarter, I'm just curious, if you have any insight as to whether that was more around your consumer-focused cards or versus commercial? Any thoughts or insight there?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I think it's probably -- I mean the consumer cards. But the slowdown, some of it could have been from the leap year, could have contributed quite a bit of growth in the first quarter that you wouldn't of had in the second. So it could just be number of days.", "Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, that's a good point. Probably the early Easter might have helped, as well, the first quarter versus second quarter.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Yes, Tim, this business is still somewhat cyclical. Holidays drive a lot of it.", "Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Yes, yes. The second question was on capital. So 2 things, one is in securities, can you give us some update around the -- what you're seeing in the M&A environment, domestic or international, card versus merchant? Obviously, there's a lot of cash on the balance sheet. So I'm curious what you're seeing on the M&A pipeline. And then second of all, obviously, you talked about enlarging the buyback. Just sort of curious around your thoughts around dividend policy, lots of flexibility on this balance sheet right now?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, I mean, there are some potential acquisitions out there. I mean, you saw Merchant e was acquired by Cielo in Brazil, that would have been a big win for us. There are several others out there that we're working with and certainly we're hopeful for some success here. I think in the second quarter, I said that if we were not able to do any -- didn't see a way forward to do any acquisitions, that you should look for us to buy $0.01 to $0.02 in EPS for the year. I mean, we will still stand by that. We don't have any appetite right now for a dividend increase. We increased it 42% last year. I don't think that's in the cards for this year.", "Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Not another 42% or not a dividend hike?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Not a dividend increase.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Brett Huff from Stephens Inc.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "On the pipeline, again, I'm sorry to beat a dead horse here but I'm -- maybe I'm being a little thick. In excess of 100 million cards, prior number was, roughly, 30 million. That leaves us 70 million of incremental cards that is due to BofA, and what else is in that incremental 70 million? I just want to make sure I'm getting this.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, it's BofA and miscellaneous. I mean, we're converting, some people have 100,000 accounts, 50,000 accounts, that we just don't talk much about because it don't move the needle that much. Just let me see if I can say this again because I was afraid it'd make some confusion. But I mean, we've got about over 30 million accounts on file over the next 12 to 18 months. And I've told you about when we expect in the first quarter of 20 million and in the third quarter another 10 million. In addition to -- and those are the big ones, and that's 3 or 4 big conversions. And then you have BofA and then some miscellaneous stuff.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. I appreciate that reiteration. The Bank of America option to bring the processing in-house, I mean, right now, we had a JPMorgan that exercised that option, we have a Capital One that has not. What color can you give us on, such that you can, on that particular option?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, I think the color I would give you is when we announced the JPMorgan thing, we said they were going to take it in-house at the end of the term. We did keep it a year or so longer than what we expected, but that was always the plan. On Cap One, we said it's a train wreck sort of deal, and we believe it's a train wreck deal with BofA. We don't believe that's their plan at all. But they need -- in case something happens to TSYS, they need an outlet, the need an exit plan.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "And then in terms of the price concessions, how many -- if you can look in your crystal ball a little bit, what other price concessions do you see coming, A; and then B, are those in guidance or how do you handicap those? The $8 million is a pretty reasonable size that we didn't -- I don't think was on the guidance, we didn't see coming.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I think you're right there. I don't know of any big ones that we've going on now that where we see any significant decreases. We've -- I know of one large deal that we have just completed, it's in the guidance. We just finished this bank that has caused this issue to come up. Our International business is in good shape, our U.S. business is in good shape, Canada is fine. We don't have any huge customers in Mexico and, of course, we only have the one client in Brazil and that's a fairly new contract. So I feel pretty good about where we're at. We don't have anything huge coming up in the next year.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then I think you said the other $8 million was the deconversion. And, Jim, did you say that was a net number that you got -- that it deconverted, or is it maybe will split in 3Q and 4Q, but that is net of the deconversion fee you're going to get?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Yes, the deconversion fee was about $2 million. And...", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "So essentially, the gross deconversion amount was $10 million, minus $2 million, gives us the net, $8 million?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Correct.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from the line of Dave Koning with Baird.", "David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Is it fair to say that the North America margins that have been kind of the mid-30s, kind of around 34%, 35%, are they biased down over the next several quarters now, just given the pricing concession, and then some cost to ramp the BofA contract?", "James B. Lipham", "They could drop just a little bit, but I wouldn't look for much drop in it.", "David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then secondly, on the Merchant Services side, the revenue per transaction has grown a lot the last several quarters, and especially with Durbin. I guess, how do you see that playing out, and are we in a situation that as that falls off, could we see the merchant business going into revenue decline, I guess, later this year, or do you expect that to continue to grow pretty nicely?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I would think it's just going to continue to grow from the volumes that we're seeing. I mean, we'll -- we were asked the question a while ago about Bank of America's deconversion and this is really going according to our plans and what we had forecast. And so we've been pretty pleased with the transaction growth, the organic growth that we're seeing that TSYS is acquiring. And I have no reason other than -- the TermNet affected the first 2 quarters and the revenue growth, so that will, obviously, anniversary here coming in this next quarter, and we really did it in May. So it'll have some effect, but not a whole lot.", "David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then the final question, just the non-operating expense this quarter was a little higher than it's been, at about $2 million. Is that -- what was that, I guess, and is that going to be a smaller going forward?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Currency was probably the major item there as far as the other -- we had -- I guess, it was roughly around $1.6 million or so. Yes. $1.6 million loss there, 6 months.", "Operator", "Do you have any closing remarks, Mr. Roberts?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I do. This is Phil Tomlinson. We've seen some exceptional results for the first half of 2012 and, as I mentioned earlier, we'll continue to keep a close watch on the economy and the consumer confidence or indicators. We believe we will achieve the high end of our guidance range for net income and EPS for 2012 despite the changes that we've talked about. And I do believe that indicates a real strength for TSYS, and I'm talking about the pricing concessions and the 2 delayed conversions. And again, I want to emphasize that those delays are not at TSYS, they're at a customer's request. I think the performance of each of our segments demonstrates that we're meeting or exceeding expectations and that we're making progress on our vision to be the leading payment services provider. We continue to gain strength in issuer processing, we will continue to expand into direct acquiring in the global market. In late June, the S&P upgraded our credit rating to BBB+ from BBB. I think that's a clear [indiscernible] in recognition of the strength of our financial condition.", "And to quote the Beatles, \"It's been a long and winding road,\" but we're thrilled to be working with BofA again.", "With that, I want to thank you for your interest in TSYS and your time this evening. And if you have any additional questions, please feel free to call Shawn Roberts at Investor Relations. I know you've got his number. And with that, we'll sign off and say good night.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation.

McVeigh - Macquarie Research", "Operator", "Good afternoon. My name is Catherine, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the TSYS Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] After the speaker's prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded today, October 23, 2012. Thank you. I would now like to introduce Mr. Shawn Roberts, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Shawn Roberts", "Thank you, Catherine, and welcome, everyone. On the call today, our Chairman and CEO, Phil Tomlinson, will provide highlights on the third quarter of 2012. And then he's going to turn it over to Jim Lipham, our CFO, who's going to review our financials. After that, we'll open it up for the Q&A.", "I'd like to now call your attention to the fact that we'll be making forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS's actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in TSYS's reports filed with the SEC.", "At this time, I'd like to introduce TSYS CEO and Chairman, Phil Tomlinson.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Thanks, Shawn, and good evening, everybody. We have a big crowd on the phone tonight. We appreciate that. We're certainly happy to report good results and an overall strong performance for the quarter. We had double-digit operating income growth of 12% over the third quarter of 2011. Our earnings per share was $0.32 for the quarter, an increase of 5.7% quarter-over-quarter. Total revenues were $484.1 million, up 1.8%, with this increase being somewhat tampered by a decrease of $7.6 million in reimbursable items.", "For the quarter, we also saw good increases in transactions. Our same client transactions from our issuer processing business were up 10.1% over last year. Same client transactions in our North America segment were up 9.9% and 11.4% for International. Point-of-sale transactions in our indirect merchant processing business, excluding deconverted clients, was up 9.5%. As you know, during the quarter, we formed a joint venture with Central Payments, really, to strengthen our sales distribution channel in the direct merchant acquiring business. And as we've said, we'll continue to diversify more into the direct merchant acquiring business.", "For the third quarter, our direct business represents 48% of our merchant business compared to 38% for the same time last year. Sales volume in the direct merchant business was up 20.5%. When you exclude the impact of the C Payment [ph] acquisition, sales volume in the direct merchant business was up 15.6% quarter-over-quarter for this quarter.", "As you read every day and as we know, there's more innovation and different things happening within the payments industry than I've seen maybe in the past 30 years. It's a really busy time. We have active dialogue with many new entrants and nontraditional players. We have a number of initiatives underway, including making investments through private equity funds to helping young companies entering the payments space. We're also forming partnerships with companies we feel will add incremental value to our clients and the customers we serve. The latest example of that is a partnership we recently announced with Truaxis, which will integrate our client's cardholder spending patterns and behavior to deliver personalized rewards and offers. As you know, Truaxis was recently acquired by MasterCard, and we are really excited about our agreement with them.", "I want to take just a few minutes and give you a brief update on some highlights from our 3 reporting segments. Let's go to North America first. The heavy lifting is really underway with the Bank of America conversion process that we expect to be complete in mid-2014. We continue to see success with our outreach to community banks and credit unions to offer end-to-end credit card management services, which we call TPS, and have signed agreements recently with Heritage Bank in Georgia and St. Mary's Credit Union in New Hampshire, which, by the way, is the oldest credit union in the U.S. So we have the largest credit union in the U.S., Navy Federal, and then we have the oldest credit union in the U.S. with St. Mary's Credit Union. We extended our contract with Redstone Federal Credit Union for 4 years and with Synovus and CB&T for 7 years. The Barclays and Regions consumer portfolios were successfully converted. We have approximately 100 million accounts in the conversion pipeline, which we expected to be converted by the end of 2014. We continue to see account on file growth. It was up 20.9% from the third quarter a year ago. Transactions for the quarter were up 9.5% for the year, the 10th quarter in a row of year-over-year quarterly growth.", "Now we'll move on to International. We continue to make good progress on our margin improvement program. And I think, as we've said before, you'll see some ups and downs in that. But we've got a good get well program there, and we have a keen focus on the revenue and expenses for that segment. We are optimistic about our progress.", "During the quarter in Europe, we signed SpareBank 1 in Scandinavia, which really solidifies our position as the leading provider in the Nordic region for licensed card management solutions. Additionally, we have key prospects we are hopeful to sign. Brazil continues to show progress and growth with our anchor client Carrefour, and our prospects continue to bode well for us down there. And we think there's great opportunities for added fraud and risk products.", "Our PRIME licensing pipeline remains strong with multiple upgrades and new clients in the Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa and Russia, and these include -- new signees include the QNB, [indiscernible] Bank. It's a multinational rollout for the Qatar National Bank. A pan-African bank rollout with Ecobank in our second client in the Central Asia region. In India, we have a major PRIME 4 upgrade for ICICI Bank, so on track to go live very soon.", "And we've launched our first store pilot in Delhi under the visa universal ID program, which we are running on behalf of them -- on their behalf. We have also -- as a part of that, we're providing the identification software to provide the Universal (sic) [Unique] Identification Development Authority of India the backbone infrastructure required to expand financial inclusions to millions and millions of people across India.", "Our relationship with CUP Data is expanding with the launch of CUP brand in prepaid cards in select markets around the world. We're very happy with that relationship.", "And I'll take just a minute on the Merchant segment. As I said earlier, in August, we formed the joint venture with CPAY out of San Rafael, California, which has been named one of the fastest-growing private companies in the Inc. 5000 list for the third consecutive year. CPAY adds another dimension to our direct merchant business for more than 800 active sales agents focused on signing small businesses. CPAY's pay-for-performance model is really effective in recruiting new agents and is great for getting the business signed.", "On the indirect processing side of the business, we signed new agreements with Optimal Payments, Integrity Payments and MLS Direct Network. We also renewed contracts with, of any size [ph], Merrick and BB&T, and that's 2 of our top 5 clients in the processing side of the business. In addition, we signed an agreement with Google to provide merchant funded rewards using transaction data based on consumers' buying behavior with our company out in TP on the merchant processing side.", "Now I want to turn you over to Jim Lipham, our CFO, who will review the details of this quarter's financials. Jimmy?", "James B. Lipham", "Thank you, Phil. Before we get into the slides, I'd like to make a few comments. As Phil said, we were very pleased with our double-digit operating income growth for the quarter at 12%. And as you can see from the statements, about a single-digit growth of net income and earnings per share didn't carry through the bottom line. And I wanted to -- it was because of the income tax line and the equity income line for CUP Data. They both negatively impacted our year-over-year results.", "So for taxes for the quarter, they were, last year, for the -- last quarter [indiscernible] as we had favorable taxes because of discrete items. It's the same thing that happened last year in the third quarter. We had about $6 million of discrete items that hit during the third quarter of last year, and it caused our tax rate to be about 400 basis points lower than it was for this third quarter of 2012. For the year, we're still expecting our income tax rate to be in the 32% to 33% range. So it's just discrete items and the timing of when those things hit. As you look at the year-to-date numbers, you'll see that our double-digit growth in operating income did flow through to the bottom line, so it's just a novelty for the comparison of this quarter.", "The other one had to do with CUP Data. It's net income, as we talked about it before, where we had CUP data last year in line with GAAP, and we had to defer some revenues into the third quarter of last year, which made those numbers higher by about $2.5 million. So that's now over and done with. Going forward, we should be fine. And what we said before is CUP Data will contribute 19% to 20% this year-over-year growth, and we're still on track to do that. So now that the quarter's over, we'll be able to compare favorably going forward.", "On Slide 6, if you just look at the consolidated results for the quarter and year to date, when you look on the left side, revenues before reimbursables were up 4.07% or $15 million at $406 million. It's still very good growth for the quarter. As Phil mentioned, the transactions showed up well. Same client transactions were up 10.1%, and we continue to see good growth there.", "Operating income was up 12%. We were able to hold the line on expense growth, a little over 2% or right at 2%. So we had pretty good growth -- I mean, pretty good control on expenses, which allowed our operating income to grow at 12%. When you get to net income attributable to shareholders, you'll see it's at 3.7% growth of $60 million, and that's because of the taxes and the CUP Data earnings that flowed through. I mentioned also that operating margin for the quarter is 22.38%. It's up 157 basis points over where it was in 2011. So we feel pretty good about the quarter, up -- we had $0.32 a share, up 5.7%.", "And Phil mentioned, we did have CPAY in this quarter for the first time. Year to date, if you look at revenues for reimbursables, up 5.9% or up to $1.2 billion and still very good growth there, internal growth of 5.8%. And we'll talked about on the next slide a little bit more about how we got the 5.9% growth.", "But operating income is up 15.1% at $267 million. We were able to hold expense growth for the year, 9 months, at 3.5% growth. So it's allowed us to have a good, positive productivity year so far and did grow in our operating income, which flows through to our net income at growth of 14.1% and year-to-date $0.97 per share. So this offset the quarter and the first 9 months.", "If you flip to the next page, we'll talk about the growth and revenues for the year so far, year to date. And as you can see, internal growth accounted for 5.8% growth, and then new clients have added 3.1%. And then in the acquisition, we talked about this 1.4%. Our total is 10.3% growth for the 9-month period, and then we've given up some revenues based on currency and lost business and price compression of 3.9% to get us back to a 5.9% growth in revenues for the 9-month period. So all along, good growth in revenues, and we look forward to continuing to anniversary the price concessions and the lost business.", "On the next slide, we'll go into the accounts on file. We continue to show growth year-over-year in all of our account on file categories. And Phil has mentioned the close to 100 million accounts we have in the pipeline. And we still maintain a segregation here about prepaid and commercial card as they continue to show year-over-year growth of 50% and contribute to the 18.9% growth in accounts on file. But the growth prior to that of commercial and consumer being at 8.6% is pretty much in line with where you see our revenues year-over-year. We've got about 35% of our accounts at our own bubble transaction. So that's pretty much in line with what you've got in growth in revenues at 6%.", "Next slide is North America. Just to reiterate here, revenues for reimbursables were actually down $2.6 million or 1.3% to $203.5 million. And the decline included about $17.3 million of combination of deconverted clients and price concessions. And we talked about some last quarter about price concessions coming onto to the BofA contract. The decline included also roughly about $5 million of new business and small organic growth of about $11 million. So it's pretty good organic growth quarter for us in North America.", "The segment operating income is $69.6 million, up 2.3%, and the margin was 34.2%, an increase of 118 basis points over last year's third quarter. So still good operating performance here in North America even with our renegotiated contracts.", "When you look at the volumes, you'll see total accounts of 413 million, up 20.9%. Good growth there. If you exclude the prepaid, we're at 9.7% and still good growth at 264.1 million accounts. Cardholder transactions, 9.5%, not quite double-digit but still very good growth. And same clients also up at 9.9%.", "Flip over to International, next slide. You see revenues for reimbursables. They're up $2 million dollars or 2.1% at $98.2 million. During the quarter, we did have a termination fee that helped out and was partially offset by about $7 million in pricing concessions and lost business, but the internal growth of $3.9 million was up about 4.1% over the previous year quarter.", "Segment operating income was $7.7 million. It's down 6.7%. And the operating margin was 7.9%, which is a modest decrease, about 74 basis points over last year's third quarter. Looking at account on file, at 53 million, it's an increase of 4.9%. It's good growth there. Cardholder transactions up 15%, which is showing some of the conversions that we've had since the third quarter of last year, and it was down on transaction growth.", "International is in good shape. Going over to the merchant segment, you'll see revenues for reimbursables are up 15.6% and $107.9 million or $8 million. CPAY is in this number and represents -- revenues without CPAY are up about $7.4 million or 7.9%. BAMS was in here for about $2.9 million being deconverted or offset that allows for the quarter and is offset by direct growth and acquiring of about $6.2 million outside of CPAY. Internal growth for the quarter was 3.2% or 3.4% -- 3.2 million or 3.4% for the quarter.", "The $107.8 million in revenues for reimbursables, like Phil mentioned, is approximately 48% we're associated with the direct portion of the business, and 52% was with the indirect. And in the Q3 of 2011, that was actually 38% and 62%. So we've actually increased our direct business about 10% of our mix.", "Indirect transactions, they were down 2.7%. And transactions without BAMS, that has been up 9.5%. The direct acquiring sales volume was up 17.4%. And if you excluded the CPAY, it would've been up 9.3%. So good growth in our transactions outside of deconversions, as well as good growth in the dollar volume on the direct business. Operating income was up 26%. Operating margin before reimbursables was at 32%, up 263 basis points over Q3 of 2011. So Merchant's had a good quarter.", "Next page, [indiscernible] a little bit about our cash flow. And we have had very strong cash flow for the quarter with $130.6 million from operations and $103.9 million of free cash flow. As you can see at the top, I mean, of this chart, the trailing 12 months,, cash flow from operations was $472.6 million, and free cash flow was at $356 million.", "We continue to generate EBITDA, good cash with EBITDA at $529 million over the past 12 months. Cash at the end of the quarter, you can see, was at $357 million. That's an increase of $40.3 million since the year end. And this was mainly taken away from the operating activities as dividends and our debt payment and obviously, the acquisition of CPAY.", "We did purchase 2.6 million shares of our stock in the third quarter. It's been about $61 million. We currently have 7.7 million shares remaining in our plan to buy through April of 2014. We plan on continuing to deploy our capital through these acquisitions or share repurchases as we go forward.", "We did complete our new credit facility in September, and that included a $150 million term loan over 5 years and the revolver of $350 million. And we did have 9 banks. A majority of our customers participate in this credit facility.", "On the next page, a new chart we put in for deployment of capital for the last 2 years and 9 months, as you can see, for 2010, '12 and where we are year to date through September, just to highlight the acquisitions there and the share repurchase, as well as the dividends. We do have another dividend payment coming in, in 2012. But there will be some acquisitions that we continue to look at that can possibly happen also. But ideally for this period of time, you can see that we've deployed roughly $815 million in acquisitions and share repurchases, as well as dividends. This compares to a free cash flow over this period of time about $760 million. So we basically dipped in to our cash reserves about $55 million, above our free cash flow over this 3-year period. So good deployment of capital.", "In the last slide, I'll just highlight again, as I've shown before, shareholder return for the 9 months, very good at 22.7% and the trailing 12 months of 42.35%. So good growth and still showing good shareholder return.", "With that, Phil, I'll turn it back over to you.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Thank you, Jimmy. I appreciate it. And Catherine, we'll open it up to questions now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Roman Leal Goldman Sachs.", "Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So first, on North American Services, can you just remind us or can you give us an update on the rollouts of those 2 accounts that were first out to 2013? Is that still scheduled for first quarter and third quarter of next year?", "James B. Lipham", "That was for the conversions that we have scheduled here into the fourth quarter of this year, and they have been pushed out until the third quarter of next year.", "Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So no update there? It's still kind of as planned?", "James B. Lipham", "Right.", "Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then in International, what was the deconversion fee? And just curious on what happened with the -- on the cost side, perhaps, given where the margins ended up this quarter despite that deconversion fee.", "James B. Lipham", "The deconversion fee is pretty much like it was for the last quarter that we talked, and there are costs associated with that, that are -- the one out of the P&L every quarter, too. They were amortized costs that were booked on the balance sheet, and they will be offset against the revenues. But it's not that net number is more. You've got to record it in the reduction of expense to go along with the reduction of revenues. It will be finished this year. I mean, this is one of those times where we had to amortize it over the end of the year up to the end of the year. So you had part of the deconversion fee in the last quarter. You had part of it in the third, and we'll have some more on the fourth.", "Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it, okay. That makes sense. One last one. On the acquisitions, obviously there's still -- there's a lot of potential, I guess, targets for you out there, especially on the merchant acquiring side. Just curious, what types of deals are you looking at? Obviously, it's on the direct side. But are you looking at e-commerce versus more of a traditional play, international, domestics? Just help us out there.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, Roman, I mean, we've been talking to a lot of people over the last couple of years, and I would say that we're looking at most anything that comes up. Some of it, we don\u2019t look at it very hard. But obviously, we'd like to be more in the e-commerce business. We would certainly like to take a look at international. There's some properties here in the U.S. that we would be interested in that come up from time to time. So I mean, we're open minded, but certainly, e-commerce would be one of them.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane.", "Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "This is actually Ashish on behalf of Bryan. I had a quick question regarding the North American segment. So you saw some -- you highlighted the pricing pressure from the Bank of America, signing the Bank of America deal. How should we think about pricing pressure going forward considering that Capital One renewal annual will be in the third quarter but you also had a few more renewals? How should we think about the pricing pressure going forward over the next couple of quarters?", "James B. Lipham", "I think over the next few quarters, you'll see pretty much the price concessions just like you've seen it as we go and anniversary what we have done with the Capital One, as well as BofA contracts.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "And Cap One anniversary is...", "James B. Lipham", "I think it's in...", "Shawn Roberts", "October.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "The anniversary is this month.", "Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. So hopefully, the pricing pressure should decline or in a sense, the pricing pressure -- the headwind from the pricing pressure should decline going forward because Capital One anniversaries and then you just have the one big Bank of America and obviously smaller ones over there.", "James B. Lipham", "Correct.", "Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. International segment, we just saw the AOF trending down. How should we think about the AOF going forward? Do you expect them to maintain this level or go up, down going forward? And the drivers for those?", "James B. Lipham", "Well, we continue to have some good prospects in the International segment. So I would say that, that, with respect to the account on file numbers, to go up.", "Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. On the Merchant side, a quick question. On the CPAY JV, we -- if I'm correct, there was $7.2 million contribution from the JV, and that's only for 2 months. And then going forward, we'll get a full quarter of benefit from the JV -- or the acquisition. Is that right?", "James B. Lipham", "That's correct.", "Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And just one final question on North American segment. Any color on the demand for project-based or Value-Added Services?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Could you repeat that question?", "Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes. Just any color on the demand for project-based or Value-Added Services in the North American segment?", "James B. Lipham", "Demand.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Yes, that demand has stayed pretty strong.", "James B. Lipham", "And our project revenues continue to be a surprise every quarter. So continuing to be a good source of revenue.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steven Kwok.", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Just had a question around the operating margin. Is this seasonality around that line? And also with regards to decrease in the International Services operating margin, are you still comfortable with getting back to that 20% by the end of 2015?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Yes, we still are.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "We're comfortable with that. And yes, there is some seasonality to this business, particularly when you consider that we get a lot of our revenues based on the transaction business, when you start thinking about the cardholder business and the traditional Total Acquiring Solutions, which is a processing business as opposed to a direct merchant acquiring business. As the seasons go, I mean, you can track them really every year over the past 30 years. Like we have just gone through a month or so ago, the back-to-school season. You have the holiday season coming up right after Thanksgiving, which is absolutely the biggest of the year. And different holidays generate more transactions and more volume than others, but it is somewhat seasonal.", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "And could you just talk about which quarter you have the highest in terms of operating margin and which ones the lowest?", "James B. Lipham", "So the fourth quarter would be the highest operating margins.", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Sure. And the lowest one would be...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I think it's the first.", "James B. Lipham", "Well, be the first quarter.", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then in terms of the tax rate, I believe you mentioned the range of 32%, 33% for 2012.", "James B. Lipham", "Right.", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "What sort of bench should we use for 2013?", "James B. Lipham", "Well, we haven't kind of got our guidance together on that yet. But I don't know that we will deviate too much from where we are.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "And we're worried about what's going on in Washington, too.", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Understood. And finally, just speaking on the guidance, is your guidance unchanged? I didn't see the guidance in the...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "No, we're staying with our guidance. We think we'll be on the high end of our guidance.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Greg Smith.", "Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Can you just talk about the card link offers, the deal with Truaxis. Is this something that could become a material revenue contributor for you?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, we think it's another value-added product. We really like what those guys have. We think they've got a really good mousetrap, and I guess only time will tell on that. But we believe that's a great product, and we're excited about our partnership with them. And we like them, and we think it's got a lot of potential.", "Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "And then just shifting to CUP Data, should we expect sort of steady growth there? Or are there any potential inflection points coming up where we could see that accelerate?", "James B. Lipham", "I think you're going to have steady growth. I think, like I said, after we got through this third quarter comparison, you'll anniversary now, and we'll be seeing some good growth. And we're still shooting at 20% year-over-year growth in '12 versus 2011.", "Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "okay, great. And then just looking at your merchant acquiring business broadly in the U.S., there's obviously new competitors. You talked about just a little bit about potentially partnering with new competitors or even investing, but do you feel like the business is under siege in any way? Or do you feel flip it and see more opportunities than you have in the past? I'm obviously talking about things like Square and other players entering Groupon. Just how are you feeling about the business and your opportunities overall?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, I think we've got great opportunities. We've got the ability to go out and make an acquisition or 2. Obviously, there's been a lot of publicity, and the market has been stirred up by the likes of Square in particular. We are looking at ways as to how we can compete with that, whether it makes sense. So we've got a lot of arms in the fire, Greg. And some, we will pull out, and they will be really hot for us, and we are excited about that. But it's a good business. It's a profitable business. We like it. We think we're getting better at it. As time goes by, we've got to add some channels. An online enrollment is one of the channels that we need. We need some more e-commerce that makes sense to us. You don't see us out just trying to buy just a big merchant portfolio that's pretty vanilla. I don't think you'll see us doing that today, but we might at some point. But we're trying to make sure that we get all of the access channels filled and so we can grow this thing organically at some point.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "I was wondering, in the aftermath of the Bank of America deal, has this help to credentialize you in any way, Phil, to further escalate or accelerate conversations with other top 10 issuers? And then I have a follow-up question after that.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, I think certainly it helps that. I mean, I think the fact that Bank of America left us to take it in-house to MBNA in 2005, that portfolio had been with us since 1985. There was this conventional wisdom in the marketplace out there that all big players had to process in-house. We have argued against that for years. In 2006, we signed Cap One and brought them home to TSYS. And then we've signed this BofA deal, which we're very excited about. But then if you look at Canada, we really have got contracts with every major bank in Canada. We do business with all of the major banks in the U.K., with Deutsche Bank. And so we think there's -- we think we're in a position -- we're in a better position than anybody on earth to do business with the mega issuers. And we think that it does credentialize us even more than we were in the past. So I think that's true.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up, maybe for Jimmy. At the Analyst Day, Bill Pruett had articulated North American Services growth rates 2012 to 2014 in the 8% to 10% range. That would imply a material escalation from what you have done year to date and certainly in this quarter. I'm wondering, to do that 8% to 10%, is that based on the current book of business through organic growth? Or are there incremental wins that are contemplated in that kind of long-term growth trajectory?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I think it was based on a 3-year period there, that pipeline, and we think we've got a very good chance of being there.", "James B. Lipham", "I think if you look at our current numbers, you see that for the 9-month period, and as I said, we grew revenues 10% before we had price concessions and deconversions. And we don't plan on having that much in price concessions and deconversions every year as we go forward. I mean, we still have some fallout from the recession, as we talked about last quarter or the quarter before with ABN AMRO, which got in trouble after the failed acquisition. And we don't think we have any other large customers that are in trouble financially.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg.", "Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "It's actually Ramsey El-Assal for Jason. At your Analyst Day, you provided long-term top line guidance from the processing side of your business around the bank processing side of your business but held off giving guidance for the Merchant side due to recent acquisitions, kind of muddying the water a little bit. Since then, have you developed any kind of clearer picture on the Merchant side of what type of -- sort of more color around this sort of future growth trends on that side of the business? Do you have any kind of incremental thoughts there?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "We don't have anything that we'd be willing to go into today.", "Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. I know that you currently play in the prepaid space as a back-end processor. And to what degree have you explored -- I think you had mentioned this in the past, but what are your latest thoughts on where you would explore, participating more in the front end of that business, say, program manager or something like that? Is that something we might see and expect from you in the future? Or does it drift a little too far from your kind of existing businesses?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I think it's something that we would like to look at. I wouldn't say that you'll see it in the future. It will be a pretty big change for us. But I mean, I think it's something that we have to look at. I mean, it's just like getting into or entering the direct merchant acquiring business. I mean, it was just one of those things that just made sense, and that business may makes sense at some point. It's a pretty -- it's an interesting business right now with all of the turmoil and change that's going on.", "Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Right. And then you mentioned in your opening comments a bit about some pipeline strength in Brazil. Can you give us any additional color there? Are there any -- has your Carrefour -- success with Carrefour opened up other sizable opportunities in Brazil? Do you expect a mix shift in terms of percentage of International revenues kind of toward Brazil? Any color there would be helpful.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "One, Carrefour is growing, and we're very happy with what's going on with Carrefour. Two, it has given us credibility, and we have more than a couple of prospects there that we think we have a good chance of doing some business with. And I'd be less than candid if I gave you any numbers because we just don't announce anything until we have a contract on hand. But we're optimistic about what's going on in Brazil. And that was the reason that we went to Brazil to start with. We see it as a growth market, and it just takes time to build up credibility and to where people trust you. This is a -- these sales efforts are pretty long term. It doesn't matter whether you're in the U.S., Brazil or the U.K. You just don't do it overnight.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer.", "Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "I just wanted to ask you if you wouldn't mind commenting on your feel of the economy right now. You guys have a huge amount of transaction data. How does it feel in terms of directionality through the quarter and what we've seen intact over?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I don't want to be too negative, but I think it does feel like it's starting to slow down a little bit. And I don't -- our numbers are good, but you'd like to see them continuing to grow higher. And transactions, while they're growing, I just don't feel -- I don't feel great about the economy. And I'm like a lot of people. I was going to say this later, but the truth is we need to get this election behind us, this fiscal cliff, the tax questions. And there's a whole lot more uncertainty out there that I think people are just -- have some reservations about. I want us to have a great fourth quarter, and we need some more certainty for a lot of people to really want to go out and feel good about it and spend money. I've been amazed -- not amazed, but I'm really thrilled at the way the year has gone so far. But the part that has really astounded me is how well we've done in Europe with all of the bad news coming out of Europe. Our transactions increases in Europe are higher than they are in the U.S. So I think there's some slowness there. Can I put my finger on anything in particular, not any more than you or anybody else can. And so I think we're going to have to wait and see. I mean, we're sticking with our guidance. We think we're probably at the high end of that guidance. So hopefully, if we're lucky, we'll exceed it by a bit. But we're comfortable with that.", "Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Just on a completely separate topic, just what's your general thoughts on the merchants piecing together MCX, which seems it's sort of becoming a standards board, so to speak. But the merchants seemed very intent forward with coupling a payment product to their loyalty product likely in the form of decoupled debit. I'm just curious of your view of the merchants' likelihood of succeeding with that. And could TSYS play a role in that initiative?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I think TSYS could certainly play a role in that initiative. A lot of those big merchants are our customers anyway. And there's been -- Isis was a -- is a group of very, very large players. This Merchant Exchange is very large. There's a lot of different opportunities out there today, and there's a lot of different solutions, solutions that I would think that some of them even are not public. And I don't know that I would -- I wouldn't bet this company on any of them today. I think it's just a matter of waiting and see -- of a wait-and-see. But those guys certainly have the wherewithal to put something together. Whether it'd be successful or not, who knows. But we're studying as much as we can. It's pretty interesting that you mentioned that though. Our fastest-growing debit card customer today is a decoupled debit player.", "Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And just out of curiosity, are the economics and that type of transaction similar to that in a, call it, Visa PIN transaction or Visa signature transaction?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Yes, very similar.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brett Huff.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Two quick questions on numbers, and then I have 2 quick -- 2 questions on more business. The term fee amount, Jim, I think you said, but I think I missed it. Can you just let us know that again, what it was this quarter?", "James B. Lipham", "It was a couple of million dollars.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "And then the quarter-to-date same-store sales transactions, what are you guys seeing so far in the fourth quarter? I guess that kind of falls upon the prior question on what you're feeling about the economy now, but anything you can share with us today.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "No, not really. I mean, we don't track that on a day-to-day basis. But I'm optimistic. I hope I didn't sound pessimistic earlier. But we just need to answer some questions and move on, and we're hoping the general public. We'll buy into whatever comes about. We can get on with business. We have some confidence.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then a couple of business questions. First, just a follow-up on the Square question earlier. I guess just to put a finer point on it, of your merchants that you would have, sort of do you have a sense of how much of the volume that comes from merchants that are on the smaller end the Square might go after? And I don\u2019t know if you want to define that as 50,000 in card processing volume a year, 200,000 or whatever the number is...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I think it's relatively small.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Small like 100 or 200 basis points over the portfolio or more?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I don't know that I could -- honestly, it'd just be a guess, but we think the numbers is pretty small.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then is there -- when you talk to your ISOs, what is their interpretation of Square? And are they -- do they see a way to compete with Square here near term? Because in my view, they're the ones who seem to be sort of on the front battle lines right now.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Yes, I would agree with that. I think the feedback we've got is, it's real. I think several -- a year or so ago, a lot of people didn't buy into that concept. I think we think it's real. There's also other competitors out there that do the same thing. Intuit is one. There's 4 or 5 more that have a very, very similar product, very little difference. So we would like to be able to come out with our own version of that because we do think that for a certain market, that's a very attractive product. And I got to give those guys credit for putting it together.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then last question. The North American margins were better than we thought they would be -- and I listened for things that might have tipped me off about why that might have been. Jimmy, was there anything in there that you want to -- we could highlight that might be the case? Or is that just a better run rate number to use?", "James B. Lipham", "It was just a better run rate. I mean, the only thing that we did have some capitalization going on, on some of our projects, as well as the Bank of America.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dave Togut.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "I guess first of all, I just wanted to ask about the North America business. I think excluding the price reduction, I think revenue growth would have been about 1% year-over-year. And I know consumer accounts were up about 7%, transactions up about 9%. What really accounts for the delta between kind of some of the core account growth or transaction growth numbers in that revenue growth number?", "James B. Lipham", "So one of the things in our account on file growth numbers, we did have a -- in our government services area, we had about 16 million accounts that were put on during this quarter that were inactive accounts and still are, but they are charged a fee, flat fee now. So it made the numbers on the account on file grow a little bit higher than what you see in the revenue growth. So that was unusual for the quarter.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "David, those are primarily student loans.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "And as we look forward then, when you talk about the potential to ramp revenue growth back to 8% to 10%, will you imagine that those core transaction account numbers would grow more closely in line with revenue growth, kind of a year or 2 out?", "James B. Lipham", "I think you still have to take into account the bubble pricing that we have on about 35% of our accounts, our transactions. But yes, the 8% to 10% is coming from the pipeline.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Got you, okay. And then finally, I think Brett just asked about margins. Long term, is your guidance still -- I think it was somewhere -- it was 31% to 33% or something around there for the North America margins?", "James B. Lipham", "Yes, it's still there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the lineup Will Maynard [ph].", "Unknown Analyst", "This is Will Maynard [ph]. I actually was trying to ask a question, but I think we're having some technical difficulties. My apologies. I think this question is surrounding the news today regarding the Target portfolio sale. And I know that Target has historically been a client of yours. Can you just address that and any potential impacts that may come about as a result of that sale?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Sure. We're very comfortable. We have a contract with Target up through 2019, have a great relationship with them. They are very transparent with this whole process. They'll still control the processing and the customer service and all of that. So we don't really see any changes.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay. And one housekeeping question. Can you just mention the merchant growth excluding the acquisition? I thought I heard 7.4%. I just want to make sure I have that right.", "James B. Lipham", "That's correct.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Togut.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Phil, can you provide a little more detail on the consumer credit account on file number up 0.4% year-over-year and I guess maybe some perspective on underlying organic growth in that line item versus lost business? And then just some thoughts on what you're hearing from your largest issuers with respect to their own marketing programs and consumer credit overall spending thoughts?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I think what we're seeing from the really larger guys is they're being fairly aggressive. We had a board meeting today, and we actually talked about that where there's a lot of folks getting solicitations, there's more and more advertising on television. If you've been watching television lately, you've been seeing some pretty serious advertising. So I think, like I've said before, I think the banks are really interested in cards again because it really gives some opportunity to charge some rates where they can actually make money as opposed to losing a lot of fees that they've lost over the last several years. It's a good market for the banks, and I think they see this business coming back. And they want to be in it, and they want to be more aggressive. And that's why we think that we've seen people like Huntington and Key and Regions come back in plus several others that I'm sure will come back in over time. So we're feeling good on a go-forward basis. Again, that's why we think we've got what I think is a very strong pipeline. Jim, I didn't know if you want to add.", "James B. Lipham", "I mean, part of the consumer problem, we did have some accounts that were purged during the quarter. But outside of that, I agree with you. I mean, the growth is...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "We've talked about this purge business before. As we get closer to year end, we'll have more purges, and that is a very low income. If you have an inactive account at TSYS, which probably is an account that has had no activity for about 2 years, most of our clients will purge those accounts off. And we'll just put them in a vault somewhere, and they may want to try to activate them. It is a very, very small fee that we get for keeping those accounts on file. So it's nothing too dramatic when we get those accounts purged off. Obviously, we would prefer that they stay on. But as the banks, it's their option to go ahead and purge them.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "How should we think about organic growth and consumer credit accounts excluding the purges and lost business?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I'm sorry, can you just -- Did you get it, Jimmy?", "James B. Lipham", "I mean, most of our growth that we talked about from the North America segment in the 8% to 10% range is going to come from consumer. SO I think that's -- just like Phil said, you will have some purges, but a majority of what we put on is going to come in the consumer area as we go in the pipeline.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Right.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Just a final question for me. Referencing your earlier comments on Brazil, you've got the big contract with Carrefour there. FIS has a strong beachhead there with Banco Bradesco. Are you going after the traditional bank card issuer processing market in Brazil? Or are you more focused on retail cards?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "We're focused on both, honestly. We compete with FIS on a day-to-day basis in the U.S. And certainly, we would be willing to do it there. And hopefully, we can.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh.", "Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research", "At the Analyst Day, you commented that you're starting see solicitations come back for the first time in a couple of years here. Has that continued? And just -- the pace is special projects? And has any of the -- it sounds like things are okay, but maybe just a little hesitancy around the election as opposed to anything, sea change? Just Any thoughts ut that would be helpful.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, I think we probably all watch television too much and see too many pundits on it. But I feel pretty good. Our projects are up. When I say projects, I'm talking about new products. Our special projects are up. Our revenue on those lines is up. Our accounts on file are growing. There's some major marketing activity out there. We're seeing new regional banks enter the business in an aggressive way, buying back portfolios. We think that bodes well for TSYS and our industry. We've got good prospects. We have a good pipeline. And I'll talk about all of that when we close, but we feel good. We'd feel better if the government would settle down and we could get this fiscal cliff dealt with and some of these other things that will send shockwaves through this economy if we don't get it dealt with.", "Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research", "Understood. Phil, any sense of -- the $100 million that will be converted by the end of '14, how that sets up in terms of first half of the year versus back half of the year, just any direction on that?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Most of it is in the last half of '13 and through about the third quarter of '14. I don't have that with me. [indiscernible] next year.", "I think it's probably time for us to shut down and move on. And if there are any other questions, you can certainly call Shawn. And he'll get you to the right people if he can't answer it.", "I just wanted to close with a couple of remarks. As we head into the fourth quarter, we are optimistic, and certainly we'll be happy to get the election, the fiscal cliff, the tax questions behind us. And hopefully, after that, we'll see a much more energized economy regardless of who wins. We'll continue to look for opportunities that'll add long-term value to this company. And from time to time, as the market makes sense, we certainly will buy or repurchase shares.", "I believe that TSYS is a unique company and an opportunity for investors. And I'll give you some reasons here. In 2013 we're going to celebrate our 30th anniversary. I think I said something about staying power in this business. There's a lot of folks who haven't made it over the years. We have a fortress balance sheet. We have really strong cash flow. We have blue chip clients. I mean, our list of clients is like a who's who of the financial industry. We have long-term contracts. We have a recurring revenue model. We have the gold standard in technology, and we invest millions in that every year. We have 100 million account pipeline today that will grow. There are significant barriers of entry -- to enter this business. It's very expensive. I think our international and merchant acquiring businesses add diversification and growth. Our prospect pipeline is strong globally. We have the financial strength to do M&A and stock repurchases, and maybe most of all is our -- we have a great team of very dedicated professionals that have a real will to win. So I think it's a unique company. And we appreciate your interest, and we thank you for your support. And we want to be as helpful and transparent as we can. So thank you for being with us today, and we look forward to talking to you at the first of the year.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded today, January 22, 2013. Thank you.", "I would now like to introduce your speaker, Mr. Shawn Roberts, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Shawn Roberts", "Thank you, Lucy, and welcome, everyone. On the call today, our Chairman and CEO, Phil Tomlinson, will provide highlights on the fourth quarter and year-end 2012. And then he'll turn it over to Jim Lipham, our CFO, who's going to review our financials. After that, we'll open it up for Q&A.", "I'd like to now call your attention to the fact that we'll be making forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS's actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in TSYS's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "At this time, I'd like to introduce TSYS's CEO, Phil Tomlinson.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Thank you, Shawn, and good evening, everybody. As I'm sure you've already seen in our earnings release, we ended 2012 with a very solid fourth quarter in every respect. We reported a $0.33 EPS for the fourth quarter and achieved the high end of our '12 earnings per share guidance of $1.30. It is a 13.1% increase over 2011. We're at the high end of our net income guidance as a result of strong growth in same client transactions.", "Transactions from our North America and international same client issuer processing businesses were up 12% year-over-year. Point-of-sale transactions in our indirect merchant or processing businesses, excluding deconverted clients, were up 9.9%, and sales volume in our direct merchant business was up 12.9%. Although '12 ended with a lot of uncertainty with the government handling of the potential fiscal cliff, holiday spending certainly improved, at least from what we saw of it. The holiday season, the TSYS card issuing clients were ahead of 2011 by 15% if you take North America and internationally together.", "You may know it or you may not, we have just entered 2013 as our 30th year as a public company, and we believe we're one of the more tenured companies in the payment industry, and I'm proud to say we lead the market with a passionate and experienced leadership team and about 8,700 team members who consistently deliver on great quality and developing long-term relationships and continuous quality improvement. You've heard me say before that we believe this is what distinguishes TSYS among its peers in this payments business.", "Our tagline for the 30th anniversary is \"Looking back but moving forward\". And while we reflect and celebrate our success and lessons that we've learned over the past 30 years, we're certainly building on that past and looking forward to the future, working with clients to identify the innovations that are going to drive this business forward and continue to ensure our success along with our clients.", "Before I move into these 3 segments, I'd like to mention our '13 guidance. This is the second year in a row that we've guided to a double-digit EPS growth and strong topline revenue growth coming from improved economic confidence and growth into card and merchant segments. '13, we believe, will be an exciting year for us. We have the previously mentioned conversions of approximately 30 million accounts in the second half of the year, and we'll continue to build toward a conversion of the Bank of America consumer portfolio in 2014. We were also planning on implementing new products and services provided from our -- that came with our 2012 acquisitions in our merchant business and continue to build our international footprint.", "Let me share some fourth quarter news within our 3 reporting segments. In North America, we renewed our contract with a top 5 major retailer and signed an agreement for their Canadian business during the fourth quarter. We successfully converted the consumer portfolio of Scotiabank in Mexico from a competitor. We signed an agreement with First American State Bank and experienced growth in new accounts from several community, regional and credit unions that were -- regional banks and credit unions that were not on our systems a year ago.", "And as we shared last quarter, our conversion pipeline is approximately 102 million accounts on file. I've talked about adding the 30 million in the second half and then, of course, BofA in the summer of '14.", "Transactions for North America were up 12.7%, the 11th quarter in a row of year-over-year quarterly growth.", "In international, we focus on delivery to existing clients, securing new prospects to build our conversion and pipeline and ongoing effort to improve future margins. Jim is going to talk about margins in a little bit, and we'll answer your questions on that.", "In Europe, we renewed 2 existing client contracts and are finalizing a third which represents almost 40% of the existing revenue now under contract over the next 5 to 7 years.", "We're also proud that we launched our first credit card in France through Advanzia on a cross-border basis and will continue to broaden our commercial card footprint through multiple U.S. issuers as they expand their programs across Europe and Asia.", "As you'll recall, we think we have a very large market share of the commercial card business that's branded Visa and MasterCard. Last week, we announced an innovative payment technology solutions we're providing for Visa in India. This pilot, the Saral Money program, was launched in the fourth quarter and provides Indian consumers with access to financial services and electronic payments for the first time by linking Visa accounts to the Indian Unique Identification Accounts. Our technology is used to authenticate account holders by transporting biometric information such as fingerprints from the point-of-sale to the Unique Identification Authority of India.", "In the market segment, in December, we completed the acquisition of ProPay in Utah. It's now a wholly owned sub of TSYS that provides simple, secured and affordable payment solutions for organizations that range from small home-based entrepreneurs to billion-dollar enterprises. And they do a lot of it with a square-like-dongle product offering that is doing very well, and we're very excited about this new acquisition. We believe we can sell their products, not only for our own direct merchant business but into our processing business as well.", "With our indirect merchant business, the processing business, we signed new agreements with Priority Payments and renewals with BBVA Compass, Payments Alliance International and Columbia Bank. We also were fortunate that we signed a major U.S. theater chain and deployed several thousand encrypted terminals into that theater chain.", "Now I want to turn it over to Jim Lipham, our CFO, who will review the quarter's financials, and then we'll open it up for questions. Jimmy?", "James B. Lipham", "Thank you, Phil. As Phil said, we're extremely pleased with our quarter results for 2012. In terms of our guidance, we achieved our revenues before reimbursable guidance and slightly exceeded our total revenues and net income and earnings per share. So we're very proud of where we finished in 2012.", "We continue to add shareholder value. During the year, we purchased 3.2 million shares of stock for $75 million. We used $190 million to invest in acquisitions, and we returned another $94 million in dividends to our shareholders. Our total return -- shareholder return for 2012 was 11.55%. So very good year, we've invested a lot of capital.", "If you look at the first slide on the quarter numbers. For the quarter, our revenues before reimbursables were up 2.7%. This was achieved by new business, the CPAY acquisition and internal growth adding about 5.7% revenue growth. And then that was offset by price concessions and lost business of about 3%. So that's how we got to the 2.7% growth.", "Our operating income was flat at $89.8 million, which was influenced heavily by these price concessions and the delays that we discussed previously and the timing of conversions for the fourth quarter.", "We also had an adjustment for our share-based comp charge of about $2.5 million during the quarter. Our operating margin or revenues before reimbursables was 21.46%, that's down 55 basis points from 2011. And you get into net income, you see us up 1.7% as we benefited in our equity income line due to the U.S. GAAP adjustments in 2011 that we made on the CUP Data. And I think I mentioned last quarter that, that was going to be the last time we will have a misrepresented -- or an uncomparable quarter, but it did have some adjustments in the fourth quarter. So next year, in '13, it will be a very favorable comparison.", "Also our effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.5% which was up slightly from the fourth quarter of '11 where it was at 32.8%. And this is mainly due to the delay in the passing of the R&D credits for 2012 which got pushed into 2013. Phil mentioned that cardholder transaction grew at 13.2%, earnings per share for the quarter at $0.33, up 3.7%, and just a great quarter.", "When you look at the year-to-date revenues before reimbursables, we're up 5% or $77.8 million. Internal growth was 5.1%, and we'll talk about that on the next slide a little bit, which was about $77 million. So we had operating income grow at 10.9%, it's mainly because of our revenues growing at 5% and expenses being held at 3.5% growth. But our margins at 22.1% are up about 117 basis points, so over where they were in 2011. And we finished the year again at $1.30, up 13.1%.", "As I flip through the chart on the revenues change, you can see the 5.1% growth, that's from internal growth. New clients added 3.2%, and then the acquisition of TermNet and CPAY added 1.8%, for a total increase of about 10.1%.", "The ProPay acquisition that Phil mentioned, we did acquire it at the end of December but it had no operating results for us in 2012. So it'll be a complete addition in '13. The 10.1% growth that you saw with revenues here is offset again by 4.7% from our lost business and price concessions. So that's how we get back down to our 5% growth in the revenues for the year.", "Next slide is our consolidated accounts on file. The summary shows growth in all areas year-over-year. Growth in our major revenue-producing accounts was at 4.8% as you can see right there in the middle the subtotal, and which pretty much mirrors our revenue growth of 5%. The less active accounts shown in the yellow also had good strong growth, pushing our total account on file growth to 18.6% for the year. That's good growth of 75 million accounts. And as we go forward, Phil mentioned the pipeline of 102 million accounts and the 5.25% coming on in the third and fourth quarter of '13 and remainder in '14.", "As we move on to the segments, North America. You can see the drivers there, strong internal growth increased volumes, price concessions and the like. Revenues before reimbursables were up about $4 million at 1.9% to $213.6 million. This increase was driven by new clients as internal growth was offset by the loss in revenues associated with deconverted clients and price concessions. The segment operating income of $77.8 million is up 16.9% or $11.2 million. The margin was at 36.42%, an increase of 466 basis points over last year's fourth quarter.", "Remember, in this year, we have had the effect of dedicating less internal resources to North America as we move them to international, and this is an effect that made the margin as high as it is. If you -- on a pro forma basis without those reallocation, we'd have a margin in North America of 32.9% compared to 31.7% last year. So just remember, those expenses were just allocated. It has nothing to do with growing our expense base.", "Accounts on file, volumes. You can see there growing at 20.9% and 16.2% if you take out prepaying single-use accounts. Good growth in transactions at 12.7%.", "The international services, you can see revenue before reimbursables was flat at $102.4 million. New client revenues were offset by price concessions and lost business, total of about $9 million. Operating income was $6.1 million, that's down 49.3%. And the operating margin was 5.9% on revenues before reimbursables. This is a decrease of 572 basis points over last year's.", "When you affect the change in the international resources that were allocated, if you took those back out, the margin in the international would be at 13.1%, which would compare favorably to the fourth quarter of '11 at 11.7%. So outside of the realignment of resources, I think we had a little improvement of a little over 100 basis points in our margin in international. We should see that continue to improve in a little faster pace as we go forward.", "You can see the transactions account on files up 3.5%, transactions were up 18.6%, so pretty good quarter for the international segment.", "On the merchant side of the house, revenues before reimbursables increased 5.5% or $5 million. When you exclude CPAY, CPAY was in there for a little over $11.7 million, the revenues were actually down mainly because of the BAMS deconversion that's still going on and some Durbin revenues that we had in the fourth quarter that we didn't carry through.", "Of the $105.9 million of revenues, approximately 50% are direct -- or associated with the direct business and 50% with the indirect. In the Q4 of last year of '11, that ratio was 43% in the direct and 57% in the indirect. So you can see we've had a shift, a pretty large shift here, of what makes up the revenues in the merchant side of the house. I will mention at this point that the margins associated with the direct aspect of the merchant business are a lot lower than what they are from the indirect. And you'll see that when I talk to you briefly about -- or you can see that in the margin when you get in there, this is 28.8%. And that's down roughly 400 basis points from where it was last year at this time.", "But anyway, the POS transactions were up 9.9% without BAMS, as Phil mentioned. And then the direct acquiring transactions were up 16.6%. Sales volume was up 12.9% on the direct.", "But the margin, as I said, is down to 28.8%. We do expect that to continue in 2013. We've had one other going on in the merchant segment that hit us with about $2 million worth of expenses in the fourth quarter, and that is the conversion from FNBO's back end to a consolidated platform on TAS increased our cost in the fourth quarter and for the year. This work is going to continue on through 2013, with roughly $10 million to $12 million in incremental operating expenses, and the project will be completed in 2014, and I'll talk some more about this when we get to our 2013 guidance.", "Next page is our cash flow. We have very strong cash flow for the quarter, with $121.8 million from operations and $88.2 million of free cash flow. On a year-to-date basis, our cash flow from operations at $456 million, the free cash flow was at $338 million. We continue to generate good cash with EBITDA at $528 million, that's up $36.6 million or 7.5% from prior year. Cash at the end of the year was down $248 million -- to $248 million, a decrease of $68.4 million mainly driven by the acquisitions, dividends and debt payments. During the fourth quarter, we did obtain a 5-year software license and maintenance arrangement for approximately $36 million, and these are licenses. They help support our core processing system. You will see that in the fourth quarter.", "During the quarter, we did purchase 600,000 shares of stock for $13.4 million. And I mentioned, it brought our total to 3.2 million shares for the year or $75 million. We currently have about 7.1 million shares remaining in our buyback plan through April of 2014. And as I mentioned before, we'll continue to deploy capital either through acquisitions or share repurchases as we go forward.", "The last couple of slides have to do with our guidance for 2013. I thought I'd just give you some assumptions behind that. As you know, we -- reimbursable items are pass-throughs and we tend to -- the management focuses on revenues before those items. And here, we're estimating we'll grow in the 6% to 8% range in 2013. This growth in revenues is going to include internal revenue growth in the 5% to 7% range. Our currency rate exchanges used in the guidance are 1.60 for the pound and 1.40 for the euros. We continue to see BAMS migrate off our systems in our merchant segment, and our guidance assumes an additional $9 million to $10 million in revenues before reimbursables will be lost in 2013.", "The migration of the back end from the First National Bank of Omaha, the migration to a new platform, I discussed earlier, will continue in 2013 and is projecting we complete it to reduce our future processing expense by $5 million to $6 million a year compared to our current expense, but, obviously, will going to impact our current margins in the short-term and return for the long-term value of our direct acquiring profit margins.", "We expect our operating income margin to be in the 22% to 24% range on calculated with revenues before reimbursables. 2013 will also see a full year impact of the noncontrolling interest for our CPAY acquisition. As a result, we anticipate the noncontrolled and interest lines to more than double. For 2013, we expect the noncontrolling interest net income to be approximately $12 million to $13 million in 2013, which on a per-share basis would be about $0.067 per share compared to the $0.03 that we had in this year.", "Our net income growth is in the 9% to 11% range. Earnings per share is 10% to 12%. Obviously, it's positively impacted by the net income growth and the share repurchase program. And we have estimated our average shares for the year at 187 million shares to assist you in developing your EPS.", "And with that, the last slide is just a picture of the makeup in -- of the growth and revenues as well as the lost business. And you can see the acquisitions play the bigger part, internal growth can possibly be a bigger contributor. But overall, we're looking for 6% to 8% growth in revenues before reimbursables.", "And with that, Phil, I'll turn it back over to you.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Lucy, we'll now open it up to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of David Togut.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Evercore Partners. The CEO of First Data, just over a week ago, announced he was retiring.  Does this have any impact on any of the business that you're competing for, either on the merchant or the card issuer side?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I'm not sure I know how to answer that, David. The way I read it, it was for health reasons. I mean, we obviously are competing with them on a lot of business, but I can't say that it has any impact on anything.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Just shifting gears for a minute. 102 million accounts in your pipeline, does that include HSBC North America?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Yes.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "So you have a firm conversion date on that business?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "We do. It is in the third quarter.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. How many accounts is that?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "We don't give exact account number. We just give ranges. And I've said it's -- we have a total of about 30 million we should add in the third quarter and fourth quarter of this year. But it's more than that. I mean, there are several conversions we're working on.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just finally, in your 2013 outlook, what's the organic North American consumer and commercial credit card account on file number embedded in that?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "We don't have those actual account numbers out there. We just figure it on the revenues and sales.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of James Friedman.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "So the first one is with regard to the operating expenses. Jimmy, they -- typically, SG&A is typically run about 13% of revenue. It was a little bit higher than that. I know you alluded to some in your prepared comments. Can you just repeat why it trended a little bit higher this quarter?", "James B. Lipham", "Well, we really had 2 things that were pretty large in the quarter. It was in the development of the new platform for the merchant segment, we had roughly $2.5 million there -- excuse me, $2 million there. And then we had an adjustment that were made in the share-based compensation that was around $2.5 million that came in the fourth quarter. And then on top of that was [indiscernible] our incentive plans, which normally happens in the fourth quarter. But those were the 2 biggest things.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "So in terms of 2013 as a whole, what should we be thinking about SG&A as a percentage of revenue just for our modeling purposes?", "James B. Lipham", "I think we'll still going to end up with a margin of 22% to 24%, so continue to use the same.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Got it, okay. And then last thing for me, so it sounds like China UnionPay is certainly becoming more meaningful here, $3.2 million in equity income this quarter, up from $2 million, I think it was last quarter. How should we be the contemplating modeling that in 2013 and beyond?", "James B. Lipham", "Well, they have been growing at a pretty good clip for the last couple of years, and we think that they're going to continue to do that as we go forward. I think it's about 12%, let me see. It's 15% year-over-year growth, $15 million to $20 million next year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just first question is on the North American segment. You have about 5.5% growth in your AOS for the quarter, excluding prepaids. I was talking about the non-onetime type of cards. You have 12% same client transaction growth, but you have 2% revenue growth. And even if you were to exclude the $4 million or so impact from pricing concessions that we know about from last quarter becoming evident, it still would have only been 4%. So what's the difference between the underlying 12% drivers in transaction growth, the 5.5% AOF growth, and the 4% even -- or 2% to 4% revenue growth we're seeing in North America?", "James B. Lipham", "Well, if you remember, we talked about transactions and roughly 35% of them are bundled. We also had 3 extra billing days in this fourth quarter than we had the prior year, so that inflated the 12% a little bit.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "That doesn't carry forward to revenue as well?", "James B. Lipham", "No, well, 35% of it, like I said, is bundled, so that doesn't affect. But it wouldn't -- I think if you took the 3 days out, you'd be probably at a 9% growth in transactions, and then 75% of that would be billable, roughly 6%, you might say.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "All right. And so I guess going forward, I mean, what kind of growth rate should we be thinking about for the North American segment in terms of the underlying drivers relative to revenue? I mean, what kind of spreads should we count on?", "James B. Lipham", "I think we're going to continue to see this 5% growth. And without the economy really picking up more, I think you're still going to have, count on 5% growth, in the 5% to 6% range. And you're going to have -- if transactions continuing to be, I'd say, in the 9% to 10% range.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, all right. And let me shift gears over to the entire guidance now for 2013. You're talking about revenue guidance of basically 6% to 8%, that's versus 5% revenue growth in 2012. And yet you're also guiding only a 10% to 12% EPS growth versus 12%, 13%-ish type of growth in 2012. So in other words, you were able to generate a much higher growth rate on EPS with a much lower revenue growth in this year. Yet, for next year, it's a different kind of guidance, showing somewhat less operating leverage unless there's an element of that $10 million to $12 million of expense for the conversion over -- of the network for the merchant acquiring at some part of that I get. So where can we expect -- are there other expense increases coming? Because I know that you have new business being added, whether it's Capital One or others, are incrementally accretive to margins. So you really should have a benefit there in terms of EPS growth. And then I'll just carry on, there's another question as a follow-on, on the capital structure and buyback implications.", "James B. Lipham", "Okay. The guidance out there, we did say the $10 million to $12 million having to do with the TAS platform development, and that is a big contributor and more expense. I can't think of anything else that is of any real size as far as increased expenses. Well, there may be a few internal projects but -- that will be, I will say, $5 million. But outside of that, that's pretty much all the unusual stuff.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "All right. Look, bottom line, I mean, I guess where we're getting at is that if you were to drive a similar operating margin expansion even after excluding the $10 million, $12 million as we saw this year on your 5% revenue growth, you'd still have a margin, an implied margin that's somewhat higher than what you were guiding towards. I'm just wondering if there's anything we are missing on the expense side or if it's really just conservatism built into your outlook.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, I think you know we're always fairly conservative. But I think what Jimmy said was $10 million, $12 million on the merchant side, another $5 million development on some development we're doing on the cardholder side.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, all right. Well, just last question for me. On the capital allocation strategy, if I look at your guidance again, it looks like you have an -- a guide towards net income growth that's only 1 percentage point lower than your EPS growth rate, suggesting maybe 1% or so of your shares outstanding bought back or taken out on a year-over-year standpoint. I know you gave some guidance on that too. That equates to about a $40 million repurchased level unless there's a little more, maybe $40 million to $60 million. You generated $300 million -- over $320 million of free cash, still have an extremely attractive and healthy balance sheet. You're probably going to trend, based on your guidance, at around $340 million of free cash flow in the year. And so $40 million or even $60 million, $40 million to $60 million of free cash applied towards buybacks, I mean, is that enough? Or should we, as investors, expect more than that?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, I'll give you the same answer. I know you get tired of it, Darrin, but I'll give you the same answer. We've said before that -- I think I've said it before, and Shawn will probably flip when I say this, but I think it's -- unless we have a significant acquisition, you ought look to us for about $0.02 a share on buybacks.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Well, just to -- look, again, I'll go back in the queue after this. But when you're saying $0.02 per share, again, that doesn't seem like it's really more than what we just discussed, right? It's maybe another $60 million, $70 million in total, I mean, of share repurchase applied. And why would it only be -- that's only $60 million, $70 million out of your $340 million to $350 million of free cash. Again, you have a huge amount of debt capacity which you could always use for deals if need be. So what's the reluctance, really? I mean, again...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, the reluctance right now is there's a lot of things going on, Darrin. I mean, that we have a lot of balls in the air that obviously we can't tell you about. But I think I would say that if we don't make some progress with some acquisitions that are meaningful, you'll see us get more aggressive in the buyback business.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane.", "[Technical Difficulty]", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Sorry about that. My question is just on looking at the overall revenue guidance, which is I have -- I think you guys are saying 6% to 8%, which revenue before reimbursable items. That compares to the fourth quarter of 2.7%. So we're looking for quite a bit improvement yet accounts on file really don't kick in probably much until -- really until 2014 because by the time you get those accounts on, it's not going to have much of an impact. So I guess moving from the 2.7% that you did in the fourth quarter to the 6% to 8%, what accounts for that improvement in the growth rate?", "James B. Lipham", "A lot of it will be the anniversary of price concessions that went on and the pickup of, obviously, those conversions, will help, and hopefully we have no more lost business.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So when we think about the big price compressions by quarter, maybe you can help us through that. When did those anniversary? And then kind of a part of that is how should we think about the sequential progress by quarter? I assume maybe the first half of the year is going to have a lot lower revenue growth than the second half. How do we think about the progression?", "James B. Lipham", "The anniversary of the price concessions, the big ones, will be over after the first half of the year. And I think you've got to consider, also, during next year, we'll have a full year of the acquisitions that we've made. ProPay came in right here at the end of December with nothing. Then you'll have, I don't know, 5 more months of CPAY.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And how big is -- how big of an annual contribution will ProPay be?", "James B. Lipham", "We didn't disclose that yet.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. I guess combined, we can figure out...", "James B. Lipham", "Yes, you'll see it. We got -- acquisitions are going to contribute 3% to 4%. So...", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes. We can get back into the number. All right, final question for me. Just by segment margins, how do we think about segment margins, either increase or decrease in the margin in 2013? I guess you commented international margins should increase quite a bit. But just thinking about if you can quantify that and then maybe also on the international, in the North American segment as well -- or the merchant segment as well.", "James B. Lipham", "We don't really -- the idea that we mentioned that the international was going to improve, and merchants, obviously, is going to go down, to roughly what you saw in the fourth quarter, and that will be what you'll see for the whole year next year in the merchant side. North America will continue to run close to where it was in the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "So just wanted to come back to the FNBO conversion over to the TAS platform. I guess the $10 million to $12 million number is pretty material. I mean, is this something that you guys fully anticipated would happen just in terms of its timing and its magnitude?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "It's a little larger than what we thought it would be from the get-go, but we really have expanded the project, Jason. We decided since we were rewriting to go ahead and clean up some things that we had been wanting to do, that's why the price tag has gone up a little bit. And we will absolutely -- it will pay great dividends once we get it operating. We feel good about where we're at with it. It's taking a little bit longer, honestly, than we had hoped, but it's a pretty big project.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Right, right. Okay, that's helpful. And can you give us some specifics around what you are expecting for free cash flow in 2013?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Yes. Jimmy?", "James B. Lipham", "Yes. I mean, we're expecting it to be pretty close to where it is now, and around $300 million, $330 million, $350 million.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "$330 million to $350 million. Okay, understood. And then just in terms of inter-quarter in Q4, can you talk about month-to-month transaction growth trends you might have seen in the U.S. in Q4, October versus November versus December? Just wondering if the hurricane or the timing of the holiday shopping season moved those numbers around materially. Anything that jumped out at you guys?", "James B. Lipham", "We had a few more shopping days in December so it moved it up a little bit from where it was in November.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "So December actually accelerated versus November?", "James B. Lipham", "It did. That was the shopping days.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And just lastly for me. I know last quarter you sounded fairly optimistic on the Brazil front just in terms of trying to drive some other near-term wins now that you've got Carrefour up and running. Any update there?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "We don't have an update specifically, but we certainly have a lot of prospects there, and we remain very optimistic there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brett Huff.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "A quick -- couple of quick follow-ups. I'll try and run through them quickly here. To follow the line of questioning from a couple of guys ago, the big -- I was surprised about the step function on the cost, and so you talked a little bit about how you'll go ahead and bite off a little bit more of that while you're in the middle of the rewrite.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Right.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "What other step functions in terms of that kind of investment should we expect? I'm not talking this year, maybe next year, but sort of over time?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Over time, I mean, you'll see us rewrite systems. We're looking at -- I explained it to some of our folks the other day, it's sort of like if you remember years ago when we had the Star Wars initiative, we're always trying to build something that makes it harder for anybody to compete with us, and we've got several things that we're working on, on the card overside. We're doing some really nice things on the merchant software side that will be very helpful to us and will give us some advantages in the marketplace out there. I think you heard me say that we're looking to spend an extra $5 million or so also on the cardholder side, $5 million to $6 million there in developing some black boxes, if you will, that will make our systems work a lot better and a lot more efficient and will make it a better experience for our customers.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Is that -- I know it's probably hard to think about it this way, but $10 million to $12 million and $5 million to $6 million, I mean, call it roughly $17 million or $18 million, is that -- that seems high. I mean, over time, would you expect that number to be sort of a $10 million -- how to keep competition...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "We had hoped to be able to be through with the -- with the merchant rewrite a little earlier, and we just decided that the smart thing to do, we just, let's go ahead and do it and do it right. So it did add some there. But yes, that's probably a little high but I think you ought to count on $10 million or so a year. I mean, it's a constant process that goes on.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Yes, that's helpful. And then in terms of just thinking about Bank of America again, and, again, kind of following with this investment. I think the last time we all talked that there wasn't going to be a significant incremental investment to handle the Bank of America cards as they come on. Is that still generally true? I think that -- at least that's I recall, correct me if I'm wrong.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, that will be a pretty good investment, but the conversion process we will capitalize quite a bit of that and we'll, obviously, have to add computers and people, but it will be very positive.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "And so will those incremental margins sort of be about what you would expect from another client even though it sounds like given the pricing concessions that...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, I think they would be probably in the same range as these very large clients. I mean, when you got as many accounts as these guys have got, they get very good pricing, they can demand very good pricing just like some of the other large clients that we process for. But again, there are some economies of scale that we're able to take advantage of which is a good thing.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "And then the $36 million in licenses, I think, Jim, you mentioned that. And I was just -- can you just say again what those are for, and kind of how that's represented in the balance sheet -- or in the income statement balance sheet?", "James B. Lipham", "It's mainly in our operating systems, and we had a good deal come through, so we signed the contract at the 8-year in and about, I guess, a little over half of that $36 million is maintenance and the other part is software license.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "And that's capitalized?", "James B. Lipham", "Yes. On the balance sheet, amortized over 5 years.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just a quick thought on CapEx guidance for '13.", "James B. Lipham", "Yes. I think it's still going to be -- this is only one unusual item that we had, but I think we'll still going to be around the same level as we were this year.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "And then last time -- lastly, thanks for the incremental info on kind of where we are on the Bank of America merchant roll off, I think you said $9 million to $10 million coming off this year. How much is left after that, and how do you see that -- sort of that tail working?", "James B. Lipham", "I don't know, it's a couple of more years. And it's not -- we have been, all along, for the last couple of years, talking about $10 million a year.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Brett, if that changes, we'll let you know. I mean, we -- it's not really in our control, other than just the minimums that we've signed up for, or they've signed up for, so they could -- we count on the minimums.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim Willi.", "Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I just wonder if you could talk maybe a bit about sort of Europe. Did you notice any change, I guess, in optimism, caution, tones of conversation you were having with financial institutions as the quarter progressed? It seems everybody fears the worst over there, but then it seems when results come across for companies that have businesses in Europe, it sounds like the tone of business has always been a little bit better than maybe the news headlines would lead you to believe. And I'm sort of curious how you guys -- what you're...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, you've heard me say before, we've been very surprised to see the transactions and authorizations in Europe on a percentage basis higher than what they are in the U.S. I'm pretty optimistic about Europe. We've got some good new prospects that are happening that I hope we'll be able to announce here in the next 60, 90 days if we get a contract signed, or 2 signed. So I mean, I don't know how you reconcile it, Tim, it seems to me like people are out buying. And one thing that we did see that was in our numbers to some degree is, if you recall a year or so ago, we announced that we had signed some debit business in Europe, really in the U.K. and Ireland, and we -- the second half of the year, we did pick up some debit authorizations from that -- it's not a huge debit business, but at least it's a good start for us. But I feel optimistic. I mean, we have pretty much resigned all of our large customers there. We feel good about it. We had one of our large customers in Europe in today who've -- and they gave a -- we try to do this once a month, we have a customer come in and speak to our people about what they're looking for. And while I can't tell you who was here, I was -- I thought they were very optimistic about what they had going on, and so we feel very good about Europe. It's -- but I don't know, I've been trying to reconcile it for over a year now, because every time you turn on Bloomberg or CNBC or look at the Wall Street, you think the sky is falling, but it's apparently not. And I do think that one of the things that has helped us is the fact that we're principally in Northern Europe. We don't have anything in Spain or Portugal or Greece or -- I mean, we're in Ireland, the U.K., Germany, the Netherlands, countries that have at least not been at the epicenter of all the problems.", "Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Yes, yes. Great, I appreciate that. And the second question I have, and then I'll hop off, is just around the acquiring business in North America. As you guys think about that business and what's going on in the marketplace between stuff around mobile and a sluggish economy, there seems to be a lot more talk about the need of acquirers to be more than just payments companies and bring more to the table for merchants to protect margin and pricing and market share. I guess I'm curious about your thoughts on that topic, or if you feel like this is still just scale, scale, scale around the pricing for payments. And also...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well -- I'm sorry.", "Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "No. But I was just going to say, and to whatever your answer is there, how do you guys feel about the money you're spending on truly bringing differentiated products that are maybe not necessarily payment-centric that are purely logical for you to be selling to merchants to protect the margins, the revenue, the market share of your acquiring operation?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, that was one of the reasons we went after ProPay and acquired it. But I do think the scale and price are always going to be incredibly important. This mobile thing is going have to play out. I cannot -- there's so many people offering a mobile product or a mobile solution that you just cannot keep up with them. And as I've said before, a lot of those folks will fall out to the wayside. I mean, we have a mobile product that is working. As a matter of fact, we just had a celebration here last week. It's working up at CIBC. We're proud of it. We like it. Is it where we want to be at the end of the day? No. And I think you'll probably see folks like us...", "[Audio Gap]", "...multiple options. Mobile has got -- there are some issues there that the issuers are worried about. There are issues there that the -- I mean, you can do a lot of really neat things. There's some liability issues, and you can really spend a lot of time talking about mobile, but it's going to happen and I certainly -- we have no doubt about that and we want to be a player in it. And I think every day that goes by, it sorts itself out a bit. But we're not there yet. And we're certainly trying our very best to stay on top of it. And we think we're making progress, but we're not where we would like to be. And I do think that there's ways with mobile to really differentiate yourself and bring new products to the table. And you're seeing it on us. The transactions are small, but you're seeing it. And this time next year, they will probably be doubled. But I don't have the total answer there, Tim. I mean, it's -- we've got some people around here that I think are certainly more expert than me, and thank goodness for that.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer.", "Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Quick question. Two questions, actually. First, follow-up on the last question. With this whole mobile commerce idea, do large merchants actually want you playing in that space? Or are they just focused on, TSYS, get us the best price, best product you can around core processing, we'll figure out the other stuff? Because it seems to me that with what Square brought to Starbucks, it was -- it remains to be seen whether that could ever mean anything to Starbucks. Starbucks got it right themselves, from the mobile side of things, and Square is buying a beta on beta, from what I could see. So did the large merchants even ask TSYS for that, or are they going to...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I don't think the large merchants are knocking down the doors, but I do think the consumer is going to want it.", "Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "But the question is who provides it? Does something like MCX develop something in-house and do it themselves?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Yes. No, I mean, that's been the issue the whole time. I mean, the story with Isis and MCX, and, I mean, but we do know that our customers, that TSYS issuing customers want solutions. So whether you provide them on the merchant side or the cardholder side, we're going to have to provide both sets of it.", "Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Secondly, if I could ask again on Brazil more of a philosophical question. Down in Brazil, we have one major card operator that's fully integrated from the acquiring side to the issuing side. From your point of view, what does a Bradesco want to do to compete with that? Is it outsourced processing to get more efficient at it? I mean, or they will -- do you think they work to buy something over time and emulate it? I'm just curious.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "That's a very good question. I certainly wouldn't presume to answer for them, but I mean they're -- they're huge, and I think you probably know them better than I do. But I think they would probably look to buy something or to -- we would hope they would take the time to chat with us and maybe there's something we can do together, you just never know. We're not talking to them about that, but I mean, we'd certainly like to.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh.", "Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research", "I wonder if you could just give us a sense. It looks like the range of guidance on the top line, the range was $55 million in 2012. This year, we're narrowing that down to $35 million. Is it just better visibility and more conviction in the economy? Are there other variables that kind of help us narrow that range? And just a very impressive range given it's a full year's worth of guidance.", "James B. Lipham", "I think we've got more clarity into next year with the conversions where they are, and with the anniversary of pricing and the like. I think that the lost business -- I mean, it is just a lot clearer to us.", "Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research", "Super. And then just it sounded like last quarter we're starting to see some solicitations come back for the first time in a while. Has that continued, and do we expect that to continue as we think about 2013?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I think it's going to continue. I think people are -- again, as I said last quarter, it's a very profitable product for the issuers. And although I think probably in some issuers, the past due, the delinquencies have gone up a bit, but that's to be expected in a high-yield product.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Just a couple of questions, kind of just follow-ons from previous questions. But the first one, sort of thinking about the 2013 guidance, the Slide 14 and the lost business, the 5% to 7%, and it sounds like from all of Jimmy's comments that we're kind of getting past that and cycling through stuff. And I guess it surprised me, the magnitude of that, and it's higher than what it was in '12. Can you just remind us the major piece-parts making up that 5% to 7% headwind for '13?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "You got it there?", "James B. Lipham", "Yes, I mean, you got a -- continue to see some Bank of America, and now we've got new contract with Navy Federal, Target, a few others, and...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "RBS.", "James B. Lipham", "RBS is still there. Merchants have got a few customers that have been renegotiated also with pricing issues.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So this is a pretty good number. So it's kind of like known stuff that you were already renegotiating...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Oh, yes, yes. We've consciously renegotiated several -- Jimmy just told you, 3 or 4 big contracts that we have. And I think you'll recall, we were really excited when we told you, in I think the third quarter, that we had re-signed Royal Bank of Scotland through 2023 which is -- and you know about the hit we took on commercial card to finish out the Bank of America business and get that signed and get on with it. Target was a big renewal for us. And the other thing is, we -- sometime, what, about midyear, we get out of the Chase licensing business.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "So that cycles through being -- getting in the third quarter?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Yes. We've been collecting that now for about 5 years.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "So will you -- so how does that -- that's actually -- I forgot about that, but does that mean you won't be getting revenue from Chase after the second quarter?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, it means we won't be getting it on the licensing. They're still a large customer of several products, but the licensing fees will go away.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "I got you, okay. Different topic and it's a very similar question to one that Darrin asked on North America, but it's basically the revenue growth in international is essentially flat year-over-year, but the transaction growth was about 18%. And is it the same phenomenon that you have bundling in international, or is there some other phenomenon that we should be thinking about as relates to transaction revenue growth?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "That's part of it, that's part of it. And again, I talked about Royal Bank of Scotland, and we had several smaller ones. That's, by far, our largest customer internationally. And of course, ABN AMRO went away, and that was -- I think that was about $3 million.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay, okay. So it sounds like it's more of the pricing issue or renegotiations rather than...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Renegotiation. And we talked about losing somebody, I mean, ABN AMRO -- well, you know the story on ABN. They were acquired and...", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And let me just squeeze one more in, in the interest of time. I know you gave some good guidance by segment on the margins. And I think you talked about North America being sort of mid-single digit revenue growth. Just a little bit of help in terms of how to think directionally about international and merchant services revenue growth in the context of that 6% to 8%.", "James B. Lipham", "I don't have it broke out here with me by segments on the guidance, so -- and we normally don't really give guidance by the segment. But obviously, the biggest piece of our revenue is North America and the international piece on the issuance side.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Greg Mahalus [ph] -- I'm sorry, that was George Mahalus.", "Unknown Analyst", "Just wanted to get some color on the ProPay acquisition, and I know it's early days. But can you give us a sense as to the size of the merchants that ProPay is signing up, maybe in terms of purchase volume?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "George, I can't off top of my head. I don't know the answer to that question. And typically, we don't get into that kind of detail, but -- I mean, they have some very large merchants, but I couldn't tell you that kind of volume. Sorry.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay, no problem. Let me just shift gears then. With the BofA win, are you sensing that there are any other large in-house card issuers who are, perhaps, a little bit more willing to explore outsourcing going forward?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Sure, absolutely. I'm the eternal optimist. I think they all want to explore doing business with us. And I do predict that over the next 12 to 24 months, we'll have some success with that. It is a very, very long sales cycle. And I think as these banks have gone through some of these really difficult times, they are starting to feel like they have to look at every alternative, whether it's us or someone else. And we certainly are pushing as hard as we can to have that opportunity. But there certainly are banks out there that do it themselves, do it with our competitors, and we think we'll get a fair opportunity at any of those that decide to look around.", "Unknown Analyst", "Got you. Just quick follow-up on that. Do you envision that those would be traditional outsourcing partnerships or more licensing deals to get them in?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I would predict they would be more traditional processing arrangements.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Greg Smith.", "Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Quickly, what's the tax rate you're modeling for 2013?", "James B. Lipham", "In the 31% to 33% range.", "Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just a question about leverage. I think you're still looking for opportunities on the acquisition side. Do you have -- what's your latest thinking as far as maximum amount of leverage you'd be comfortable with as a multiple of EBITDA or absolute dollars or something?", "James B. Lipham", "Probably 2% of EBITDA.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "2x.", "Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "You mean 2x?", "James B. Lipham", "2x, yes.", "Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So over $1 billion you'd be comfortable deploying if the right opportunity came along.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Right.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Roman Leal.", "Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Basically all my questions have been answered. I'll ask 2 quick follow-ups. First on international, I realize that margins there have been somewhat depressed by the reallocation. But given those resources there, help us think through how you're going to improve margins in 2013. How much of that will come from the potential wins you see in the pipeline versus pure cost reductions?", "James B. Lipham", "Well, I think you're going to see the improvement of probably 300 basis points. And I'd say it's probably 2/3 on the expense side and 1/3 in revenue.", "Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then the last one is just on capital allocation, just to get a follow-up on what's previously been asked, get to know kind of the ranges of leverage that you're comfortable with. Obviously, we all see the headlines and we see that there's a lot, especially in the merchant acquiring space, a lot of potential acquisition opportunities for you. It seems like you've been executing on some tuck-in acquisitions domestically, there are obviously some attractive opportunities internationally as well. Help us think through where you really want to focus on in expanding your merchant acquiring business.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, I think what we're looking for is to initially continue to expand in North America. We would love to have an opportunity to be in Canada. We're doing merchant processing in Germany. There's some countries in Northern Europe that we think would be a good match for us. Although we think there's still a lot to -- for us to look at here in the U.S., we're not going to try to be everything to everybody in the merchant acquiring business, and have never wanted to be. We're in the process of expanding our footprint in North America as well as expanding our product lines. And that's what we'll continue to do there. And I think you'll see us take advantage of opportunities that come across our table here or our desk here, and just like we did in 2012 with a couple of opportunities that we really liked. We want to be a top 10 player in the merchant acquiring business, and we think that we can. Now at some point, it would probably make sense to move on to Europe with the right opportunity, and we just, frankly, have just not come across the right opportunity yet. We've had some chances, we've had some deal opportunities and we've just passed on them. It just didn't make sense to go anywhere else. I don't know if that helps you any, but that's sort of what we're thinking now.", "Listen, we've gone over our time. We hate to keep you late. There's no one else in the queue, and I just wanted to go ahead and close out and tell you that we remain focused on growing our business through value-added acquisitions or if that won't work for us, we plan on being aggressive with our stock buyback program.", "I think we're very thrilled that we've made it 30 years. A lot of people in this industry have not made it 10 years. So I think that you can look for trends to continue to change in '13 and beyond, but I think that, when you think about TSYS, I want you to, if you will, know that we are committed to our clients and team members and shareholders, and we're thinking proactively how to get things done in our -- in a high-touch customer service environment that really gives us an advantage.", "If anybody else has any additional questions, you can certainly reach out to Shawn Roberts, and I know you have his number.", "And with that, we really do appreciate you taking time to be with us and asking us the questions, and we look forward to having a really good year in 2013. So again, thank you, and good night.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Shawn Roberts, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Roberts, you may begin.", "Shawn Roberts", "Thank you, Lisa, and welcome, everyone. On the call today our Chairman and CEO, Phil Tomlinson, will provide first quarter 2013 highlights. And then he's going to turn it over to Jim Lipham, our CFO, who's going to review our financials. And after that, as usual, we'll open it up to Q&A.", "I'd like to now call your attention to the fact that we'll be making forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, factors that could cause TSYS' actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in TSYS' reports filed with the SEC.", "At this time, I'd like to introduce TSYS CEO and Chairman, Phil Tomlinson.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Thank you, Shawn, and good evening, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter call. If I sound a little hoarse today, we've got about an inch of pollen on the ground here in Middle Georgia, and I think everybody is having problems with it.", "Speaking of the first quarter, during my, really, 30-plus years of TSYS, I don't ever recall a busier quarter and I don't expect this pace to slow down. It's driven though by a lot of good things happening that I think reflect a bright future going forward. Our 100-plus million accounts on file in the pipeline through June '14 are obviously requiring a lot of attention and focus by our team. We've also been working hard during the first quarter preparing to close the acquisition of NetSpend. That process is moving along pretty much as expected and we hope to close midyear.", "NetSpend will become a fourth reporting segment for TSYS, representing what we think is the fastest-growing area of payments today and really, as in our first foray into the B2C space in payroll cards. NetSpend is delivering some of the most innovative products in the market today, and as you know, is focused on serving the underserved and underbanked. We think there are numerous revenue synergy opportunities with NetSpend's general-purpose reloadable cards when combined with our clients' needs and our merchant relationships.", "During the first quarter, we had a $6.2 million pretax and $5.2 million after-tax expense associated with the NetSpend acquisition. By the way, the NetSpend shareholders' meeting is scheduled for May 22, and we will certainly keep you up-to-date as this acquisition comes to closure.", "There are 3 other areas that incurred some expenses, which Jim will quantify financially in more detail, which are related to positioning TSYS for the next-generation of technology and innovation. I just want to kind of go through them very quickly. The first is moving our merchant business off of the First National Bank of Omaha, legacy system in Omaha, home to our newly developed merchant clearing and settlement system. And when it's completed, this new system will allow us to operate much more efficiently and effectively and surely achieve some significant year-over-year cost savings.", "Second, on the issuing side of our business, we kicked off what I would describe as our most significant business and technology initiative since, really, the launch of TS2. While we're not ready to formally introduce this to the public or to the market, this new multi-year initiative will provide a forward-thinking infrastructure that really supports new and emerging technologies and will be much easier to integrate new products, services, new conversions and different partners. It's not a new platform but it exponentially enhances the power of our core systems or our black box, as we call it. And it certainly gives us and our clients -- it will certainly give us and our clients, the agility and flexibility to meet the changes in payments, the quick changes in payments that we face today, as well as much more -- is being much more flexible and has newer technology -- has a newer technology framework for future growth. Continuous change and innovation are really the reason we have to have this.", "We've partnered with some of the most reputable technology suppliers in our industry who are working with us to deliver this initiative that includes a single view of the cardholder across the multiple relationships a cardholder may have with their issuer. Cardholders will have more self-service options, allowing them to access their account information through multiple channels, whether it's the branch, voice response, web, mobile or even social media, all with what I believe is the same superior and consistent service that we are known for. There are just a few --  those are just a few features that we expect and I believe it's a real game-changer going forward.", "On the last issue, many of you know that during the first quarter we experienced a 3.5 hour power interruption at 1 of our 2 North American data issuer -- data centers or processing centers, which impacted a small number of our clients. As a result, we experienced some nonrecurring one-time expenses and charges during the first quarter that Jim will cover later. The type of interruption which occurred -- that occurred has never happened in the history of our business, and we've been in business 38 years doing this. After extensive investigation and testing, the issues associated with the incident have been corrected, and we certainly don't believe it will be a recurring problem.", "With that, Jim, I'm going to turn it over to you, and you can go through the numbers and get into the details. And then we'll open it up for questions and answers.", "James B. Lipham", "Okay. Thank you, Phil. Let me first touch on the 3 issues that Phil mentioned. The first will be in the FNBO conversion, home to the new software system at TAS. And I mentioned last quarter that we would incur $10 million to $12 million in incremental cost for 2013 for the development of this system. We did have $2.6 million hit in the first quarter, and I remind you again that once we do finish the conversion in 2014, we're expecting to see annual savings of $5 million to $6 million in processing costs each year.", "The second issue was the new technology initiative that Phil mentioned, and it has gotten off to a good solid start. We've chosen an industry-leading software package to build out the platform. I'm going to spend about $13 million to acquire that technology. We did have some minor expenses during -- incremental expenses during the quarter in this development, roughly around $1 million. The third issue, we had some one-time expenses during the first quarter, of which the North America data center issue was there. The total expenses of that and other items was $3.7 million, and we anticipate these not to recur as we go forward through the year.", "Now, as we get ready to look at the first quarter, the first slide, I'd like to, first of all, refresh your memory a little bit about the first quarter of 2012 which we're comparing to. It was extremely strong due to good growth in transaction, sales, volume and improving economy at that time. We also had good organic growth in the first quarter of '12, which included extra leap year revenues for an extra day. The merchant segment had good growth after the passing of the Durbin Bill and some compliance fees and higher volumes also. All of this helped operating income grow in the first quarter of '12 to 16.2% and earnings per share to grow at 18.6%. So it's a very strong quarter we're comparing ourselves to.", "But if you look at total revenues, they are up 0.8% or a 3-point -- $8 million at $465 million. They were negatively impacted by a decline of $5.2 million for reimbursable items as a result of deconverted clients, as well as a $4 million negative CTA adjustment. Both had little to no impact on operating income. As you know, our CTA, kind of a natural hedge with the same kind of drop in expenses. Revenues before reimbursables, they are up 2.3% or $9.1 million to $404 million. And I'm going to go with a breakout of that 2.3% growth on the next slide.", "Return on operating income, it was $74.9 million, which included merchant acquisition expenses above the line of $3.5 million, some onetime net operating expenses of $3.7 million that I've mentioned earlier, that are not expected to continue throughout the year, and $2.6 million of incremental costs for our merchant software rewrite. If you exclude these items, operating income was flat at $84.7 million. These same expenses negatively impacted our operating income margin as a percentage of revenues before reimbursables at 18.5% versus 24.9%, if you excluded them. And the 24.9%, would be more in line with our expectations. We do still expect our consolidated margin to be in the 22% to 24% range for the year.", "As you go down to net income, you can see we actually were up 1.1% as we were able to pick up some benefits in our income tax line with about $6.4 million worth of credits that were included in our guidance that we provided for you in January of 2013. They fell in this quarter in accordance with the required recognition. This contributed around $0.03 per share for the earnings per share for the quarter, but I want to emphasize again that these were in our guidance and they're not something new to us.", "We look for our tax rate to still be in the 32% to 33% range for the entire year. And one more note on the NetSpend transaction, including operating expenses and other expenses reported below the line for a total of $6.2 million, as Phil mentioned, and $5.2 million after-tax. On a rounded basis, this would represent about $0.03 a share.", "On the next slide is our reconciliation of our 2.3% growth in revenues and you can see the internal growth for the first quarter, 3.9%, is a little slower than we had anticipated but still, we feel comfortable with our guidance at 5% for the year. We think some things happened in the first quarter that kind of slowed down the spending a little bit and it'll pick back up.", "New clients contributed 2.6% growth. And the acquisition of ProPay and CPAY added 4.4% growth. And then I mentioned earlier the currency was -- cost us 1%. So overall, we had about 9.9% growth here and unfortunately, was offset by 7.6%, mainly 6% of this drop had to do with lost business. North America had a lost business of about $7.5 million and that includes the BofA cards that we lost and they're going to anniversary in May. So we'll have that to compare it to until May comes along. International, we had about $6.8 million there of lost business and if you remember, ABN AMRO deconverted and they'll anniversary in June of this year.", "In the merchant segment, we're still watching BAMS deconvert off of our system. We had about $9 million -- $9.9 million in the merchant segment for lost business. But BAMS is in there as well as some large national merchants with -- in our direct side of TMS. Price reductions hit us with about 2%. If you remember last year on the new business that we got from BofA, we gave some discounts on some current business that we had and that'll anniversary in August, and that was about $4.3 million. And then we've had some discounts going on in the merchant segment as we've renewed and extended some major customers for TAS. But overall, at 2.3%, we've got to anniversary, as we've talked before, this lost business. And hopefully, that will happen as we get on through the year and the 7.6% gets smaller and get back in line what I think -- we have 5% guidance on that.", "On the next page is our accounts on file summary and you can see year-over-year, excluding the prepaid and the single-use commercial cards, now we increased 4.8% compared to last year. This the same rate of growth that we finished the year of 2012 compared to 2011. We did an analysis and looked at our issuing revenues for the first quarter from the North America segment and International and compared them to prior year and obviously, they started out flat. But if you add back the price concessions, the lost business and the currency hit and adjust for the GP Net stuff in Japan that's in there, then you'll get close back to a 4.8% growth year-over-year in the issuing revenue, which is more in line with the account on file growth. We still did have some good growth, as you can see in the prepaid, Government Services and single-use accounts, and that contributes to our 15% growth on accounts on file. Phil mentioned the pipeline, 101 million accounts, and that's still there and most of these are scheduled to convert in 2014.", "We move over to the North America segment. You'll see revenues before reimbursables were up $1.5 million or 0.8% at $205.6 million. Internal growth, North America was at 5.3% or roughly $10.6 million, and new clients added another $5.7 million. This growth was partially offset, as I mentioned before, the lost of client, 7.5%, and price reductions of 6.7% and of course, BofA and the commercial car price reduction and then the bank of -- the car production loss. All of those will amortize -- I mean, anniversary this year so we'll get past those.", "Segment operating income was $67.2 million, down slightly over 2012 as we had $3.6 million of expense items that are not expected to recur in the remaining quarters of the year. Our margin was down 81 basis points to 32.7%. If we adjusted for the onetime cost that we had, margin would've been 34.5%, which would be a 96-basis-point increase. And as the year progresses, we expect the margin to be line with last year at around 35%.", "You might note also, we have anniversaried the realignment of staff between North America and the International segment. And the other highlight on here is the car product -- I want to touch on the car transaction growth, a little over, right at 2 billion transactions growing at 7.8%. And just, Mike mentioned that the growth rate in the fourth quarter was 12.7%. So we did see some slowing in our growth rate of transactions. Same client transactions, same thing there. They had an increase of 9% compared to 13.2% growth in the fourth quarter. So there was a little slowing in transaction growth from what we had seen in -- sequentially.", "On the International segment, revenues before reimbursables at $92.6 million. They're down $3.9 million or 4%. And I mentioned the   CTA of negative $4 million. So on a constant-currency basis, you would see revenues at $96.6 million, and which would be a slight increase over 2012. Internal growth in the International was good at $5.2 million or roughly 5.4%. And then being impacted by the $4 million there and the lost clients of $6.8 million, partially offset by some termination fees of $2.2 million, left our operating income was at $6.6 million, up 61.1% with a margin of 7.16%, which was a 290-basis-point increase over last year's. If you remember, it was around 4.3%. But we continue to see margin improvement in the International segment and we expect it to continue as the year progresses.", "Cardholder transactions, as you can see, were up 13.3% compared to fourth quarter. They were at 18.6% growth. Same thing with same client. They were up 6.9% compared to 12.9% in the fourth quarter, so seeing the same trend in the International sector with lower growth percentages.", "And the next one on the merchant side, if you look at revenues, they're at $109.3 million for an increase of 11.1% or $10.9 million. Internal growth was negative, as you know, we lost business with BAMS and then we had some price reductions with some other customers. But these were offset by new clients of $5.1 million or 5.13%, and then we had the segment acquisition revenues of $17.2 million or 17.4%. Operating income was $29.3 million, a decrease of $4.9 million over 2012. The development of the new platform for FNBO conversion impacted expenses, as I mentioned before, $2.6 million. The operating margin was at 26.83% for the quarter. If we excluded the $2.6 million incremental expenses, it'd be around 29.2%, which would be more in the range of what we're looking for, for the remainder of the year. So merchants segment did well.", "In the last slide here on the cash flow, I'll highlight in March, we re-classed $8.6 million of Cyprus cash and cash equivalents as restricted cash due to the limitations that have been placed on transfer of funds internationally. This amount represents about 3 months of fund in the working capital and we anticipate these funds to be utilized within Cyprus by the end of the second quarter.", "Our cash flow this quarter at $52.4 million from operations. This is down and is due to -- we spent $56.6 million on investments in software and related maintenance agreements that we entered into during the first quarter. We've made the decision to make the investments now to secure pricing arrangements that will benefit us over the long-term and also to increase operating scale on our TS2 platform as we prepare to convert our 101 million pipeline.", "We had an unusually high CapEx for the trailing 12 months of 8.3% of revenue. This is the first time since the fourth quarter of 2010 that, that's happened and that's mainly because of the increased acquisitions there on prepaid basis. We do expect our cash flow from operations next quarter to move back to $100 million range as it has been consistently for the previous year. On a trailing 12-month basis, you'll see our cash flow from operations at $410 million, and that's down because of these investments in the software and prepaid maintenance, as well as the free cash flow, $254 million. $254 million, it's going to be in that range for the next 3 months as we anniversary these front-end payments, large payments for the software and maintenance. But we do continue to generate good cash with EBITDA at $520 million. And with that, Phil, I'll turn it back over to you.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Thank you, Jimmy, and we'll open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from David Togut.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Just starting with the merchant business, Jim, you called out the $2.6 million expense to convert off the FNBO platform and I guess, $10 million to $15 million total. It looks like that accounted for about half of the negative variance versus our expectation. Margin, overall, down about 800 basis year-over-year in merchant, are there any drivers -- any other drivers you would call out for that substantial decline in margin?", "James B. Lipham", "Well, as you know, when we deconverted BAMS, that's a large-scale business. And obviously, when you lose revenues there, it's going to affect your margin pretty drastically up, higher than the 30% that we've been seeing. And also, you've got these repricing agreements that are going on. There's a lot of people switching from dial to IP and SSL, and it's just the lower rate for transactions. So we've had some compression there and I think you're going to see also that, I think we finished up the fourth quarter of 2012 at a 50-50 split between direct and indirect business. And that's now 53% direct and 47% indirect and the margins on the direct business, it's a little lower than what you had in the process on the indirect side.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Jimmy, also about 300 basis points on amortizations of intangibles over with [indiscernible]", "James B. Lipham", "I don\u2019t know if you all heard that, but we also had the intangible amortizations on the acquisitions, which would affect...", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Looking at the deconversion of BAMS though, that's been going on for a while, no? I mean, shouldn't that have been in the run rate already?", "James B. Lipham", "The deconversion of -- yes, it was in there.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "But in other words, it seem like it had a significant incremental negative impact in the quarter versus previous quarters.", "James B. Lipham", "So we lost about, I guess, it was $4.7 million for the BAMS over what we had in '12. I mean, when we -- but it was a little bit higher, maybe but we do expect them to slow down a little bit as we worked on a new contract with them.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Is that a negative $4.7 million of revenue and operating income from BAMS year-over-year?", "James B. Lipham", "Pretty much the same, yes.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "I see. And then could you give us an update on NetSpend? You gave us your thoughts on earnings accretion on an annualized basis in broad brush strokes. When you made the acquisition 2 months ago, I believe you said low teens accretive to cash net income. 2 months further in due diligence-wise, what are your thoughts in terms of EPS impact on an annualized basis?", "James B. Lipham", "We haven't seen anything at this point to change any of our original assumptions. And obviously, as Phil mentioned, the board meets in May, hoping this thing will get done and we'll get back to you before the quarter end or right at quarter end with some new guidance numbers.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Jason Kupferberg.", "Unknown Analyst", "On behalf of Jason. Just a quick question, have you seen any competition on the acquiring side from the alternate entrants, i.e. Square. And particularly with the ProPay acquisition, it has that Square-like dongle, have you bumped into these players in the market?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I've talked to our guys that are running the merchant business and they're not really bumping into them a lot. I mean, I think we're going after a different segment. I think we told you before that we like the multiple -- we have a term for it, and it escapes me right now but like Mary Kay Cosmetics and some of these companies that have salespeople out, tens of thousands of salespeople out selling almost to their neighbors, et cetera. And we've got a system that works very well for, if you look at our dongle, it's very, very similar to what Square's look like -- looks like. It does some things that we don't think Square does, but I mean, again, it's a different segment of the merchant business and the reports I'm getting are -- we're just not running into them.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay. And then just a follow-up on that, staying with Square. I mean, we obviously saw Square start processing the Starbucks transactions. Has that -- have you seen any flow-through like that? Has there been any pricing pressures as a result?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "No. I mean, they -- don't get me wrong. There is pricing pressure everyday, but pricing pressure that I can attribute to that, no.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay. And then just lastly and broadly, what is your overall reaction to Visa-Chase CMS deal? Do you think this is something we might see more of going forward?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, we're still trying to figure out exactly what it is. And we haven't actually reached anything, a conclusion that we're comfortable with yet. We've talked to a lot of different people, and you might want to save that question for next quarter or at least a couple of weeks because we just -- and maybe we're a little slow, but we've tried to dig into the details and it's just missing some things and we're going to reserve judgment until we figure that out. Although I do think that the future will have deals like this, and I don't think they'll be restricted to Chase. I mean I think that Visa and MasterCard will continue to do things in this arena.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Greg Smith.", "Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Can you just help flush out sort of what, in the quarter, what came in below expectations? It sounded like revenue is a little lighter, the North American transactions were a little lighter. Just wondering if you can sort of talk about that? And then were all the one-time charges and expenses, I mean, I assume all of that was anticipated going into the quarter. Is that correct?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, not all of it. Certainly the outage that we had was not anticipated.", "James B. Lipham", "All the one-time stuff of $3.7 million was not anticipated and when you look at the quarter, and I've talked a little bit about the lower growth in transactions, we think that there was some hesitancy going on with consumer spending with the sequester going on and with delayed income tax spending. So that was not considered and -- but outside of that, I mean you just had less of a revenues and the effect of, like we said, BAMS was up a little bit higher than we thought.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "BAMS' loss.", "James B. Lipham", "Loss, yes.", "Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So then where does the confidence get in and where does the confidence come from that things are going to pick up, because you're going to need an acceleration in some of that internal revenue growth to hit your guidance.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Yes, I mean we are still -- I mean, we don't like surprises anymore than anybody and we really had, I'd say a couple of surprises. And we think we are certainly not changing our guidance. We will -- we're going to do what is required to make our guidance and we feel good about it. Obviously, we're going to have to change it at some point as this NetSpend transaction comes to fruition. And in that way, we can be official about it. But if that were not to happen, we are still sticking with our guidance that we gave you earlier this year.", "Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then the CUP Data, any update there? The equity income popped up nicely. It looks strong. Can you give us an update on what's happening over there?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, we just had a board meeting with them last week and...", "James B. Lipham", "Well, the -- we -- when we closed out year end, they actually came in a little stronger than what we had anticipated. So we picked it up in the first quarter. But they are running on a rate of growing again this year, around 20% net income. So they're still doing an outstanding job over there.", "Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just last question, is there any way you can give us a little more detail on the timing of the 100 million accounts? I know most of that is in 2014, but any more granularity potentially on how that's going to play out on a quarterly basis?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Greg, I don't have it right in front of me. We've got part of it in the fourth quarter of this year, not a big chunk of it though. Most of it is in the mid to -- around mid-2014. There may be a piece of it just a little beyond that, but I would say, we'll have the vast majority of it done by then. And the majority of it, obviously, would be the Bank of America conversion.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Bryan Keane.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I just wanted to understand, the operating margins were reiterated at 22% to 24%. Is that excluding all these one-time charges? Because you were significantly below on a year-over-year basis and below most street models. So I'm trying to get a sense, do you expect a hockey stick of margin increase as we go forward in order to get back into that 22% to 24% range?", "James B. Lipham", "We do expect the margins to improve as we go through the year. As the revenues will pick up, we'll anniversary off some of this lost business and it'll be better.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So does the 22% to 24% include all these one-time charges you called out or does it exclude M&A, and what does it include and exclude?", "James B. Lipham", "It excluded M&A. It did have the $2.6 million for the software rewrite and the merchant business. And it did not have the one-time $3.7 million cost in it.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "But you'll still, including that $3.7 million one-time charge, you're still be in, I guess, the 22% to 26% range?", "James B. Lipham", "Yes.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay.", "James B. Lipham", "But not have any 22% to 24%.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I'm sorry, 22% to 24%, yes.", "James B. Lipham", "Yes.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And does that -- do we -- is it more a back half of the year where the margins will increase significantly or starting in the second quarter, we should see it back to more normalized margins?", "James B. Lipham", "You'll see more of the increase in the third and fourth quarter as we anniversary these things.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "[indiscernible]", "James B. Lipham", "Yes, it should be increased in the second. We're hoping we're having more of these one-time item shares.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Right, right. And then just to make sure I have it. For the effective -- to get to the EPS ex M&A, what was the tax rate in the quarter to get there? I think you guys are saying in your press release $0.33, because you're still reiterating the tax rate, but I'm getting a much lower tax rate to get to that $0.33 number.", "James B. Lipham", "Well, you're talking about the tax rate for the quarter?", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes, the effective tax rate for the quarter ex M&A cost, I think is $0.33. I just want to make sure I've got the right tax rate to calculate that.", "James B. Lipham", "We don't have it handy, but if I remember correctly, it was 20s -- 24%.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "24%.", "James B. Lipham", "For the quarter.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So when we're talking about 32% and -- 32% to 33% range for the year, then we're expecting a significant increase above that range to offset that lower tax rate in the first quarter? Just trying to make sure I got that right.", "James B. Lipham", "Yes, you got it right. I mean, we picked up $6.4 million in discreet adjustment in the first quarter. And it was in our guidance, the 32% to 33% tax rate for the whole year of '13. So it was figured into that rate that we had in guidance. It's just we got a lower -- you're going to have a lower quarter whenever that hits.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Steven Kwok.", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "My question is around capital management. I know currently...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Steven, Steven?", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Yes?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Can you speak up? We can hardly hear you.", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Sure. My question is around capital management. I know you guys are currently dealing with the NetSpend acquisition, but is there any guidance as to like how -- what are your targets in terms of once the acquisition is complete, to return capital back to shareholders and what your targets are for like the debt-to-equity and everything else?", "James B. Lipham", "After the NetSpend acquisition, we're going to probably be tied up for a year in retiring some debt to reduce our leverage and -- but it will be a year, we'll have to digest the NetSpend acquisition before we can make any other promises or any other use of funds.", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Is there a targeted ratio that you look at? And once you get below that, you'll consider returning capital back to shareholders?", "James B. Lipham", "Probably 2%. We'll be at -- moved up to about 2.6% leverage and we want to get it back to at least 2%.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Glenn Fodor.", "Glenn T. Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just on the International Services side with respect to the operating margin. Sorry if I missed it if you gave an annual texture here, but this was the first time we saw a year-over-year increase in margins, at least according to my model. What's the goal for -- do we have a goal here for 2013, and are you confident we're on a sustainable road for sequentially in year-over-year increasing margins from here on out?", "James B. Lipham", "Yes, we have goal for the year to be in the low-double digits and we are on track for achieving that.", "Glenn T. Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just to inquire on the small bank strategy, just an update there on how it's going and how you think it's tracking versus expectations? And are your conversations there now changing?, You don't have NetSpend into the full, but it's imminent that you will, how are the conversations on those fronts changing?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Glenn, they still continue to go very well. We have a lot of the small bank prospects. You have to consult with them a lot more, I would say, to get them to move and to get them to bring up the processing portfolio. But there's a lot of interest out there and we're starting to build that portfolio up. It will take time because the numbers are just so much smaller. But on a per account basis, we -- our revenue is significantly higher, and we think that's going to be a good little business for us.", "Glenn T. Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I'm sure it will. When you think about revenue per account, can you give us sort of order of magnitude? Is it twice as much as your overall company average, is it 3x? Just something sort of, rough range.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Don't ask me that. I don't have it in front of -- Jeff, do you have this? We can get back with you on that, but I do not have it in front of me.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Tulu Yunus.", "Tulu Yunus - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "I'm going to ask, did RBS have an impact on the price concession there in the first quarter? And can you remind us when that was repriced, whether it will have an impact in 2Q?", "James B. Lipham", "RBS did not have an impact in the first quarter. And what's the second part?", "Tulu Yunus - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. So that's already anniversaries and nothing in 2Q. Okay. Got it. And just secondly, just to dovetail off of Glenn's question actually on, I guess, conversations regarding -- with your banks, with your bank clients regarding the prepaid assets that you'll bring on board here. I mean, I guess what's the thought process in trying to cross-sell NetSpend into your client base? And are you thinking about adding sales behind that, or how are you thinking about it? Or is it way too premature right now?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, it's probably a little premature. I know that you guys from NetSpend are chomping at the bits, to go start calling on our clients. We do have interest. We think it makes sense, not only to go to our issuing clients, who are really warming up to the idea of issuing a general-purpose reloadable card. They're warming up to that a lot as you can see by the banks that have already issued those cards. And I think we'll also see some good interest from our merchant portfolio and I do think we can sell this to our TAS customers also, who would like to -- who have merchants that are -- would be interested in this sort of service. And I go back to one thing that we all tend to overlook is this payroll card segment of NetSpend and that's a pretty hot product these days. And we think that, as a matter of fact, we've had calls from local businesses here in Columbus that have said, \"Man, we're thrilled. When can you get those guys to come call on us?\" And we're letting them go ahead and call on those folks.", "Tulu Yunus - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Right, right. That's certainly an interesting opportunity given...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "We think it's really interesting. And I think we've got to be smart enough to make it work and I think we can do that.", "Tulu Yunus - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Right. And then just lastly on just Merchant Services segment, looking at your growth, it seems like it's growing sort of in-line, maybe even a touch slower than the market, excluding the deconversion, et cetera. What's the strategy longer-term to get that back up -- the growth back up there? I mean, are you going to -- are you growing referral channels? Are you adding sales headcount? Is there anything that you're doing to really sort of...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Honestly, Tulu, we're doing all of those that you just suggested. We've got a new Head of Sales, who's been there 6, 7 months. Our guys are really aggressive. We're adding sales staff. The 2 acquisitions that we made will give us some options that we haven't had in the past, just like this dongle product. So we're pretty excited about it. But again, it is a very tough business right now because it seems like everybody's wanting to compete on price, and we want to compete on, obviously, we have to compete on price, but we also want to compete on service. And you're going to have good quarters and not so good quarters. And we're doing everything we can to have good quarters. We -- it is a big priority for us to make sure that business grows.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Roman Leal.", "Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "First question, a follow-up question on margins. Sorry to beat a dead horse here, but just given all the puts and takes, and obviously there were some one-timers that you contemplated, some that perhaps were more surprising, and you're keeping the guidance suggest that you have some pretty good comfort and expectations that revenue will pick up? And I just wondered, what in the data or perhaps in your conversations with banks make you feel confident that the transactions coming in lighter this quarter would accelerate kind of into next quarter or over the next 3 quarters. And I know a lot it will be back-end loaded. But what do you feel from a timing perspective, what makes you feel comfortable there?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, we're never totally comfortable. We're always looking behind us, making sure nobody's chasing us. But the truth is the banks are optimistic about this business. It's one of the more profitable segments that they have. There's a lot of new product that's being built and going out the door. We're talking to a lot of banks that want to get into this business that have not historically been in it and we're putting them in the business. You're also starting to see more and more mailings in your mailbox with some of our issuers. And we're seeing a lot of our -- I say a lot, several of our really large commercial card clients letting us take them to Europe, in particular. We think there'll be some good growth there, it's a very good product for us. All in all, I mean we feel like without a couple of surprises, this would've been a really good quarter for us. We would've had some x items like the acquisition expenses, but our mind has not changed. I mean, the first quarter is always a letdown from the fourth quarter just because you're coming off of holidays and where people have a head of steam on purchasing, and that eases up through the first quarter. And the next quarter -- this business is somewhat cyclical. The 2 best quarters are the third and fourth quarters. So we know we've got the best coming. So we do have some confidence. I mean, there's certainly no guarantees but we have confidence. We've been in this business a long time and you've heard me say before, you could overlay volume growth or authorization growth for the last 30 years and the trend is absolutely the same. The numbers would be bigger but the trend is absolutely the same. We think we're in good shape there. We don't like surprises like we had in the first quarter. We've always tried to be transparent with you folks about things like that and I hope you think we have on this one.", "Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Sure. That's actually really good color. And Phil, when you look out across those segments, how important in international, how important is revenue acceleration versus just cost efficiencies to get to your margin targets for there?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, it's very important. And I think you will see some good growth. I hope I say growth. You'll see us sign some good customers here in the near future, at least I believe you'll see that in the second quarter. Some names that you will instantly recognize. We're excited about that as I -- we need the revenue. This is a business that is certainly impacted by economies of scale. We've got the infrastructure and we can add a lot of scale to that infrastructure without really ramping up the cost.", "Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. Got it. Okay. And last one, on merchant acquiring. Obviously a lot of focus on pricing and you did mention that part of what you saw this quarter was -- even negative pricing there. Can you maybe give us a little bit more color on whether that's more in the kind of small and midsized segment versus across the board and maybe the magnitude of pricing that we're seeing there?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I think that in the merchant business, it's just like the card issuing business, or card processing business. Price is something that you just have to deal with. I mean, it's a way of life in both of those businesses and we're used to dealing with it. What we are certainly trying to do is build a better mousetrap for the issuing side as well as the merchant acquiring side. And that's why we are stepping out and spending money when a lot of people are absolutely not spending a nickel trying to enhance their systems and capabilities for the future. We think it's just like this package that I was talking to you about on the card issuing side. These guys here laugh at me but I call it Star Wars. Because I think when a lot of people that we compete with see that, they're going to say, \"Oh, my God. I mean, we're going to have to compete against that?\" And I think it's going to be a real game changer. But only time will tell. That's my experience, tells me that, that is going to really set some folks back. And I'm very excited about it. But we've got to get it done and we've got to make it work. And I have no doubt we will do that. And this new merchant system that we're bringing, the First National Bank of Omaha portfolio, over to -- it's a huge project. I mean, it's not something that you can just do in 90 days or 6 months. It's a big project. And I think we're going to be very successful with that. And when that happens, it will be a very good thing for our business. We will save a lot of money. We will certainly recover our expenses pretty quickly. And so I'm excited about the future. I mean like I said, I'm not happy with the power outage but I'm certainly happy with NetSpend and the way the card business is looking and the way the merchant business is looking.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of -- one moment. Yes, our next question will come from the line of Darrin Peller.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Listen, I just want to touch, on the -- in the slides, the 7.6%, 6% headwind that you talked about earlier has a big drag on the growth rate this quarter. It's a bigger number than we've seen in the past, obviously. And so, when we look at that, I think compared to the end of last year, you had about a 4% or 4.5% headwind in terms of the lost business, nonrecurring items, the price compression. In aggregate, this quarter was 7.6%. So what I'd like to hear is really a breakdown of the anniversary of those items and what, if anything, we should expect to replace that? In other words, if we pull those items out, your growth rate would have been close to 10%. So obviously, there's always going to be some price concessions to get new business, but then you have lost business, you have nonrecurring items, how much is going to actually anniversary and when? And then what is going to -- what, if anything, is going to replace it going forward?", "James B. Lipham", "I went over several of them. I'll go over them one more time but in North America, you've got the BofA card, which is $3.6 million roughly, and it's going to anniversary in May. You've got ABN AMRO and international segments, about $7 million and this is going to have a June anniversary. And you've got in the merchants, you've got BAMS going on about $4.8 million for the quarter and then will slow some as we go forward, but certainly not anniversary as they got another year or 2 to go.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Darrin, I think on the BAMS business, that one is really kind of hard to predict. I mean, that business was supposed to have been gone 3 years ago totally. We've been fortunate to keep it. We appreciate it. Made a lot of money on it. But we don't control when they pull it out. And we're trying to sit down with them and come to some -- a better, more controlled roll-off, if you will.", "James B. Lipham", "I think, too, remember that this a year-to-date type number and they'll get -- as these things anniversary, this 7.6% will start shrinking, get down to the 5% range, probably.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "All right. And so, look, I mean you just went through 2 or 3 BAMS and the other 2 items, which get you to maybe 2 or 3 percentage points, the difference of that 7.6%. When that anniversaries, which is basically the third and fourth quarter of this year, is there -- are there going to be other similar items that replace it and continue to act as a headwind or -- because I know, I guess, you just said...", "James B. Lipham", "I know of [indiscernible] at this point, and the one I did forget to give you was a price concession on the Bank of America commercial cards. And it has about 2%, and it will anniversary in August.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "All right. All right. And then -- so that's helpful. And then understanding the international growth this quarter, it came in below our estimate and sequentially showed a change also, down. I know there's obviously some holidays spending that helps in the quarter, but can you just give us a little clarity on what's going on in the International segment in this quarter and what are your goals in terms of, putting aside margins for a moment, what's actually just top line growth? We've heard anecdotally from different checks we've done that there is actually expected to be some acceleration in Europe on the issuer processing side. And so, if you could give us some color on what you see there, we'd appreciate it.", "James B. Lipham", "I mean, we've had, in the case of Europe, you've got the ABN Amro and several deconversions that we've had starting last year that were pretty large. And we do have good business that's on the books today that's growing. What I like to call value-added services, managed services is starting to pick up some. We've got good project revenues, RBS is strong. I don't -- as far as signing new customers, we don't have anything that much in the pipeline, but we are talking to some very large prospects. So we anticipate that we'll start financing more business there in the core U.K.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "All right. And just last question for me in the free cash flow front. You mentioned that, and honestly, I missed the comment you said, I think it is around software. But what was reason for the, I guess, lower run rate of free cash versus the $300-plus million we were seeing in the prior quarters? And then going forward, you said, I think another quarter in that run rate and then after that it improves?", "James B. Lipham", "Well, the -- on the free cash flow of $254 million, I mean we spent about $87 million -- excuse me, $84 million all total with software, prepaid maintenance. So we had an accrual at the end of last year for a large block of software that we paid out here in the first quarter. And so that will -- on a trailing 12-month that will continue to show up until you anniversary.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Right. But I guess from a monthly cash generation standpoint, are you still in the range of $30 million or so a month excluding that payout?", "James B. Lipham", "Yes, on a go-forward. We expect the cash flow from operations next quarter will be back up around $100 million.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Ashwin Shirvaikar.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "So I guess my first question, you mentioned consumer weakness was a factor in the quarter. Was there any trend throughout the quarter? Did it get worse as the quarter progressed? Better? Any comments there?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I don't know of any trend, Ashwin. I think what Jimmy was talking about is a lot of our folks around here feel like there was some apprehension with sequester and the tax bill that was passed, and a lot of people didn't know what was in it. And hopefully, there's been some -- people do understand now and there's some certainty to a lot of this. But the sequestration thing, I don't know what to say about it. I mean I've been watching the news. I haven't been in the Atlanta Airport in the last couple of days, but I understand it's a mess. But I think people will continue to use their cards. I think most people feel like things are better. I think they would have to feel like things are better. But I don't think we saw a trend, just what I said earlier. I think the first quarter is traditionally one of the weakest quarters we have and you throw in a couple of hiccups and you have to deal with those. So we expect it to continue to improve. One thing that I meant to tell Darrin and anybody that asked about international, we'll -- I don't believe we'll ever get the international margins up to the North American margins, primarily because table stakes internationally require that you offer call center services, which don't have the margins that the processing services have. But we do expect those to continue to climb up. And as we add volume internationally, they will get better. Still pretty interesting, the international transaction growth is actually higher, it has been now for several quarters, than the North American transaction growth.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I guess one clarification. I think when you mentioned the pipeline of roughly 101 million accounts. I thought part of that was going to convert in 3Q, 4Q, but you said mostly converts in 2014. Just want to make sure, did I hear it wrong?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Hold on. We're trying to be clear on this. Second quarter of '14. BofA. In the summer, we are saying June and then there's another piece that will happen, not Bank of America, but another bank, will happen in, pretty good sized, in the August, September range of '14.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Got it. Okay. Okay. And there are a lot of questions on this call about, I guess Bank of America, BAMS, the role-offs and price concessions and so on. So my question is more forward-looking. What's on tap that could result in material price concessions or deconversions in terms of renewals coming up, if you can comment on that?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, we figured that renewals have historically been about 2% a year. We've got, as you heard, there are several things that are in the 7.6% that we went down the list with Darrin with -- that will anniversary -- I think mostly all of those anniversary this summer. The BAMS thing is the one thing we just can't control because they have the ability to take off a lot and we just have some minimums. And we're hoping to, as I said earlier, to try to work out some arrangement where it will be more stable, if you will. But that's been a huge piece of business that has just kind of fallen away over the past 3 years or so. As I told somebody earlier, we are very fortunate that they have kept as much as they have with us for as long as they have and we wish they would leave the rest of it here forever. But I mean, we're working our way through that right now.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Right. Right. But beyond what you already mentioned, there isn't -- I mean, are there renewals...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "We don't have anybody that has sent us a termination. We don't have anybody who has been acquired. We do have several people that we will probably do renewals with sometime in 2013. Those are not on a firm schedule yet. But the renewals won't be any more than they typically are. And these are not as big as a lot of these things we've renewed over the years. So I don't know. Once you get past what we've gone over, I don't honestly know of anything, other than a couple of renewals, that could have this effect again. And we'll be glad -- we'll be just as glad, as you will, to get this lumpiness out of these numbers with these -- with the anniversaries and with the termination fees. We just -- we'd be glad to get through that. We've been trying to get through it really since the recession. And just like ABN AMRO, that's part of that recession process where they did that deal with RBS and they wound up getting sold and the new owner had his own program, and so they're migrating that to them.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Craig Maurer.", "Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Most of my questions have been answered at this point. I just wanted to know if you can go into a little more detail regarding where you're seeing pricing pressures? Is it more on the small merchants side? Are you seeing it in larger merchants? Just curious.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, I think we're seeing it across the board. I mean obviously, we don't have a lot of large merchants. But the ones that we do, we've seen it on several of them. Our business is mostly in midstream and smaller merchants. And it's a process where you just have to stay close to them because there's a lot of people. I was at a men's clothing store the other day here in Columbus and he's a friend of mine and most all of us in this room do business with him. And he had 2 calls on the phone while I was in there trying to set up appointments with him to take a look at somebody else's offerings. And he would be a small merchant. So that's just an example. And it just -- that's part of the business we live in. And we've got to compete on price and we've got to have better service.", "Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Actually one follow-up. You're talking about the technology buildout on the issuing processing side. When we think about what you're building out, you're not exactly, obviously you're not going into too much detail at this point, but should we be thinking about this like same type of leap you made to TS2? Will that really put some of your competitors in a hurt locker for a while or is this more incremental?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I think it's going to hurt some people. I think it's going to be pretty slick. And I think it's going to make us easier to do business with. I think it'll make conversions easier. I think it'll make start-up products easier. It will certainly give the card carrier, the person, customer of the issuer much more flexibility as it relates to technology in ways to manage their accounts. It will certainly make it easier on the bank, customer service people. I can't go into a lot of details, but it's been a while since I've really been excited about a technology product, and I'm excited about this one.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Brett Huff.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "I want to go through kind of like what Jim, maybe what you did for the revenue. Can you just -- I want to make sure I got all the moving parts on the negative impact to margins. Can you just -- sorry to make you do it again, can you just enumerate those for us again and articulate kind of recurring versus non?", "James B. Lipham", "Okay. We've got the merchant acquisition expense of about $3.5 million effect on margins. We had some onetime items affecting net operating expenses of $3.7 million.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "And that's the data center?", "James B. Lipham", "That's some of it, yes, and then some other items in there. But that does include that. And then ...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "That's the big one.", "James B. Lipham", "That's the big one...", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "That will -- will the -- that won't -- the data center won't recur, correct?", "James B. Lipham", "Correct. All of that $3.7 million should not recur.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "If it does, about half of us will be gone.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "And sorry, just to be -- just before you go on, sorry. I thought before you said before you had about $6.2 million pretax, $5.2 million after-tax, NetSpend M&A impact. But you just said $3.5 million. Am I missing something?", "James B. Lipham", "You've got some interest costs below the margin line.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of James Friedman.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "So couple of questions. Since you changed the reporting segments a couple of years back, we don't get under the hood in terms of the value-added services. Jimmy, you had alluded to them in your prior comments. Phil, maybe if you could maybe make just some qualitative comments on how are things like Fraudguard performing in this environment? Do they give you a competitive advantage still?", "James B. Lipham", "The percentage of value-added used to be up around 24%, 25%. And currently, we're seeing about 11% to 12% and -- but yes, we got away from us talking about that so much.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "So are things like Fraudguard performing through the same level that they were previously or is it because they've been folded in by other services?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "No, I think we're performing very well. The revenue stream has changed so much. I mean, we're still -- if you broke it out by North America and international, it would be higher than that, this is a percentage of everything. All revenues, which includes the merchant revenues and certainly those have gone up pretty dramatically over the last year or so. I don't know what it would be just on Q. We don't have that in front of us, but that's 12% on the entire revenue base. It really -- there's not much of an opportunity for those services on the merchant acquiring or the merchant processing business.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "And then about merchant acquiring sale, people, investors...", "James B. Lipham", "Jamie, we're really having a hard time hearing you. Can you...", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "So investors, I'd like to get your perspective on industry trends, obviously. Just wondering, with regard to your decision not to acquire in merchant acquiring, was that a referendum on your perspective on the future of the industry in any way, or was it...", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "No, it was a referendum on opportunities, really. We had to look at -- we had looked at several that we -- and we had bid on several, frankly, that we lost on. We bid on a couple that we won and we looked around at what was available and becoming available. And it -- there was one out there that would have been about the same price as NetSpend. We saw an opportunity in a very high-growth area, that we are the largest processor in the world in anyway, an area that we like a lot and it seemed to make sense to us and we think it's really a great fit but we still like the merchant business. We have not -- it would be a mistake to read anything into that. That is not a referendum on the merchant acquiring business or the merchant processing business. It was just about opportunities. And this thing, one day, when it's all settled down, I'll tell you the entire story about how it happened and it's pretty unique. But I think you'll see us, Jimmy said a year. I'll say we're out of the -- we're out of that business for the foreseeable future. But we would -- we've got -- we will have more debt than we've ever had. We want to -- we're pretty conservative, as you know. We like having a very strong balance sheet. We will pay down a lot of debt and then we will start snooping around again and see what's out there and what we can find. It makes sense for us.", "Well, listen, everybody. We appreciate you being on the call. We appreciate your interest in TSYS. I hope you -- our comments today were helpful. We are certainly laser-focused on this business. I hope you think we've been transparent, and we really are pushing forward with our strategies and growth plans. And I think we're also creating an ecosystem that -- and a business model that will support the next generation of payments, not just the current generation of payments. And we're very excited about that on all fronts. So with that, again, thank you for your interest and we will adjourn the meeting. Thank you.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the TSYS conference call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Shawn Roberts, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Mr. Roberts, you may begin.", "Shawn Roberts", "Thank you, Josh, and welcome, everyone. On the call today, our Chairman and CEO, Phil Tomlinson, will open up with a few remarks; our COO, Troy Woods, will provide business highlights on our 4 segments; and then turn it over to our CFO, Jim Lipham, who will review our consolidated financials. After that, we'll open the call up for Q&A.", "I'd like to now call your attention to the fact that we'll be making some forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS' actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in TSYS' reports filed with the SEC.", "At this time, I'd like to introduce TSYS CEO, Phil Tomlinson.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Thank you, Shawn. And I'm thrilled to be with you today. I can't tell you how mortified I was last July 23 when my voice went totally out. Just a little hoarse today, but we've just had some bad weather here. I wound up with what they call a paralyzed vocal cord and got a shot in it a couple of weeks ago and figured out what it was, and I'm on my way back strong.", "So anyway, like I said, I'm glad to be back, and we did change the format last time and -- where Troy Woods went in and went over the 4 segments. And we had some good feedback on that. I thought Troy did a great job, and we're going to continue to do that. We had good feedback both in the buy and the sell side.", "I hope all of you have had a chance to see our earnings release. We had a good third quarter. And overall, I'm feeling really good about our business and continue to believe that our future is bright.", "And I'll turn it over to Troy for his review. Troy?", "M. Troy Woods", "Thank you, Phil. Glad to have you back. We'll begin our segment reviews this afternoon. I would like to provide you with an update on some of the more significant corporate-wide initiatives that we are working on.", "From a corporate perspective, we are continuing to place significant emphasis on 3 major corporate-wide initiatives. The first one is the migration of our direct merchant business from the FNBO platform to TSYS. During the third quarter, we achieved significant milestones with the final phase of our 3-year migrations plan, with the back-end integration of our clearing and settlement system through several successful pilots. We remain on schedule to complete the conversion to the new platform in the first quarter of 2014, which would allow us to operate much more efficiently and effectively than we have in the past. The conversion also provides us with the new products and solutions that will significantly expand our addressable market. Once the conversion is complete, we will be processing close to 100% of our direct portfolio on a single platform, which we believe will give us an advantage over the vast majority of our competitors.", "The second corporate-wide initiative is our business and technology strategy to support the next generation of financial technology. We have been referring to this multiyear, multiphase strategy as Surround. This new technology framework will allow us to create a series of next-generation consumer servicing products, enable omni-channel capabilities, mask the complexities of sending and receiving data across multiple platforms and allow for easier innovation and simplify client integrations and conversions. Surround, when combined with our industry-leading processing platforms, will create the market's new gold standard in payments processing, and we're all very excited about introducing Surround to the market in 2015.", "The third major corporate-wide initiative is the emphasis we are placing on becoming a more innovative company. We have identified an outstanding team to lead our innovation efforts across the enterprise, and we have declared innovation a part of everyone's job at TSYS. During the third quarter, we opened the new TSYS Idea Center where we collaborate on new products and services with clients, partners and team members. The Idea Center allows us to prototype new payment solutions, improving our ability to innovate, create what-if scenarios with clients and prospects, test the interest for development and then deliver these new offerings in an expedited manner. All 3 of these initiatives are progressing very well and from beginning to end, represent an overall investment exceeding $85 million, which we believe will return significant dividends to TSYS and our customers over the long term.", "Now I would like to begin our segment reviews by beginning on Page 6 with North America. I mentioned last quarter that by any performance measurement, the second quarter was a very good quarter. I'm happy to report that we believe the third quarter for the North American segment is even better. Revenue before reimbursables increased 6.8% to $217.3 million. This revenue increase was driven by increased transactions, growth in accounts on file and new sales of value-added services, particularly from our fraud detection products and managed services. We also benefited from the HSBC portfolio conversion for Cap One in July. This 6.8% revenue increase represents the highest quarter percentage increase for the North American segment in 2 years.", "Operating income for the quarter was a strong $82.3 million, representing an increase of 17.4% over the same period last year. In addition to strong revenue growth, the increase in operating income was attributable to higher capitalization of conversion project costs and excellent overall expense management, with expenses before reimbursables increasing only 1.2% for the quarter. These factors combined to produce a 37.9% operating margin, continuing our positive trend in margin improvement. Since the third quarter of 2012, the North America segment has increased its operating margin by 343 basis points.", "Page 7 reflects continued strong growth in accounts on file and transaction volume, increasing 11.6% and 17.6%, respectively. During the quarter, we added a net of 17.6 million consumer, commercial and debit card accounts, 11.2 million from conversions and 6.4 million from our existing customers and a net gain of 30 million accounts overall. Our conversion pipeline for North America remains strong as well. We recently completed the conversion of approximately 1 million accounts for the First National Bank of Puerto Rico and for KeyBanc, and those 2 conversions will end our conversion activity for the remainder of this year. This will leave us with approximately 89 million accounts to convert during 2014.", "During our call last quarter, we provided a conversion schedule that indicated that we expected 79 million accounts to be converted during the second quarter of 2014. We now expect that 75 million of those accounts will be shifted into the third quarter rather than the second quarter. Once we complete the conversion of these 89 million accounts, we project that our number of accounts on file for North America will have increased 30% versus year-end 2012 without any consideration for organic growth.", "As we continue to be laser-focused on ensuring that we convert the accounts in the pipeline, we remain equally focused on winning new business. We are experiencing significant success in expanding our business with regional and community banks, as well as with credit unions. And we are currently in negotiations on several new agreements. All in all, it was a great quarter for our North America segment.", "Now I would like to ask you to move to Page 8 for a review of the International segment. Not unlike the first 2 quarters, we encountered significant currency headwinds of $6.4 million this quarter, which resulted in a year-over-year revenue decrease of 2.8%. On a constant currency basis, revenue was up 3.7%. Although these currency headwinds continued to persist, representing $16.7 million year-to-date, we are encouraged by, one, a 205-basis-point margin improvement sequentially and a 285-basis-point improvement over the same period last year; two, profitable revenue growth on a constant currency basis as we continue to build our scale; three, a record number of accounts processed, at 59 million, which represented a 12% increase over last year. All of this $6.4 million year-over-year account growth was delivered by our existing customers through product extension and diversification; and, fourth, we are working on 2 conversions and 5 individual launches that should deliver over 1.5 million new accounts over the next 18 months to our International segment.", "We continue to execute on our margin improvement plan and expect to end the year with an operating margin of approximately 11% compared to 6.9% in 2012. As I mentioned last quarter, we are also accelerating some of our revenue growth opportunities to include an aggressive market expansion of our core processing and Value Added Services business across Europe, expanding our debit solutions into select markets in Europe, following our successful entry and current market share dominance in Ireland, developing our PRIME licensing business further across Asia and Latin America, extending our highly successful China UnionPay partnership by building out UnionPay issuing and acquiring solutions with our licensing clients, as well as pursuing new opportunities with CUP Data outside of our domestic market in China. And, lastly, we intend to establish more product partnerships and joint ventures, specific to enhancing our end-to-end capabilities that support our core issuing business around the globe. While the global economy continues to show varying signs of recovery, our core International business remains stable, with evolving pockets of healthy news, as well as near-term opportunities.", "Now we'll move to the Merchant segment review beginning on Page 10. For the quarter, our direct revenues were up 23.4%, and our indirect revenues were down 7.7%, resulting in a 5.4% increase in revenue for the segment. Excluding the decrease in BAMS, our year-over-year third quarter revenue growth would have been 9.4%. As I briefly mentioned last quarter, we are currently projecting the annual revenue from BAMS in 2013 to be approximately $16.5 million less than we received in 2012, and that is a significant amount of money to grow over in our indirect channel. Although the decline in revenue from BAMS remains a challenge to overcome, each year, as we move forward, BAMS will become a smaller portion of our Merchant segment revenues and, therefore, will be less of a drag on our revenue growth metrics.", "The year-over-year revenue growth rate chart on the bottom right of Page 11 reflects some of the continuing headwinds we face in the Merchant segment as a result of continued price compression in our indirect business, slightly negative growth in the rest of our indirect business, excluding BAMS, primarily as a result of several clients moving in-house, the vast majority of which was a result of being acquired. We have also begun to experience some revenue pressure in our direct business as the market begins to shift from bundled to unbundled pricing. We believe this shift in our direct business could be a short-term phenomenon, and that it will normalize once we complete the transition from pricing primarily on a bundled basis to pricing primarily on an unbundled basis. On the upside of this, I might add that the unbundled merchants that we are signing recently are typically larger, more established businesses than we have historically signed with a lower risk of attrition, which should also help our growth rate over the long term.", "Also, on Page 11, we reported record small business sector sales volume of $5.3 billion, representing a 22% growth over the third quarter of 2012, primarily driven by the CPAY acquisition. Our year-over-year growth rate fueled by our recent acquisitions continues to perform well. On a pro forma basis, CPAY is up 32%, and ProPay is up 8%. On the recognition front, CPAY was recently honored by Inc. Magazine for the fourth consecutive year as one of America's top 5,000 fastest-growing private companies. And last month, ProPay earned the Sellers Choice Award overall payment services in the Payment Service Provider category. I might also add that ProPay just recently signed several new customers that will double their processing volume on an annual basis. Although our margins remain under some pressure and we are not happy with some components of our growth profile, we remain keenly focused on sales growth initiatives and expense management in an effort to improve our margins and remain optimistic that we will continue to be able to grow the direct Merchant segment business, as evidenced by the signing of many new national accounts and the launching of new product offerings offsetting the declines in our indirect business.", "For the first time, we are very pleased and excited to be reporting NetSpend's financial results within our third quarter numbers, and this review begins on Page 12. NetSpend continued its strong top line growth, with revenue up 22.2% for the quarter, largely driven by growth in our direct deposit customer base and GDV. Adjusted operating income was $31.2 million, representing an increase of 68% over the third quarter 2012. We continue to generate expanding operating margin, achieving 30.1% in the quarter, which is partially attributed to removing corporate administrative expenses beginning this quarter to be consistent with our other segment reporting. On a like-for-like basis, the third quarter of 2013 margin would have been 27% versus 22% for the third quarter of 2012, a 500-basis-point margin improvement.", "Each of the 4 NetSpend channels delivered strong growth as a result of their leaders' continued focus on executing against their respective plans. In the quarter, we signed over 75 new PayCard clients in our retail channel, adding more than 1,000 new locations, including a successful pilot in Home Depot stores. You will also begin to see the PayPal Prepaid MasterCard rollout in stores nationwide beginning this month.", "Page 13 reflects the strong growth in direct deposit active cards and gross dollar volume increasing 23.8% and 22.4%, respectively. Our direct deposit card metric is key as the majority of the spend on our cards comes from direct deposit customers, and this in turn helps drive predictable and recurring revenues. This level of growth is especially exciting following such a robust tax season, which included our new partnership with Intuit and the launch of their TurboTax program.", "Now I would like to address how the segments are working together and the actions we are taking to drive synergies with respect to the NetSpend acquisition. During the quarter, we created a joint marketing and sales effort with the North America and Merchant segments. We have been introducing NetSpend to our customers and conducting joint sales meetings. We have also conducted multiple cross-training sessions to educate our various sales teams and account managers about NetSpend's products and services and vice versa. With this quarter's results, it bears repeating how excited we are to welcome NetSpend to the TSYS family. We believe we have created one of the most unique payment companies in the industry, and we are already seeing our teams plan and execute on opportunities we see to growth revenue.", "Also, the past 90 days has confirmed what we expected going into this partnership, and that is NetSpend's vision to empower consumers, with the convenience, security and freedom to be self-defined, is a natural fit for the TSYS family, where we put people at the center of every decision we make. The NetSpend teams tell us that the credibility that TSYS brings to the table is already opening doors, and our existing and prospective clients, they are excited about our combined capabilities. We believe now more than ever before, in the opportunity we see together to grow.", "Now I would like to turn it over to Jim Lipham for a more in-depth financial review of the third quarter and consolidated year-to-date results. Jimmy?", "James B. Lipham", "Okay. Thanks, Troy. As Troy mentioned, for the quarter, the NetSpend results were outstanding. We expect NetSpend's revenues to continue the strong growth ahead in the third quarter into the fourth. As we expect now, they will contribute roughly $210 to $214 million in revenues. That's up $13 million to $14 million from our original guidance last quarter of $197 million to $200 million.", "We also, during this quarter, as Troy mentioned, incurred $6.3 million of negative currency translation for the quarter and $16.5 million year-to-date. We do expect our revenues to be reduced by $23 million to $24 million for the year as a result of the changes in foreign currencies compared to 2012. And you remember, we did recognize $10 million of currency in our guidance that we reissued at the end of the second quarter. But based on these 2 items, which offset each other, we are going to reaffirm our -- or affirm our current consolidated revenue guidance for 2013.", "On Slide 15, talking about the quarter revenues, we look at total revenues at $588.1 million. We're slightly above Thomson One's consensus of $586 million, a very strong growth of 25.6%. Revenues before reimbursables are also good growth at 29.8% for the quarter and 12.4% for the year. Our revenues before reimbursables obviously include the impact of our acquisition history for the past 12 months, and the biggest addition here is NetSpend at $103.7 million. With the NetSpend acquisition, our quarterly revenue mix is much more diverse now than it was last year. North America prior year comprised 50% of our revenue, and this year is 40.7%. The other 3 segments are representing roughly 18% to 22% revenues, so very well-diversified from where we were a year ago.", "Also, during the quarter, the revenues, as I mentioned, were negatively impacted by currency. Without this impact, revenues before would have been up 31.3% for the quarter and 13.8% for the year. On the offset, expenses for the quarter benefited from a favorable currency impact of $5.4 million, resulting in minimal impact on the operating income line. We were unfavorable about $830,000 for the quarter and unfavorable $2 million for the year. So on a net basis, it's clearly immaterial to our overall results but very important that we continue to monitor these foreign exchange rates as we ensure that we can maintain our natural hedge.", "Operating income for the quarter, $105.6 million, included $7.3 million of M&A expenses related to the acquisition of NetSpend, and that number was $12 million year-to-date. Excluding these onetime expenses, operating income for the quarter was up 24.2% as compared to the 16.2% reported. And the year-to-date was up 7.5% as compared to its reported 3%. Operating income also included $16.9 million of acquisition intangible amortization related to the NetSpend acquisition. This increased the operating margin by 287 basis points to 20%, which knocked it down below the 22% to 24% range that we were currently enjoying.", "A couple of other items to note, which are not shown separately on this slide, but which help to explain our net income results for the quarter, are that the nonoperating income includes $9.8 million of interest expense on the bonds for the quarter, and income taxes include a favorable onetime benefit of $2.4 million, bringing net income to $64.3 million for the quarter or $0.34 per share on a GAAP basis.", "Our adjusted cash, EPS, which excludes the after-tax impact of stock-based comp, amortization of acquisition intangibles and the M&A costs, is 49% for the quarter, which is up 37% and ahead of Thomson One consensus of 47% -- $0.47. The adjusted EBITDA, as you can see there, the margin was 34.6% for the quarter and 33.4% for the year, a very healthy margin in EBITDA.", "On Slide 16, is the chart that shows the breakout of our 12% growth in revenues for the first 9 months, it's a year-to-date chart. And you can see internal growth contributes 5.5% of the 12%, and it's really driven by North America and International. North America represents about 60% of this internal growth, and International is about 35%. New client revenue growth is driven also by North America and our Merchant segment. North America representing about 53% of this. The acquisitions of NetSpend, ProPay and CPAY added 13%. We have 3 months of NetSpend in these numbers, 9 months of ProPay and 7 months of CPAY in our 3 quarters of 2013. We also had the unfavorable currency. And if you net out 4 of those together, you end up with 20.2% increase and that's partially offset by 7.8% from the lost business and price reductions section. The last quarter, that was 8.2%. So you can see us decreasing as things get anniversary-ed. We did pick up a new one, this -- as far as lost business, this quarter would be the Chase license maturing, and that's roughly about $1.2 million a month. So we'll see that drop off in this next quarter. They left -- that license matured in July of this year.", "Next Slide, on Slide 17, is our accounts on file slide, and you can see the sequential increase is primarily related to the conversion of HSBC accounts for 10.7 million accounts in July. And we've had some other conversions that Troy mentioned, but we did see 15.1% growth in our traditional account on file categories and 11.7% overall account on file growth. So continued good growth year-over-year in our accounts on file.", "On Chart 18, this is our cash flow strength. And our cash flow this quarter had $150.2 million from operations. If you remember in the second quarter, we were at $104 million. So we've had a pretty good pickup. We will have semiannual bond interest payments of $17 million every 6 months, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013. These are being accrued, and obviously, the cash flow will be hit every 6 months for the interest. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations at $429 million and free cash flow at $277 million. We continue to generate good cash on EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA of $589 million. And adjusted EBITDA is our EBITDA -- we've got 1 quarter of NetSpend in there, plus we have adjusted the share-based comp and the NetSpend M&A expenses to get to the $589 million.", "Slide 19, this is our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, and we wanted to put forth to you the combined EBITDA, excluding onetime M&A costs of NetSpend and TSYS on a trailing -- I mean, on a 12-month basis. As a follow-up on our plan that we said in Q2, we reduced our debt since July 1 by just over $60 million. We brought it down from $1,618,000,000 down to $1,556,000,000. We continue to target the debt multiple range of 2x EBITDA and will continue to make debt repayments over the next several quarters. In conjunction with the expected growth in EBITDA that we have, we certainly expect to achieve this target soon. As we achieve this goal, we will be in a position to pursue additional capital deployment strategies such as the share repurchases and acquisitions.", "As I close my comments, I'd like to draw everyone's attention to our total shareholder return at 9/30/13, and our TSR year-to-date is at 38.8% and is considered to be ahead of where Standard & Poor's 500 total return of approximately 20%. So we've had a great 9 months, a great third quarter. And with that, I'll open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steve Kwok with KBW.", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "I guess my first question was around the operating margin. I was just wondering in terms of how much operating leverage do you think there is in the business. You had mentioned the range of 22% to 24%. Is there the ability to take it above that range over time? And how fast of an improvement could you see on a consolidated level?", "James B. Lipham", "I think there's room to take it. I don't know the timing of it. It's got to do a lot with what Troy was talking about with building the scale out in the International sector. We don't have scale in Brazil, and obviously, we need a little more scale in the International to do that. I think North America, with the growth that we are experiencing, are going to experience over the next year in the accounts from the pipeline, they're going to hold the scale down a little bit until we get a little age on those accounts. So I do think 22% to 24%, without the intangibles, are the write-off that we had of the intangibles this quarter. 287 basis points is going to keep us down around 20%.", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Got it. Got it. And then just in terms of the joint marketing efforts with NetSpend, could you give us a little bit more color on how that's going? I mean, how should we think about the synergies from the acquisitions over time?", "M. Troy Woods", "Steve, this is Troy. What we've indicated, of course, in the past is that, from a revenue perspective, we have a number out there of $25 million kicking in, I believe, in 2017. That is absolute the lowest number we would ever want to accept. That's the number we've got hanging out there. What we are doing between NetSpend, the North America segment and the Merchant segment, we're zeroing in on a couple of areas. One, from a PayCard perspective, obviously, I think NetSpend has about 7 or 8 financial institutions as referral partners. Clearly, TSYS has hundreds of banks. And so we're beginning to, after we get through the cross-training and introductions, to make joint calls there from a PayCard perspective, from a referral avenue. I think number two, as you well know, TSYS leads the market for commercial cards, small business processed. And one of the things that we believe we can do is make some introductions there for a business product for prepay. And so there's just a lot of avenue on the merchant side. We've talked about before the opportunity to not only open up some of our merchants in the Merchant segment to perhaps the distribution channels, some, but at the same time, to offer prepaid products. So all the cross-training is going on, joint calls are being conducted, we feel very confident about both the revenue and the expense synergies that we have outlined.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I think the 22% to 24% was the old kind of margins. I guess now looking at it on a cash basis, what should be the new targets for the operating margin? What does it come out to be? I have, on the quarter, you did about 26.3% adjusted operating margin. What should we now target on kind of a quarterly or annual basis?", "James B. Lipham", "I think on your segments, the way that we're reporting those, moving the corporate and [ph] man out of there, you're probably close to -- that's 26%, 26% to 30%.", "M. Troy Woods", "Bryan, your question was more corporate though, not segment?", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes. I guess we can do -- you can do it by segment and then also on the overall operating margin, adjusted operating margin that we should target now.", "James B. Lipham", "As this quarter went, we ended up with 20% margin for the quarter. And I think that once you -- I mean, if you're just looking strictly at operating income, it has amortization -- acquisition intangible amortization in it, then 20% is probably what you ought to look at.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes. But on an adjusted basis, it's going to be a lot higher than that from the way you're reporting the margins now. So I'm just trying to figure out what that target -- it sounds like it's probably north of 26%.", "James B. Lipham", "I don't think it's quite that high. I'm still in the 22% to 24%. I mean, you're 287 basis points is what the amortization worked out to be. And if you're 20%, you'd be at 22.87%, so close to 23%.", "M. Troy Woods", "Bryan, I think the difference may be that the only thing we're backing out is the amortization of the intangibles related to the acquisition. We're not backing out other amortization and other depreciation. So I think Jimmy is spot on with -- as a result of NetSpend's, whatever it was for the quarter, $16-plus million, it's 287 basis points. So the old \"but for\", it would have been 22.87% margin for the company for 3Q.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes. There's a couple of different ways you can look at the margins. I can work through that. Just on the Merchant segment, some of the pricing pressure you're seeing, is that an industry phenomenon bundled to unbundled or is that something that you're just specifically seeing in your niche of clients?", "M. Troy Woods", "Well, I think to some degree, it depends on who you're talking to. Obviously, there are a few players out there that perhaps go to market more on an unbundled basis versus a bundled basis. But when you put that off to the side, Mark Pyke, some of the conversations we've had over the past few months about that, Bryan, is, yes, we are seeing that in the marketplace. We've been seeing it, to some degree, for a while. But I think it just -- I wouldn't say it slipped up on us by any imagination, but the magnitude of the change since the third quarter of '12 to where we are today is pretty significant, the shift that we're seeing. And we're doing a lot of things. Mark and his team are working on 4, 5 mitigation strategies to help shore that up and get our arms around it.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And what's causing that shift, that change?", "M. Troy Woods", "I think it's everything from competition, the churn, the competition. All of those things are contributing to it.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just finally on the NetSpend business. Any change in the competitive landscape there? I know American Express has kind of relaunched their product, and there's some worry about potential pricing pressure from that. And then, I'd just be interested in your thoughts now that you've had NetSpend under your belt for a little while, how you see the outlook for the business.", "M. Troy Woods", "Not really, Bryan. We certainly, as we've talked on many occasions, we look at, we review, we study all the pricing out there in the marketplace. We're very familiar with what AmEx has announced that they're doing. But in many ways, it could be an advantage for TSYS and NetSpend. And the primary reason for that is that, as you probably know, from a reload revenue perspective, the amount of revenue that we get from reload fees is extremely de minimis. And so going to the marketplace with distribution channels that have low to 0 fees for reload doesn't concern NetSpend and TSYS that much. So -- but we watch it all. We're continually mindful of all of it. We haven't seen any changes over the last quarter.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Dave Koning with Robert W. Baird.", "David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I guess my first question is just EPS guidance. I think you gave some parameters last quarter, and I'm just wondering if we're kind of in the same ballpark as what we were in before.", "James B. Lipham", "We are.", "David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. Okay, good. And then, secondly, I know there've been some margin questions already. But just in North America, you continue to do such a good job on the margin front, and I know by late next year, when BofA comes on, I would imagine that might put a little pressure on margins. But just wondering, is that 37%, 38% rate sustainable or should we expect that to come down a little kind of later next year?", "M. Troy Woods", "Well, I think what we're looking at, at the moment, Dave, is the fourth quarter is probably going to be maybe down 100 basis points or so from the third quarter. As far as sustaining it, I do believe we can -- that 34%, 35% adjusted operating income level, we have said on many occasions that you do not bring in someone the size of Bank of America and have the kind of margins that we have for the entire North American sector. So we haven't given any guidance on that yet. We certainly will when we come out in January for our '14. But for the most part, directionally, you're correct. I think we can -- with the adjusted, we can get into that 34%, 35% range still, not necessarily the 37%, 38% that you see for this quarter.", "David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. No, that's great. And then, finally, just organic growth in Merchant Services. I know Bryan was just asking about pricing a little bit, but it just -- it went from about 9% growth, I think, in Q2 down to 1% in Q3. So how much of that deceleration is just kind of this incremental pricing pressure? And then maybe what else might be in there? What else, I guess, are you seeing maybe other than pricing that might be having a little slowdown impact?", "M. Troy Woods", "Well, we've lost some business on the indirect side. As I mentioned, we've lost some back-end business, some of which we have telegraphed before, some through acquisitions, some have taken their back-end business in-house on different platforms. BAMS continues to run off, as we've talked about for, gosh, 2 years now. Mark Pyke is with us today. Mark, do you want to add to that?", "Mark D. Pyke", "With regards to -- Troy talked about pricing pressure that we have -- that we're facing. We have price compression, but we are fortunate that we are rolling out some new products to mitigate this pressure going forward. So we're optimistic.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from David Togut with Evercore.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Troy, you indicated a pushout of conversions for 79 million accounts from Q2 of next year to Q3 of next year. What are the reasons for the postponement in those conversions? And how much conviction do you have that you'll convert those accounts by year-end 2014?", "M. Troy Woods", "David, it's -- 75 million accounts is what I think I mentioned in the prepared comments. And, yes, it is shifted from the second quarter into the third quarter. And from a reason perspective, I don't think there's really anything we're prepared to get into. Everything is fine here at TSYS, just a lot of moving parts to make it happen. It's not a significant shift moving from 1 quarter to the next. And I really didn't pick up the very last part of your question -- if somebody -- can you repeat the very last part of that, David?", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Sure, Troy. So how much conviction do you have that the accounts will actually be converted onto your systems by year-end 2014?", "M. Troy Woods", "We'll, I don't have a crystal ball, but we have been working on those conversions, as you well know, a very, very, very long time. And I'm certainly not making excuses for it, but I would suggest that, in a conversion of this size, complexity and all the moving parts, that moving it 1 quarter out is not significant. So we feel pretty comfortable about where we are, both us and Bank of America. So at the moment, we feel very comfortable that it will happen in the third quarter of '14.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "I see. You highlighted in your remarks that one of the biggest drivers of North American margin expansion was software capitalization. Can you break out how much the increase in software capitalization actually contributed to the margin gain in North America in Q3?", "M. Troy Woods", "Well, I personally cannot. But what I really think I said was we had a little bit higher capitalization rate around some conversion projects. I don't think I said anything about software. Jimmy, you may have some software numbers for the quarter. I don't think there's anything of significance.", "James B. Lipham", "No. But you got -- like you said, you got to capitalize conversion costs for this conversion going on, in addition to some software. So, yes, it's Surround we're working on. So I don't have those numbers here in front of me, but, yes, you do have some increased capitalization.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "I see. And then on the second quarter call, you highlighted a very significant cost savings you expected once you finish the back-end integration of your clearing and settlement system in the first quarter of next year. Can you quantify how much those cost savings might be on an annualized basis?", "M. Troy Woods", "I don't think -- I'm doing a check here, to be honest with you, David. We know exactly what it is. It hasn't changed. We still feel very comfortable about the number. I don't think we've shared that number. I'm looking to...", "James B. Lipham", "No, I think maybe we have said something in the past about we're looking for about $5 million of savings out of moving from FNBO to our platform. So...", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "And would that all occur in year 1?", "James B. Lipham", "Yes. For the full year.", "M. Troy Woods", "It's just an annualized number.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Quick final question. I think, Jim, you indicated that you would look at changing your capital allocation toward more share repurchase once you had paid down a certain amount of debt. Where do you need to be in terms of your leverage ratios to begin -- to sort of reengage on share repurchase?", "James B. Lipham", "I think if you look at the schedule that we presented and you think about the growth in EBITDA, we've shown a number with 1 -- I mean, 1 quarter of NetSpend in there. But once we get to around $700 million in EBITDA, you can multiply 2x that and get $1.4 billion, and we're at $1.5 billion. So it's not going to take a whole lot for us to, doing $60 million a quarter to bring this -- with the growth in EBITDA, to bring this multiple down in the range we want. And then it will free up some cash, which obviously we are going to be looking to do something with. And we'll look at share repurchases, as well as acquisitions.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from David Scharf with JMP Securities.", "David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "Just a couple of follow-ups. Switching to the NetSpend sales efforts. Just curious, I know the ACE contract was renewed and announced last quarter. As it relates to other check-cashing entities, just curious whether you're seeing Green Dot show up in any of either existing contracts that're up for renewal or new business efforts. Obviously, they just started to roll out in their first check-cashing market this past couple of months.", "M. Troy Woods", "Well, we all are certainly privy to what Green Dot has said about the check-cashing channel. With very, very few exceptions, all of the alternative payment providers that we have at NetSpend are under exclusive relationships. As a matter of fact, the few that they signed up in New York and mentioned last quarter, meaning the second quarter, 2 of the 3 are customers of NetSpend. And the way we look at that channel is a little bit different or that segment of that channel -- when you're in a consultative sales position of selling these products as a check casher, our experience has been, and what Dan and Chuck shared with me has been, David, is that it's very, very difficult to have multiple products to focus on. And so time will tell, but we've been in this business 12, 13 years. As you well know, it's our legacy channel, the check-cashing channel. So we feel -- I wouldn't say we're entrenched and cocky comfortable, but we feel like we have a very good model. And like I said earlier, almost all of those are exclusive relationships, and most of them want to keep it that way.", "David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "Got it. Helpful. And I know you mentioned that reload fees are a very minimal part of the NetSpend revenue model. Can you update us on perhaps what percentage of revenue is coming from overdraft?", "M. Troy Woods", "I don't think we share that number, David. It's -- we don't share it. We don't make that number public.", "David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "Got it. Got it. Fair enough. And switching to International. I just wanted to make sure, I thought I'd written it down. Jim, did you mention that 11%, which I believe was the operating margin this quarter, was the year-end target?", "M. Troy Woods", "Correct. For the year, David. Obviously, if you go back, and then you probably don't have it right in front of you, but the operating margin for the International segment for the first quarter was just 7.7%.", "David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "Okay, yes. I just wanted to confirm. That's a full year figure. So we're still expecting the...", "M. Troy Woods", "The idea is a little confusing. As a matter of fact, the full year margin for the International segment will probably come in exactly right on top of what the third quarter margin was, around 11.2%, 11.3%.", "David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So the implication being that we should still see sequential improvement in the fourth quarter?", "M. Troy Woods", "As I indicated the last quarter, you will see a pretty significant spike in the fourth quarter for the International segment.", "David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "Got it. Got it. Tax rate, what should we be thinking about now?", "James B. Lipham", "We're still in the 30%, 32% range.", "David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just lastly, I apologize. I'm not sure if I caught this. Somebody may have asked. I know you reaffirmed your top line guidance. Did you discuss EPS for the year?", "James B. Lipham", "Yes. Well, I didn't talk about it. I mean, we left it where it was. I mean, if you look at the $13 million to $14 million on NetSpend and their margin around 30%, you're talking about $3.5 million there, and then you got $2 million that we talked about on our negative currency. Plus, we are thinking in corporate overhead that we might have some room for a bonus or so -- some benefits or whatever. And -- so we didn't change it. It was real close.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "So just a follow-up to that last question on EPS guidance. Typically, you guys do better in 4Q than 3Q. Do you still expect that to be the case? If I -- as I look at the last 3, 4 years -- 3 of the last 4 years, 4Q is better by $0.01 or so on EPS.", "James B. Lipham", "Well, I would say if that's what the numbers have shown, I think I forgot what we had in the fourth quarter at this point. I don't know -- I don't have that here in front of me. But we were still in line to get our target out there of $1.70 to $1.72 in cash earnings per share.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Right, right. And that's really what I was sort of getting at is between the beat this quarter, and if you do the normal seasonal pattern, which it seems like you're leaning towards, you should be towards the top of the current range, if not $0.01 above it, is sort of where I was kind of looking for why you might not have raised guidance.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "That's what we're hoping for.", "James B. Lipham", "We're going to be at the top of the range. And I think we just didn't raise guidance. As I mentioned before, we have an opportunity for some employee benefits that we don't have on the books at this point, if we have a good fourth quarter.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Right, right. And then on that waterfall chart that you guys present each quarter, the -- if I look at that or try to do that just for 3Q, what would those pieces start looking like? I know the lost business component you mentioned probably goes down a couple of percentage points. Down the road, acquisitions become, I guess, into next year, a bit of a smaller component as you lap ProPay, CPAY. So net-net, should we, going forward, still be looking at a fairly healthy upper single, low double-digit kind of organic rate, upper single?", "James B. Lipham", "If we're looking at upper single on organic, I mean -- if you look at the acquisitions, we got NetSpend. We'll have laying in [ph] here for 3 months right now. But obviously, they'll finish up '13 in 6 months, and we'll have them in there for 6 months more in '14. So you will anniversary ProPay at the end of the year, and CPAY will be in '14 for about 5 months. Well, we've got 7 months in there now, so they'd be in there for the first [ph] quarter.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Right. So net-net, if you did the same chart for just the third quarter because you anniversary-ed a lot of the lost business and all that stuff back in June, July time frame, what's that look-forward and if you look on a go-forward basis is what I'm trying to get at.", "James B. Lipham", "I think you're going to be looking at something similar to what you got here. I mean, I know the lost business and revenue is, like we said, we lost some of them. They anniversary-ed, but we picked up Chase license, which is a big one that will go on to July 14. And -- but we did anniversary the discounts on BAMS. We did not anniversary yet the cards production business that we lost back in January. So...", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. Understood. But that situation keeps getting better steadily?", "James B. Lipham", "Yes.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And last question I have is -- and this is something I get from a lot of investors who feel that the debt-to-EBITDA target, so to speak, that you have of 2x is somewhat arbitrary and quite likely suboptimal. So I'm trying to figure out what is the basis for -- how did you kind of arrive at -- 2x is the right -- as the right target? When you look at many other players in the ecosystem, they are quite comfortable with higher leverage ratios.", "James B. Lipham", "Well, it was a -- more of a start into leveraging the company that we had never done before. And I don't know, maybe we picked the number that we thought was -- we wanted to maintain investment grade, and we had never been rated before. And it fit us very well with what they were looking for. So obviously, as we go forward, we'll continue to look at it.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Greg Smith with Sterne Agee.", "Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Can you talk a little about the Chase relationship, now that they're not paying the license fees, sort of what options Chase has and how you may think this plays out in the future?", "M. Troy Woods", "You mean, Greg, as it relates to the software that they run on and the license...", "Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Yes. Exactly. Because aren't they limited as to the modifications they can do without paying additional money to you, essentially?", "M. Troy Woods", "No, not really. They can make all the modifications should they desire to the cut of the software that they have as long as they respect the software rights, et cetera. So the license fees are over. That's over and done with. So they'll never own it. It's just a perpetual paid-up license.", "Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Do you still consider them as a potential outsourcing client again?", "M. Troy Woods", "Always. And, of course, they're still very significant to us and Canada, as well as their commercial card business. So they're a very big customer of ours. But you're right, just like we said, for 5 years, Bank of America was one of our largest prospects, but yes.", "Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just lastly, CUP Data, any color on how they're doing and where we can expect your equity income to go as we look into '14?", "M. Troy Woods", "I'll answer the first part of it, and then Jim just got back from a board meeting 4, 5 weeks ago and can address the second part, Greg. But CUP Data is doing extremely well. It continues to exceed our expectations. We continue to have dialogue with them about doing additional things in China. That's doing additional things around some prepaid, doing some things perhaps with the CUP, yes, the CUP Merchant business, the UMS business, talking about maybe expanding what we do outside our domestic footprint in China. Jimmy, you might want to add the financial piece, but...", "James B. Lipham", "Yes, I think, Greg, they're still growing revenues over there in the 25% to 30%. They're starting to shift a lot of it into transaction-based net income, which is where we get our dividend from. It's growing at about 25%. So they continue to grow off of a small base number, pretty large rates.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Greg, by the way, Chase is our largest prospect.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Jamie Friedman with SIG.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "I was wondering if you might have any update with regard to Brazil. I know you had some initiatives there, and they were on the come. So any update in that market?", "M. Troy Woods", "Jamie, not a lot. Carrefour continues to have significant growth. They've added over 1 million accounts this quarter over last year, so they continue to grow. The bottom line is, though, at the moment, just to be brutally honest, that's the only customer we have in Brazil. We continue to knock on the doors and beat the bushes. And Carrefour is a great reference point and a great partner, and they're helping us. But that's the bottom line at the moment. It is our only customer in Brazil. And as we've said several quarters, we continue to rationalize our expense base there. We're not going to do anything silly or crazy to jeopardize our relationship with Carrefour, but it is our only business. Thank goodness it's growing, but...", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. And then just a quick follow-up, Troy. With regards to the regulatory environment, I mean, do you see any material changes in the marketplace on the regulatory front? Anything you want to call out that we should focus on?", "M. Troy Woods", "No. Of course, everybody is wondering and waiting and speculating on what may come out of the appeal of Judge Leon's decision up in the U.S. District Court in Washington on Durbin. I think that's going to take some time to play out. I think all of us are somewhat concerned about some of the FDC stuff that's going on, Jamie, and what kind of, I hate to say overreach, but I am going to say overreach, that they might be exerting themselves in the area of where does one's liability and one's responsibility stop and start if you're a third-party processor or an acquirer. So we've got a lot of good people looking at that on top of it. I know Mark's involved at the ETA level, and they've taken it up as a very serious subject. But I think beyond that, nothing on CFPB, nothing that I could think of. I'm looking around the room and for those that are a lot closer than I am, and I'm getting kind of the same answer, Jamie.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "I guess first 2 questions and then a couple of quick clarifications. The first one, I'm looking at the NetSpend slide, I guess it's Slide 13. And just from my education, is it sort of normal to see sort of the sequential declines in cards and volumes? I mean, I understand the spike-up in the first quarter, but how should I understand that sort of sequential decline in cards and volume?", "M. Troy Woods", "It is, Glenn, and it's primarily driven, of course, through the large influx of tax business that NetSpend does early in the year. And, of course, with the new addition of Intuit and TurboTax in 2013, you would expect it to jump at you like it does on these charts on '13. But if you went back and looked at '10 and '11, and, of course, we do show you '12, you would see that drop. It's just exacerbated by such a large piece of business like TurboTax that we pulled in this year.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So nothing to be alarmed about. It's sort of normal course of business.", "M. Troy Woods", "Absolutely not.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then I want to follow up on Bryan's question from earlier, just on the shift in the pricing on the merchant side from bundled to unbundled. Is there any way to sort of directionally quantify what that magnitude of that price impact is?", "M. Troy Woods", "Well, I don't think we're going to telegraph that, but let me clarify something, though, Glenn. We're not necessarily saying there's a shift in pricing on bundled and unbundled. What we're seeing, as much as anything, is a shift in the mix. And so when you look at the revenue per transaction for our bundled business in 2012 and look at the revenue per transaction for our business in '13 bundled, they're almost -- they're identical. They're identical to the $0.01. But when you've got a significant basis point drop of the mix shifting from bundled to unbundled, that's the real -- and I'm not trying to split hairs with you, but I just wanted to make that clarification, it's more of a shift in mix versus a price reduction in our bundled. Mark, is that...", "Mark D. Pyke", "Yes, that is absolutely correct. As Troy mentioned in, I think, his opening comments, we've got a number of actions that we're taking to mitigate this, including incentive comp plans for our salespeople. We are definitely putting better pricing for a lot of how we price these merchants. And I mentioned earlier, we have some -- a number of value-added products that we're going to be launching here in the marketplace. So we've got some plans to mitigate this. But the market kind of dictates. Once a small merchant has unbundled pricing, they don't like going back to discount rate. So we think there's somewhat of a shift going on in the marketplace that is inevitable to a certain extent.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just 2 quick clarifications for Jimmy. The first one, you keep alluding to a 20% operating margin in the quarter, and it looks like to reconcile to the $0.49 cash EPS, I mean, I at least got something like a 21.4% margin, and I think the difference is you're including those $7.3 million of M&A costs as a cost to get to that 20% margin. Is that...", "James B. Lipham", "That's correct.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So on a cash margin basis, it was more like closer to 21.5%, I think, in the quarter.", "James B. Lipham", "That's correct.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just, again, a clarification. The amortization of intangibles that you're adjusting for, I think it's just for NetSpend, meaning the amortization of intangibles for prior acquisitions, you're including as an expense?", "M. Troy Woods", "Glenn, what we've decided to do, we didn't want 1 segment looking so different. So -- and really, it has negligible impact, I think, to North America. There was some paying still hanging out there in international that should go away, not too many quarters down the road. So all of the segments, we are now reporting adjusted operating, taking out only amortization for acquisition intangibles, nothing else. And if you went back and compared operating margins before and after, the only one you're going to see a real difference is Merchant.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And that's basically -- that last page of your supplemental sort of financial statement sort of gives us all this, I think.", "M. Troy Woods", "Yes, sir.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens Inc.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Two quick questions. And I don't know if Jimmy or Troy wants to maybe address this. You have mentioned a couple of things, that you've been working on multiyear cost item -- or multiyear items that are costly, both the Surround technology platform, as well as this new innovation push or effort. Can you give us a sense of how much that impacted 3Q margins and/or a sense of how we should think about that annualized impact in '14 and then maybe when it goes away? I'm trying to get to maybe a margin target or an idea of leverage, x those 2 items, because they sound pretty meaty.", "M. Troy Woods", "I think it was about $5 million for the quarter.", "James B. Lipham", "I think it's Surround.", "M. Troy Woods", "For all of those Surround and our back-end clearing and settlement. I think we've indicated also in the past, Brett, that this year, 2013, we're looking at about a circa $10 million number for the back-end version from a P&L impact. And I think we've actually shared also with you that for 2013, we were looking at about $7 million P&L impact for Surround. So I think that gives you directionally what you're looking for.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Anything on innovation? I think you said -- the number you gave us is that maybe it's an $86 million all-in over many year expense.", "M. Troy Woods", "That's right. That would include the Surround initiative, the 3-year -- at least 3-year migration of the front-end and the back-end out of FNBO and what we started in 2013 around innovation.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So the $86 million is inclusive of all 3?", "M. Troy Woods", "$85 million was all 3, all-in incremental, as well as non-incremental for those 3 mentioned. Correct. And, Brett, I just wanted to add that, I don't have the number in front of me, but a significant amount of that has already gone through the P&L. I just gave you $17 million, $18 million for '13 alone. Some of it, of course, hit the P&L in '11 for migration, '12 -- primarily '12, I guess. So, anyway, just had that quick note for you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from George Mihalos with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just wanted to start off maybe on the merchant side. Can you give us a breakdown of what percentage of your revenue now was sourced from interchange-plus in your direct business there?", "M. Troy Woods", "Interchange-plus in our direct business. No, we don't share that number. I don't know what it is, but we don't share it.", "Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. It's safe to say it's been steadily increasingly, though, over the last couple of quarters?", "M. Troy Woods", "Yes. Yes. Yes. That's the point I was making earlier -- trying to make earlier about the shift. That's correct.", "Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And do you think we've kind of approached close to a bottom here in this shift, meaning that we sort of have reached the low point, or are there still more merchants that you think are going to be converted to this pricing?", "M. Troy Woods", "I think we would all like to say, yes, we've reached the bottom, but I don't think we have. We certainly don't know. We've watched this move now for quite a few quarters, a significant drop over this time last year -- I really should say over the last 12 months, third quarter '12 to now. So I doubt if it's over with, but I do think, as Mark indicated, some of these mitigation strategies we are implementing will certainly, hopefully, at least from a TSYS perspective in the marketplace, begin to slow it down.", "Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And just sort of from a strategic angle, as you think about the Merchant Services business, you think that, that can post long-term growth in a margin profile, sort of in line with where the card processing businesses are?", "M. Troy Woods", "Well, we do. I'm going to caveat it, just a couple of things. If you go back and historically look, you will note that the margins of our Merchant segment have absolutely been in the high 30s all the way, once or twice approaching, maybe even hitting 40% on an adjusted, with intangible amortization out. I think the caveat that I would say at this moment in time is the indirect side of the business. I think we're just going to have to continue to see where some of these players fall out. There's a lot of acquisitions going on. We're losing some of those, as we mentioned earlier. And I think we still have some runway out there with BAMS. And I don't think any of us can handicap that today, but we know where it's been over the past 4 years, then it's been on a downward spiral. As you well know, we redid that contract that takes us out, I think, to 2017, but where that goes over the next 3 years will also have a bearing on that indirect business. But that's the real caveat. I think it's the indirect and the shift. Mark, do you want to add to that?", "Mark D. Pyke", "Yes. The only comment I'd make on the indirect side of the business, which we've disclosed represents a little less than half of the revenue for the Merchant segment, the size of the addressable market for third-party processing has been declining the last 3 years, and we see that continuing because of the M&A activity where people who have in-house capabilities by organizations that may be processing on us. We don't lose clients to another third-party processor. We're losing them because of M&A, and some, when they get to a certain size, look to in-source.", "Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And just last question for me. On the acquisition side, I think you referenced some flexibility with the debt pay down to potentially do buybacks or acquisitions going forward. Should we assume that those acquisitions are going to be focused on the Merchant Services segment, predominantly?", "M. Troy Woods", "I think that would be a very good assumption. We've said on many occasions that our desire, our vision hasn't changed. It may have taken a diversion with the NetSpend acquisition, but we would absolutely still like to be a top 10 global player. And we're not there. And the only way we can get there is via acquisition. And so it's clearly up there on the top of the list. We've also indicated that we have some desire from an international perspective to see what we might can do with acquiring on the international side. So, again, I think at the right time, right circumstance, right property, it would be high on the list.", "Operator", "And at this time, we have no further questions. I'll turn the call back over to you, Shawn.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I'll take it, Shawn. I'm about to lose my voice again, excuse me. I want to thank you all for being on the phone today. We're feeling really good about where we're at. We are cooking, it feels like, on all cylinders. There are several key things that I wanted to mention to you as reasons why we feel that we have some strong tailwinds. One, obviously, is NetSpend is showing what we saw in our due diligence, strong growth, good margins and great distribution channels.", "Also, this operating margin on the international basis that we've talked about a lot here today, as you recall, last year, early last year, we talked about international get well-plan. It has worked. It's working well today. We're -- it's really ahead of schedule and will come in at year end in good shape. And as we can leverage that up with new business, that should only get better.", "This account on file pipeline is of historic size with new clients, as well as clients who have acquired new portfolios. And it just is one of those things that we can really look forward to over the next year or so to continue our growth.", "I was sitting here, looking at one of those charts a second ago, and thinking that possibly this time next year, we'd be processing 620 million to 650 million or 660 million accounts on file, and I don't think anybody has ever been anywhere near those numbers in the history of this business. So that gets me very excited. Our organic account on file and revenue growth continue to do well.", "So we -- like I say, we're hitting on all cylinders. Our confidence is high. I think we've fully well -- we fully understand where our problems are, where we've got some weaknesses, and I can assure you that we've got teams working on those weaknesses. And we're putting together plans to make sure that they turn into strengths or we get out of that business.", "So I really want to thank you for your time and your support and your interest this evening. And if you have any additional questions, don't hesitate to call Shawn Roberts in Investor Relations. Again, thank you, and good night.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation.

Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Operator", "Good afternoon. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the TSYS earnings conference call. All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. ", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Shawn Roberts, Senior Director of Investor Relations. ", "Shawn Roberts", "", "Thank you, Jasmine, and welcome, everyone. On the call today, our Chairman and CEO, Phil Tomlinson will begin his opening remarks; then turn it over to Troy Woods, our COO, who is going to provide business highlights on our four segments; then turn it over to our CFO, Jim Lipham, who will review our consolidated financials. After that we'll open it up for Q&A.", "I'd like to now call your attention to the fact that we'll be making some forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS' actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in TSYS' reports filed with the SEC.", "At this time I'd like to introduce TSYS CEO, Phil Tomlinson.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Thanks Shawn and good evening everybody. It\u2019s been a while since my vocal cord problems allowed me to participate in the call. I am certainly happy to be back in the saddle and have my voice with me today. We seem to find ourselves today in the middle of a freak ice storm that is beginning to present some real challenges, and as you can imagine this type of weather is pretty hard to us. ", "I am proud of how we closed out 2013 with a strong fourth quarter. Our team is executing at a high level and they are meeting or exceeding our clients\u2019 expectations. We are thrilled about the fact that our total shareholder return was up 57.2% as compared to the S&P 500 return of 32%. And I think that most would agree that we spend our capital in a shareholder friendly manner by reducing debt and in December we repurchased 3.1 million shares of TSYS\u2019. ", "Certainly the acquisition of NetSpend is already proving to be a really smart decision in our opinion. NetSpend came with an excellent business model and an outstanding team of experienced professionals and is a really worthy fourth reporting segment for TSYS. It presents some real growth opportunities for us. ", "2014 has started just as you would expect, it\u2019s been really busy. We have many positives that we are looking forward to in \u201914 and feel good about our goals of delivering strong shareholder value, exceeding client expectations and being a great place to work for our team. ", "Before I turn it over to Troy and Jim I want to take just a minute and talk about the Target situation, because I know that questions on your mind. And as you know Target is a wonderful long term TSYS\u2019 client and we have great respect and empathy for them during what must be a very, very difficult time. But I do want to make it very clear that TSYS has no involvement in the Target issue or any of the other breaches that seem to be announced almost daily. ", "Now I will turn it over to Troy Woods to review our four lines of business and then as Shawn said we will come back to Jim and when Jim finishes we will open it up for questions. Troy?", "M. Troy Woods", "Thank you, Phil and good evening. Last quarter I took the opportunity to provide updates on several corporate-wide initiatives currently underway that will help position our company for next generation capabilities. ", "All of these initiatives are on schedule and to a large degree are the direct result of our reinvigorated confidence in ours and our customers\u2019 businesses and have led to significant investments in people via hiring and market salary adjustments; facilities via upgrades and expansion around the globe; and technology via our Surround project, which is our next generation technology framework and new consumer servicing platform, the FNBO back-end conversion which takes place this weekend, the NetSpend integration, and the building of innovation labs and products like the Authorization Control product which we announced two weeks ago.", "We believe these investments are essential, and we have invested significant capital and resources in each of these segments to ensure our success. As a matter of reference in 2014, these investments represent a P&L impact exceeding $13 million over 2013. We're also convinced that these investments and commitments will differentiate TSYS from its peers and will return significant dividends to us and our clients over the long-term. ", "I now would like to begin our segment reviews with an overview of North America on Slide 6 and 7. The North America segment turned in another strong quarterly performance with revenue growth of 4.5% to $223.3 million. This revenue increase was driven by increased transactions, authorizations, and growth in accounts on file. Also during the quarter, we saw improved sales in both our fraud and customer care services as well as increases in our card production services. ", "I might also add that for the first time in our history, total revenue for the segment exceeded $1 billion for the year. This revenue growth and excellent expense management during the quarter resulted in an adjusted operating income of $85.2 million, representing an increase of 8.1% over the same quarter last year. These metrics resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 38.2%, which is 130 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2012 and the third straight quarter of margin expansion. ", "On a full-year basis, the North America segment produced a 36.6% adjusted operating margin. Based on our current projections and the conversion schedules that we have in place at this time, we expect 2014 adjusted operating margin for the North America segment to be in the 34% to 36% range. ", "With respect to conversions we now have approximately 96 million accounts in the conversion pipeline with approximately 90 million of these accounts scheduled to convert in the third quarter. Once we complete these conversions, we estimate we will process for approximately 40% of United States credit card market and 80% of the Canadian credit card market.", "Also during the quarter, we implemented a credit card launch for Rogers Communications, the largest wireless carrier in Canada in support of the Rogers Bank credit card program. We also renewed our relationships with Banco Popular and Commerce Bank of Kansas City to include the addition of Commerce Bank Kansas City\u2019s pin debit card business. ", "All-in-all, it was another very good quarter for the North America segment and we're all very excited about many opportunities and conversions ahead of us for 2014. ", "I now would like to move to slides 8 and 9 for a review of the international segment. Revenues for the quarter were $108.3 million, which represented a 5.8% increase over the same quarter last year. As we had experienced in previous quarters, we encountered a negative impact on currency of $4 million in the fourth quarter which was a modest improvement over the third quarter. Excluding the impact of currency for the quarter, revenues were up 9.6%. For the full year, the international segment experienced $20.6 million currency headwinds. ", "Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $19.5 million, resulting in an 18% adjusted operating margin. Fourth quarter margin was higher than usual as a result of booking one-time, non-recurring revenue and associated cost for a major client project with respect to project fees and advisory services for a conversion that has shifted out about one year from the original date. Normalizing this unusual item would have generated 15.7% adjusted operating margin for the quarter. ", "As we have communicated throughout the year, our margin improvement program continues to produce excellent results. We ended 2013 with 11.8% adjusted operating margin compared to 7.4% for 2012. Gaylon and his leadership team have done an excellent job on executing their plan. Certain areas of our international business saw double digit growth that included the processing and related services in Europe, our licensing business, and our GP Net partnership in Japan. ", "During the quarter, we also went live with a new debit launch in Ireland. We now support over a 90% market share of both credit and debit card processing in Ireland, and this provides us with a solid foundation to actively pursue opportunities in the growing debit markets across Europe. From a growth perspective, we\u2019re currently working on three conversions and five new launches that should deliver approximately 2 million new accounts to the segment over the next 15 to 18 months.", "In summary, we continue to see pockets of an improving global economy, additional TS2 and licensing opportunities, opportunities to expand our product reach like debit, and continued margin expansion as we strive to reach our goal of an adjusted operating margin of 18% by year-end 2015. ", "Our review of the merchant segment begins on slide 10. As I have said on several occasions before, the merchant segment is a tale of two cities. Our merchant segment presently operates in two very different businesses. Direct merchant acquiring and indirect acquiring or third-party processing for other merchant acquirers. While the direct and indirect businesses are related, they are also fundamentally distinct businesses with very different industry and competitive dynamics. Direct acquiring is a large $12.5 billion U.S. addressable market which is growing, and third-party processing is a relatively small $500 million U.S. addressable market that is shrinking. ", "In 2010 we began our journey to transform our merchant business from being exclusively a mono line third-party acquirer processor to being primarily a direct merchant acquirer. One of the primary driving forces behind the strategy shift was that it had become clear to us that the third-party acquirer processing industry was declining with no real long term prospects for growth. We came to the conclusion that one of the best ways to maximize the value of our third-party processing business would be to leverage it in support of an acquisition driven expansion into the much larger and growing direct acquiring business. We have made solid consistent progress in executing on this strategic transformation. ", "In 2013 we achieved a significant milestone. Direct revenues now constitute the majority of our merchant business for the first time. However our journey is absolutely not complete. We remain focused on executing the business transformation we started in 2010. Our goal is to have at least 80% of the merchant segment\u2019s revenues come from direct acquiring in the near term and to deliver industry leading organic growth rates and our strategy for execution has not changed, to execute this transformation through a combination of organic growth initiatives and additional strategic acquisitions. ", "Bottom line, our direct business is growing. We have successfully completed four accretive acquisitions since 2010. The collection of these businesses that we have assembled are organically growing although not near quite as fast as we\u2019d like. On a combined pro forma basis this collection of direct businesses organically grew revenues 5.2% for 2013 versus 2012 and we are projecting to organically grow in the mid to high single digits for 2014 over 2013. We remain intentionally focused on continuing to improve our growth results. ", "Our indirect business reflects a different story and continues to decline which should not come as a surprise to anyone. The addressable market the third-party processing continues to shrink primarily as a result of industry consolidation as many acquirers have outsourced or acquired companies with in-house capabilities. Because the end rate business still comprises about 40% of our merchant segment\u2019s revenues the decline is driving down the growth for the segment as a whole, and will continue to do so until it comprises a smaller portion of our segment\u2019s revenue. ", "The same 40% indirect composition of our merchant segment also creates confusion when comparing our \u201cmerchant results\u201d with other publicly traded direct merchant acquirers, none of which have over 5% of their business in third-party indirect processing. We would suggest a more equitable comparison going forward would be our direct business not the entire merchant segment. ", "Moving to slide 11, consistent with this trend for the fourth quarter our direct revenues were up 21.8% and our indirect revenues were down 12.2% resulting in a 4.3% increase in revenue for the quarter. Even with mid to high single-digit growth forecasted for our direct business, due to the loss of several large indirect customers in 2013 we do not expect to show positive quarter-over-quarter growth in the merchant segment until the fourth quarter of 2014. And the entire segment\u2019s revenue will be down 1% to 2% for the year. ", "As a result of this overall revenue decline we expect our merchant adjusted operating margins to decline to the 31% to 33% range for 2014 with the first two quarters being our most difficult comp quarters. TSYS remains committed to growing the merchant business, both organically as-well-as through continued acquisitions in the direct acquirer space. Our stated goal has been to become a top ten global acquirer and we have not backed away from our pursuit of that goal. ", "And finally our NetSpend review begins on slide 12. NetSpend demonstrated an exceptional performance in the fourth quarter and for 2013. Revenue for the quarter was $104.1 million, 16.1% higher than fourth quarter last year and revenue for the year was $430 million, an increase of 22%. This revenue growth is directly attributable to an increase in direct deposit cards and the contributions of all four of our channels. ", "On slide 13, you can see that our direct deposit cards were up 22.1% ending the year with slightly more than 1.3 million active direct deposit cardholders. NetSpend maintains strong margins and operating leverage for the quarter with adjusted operating income of $28.5 million and an adjusted operating margin of 27.3%. ", "On a like-for-like basis when taking into consideration the effect of corporate administration expenses being moved out of the segment, the fourth quarter 2012 adjusted margin would have been 23.3% versus the 19.9% shown on slide 12. This represents a 400 basis-points improvement in operating margin since last year. ", "NetSpend completed its first very successful year offering its prepaid card as an option for saving tax refunds to the millions of consumers to use into its TurboTax software. We exited the year with an established base of active debit cardholders and were off to a very strong start for 2014 tax season. ", "As a reminder we experienced the impact of seasonality in this part of our business. But you will see marketing investments we made in the first quarter drive results throughout the remainder of the year. ", "During the quarter we also added 4,000 new retail locations giving us 14,000 new additions for the year. The total number of retail locations now supporting the NetSpend product are more than 64,000. Also during the quarter we launched the Brink\u2019s money payroll card program and signed over 80 new paid card clients. This brings our total number of employers who pay their employees with the NetSpend issued card to more than 1,800 businesses. ", "Today we support and partner with a host of marketing clients that include ACE Cash Express, 7-Eleven, Intuit, PayPal, BET, CVS, [World Range], Regions Bank, Dollar General and Family Dollar to name just a few. Today almost half of all NetSpend cards are now on direct deposit and the majority of spend on these cards also come from these customers, a very critical source of predictable recurring revenue. ", "Slide 13 reflects our gross dollar volume for the quarter is $4 billion representing a 21.5% increase over the same quarter last year. For the year gross dollar volume exceeded $17 billion representing a year-over-year increase of 30%. On the innovation front we recently overhauled our mobile architecture, are now home board brand and get-to market with new partner programs faster than ever and accelerate the development and delivery of new features.", "On the integration and synergy front all initiatives are on schedule and we expect to meet our previous commitments. We have a very impressive pipeline of new partnerships leveraging the North America and merchant segments demonstrating the cross-selling across the enterprise segments does indeed work. This then continues to be a high growth results driven business for us and we are expecting great things from them in 2014 and beyond. ", "Now I would like to turn it over to Jim Lipham for a more in-depth financial review for the fourth quarter and guidance for 2014. Jim?", "James B. Lipham", "Thank you, Troy. Starting on slide 15 we are extremely pleased with our reported results for 2013. In terms of our guidance we achieved the high end of adjusted cash earnings per share with $1.72. Phil mentioned earlier about shareholder value growth, we purchased 3.1 million shares of stock for $97.6 million as well as investing $1.4 billion in acquisitions and returning $57 million in dividend to our shareholders during the year. ", "This all contributed greatly obviously to the shareholder returns being up 57.2%. A transformational acquisition of NetSpend added $104.1 million in revenue for the quarter and $207.9 million year-to-date and helped push total revenues over the $2 billion mark for the first time in our history. ", "Revenues before reimbursable items increased 29.7% for the quarter and 16.9% for the year. For the quarter our revenue increase was a result of acquisitions of new business and increased volumes. In the fourth quarter we did have a non-recurring revenue of $5.5 million and expense of $2.2 million in our international segment. ", "For the year revenues from new clients and internal growth helped offset lost business and currency translation. We continue to experience negative headwinds from currencies of $3.9 million during the quarter and $20.3 million year-to-date. ", "The growth in year-to-date revenues was mainly the result of the acquisitions. We have now anniversaried the 2012 acquisitions of CPAY and ProPay. Our operating income for the quarter increased 22.9% and operating margin was 20.3%, excluding reimbursable items. During the quarter we had $2.2 million of M&A expense associated with the acquisition in NetSpend. ", "We do anticipate these expenses to continue in 2014. Also included in operating income was $24.8 million of acquisition and tangible amortization. Excluding the acquisition in tangible amortization and the M&A expenses our operating margin was 25.3%. ", "Our adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter of last year was 23.2%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 32.2% for the quarter and 16% for the year and as I said before we are very pleased with our adjusted cash earnings per share at $1.72 which was a high end of our range. ", "On the next slide a recap of about 16.9% growth in revenues before reimburses, and total growth or the value increase from our same-store class represent 5.8% growth in revenues while new clients added 3.5%. We had six new clients in North America and one new client in international making up this growth. The acquisitions of ProPay, NetSpend and CPAY added 16.7% of growth there and the currency translation we were negatively impacted 1.3% or $20.3 million. ", "The net positive increase of 24.7 million from these four items was offset by the 7.8% in last year\u2019s price concessions. Price concessions totaled $31.4 million for the year. North America contributed to 67.9% of this, international was 10.2% of the price concessions and merchants accounted for 21.9%. ", "As we go forward into \u201914 we\u2019re expecting the price concessions to drop down to around $24 million. Lost business at $85 million; North America they contributed 29.3% of that, international was at 22.2% and merchant at 48.5% but of note there over half of that 48% growth comes from the normal merchant attrition business that we have that goes on the direct acquirer space. Overall we think lost business next year which includes the Chase license scenario is going to drop down to about $64.8 million from this current level of $85 million. ", "On the next slide is just a -- shows acquisition of NetSpend has transformed the organization and diversified our revenue stream whereas we now have North America representing 40.7% of our revenues versus 50% in 2012 and now with the new segment of NetSpend. The other segments all three are contributing close to 20%. ", "The next slide has bridged our quarterly segment margins for our top two through our consolidated margin and you can see the adjusted segment margins for the quarter, North America is 38.2, international at 18, merchant is 32.2 and NetSpend at 27.3. ", "On a total segment basis the adjusted operating margin 31.1%. All-in our consolidated operating margin or revenues before reimbursables is 20.3% for the quarter. ", "The next slide just shows the same reconciliation of our year-to-date margin and I am not going to go over those numbers, you can read those later but all in all operating margin, revenues before reimbursable was 20.4%. ", "Our next slide is our normal slide on the accounts on file consolidated. This slide only accounts for the accounts on file for North America and international. It does not include the NetSpend accounts. As you can see we saw strong year-over-year growth 14.6% in what we consider as traditional accounts on file and with the big conversion there being the HSBC accounts Capital One but good growth there and total accounts on file at 12.9%. ", "This next slide shows our cash balance and rollforward from last quarter as we had a big decrease of $119 million for the fourth quarter. Our operating activities continue to generate strong cash of $145 million and we spent $75 million of this cash in CapEx, the majority of which was in investment in systems support software that we extended the contract for a term of 36 months. ", "We continue to deploy our cash by paying down debt of $84 million as well as we purchased 3.1 million shares of stock for $97.6 million. We also had a normal quarterly dividend of $19 million. The uptick of cash inflow in the other category at $12 million mainly came from proceeds from the stock option exercises, leaving us with $278 million in cash at year-end.", "On the next slide is our cash flow, the trailing 12 months. As you can see stronger cash flow from all business, EBITDA for 2013 at 634 million. We generated $452 million in cash from operating activities. For the year our CapEx was $193.8 million, an increase of 64.1% over 2012. The increase of $75.7 million was driven by $31.7 million increase in software licenses and $21 million in contract acquisition accounts, mainly Bank of America conversion.", "Our CapEx was also impacted by the increase in our software which was mainly for the Surround project and the Fiji project on the acquiring business. In the fourth quarter we were able to take advantage of favorable pricing and acquire these software licenses similar to what we did last year in the fourth quarter. Our contract acquisition costs are higher due to conversion activity we are doing primarily for Bank of America and this work will continue until the conversion in 2014. ", "Our average monthly free cash flow for 2013 was $21.6 million. Excluding the impact of the software acquisition in December of 22.7 in bond interest expense of approximately $18 million. Our average monthly free cash flow was approximately $25 million. ", "We expect our CapEx for 2014 to be in the range of $200 million to $210 million. And we believe our average free monthly cash flow will be in the $35 million to $37 million range. This schedule, next schedule is our update on our EBITDA ratio. As you can see at year-end we were at $1.5 billion which also includes a new vendor financing arrangement of $20 million in the fourth quarter. With our scheduled debt payments in 2014 of $34.3 million in home notes and $21.6 million in capital lease and I expect with growth in EBITDA we moved much closer to our desired level of debt to EBITDA of two times. ", "As a result we will look to deploy our capital for strategic acquisitions as-well-as share repurchases as we go forward. On the share repurchase slide during the fourth quarter, you can see we did buy the 1.3 million shares and at this time we are excited about expanding our share repurchase program to 28 million shares and now have available 12 million shares for buyback from now through April of 2015. ", "As we have done in the past we will opportunistically look to repurchase shares especially at times when we don't have material acquisitions in the works. As you can see in the last four years we have bought 16 million shares for $338 million over those past four years. ", "The last slide is our 2014 guidance and before we get into the actual metrics I thought I\u2019d spend a minute on several key assumptions that went into this guidance. One item I want to emphasize and pay special attention to and understand is the tax line item. In 2013 we benefited from the recognition of discreet tax items of $8.8 million or for an earnings per share impact of $0.05 a share mainly coming from section 199 in tax deductions. We do not see these discreet items recurring in 2014. ", "As we look at the tax rate for 2014, we would expect it to be in the range of 34% to 35%, roughly $0.03 per share impact on the higher rate. In addition to the discreet items I just mentioned we are also seeing a slight uptick in our tax rate due to NetSpend acquisition. ", "On a GAAP basis we would also see an additional six months of NetSpend related acquisition, amortization bringing our total consolidated for the year of $97 million in 2014. And an additional 4.5 months of bond related interest expense which is approximately $8.8 million per quarter. ", "We continue to see strong earnings growth from our joint venture in China, CUP Data and expect them to grow in the 12% to 15% range for 2014. You can see our total 2014 guidance on total revenues is expected to increase 17% to 19% and revenues before reimbursables are expected to increase 19% to 21%. ", "Adjusted EBITDA is expected at 17% to 20%. As-well-as our debt-to-cash earnings per share of 11% to 13% growth. Our currencies that we have used in our guidance as the Pound is at the 1.60, the Euro is at 1.35 and the Yen is 1.05. With that I will open it up for questions. ", "Shawn Roberts", "Jasmine, we will take questions here. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Barclays. ", "Adam Carron - Barclays Capital ", "Hey guys how are you, this is actually Adam for Darrin. ", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Hey Adam, how are you? ", "Adam Carron - Barclays Capital ", "Good, so just the first question just around the delta on the guidance between adjusted EBITDA and adjusted cash EPS, you kind of mentioned the tax stuff there which was pretty helpful, but just in terms of looking at it from an apples-to-apples standpoint, should we be thinking about it on like a 167 type number versus the midpoint of 192 this year? ", "James B. Lipham", "Yeah, part of the midpoint. ", "Adam Carron - Barclays Capital ", "Okay. I am just wondering just because of the growth in EBITDA, even if we use that the 192 over 167 or so, it's still kind of below the adjusted EBITDA guidance. I mean is there anything, anything else that we should be thinking about there as a share count having an impact? ", "James B. Lipham", "I didn\u2019t mention on the guidance slide, but the shares that we think we're going to have on next year is 188.4 million, and yeah, the shares have had an impact in the analyst numbers that are out there for 2013. ", "Adam Carron - Barclays Capital ", "Okay. And then secondly, I guess in terms of North America, we continue to see somewhat of a gap here between your kind of core accounts on file growth and the transaction growth even looking at same-store clients, and I know that there is obviously some price concessions in there and some loss business, but in terms of that spread given that lower amount of pricing pressures going forward, where should we kind of expect that to kind of fall over the course of 2014, I would expect it to narrow quite a bit, right? ", "James B. Lipham", "It should narrow quite a bit, right. ", "Adam Carron - Barclays Capital ", "Okay. And is there any way you could walk through kind of the difference between that 5% revenue growth and the 16% core account growth? ", "James B. Lipham", "It's kind of hard to do it. When you see the 16% account growth, we have roughly 35% to 40% of our transaction growth or 30% of these accounts roughly have bundled pricing on transactions, so it never will equate, it will always be a growth higher than our revenue growth. ", "Adam Carron - Barclays Capital ", "Right, okay. And then I guess last one from me. Just in terms of potential capital deployment going forward, you still continue to talk about opportunities in the acquiring space. Just in terms of where you guys feel comfortable from a leverage standpoint, is there going to be more of a focus on de-levering going forward or are these -- at these levels would you feel comfortable bringing out leverage ratio back up for what could be an attractive acquisition? ", "James B. Lipham", "Yeah I thought I mentioned on the slide that going forward we have some scheduled payments that we have to make on debt next year, but outside of that we are comfortable with where we are and we\u2019ll go forward looking at strategic acquisitions and share repurchases. ", "Adam Carron - Barclays Capital ", "Right, thanks guys. ", "James B. Lipham", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brett Huff from Stephens Corp.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Hey Brett, how are you? ", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.", "Hey guys, how are you, can you hear me okay? ", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Yeah. We hear you great.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.", "Great. My only little question is Jim you had mentioned on the free cash flow, I think you said 35 to 37 monthly for '14, was that right?", "James B. Lipham", "That's correct. ", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.", "Okay. And then as we think forward, and think probably about lower CapEx spending, the Surround project and some of these important projects maybe tapering a little bit, maybe getting a little more leverage on the margins, what kind of growth should we expect as we look out on a normalized basis on your free-cash flow per year per month? I mean it seems like it will go up, but can you characterize how you think about that beyond '14? ", "James B. Lipham", "Well, we have to go past '14, but I would say we\u2019ve got a pretty high CapEx for '14 again, and it should be tapering off quite a bit going forward to get back to some normal levels. ", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.", "Is that -- midpoint in '14 of 205, I mean are we talking $50 million less or just can you just size it a little bit for us? ", "James B. Lipham", "I don't know how to really size it I would just say we are up probably what $75 million in CapEx in 2013, and it looks like we are going to hold that level in \u201914. So we\u2019ll be coming back somewhere close to that by the time we get to \u201915.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.", "Okay and then -- can you just rearticulate the assumptions around the annual expectations for \u201914 for the purchase amortization, and I think you also articulated the stock-based comp. I just didn't get those details. Can you reiterate those for me?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "I think I said we\u2019ll have $97 million worth of amortization of intangibles consolidated, and then $8.8 million was the related interest expense per quarter, so we\u2019ll have about four and half months lower interest next year.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.", "Okay, that\u2019s fine. Thank you.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Thank you, Brett. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim Willi from Wells Fargo.", "Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo", "Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. Just couple of quick questions. First on merchants, curious about your thoughts around investments, and I guess joint-ventures or partnerships with some of the newer technologies and \u201cdisrupters\u201d that have sprung up in the last couple of years, and obviously we\u2019ve seen Hartland make some moves and others, just quite curious how active you have been there that maybe have not been publicized or what are your thoughts on it about that with the merchant business and whether or not that\u2019s all part of sort of the strategy to get that ramp back up again and I have a quick follow-up?", "M. Troy Woods", "", "Hi, Tim, Troy. Let me take a shot at that one. You know I think even in my opening remarks I made a comment that we\u2019re clearly committed to becoming the top 10 global acquirer. I think to get there we\u2019re going to be committed to investing and partnering to probably meet that goal and from our perspective either domestic and/or international we\u2019ll look at anything that can help us grow and expand and if these technologies and product offerings of these partners can get us there then I clearly think we would have an interest to work with them.", "Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo", "Okay, great. I appreciate it. And just my follow up maybe you hit on it earlier; I apologize but around the NetSpend acquisition and again just sort of the -- you mentioned cross-selling across the platform, North American customers and merchants. Has the pipeline of discussions or the signed commitments for card issuance within financial institutions, how has that progressed since you have acquired that? Does that continue to escalate in terms of interest levels or actual pen on paper with contracts for banks to issue prepaid cards and just your thoughts around that?", "M. Troy Woods", "", "Well we continue to see get enquiry from the banks and FIs about interest in the NetSpend prepaid cards. As a matter of fact working with North America segment we probably have a good handful of cases, customers that have expressed very keen interest in the NetSpend product. So yeah we\u2019re still getting interest. The cross selling has worked again primarily in the North America segment. Just last quarter also the NetSpend area Tim we signed a 700 branch banking network out on the West Coast that helps to expand our footprint. So yeah I think we still are getting a lot of good interest from the FIs. ", "Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo", "Great, that\u2019s it. That\u2019s all I had. I will let somebody else jump on here. I appreciate it. Thanks Troy.", "M. Troy Woods", "", "Thanks, Tim.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from the line of Dave Koning from Baird. ", "David J. Koning \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "", "Hey guys. I guess, just a couple of things the first one the free cash flow if we just assume that $35 million is the low-end and we just multiply it by 12 it\u2019s $420 million of free cash flow, that gets to like $2.25 of free cash flow per share. Should it really be that much better than earnings this year?", "James B. Lipham", "Yeah that\u2019s what we are anticipating for \u201914. ", "David J. Koning \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Okay, and is there is some working capital benefit that you are getting maybe something negative that happened in \u201913 that somehow reverses in \u201914?", "James B. Lipham", "No. I can\u2019t think of.", "David J. Koning \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Okay, just the reason I ask is total CapEx was I think just under 200 million in 2013 pretty much the same as what you are guiding to \u201914 but I think free cash flow is in the $250 million ballpark in \u201913 and I know NetSpend you had a full year, it adds up but it just seems like a big variance from '13. ", "James B. Lipham", "You got that and the M&A expenses also. ", "David J. Koning \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Yeah, that's a good point. All right and I guess just my other question what do you assume for the timing of Bank of America coming on within the guidance is it kind of the beginning of Q3 be under Q3 just to get a flavor because that is a big swing factor. ", "M. Troy Woods", "David, [you are not] a Bank of American consumer. ", "David J. Koning \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Yeah.", "M. Troy Woods", "No it\u2019s still on schedule for the third quarter of 2014 and it's on schedule, it's scheduled to come in that quarter and when we look at our guidance for the North American segment for 2014, with those conversions as well as the other conversions that we talk about the 90 plus million in the pipeline we're looking at 8% to 10% of growth rate for that segment in '14.", "David J. Koning \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "All right, great. Thank you.", "M. Troy Woods", "Thank you, David. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Thank you and good evening. You mentioned strength of the new business pipeline. Can you elaborate on what some of the largest opportunities might be in the North America segment and in NetSpend?", "M. Troy Woods", "Well I think for the North America segment we have said on several occasions I think there are no secrets who are in the conversion pipeline, Bank of America being the largest in the third quarter that I just mentioned. We still have Toronto -- and Bank of Montreal as we talked about on several occasions coming in also in 2014. So they make up the bulk of the 96 plus million accounts in the conversion pipeline. ", "Second case you mentioned NetSpend? ", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Yes, I am sorry just to clarify my question. I was really asking about may be the new prospect pipeline i.e. contracts you haven't signed. I thought you were highlighting the strength of the prospect pipeline, perhaps I misunderstood. ", "M. Troy Woods", "I don't recall say anything. I did say that on NetSpend we had a very robust pipeline of prospects. If NetSpend signs up obviously we can go in and lay those out. But it is a very impressive list of some of these trial launches being going on for quite some time and hopefully we can get some across the go live real soon, but it is a very impressive list. ", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.", "And then just as a follow-up could you quantify unit pricing trends in the merchant segment, both on the direct and indirect side in the fourth quarter? ", "M. Troy Woods", "Yes I can. If you look at it and break it down into direct and indirect for the most part the unit pricing for direct is holding up really good for bundle, actually it's up about a penny. The unbundled is found about a penny. So all-in the unit pricing is holding up quite well. What really hurt is something I mentioned last quarter is the shift that we are seeing from bundle to unbundle on the direct side so it's more of a mix shift unit pricing shift.", "But the good news there is from what I mentioned last quarter we only saw about 200 basis points drop in the shift bundle to unbundled on volume. So some of the mitigation controls that I mentioned last quarter that Mark Pyke and his team working on are beginning to may be payout some good dividend. I think it's too early to declare a victory after one or two quarters but it is a very positive trend. ", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Just finally any client traction in Brazil beyond your large contract with Carrefour. ", "M. Troy Woods", "No we do not -- I think we really should think about it, lot of activity as I mentioned before most of its been on the retail private label side but no, I think to sit here and bribe about today. ", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Thank you very much. ", "M. Troy Woods", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank ", "Hey guys, how are you doing?", "M. Troy Woods", "Good, you?", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank ", "Good, I just want to follow up on that question Troy just on the prospect pipeline post BofA, is there any large fish out there either on the domestic or international side that you guys are kind of -- for 2015 and beyond? ", "M. Troy Woods", "Brian I would had this conversation before when you said out rolling anyway it's not process thesis we are eyeballing. So you know who they are, both in-house players, players in process with our competitors really I just really could go beyond that. ", "Really, factors really can go beyond that point, some of that dialogue is a lot further than others. So we just have to see how they all play out. ", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank ", "Yeah. We can -- we will wait and see on that. I just wanted to ask on the prepaid business I might have missed this. But what's the annual fiscal year '14 revenue expectations for the prepaid NetSpend business? And then what kind of margin profile should we expect?", "M. Troy Woods", "We are looking at the high change on revenue growth and we are looking at adjusted operating margins of high 20% to low 30%. ", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank ", "Okay. So even a maybe little bit of acceleration in the growth rate. I guess you saw what 16% revenue growth this past quarter, at 27% adjusted operating margin. So in that ball park if not a little bit better?", "M. Troy Woods", "Yes, sir. ", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank ", "I guess the worry I add is maybe the Intuit business comes off and because that was a big client, does that slow down the business or is there other things that slow that pipeline?", "M. Troy Woods", "It comes off at a standpoint of our anniversary?", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank ", "Yeah. Anniversary, right. ", "M. Troy Woods", "Well. Yeah. It\u2019s certainly going to anniversary. But as I mentioned earlier the taxation is expected to be another good one. There is some other businesses that I have mentioned with the addition of the PayCard additions, the extra 4,000 that we have added on retail locations and when all of that will kick in but you are right, Intuit does anniversary this year. ", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank ", "Okay. That's all I had. Thanks guys. ", "M. Troy Woods", "Thank you, Bryan.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna.", "M. Troy Woods", "Hey Jamie. ", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group", "", "Hey. Thanks guys for taking my questions. I had just a couple to ask about. So Troy thanks for your eloquent description of the movement in the merchant segment. I was wondering when you look at kind of the tale of two cities to use your language. Would there be any consideration to divesting a lesser setting any in the indirect business so that you could really focus management\u2019s attention and assets on the direct, that's my first question. ", "The second question Jimmy, you sounded more confident about the trends in pricing on North America in your assumptions for '14. I was wondering if you could elaborate as to what's behind that? So those are my two. Thank you. ", "M. Troy Woods", "I will take the first one Jamie, [inaudible] didn't you. We clearly are having some headwinds, some real headwinds on the indirect side about to go back to - . But at the end of the day we really do not have any interest in divesting the indirect business. It- produces extremely good margins, the cash flow is very significant in that business. As I mentioned also this coming weekend we will finish that back end conversion of it. ", "When we look at it, it gives us a very powerful platform with a lot of scale to leverage and to also leverage the investments that we have made. And look when you look at the acquisitions that we made over the past few years, most of them are indirect customers. And so we also look at it as a good source of low risk M&A target. ", "So all-in-all we don't have any interest to disband and divesting the indirect business. We got to get it turned around, we got to get back some of these things for anniversaries and till that happens you are going to see as I said a continued drag on that segment. - I think you have the second. Jim I think you have the second question.", "James B. Lipham", "I think your question was on the pricing in North America and being optimistic about the increased pricing and what not. But I think the biggest fear for us is the renewal cycles going on. We did have an increase going on in our value-added services, the crowd services like that, that are be going on and it\u2019s pretty hard margin type business or revenue sources. So anyway we have renewals are slowing down as we go forward but they are still awesome. We should have a better year on pricing. ", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group", "Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citigroup. ", "M. Troy Woods", "Hi, Ashwin. ", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Hi. Good evening gentlemen. Phil, good to hear your voice again. ", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Good to be talking again. ", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "I guess one question I had was with regards to North American segment margins being down in '14 or '13 is that mostly a second half event because of micro conversion as those comps come on?", "James B. Lipham", "Ashwin last quarter I mentioned that we're probably looking at the 34%, 35% margins for North America. We're up that slightly so yes down on the fourth quarter but actually no I would say as a result bringing on the back end when we look at our numbers for 2014 we're probably looking at the margins of that segment probably ramping up in the third and fourth quarter I would like going down. So third and fourth quarter margins would probably be higher than the first and second. ", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Okay, understood. And just to clarify the system conversion that you had, that will happen this weekend I guess was supposed to have a financial benefit associated with it is that already incorporated in your merchant segment margin guidance that provided? ", "James B. Lipham", "Oh yes, just on the guidance that we provided it is. ", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Okay. Third question as I guess again about guidance, to your guys include buyback in there and if so to what extent I might have missed that if you commented?", "James B. Lipham", "This is not included in our guidance. ", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Okay. So if I -- from what might prove as the midpoint, call it $0.03 for tax and let\u2019s call it $0.03 to $0.05 for buyback is that reasonable to kind of get to? ", "James B. Lipham", "It's reasonable but we wouldn't commit to it today, Ashwin. ", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Okay, understood. My last question if I was looking at that release for the waterfall chart that you flagged Jim, if I was looking at that for 2014 you provided some very good color on the negative shrinking potential on percentage points. And some of that\u2019s sort of eaten away it seems to me like the some of the positives with a model number what kind of came out based on your guidance? ", "James B. Lipham", "Excuse us. It's snowing pretty hard here. We don't know if we've got a bad connection with you really broke up there if you could try that again.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Sure I am also calling in from overseas so that might be the main reason, the waterfall chart that you provide Jim, if I was to look at that perceptively for 2014 what might that look like you already provided some pretty good color on the shrinkage going down but let's call it about three percentage points. ", "If the other pieces remain the same then your overall growth rate should have gone up by three percentage points but it's not doing that so I am looking for where the offset is?", "James B. Lipham", "You talk about the revenue change, what drives that? ", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Yes. ", "James B. Lipham", "", "And I did mention that last business will go down as far as a percentage and so will price concessions. ", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Right. ", "James B. Lipham", "Also acquisitions will go down as a percentage as we go forward. ", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Okay, got it. So the organic piece remains about what it is this year. ", "James B. Lipham", "Yeah it has been pretty close in that range. ", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Okay, got it. Thank you guys. ", "James B. Lipham", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "And your final question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh from Macquarie.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Hello? We may have lost him.", "Operator", "Mr. McVeigh your line is open. If you have your line muted can you unmute it? ", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Jazz I think you need to move along. ", "Operator", "Okay. There are no further audio questions at this time. ", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well good. Thank you so much for your questions. I hope you will agree that our game plan is solid and our team is ready to execute on the challenges and we are looking forward to 2014. I think that 2013 will really be the year that we remember as a transitional year with NetSpend acquisition, which was a really big deal for us. And we are thrilled with what we\u2019ve got there. ", "I am starting to believe that 2014 will be remembered as the year the industry really ramps up and gets serious about security. As you know EMB would not certainly -- would not have created the breaches that we are seeing. It certainly would help and we are starting to see some activity in that area. It\u2019s ramping up a little harder than it has in the past. ", "I also think it\u2019s worth mentioning when we get to this time in 2015 this time next year in 2015 we will be processing close to 700 million accounts and that\u2019s where we are mapping and I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s ever been there before. So we are excited about that. Remember Shawn Roberts in Investor Relations, he\u2019s here to serve your needs of quality transparent answers. So don\u2019t hesitate to call him.

All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Shawn Roberts, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Roberts, the floor is now yours.", "Shawn Roberts", "Thank you, Hannah, and welcome, everyone. On the call today, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phil Tomlinson is going to begin with his opening remarks. Then he is going to turn it over to Troy Woods, who will provide business highlights on our four segments. And then Jim Lipham, our CFO, will review our consolidated financials. After that we're going to open it up for Q&A as usual.", "I'd like to now call your attention to the fact that we'll be making some forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS' actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in TSYS' reports filed with the SEC.", "At this time, I'd like to introduce TSYS' CEO, Phil Tomlinson.", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "Good afternoon, everybody. Shawn, thank you. We're glad you're on the phone with us. I'm happy to report that our weather was much, much better than it was the last time we did this. We're certainly not used to having conference calls in ice storms which we did in January. It's a typical warm day here in the spring in South Georgia, so we're ready to get on with it.", "Welcome again to our first quarter earnings call. I hope you have had plenty of time to read our press release and go over the financials in some detail. Happy to note, though, that we've met all of our internal goals for the quarter.", "As usual, we had a few moving parts in the quarter including on the disposition front, the sale of our majority stake in GP Network Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiary, TSYS Japan Inc.", "I hope that these dispositions didn't surprise anybody as I've mentioned on numerous occasions over the past several years that we were not happy with our progress and our growth in Japan.", "Also on the acquisition front, during the first quarter, we purchased an additional 15% of the Central Payment's business, bringing our total to 75% ownership. I'm happy to tell you that they continue to outperform our expectations in the direct acquiring space.", "And we're also delighted that as a part of the CPAY transaction, we've extended the employment terms of the CPAY Executive Management team, really happy about that.", "On the new business front, we just announced a major internal international win with Virgin Money in the U.K. a week or so ago and yesterday we announced NetSpend's exciting -- really a big opportunity with Western Union.", "And with that I am going to turn it over to Troy Woods who will go through the four segments. Troy?", "M. Troy Woods", "Thank you, Phil, and good evening. We've had a very busy and productive first quarter and I think our actions and progress this quarter represent a very aggressive and deliberate approach to how we run our business.", "As Phil indicated, there are many details and moving parts to our first quarter, so let me just jump right in. First, I'd like to begin our segment reviews with North America which begins on slide six.", "The North America segment produced its largest year-over-year quarter revenue growth in over five years, coming in at 9.1% to $224.4 million. This 9.1% revenue growth is equally impressive when you consider that we had Chase licensing revenue of $3.75 million included in the first quarter of 2013.", "Our revenue growth for the quarter was probably driven by a 16% increase in transactions and a 17% increase in accounts on file.", "Also during the quarter, we saw improved sales in broad services and in card production services. And almost half of our increase in card production services was the result of the re-issuances of cards due to several retailer breaches.", "One of the synergy opportunities identified with NetSpend was card production. During the first quarter, TSYS produced over 30% of NetSpend's cards and we expect to produce at least 30% of card production for NetSpend for the remainder of the year.", "As expected for the quarter, our expenses grew faster than our revenue growth producing an adjusted operating margin of 33.2%, down 20 basis points from the same quarter last year. These extra expenses are primarily the result of increased incentive pay and Phase 1 and 2 of our market salary adjustments that I mentioned during last quarter's call.", "Historically, our first quarter margin is the lowest margin quarter of the year and this year will be no different for this segment. We still expect the margins for North America to be in the 34% to 36% range for the full year.", "On the business development front, we signed new agreements in the community and regional bank stays with Iberia Bank and TrustCo Bank as well as contract extensions with Toronto-Dominion, Canadian Tire, and Bank of Nova Scotia.", "And finally, all of our conversion activities are green and on schedule.", "Operator", "Due to technical issues, your conference will resume momentarily. Please do not disconnect. Due to technical difficulties, your call will resume momentarily.", "You may proceed with your conference call.", "Shawn Roberts", "Thank you, Hannah. This is Shawn Roberts of Investor Relations. I apologize for the fact that we got disconnected on the line. I'm going to reintroduce Troy Woods, our COO, and he'll pick up with his presentation from the beginning.", "M. Troy Woods", "I don't really plan to go back to the beginning, Shawn. I'll do back up, I'm not sure when we lost, but I'm going to back up a little bit. I'm still on the North America segment and I was indicating that, as we expected for the first quarter, our expenses grew faster than our revenue growth, producing an adjusted operating margin of 33.2%, down 20 basis points from the first quarter of last year. These extra expenses are primarily the result of increased incentive pay and Phase 1 and Phase 2 of our market salary adjustments that I mentioned during last quarter's call.", "Historically, our first quarter margin is the lowest margin quarter of the year and this year will be no different. We still expect the margins for the North American segment to be in the 34% to 36% range for the full year.", "On the business development front, we signed new agreements in the community and regional bank space with Iberia Bank and TrustCo Bank, as well as contract extensions with Toronto-Dominion, Canadian Tire, Bank of Nova Scotia.", "And finally, all of our conversion activities are green and on schedule. We have converted just over 800,000 accounts already this quarter, leaving approximately 4.2 million left to be converted. This will leave us with approximately 91 million accounts to convert in the third quarter, finishing up the largest conversion pipeline in our history.", "All in all, it's another good quarter for the North American segment and we're all very excited about the many opportunities that are ahead of us for the remainder of this year.", "I now would like to move to slides eight and nine for a review of the international segment. I mentioned earlier that this quarter had many moving parts and no segment probably had more moving parts than the international segment.", "As we look at the quarterly financial comparisons, revenues for the quarter were $76.8 million, up 0.5% of 1% over the same quarter last year. However, unlike previous quarters, currency had a positive impact this quarter of $3.9 million. So, on a constant currency basis, our revenues for the quarter were down 4.6% compared to last year.", "I think it is very important to note and point out that the first quarter of 2013 had approximately $2.3 million of non-recurring de-conversion and penalty fees as well as approximately $1 million of additional non-recurring items that has made this quarter a very difficult revenue comp quarter.", "In addition to these items, as I have mentioned before, we're deliberately continuing to close some of our least profitable lines of business as part of our continued efforts to eliminate less profitable revenue and improve our margin profile. These closures and sun setting of services resulted in approximately $1.4 million of less revenue in the first quarter of this year versus last year.", "As a result of these many moving parts, our margin this quarter, as expected was below our quarterly numbers for 2013. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 5.9% versus 9% for last year.", "While the metrics for the quarter are lumpy when compared to last year, we believe the underlying trends for this quarter like 8.9% account on final growth and 19% transaction growth as well as our other growth initiatives will keep us on track to deliver both our revenue growth and margin targets for the full year.", "As Phil indicated, one of the most exciting business development activities for the quarter was the announcement that TSYS would begin the processing and servicing of credit card accounts with one of the best-known brands in Europe, Virgin.", "Virgin's newly established U.K.-based retail bank, Virgin Money will be receiving a comprehensive suite of services from TSYS to include core processing, analytical solutions, Internet self-service, as well as a full set of managed services capabilities from our call center facilities in Milton Keynes, U.K.", "Our current plans are to launch a start-up program for Virgin Money in the fourth quarter and then convert approximately 600,000 accounts in the first quarter of 2015.", "Now, I'd like to add some additional color to our Japan announcement. In 2011, we began a process to strategically assess all lines of business and all geographies served on the international segment.", "One of the outcomes of this exercise was a plan to streamline our operations into the markets and business lines that we felt would give us the highest returns and the line with our long-term strategic goals. This assessment included the need for us to make a decision on the future direction of our operations in Japan.", "Our operations in Japan have consisted of two lines of businesses. The first was our issuer processing business using our prime technology, operating out of our operations facility in Knaresborough, U.K. and (indiscernible), a payment solution operated out of a leased data center in Okinawa, Japan.", "The second line of business was our 54% stake of GP Net, which provides POS terminal services to the Japanese market, and certain businesses that was related to the sharing of Japanese domestic processing fees with Visa and other shareholders in the joint venture.", "Although Japan is a very large card market, it is heavily conciliated and concentrated among a handful of very large financial institutions, almost all of which process internally. For almost 14 years, TSYS has been trying to build a profitable issuer processing business in Japan with very limited success.", "After assessing the size of the investment required to enhance our processing platforms and balancing that investment against the low likelihood of successful penetration of scale needed in the domestic processing market, we decided to exit the Japanese issuer processing segment.", "We accomplished this by transferring our existing issuer processing business to a local entity created by former leaders of our TSYS Japan business. In conjunction with exiting the issuer processing business, we also decided to sell our 54% stake in GP Net to Visa who is also a minority owner of GP Net.", "Domestic interchange is not a core strategic business line to TSYS, nor one that we could expand or replicate to other markets around the globe. And while GP Net has been a good venture for TSYS and for TSYS shareholders, we felt that by disposing of our interest in GP Net now, we could move faster in aligning our various markets with our strategic agenda in the longer term.", "The highlights for the merchant segment, again on slide 10. Consistent with recent trends reported in 2013, our merchant segment revenues were $104.6 million, up 4.3% for the quarter. The operating margin for the quarter was 28.8%.", "As I mentioned last quarter, the movement in revenue growth and operating margin were both expected. Revenue profile and margin will both continue to improve each quarter for the remainder of the year.", "Slide 11 provides additional detail around our direct versus indirect revenue growth for the quarter. Also during the quarter, as Phil indicated, we were very pleased to have had the opportunity to increase our stake in CPAY joint venture to 75% from 60%.", "In addition, as a result of this equity increase, CPAY company founders Matt and Zach Hyman have agreed to continue to lead the company as co-managing directors for an additional three years.", "Continuing on the direct side, we signed nine new national accounts and a new referral agreement with Navy Federal Credit Union, a long-standing TSYS customer on the issuing side. This is a great example of the synergies we can realize when we package our services across the larger enterprise.", "Our direct growth plans have a multi-pronged approach. One, establishing new referral partners and expanding upon those already in place. Two, expanding into adjacent verticals such as rent and charities.", "Three, providing enhanced products to differentiate us in the market such as tablet-based POS, restaurant solutions, mobile solutions, and tools to improve merchant growth and engagement with their customers through social channels.", "Four, increasing sales productivity of our W-2 employees as well as our independent sales agents. And five, strategic acquisitions.", "On the indirect side, we're all familiar with the headwinds we continue to experience. But we're pleased with the increased attraction in the market in an industry where the addressable market is shrinking.", "We're beginning to see increased activity with the top 100 non-bank acquirers and are pleased to announce that we signed three new indirect processing clients and renewed three clients during the quarter.", "We will continue to focus on this market and leverage our competitive advantages of leading reputation, strong balance sheet, fraud and devalue-added reseller certifications, expanded capability set and scale through a single platform.", "Speaking of scale through a single platform, we have completed our backend clearing and settlement conversion this quarter and have now processed two up ends. This has been a long and arduous journey, but this consolidation will provide us many efficiencies, new capabilities, and cost savings going forward.", "And finally our NetSpend segment review begins on slide 12. NetSpend turned in another exceptional performance for the first quarter. NetSpend produced record revenues for the quarter of $132.6 million, representing a 13.1% increase over the same period last year.", "A very strong and successful tax season was clearly a contributing factor on the revenue growth for the quarter. The tax volume and our public growth initiatives also helped produce record direct deposit cards at $2.1 million and industry-leading gross dollar volume of $6.6 billion, representing increases of 21% and 22% respectively.", "It has been our experience that revenue in card metrics declined from the first quarter to the second of each calendar year as tax volumes subside and single use account holders acquired during the tax season that's right during the second quarter. We do expect this trend to continue during 2014.", "Also as part of the seasonality and the NetSpend segment, marketing investments paid in the first quarter are usually higher than other quarters which are intended to drive results within the calendar year. As such, the margin for the first quarter is usually the lowest margin quarter year.", "As it relates to our revenue expectations, I thought it might be helpful to provide some additional color on a few initiatives we're working on. As you might expect, NetSpend intentionally focuses on maximizing lifetime profit per account, starting with our focus on direct deposit to pricing to our products and, ultimately, to the partners we work with.", "Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013, we began to focus on two very important initiatives that we believe will have significant meaningful impact on our customer satisfaction and will also have the result of increasing the lifetime of our accounts and ultimately, drive higher long-term profitability.", "First, as you know, we offer both a pay-as-you-go plan and a monthly plan for our cardholders. Through aggressive partner promotions and customer service communications, we're beginning to see a positive shift across our cardholder base from pay-as-you-go to monthly fee plans and this should be very good news for lifetime value.", "Second, if the successful migration of our PayCard platform in November, our PayCard and GPR accounts are now on one platform which will allow us, among other things, to deliver a consistent product experience across program.", "This migration also allowed us to proactively make some adjustments to the overdraft protection plans we offer on our payroll cards to align more closely with the overdraft protection plans we offer on our GPR cards which we have designed to be the most consumer-friendly options in the industry today.", "These lifetime value and overdraft change initiatives both have the effect of impacting short-term revenue. With these initiatives gaining traction, we expect to see low to mid teen revenue growth for all of 2014. We're also firmly convinced that these initiatives will yield long-term gains on retention, customer satisfaction, and lifetime value.", "On the business development front, we added 2,000 new retail locations bringing our total now to 66,000. And we added over 70 new PayCard clients bringing the total number of trusted companies who distribute our PayCard products to their employees to approximately 1,900.", "Of course, one of the biggest business development news for the segment was the announcement yesterday of a new agreement with Western Union. This is an incredible opportunity for both companies to jointly develop an innovative cobranded prepaid card to be launched later this year.", "NetSpend's industry-leading expertise and product capabilities, coupled with Western Union's global brand and expertise at moving money, is very compelling and very exciting.", "We're also equally excited to announce today that we have signed a new agreement with PayChex to launch a new PayCard product later this quarter. PayChex is one of the nation's leading providers of payroll, human resource, and benefits outsourcing solutions to small-to-medium sized businesses and serves more than 570,000 payroll clients.", "As I mentioned earlier today, we provide our PayCard products and services through 1,900 companies. So, having the opportunity to work with 570,000 payroll clients is significant. Western Union and PayChex are two great names in their respective businesses and we're very excited about the many opportunities that we will have working with both of them.", "Although the ramp-up of these new initiatives will require some additional upfront investments. We're still expecting our adjusted operating margins to be in the high 20s to low 30s for the year.", "We continue to be focused on high growth opportunities, flawless execution, and driving innovative products that will help us reach more than 68 million people who need alternative financial services.", "Now, I'd like to turn it over to Jim Lipham for a more in-depth financial review of the first quarter and revised guidance for 2014 as a result of our Japanese business dispositions. Jimmy?", "Jim B. Lipham", "Thank you, Troy. Let me say up front on the financial data that we will be presenting, we have the -- excluded all our operations in Japan.", "Let's take a look at the slide on -- slide 15 with consolidated results for the quarter. And as Phil said we're very pleased with our reported results as we met or exceeded our planned quarterly results.", "Total revenues were up $144.1 million or 32.1% to $592.8 million in revenues before reimbursable is up $144.7 million or 37.3% to $532.8 million. Both total revenues and revenues before reimbursable items exclude $16.2 million of revenues as a result of the move of our Japanese businesses to discontinued ops.", "As Troy just covered, NetSpend contributed $132.6 million in revenue for the quarter. North America had an outstanding quarter and had one of its best ever in terms of revenue growth. Our consolidated organic revenues were up 3% and were in line with our expectations.", "Troy mentioned currencies that had a favorable impact on revenues before reimbursables with an increase of $4 million in the quarter. The difference in rates year over year also added $2.5 million to operating income and $3.1 million in adjusted EBITDA.", "Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter excludes $7.6 million of stock-based comp and $1.3 million of M&A expenses related to NetSpend and amounted to $149.6 million with a 28.1% margin. It was up 26.1% or 21.2% over last year. The adjusted cash earnings per share from continuing ops was $0.38.", "Our tax expense for the quarter is approximately $6 million higher than last year, primarily due to the discrete items in 2013's first quarter of $7.2 million versus $1.4 million this year, which was a difference of about $0.03 a share on earnings per share.", "Net of one-time items adjusted cash earnings were also negatively impacted by the incremental interest expense this quarter over 2013 of $9.5 million pretax and $6.2 million after-tax. These two items negatively impacted our year-over-year adjusted cash earnings by approximately $0.06 per share. If you adjusted for those two items, adjusted cash earnings per share would have been up 17% year-over-year.", "The next slide, on slide 16, our segments report their results on an adjusted segment operating income basis which excludes amortization of acquisition intangibles, amortization and NetSpend M&A expenses. This slide is a bridge between the adjusted segment operating income for each of our segments and our consolidated adjusted operating income.", "As you see, adjusted operating income is $113.9 million with a margin of 21.4. We expect the adjusted operating margins to be in the range of 25 to 27 on a full year basis. The lower margin in the first quarter is where we expected it to be and is due to the result of the increased expenses Troy spoke about earlier. The margin for 2013 was 26.9%.", "The next slide is our roll forward on quarterly cash balance. Slide 17 shows our cash balance excluded from both the beginning and ending balances is approximately $34.5 million and $33.5 million respectively as we move the cash in our Japanese operations to the discontinued line on our balance sheet.", "We had $149 million of cash flow from operations and used $47 million of it for CapEx, roughly a third going towards conversion cost, a third going toward property and equipment, and the remaining third going toward developed software and licensed software.", "We had $22 million worth of principal payments on debts; $38 million on increasing our own ship of Central Payment's joint venture from 60% to 75% ownership; dividends to our shareholders, $19 million; and various miscellaneous items of $3 million resulting in a balance of $274 million at quarter end. We will say our scheduled principal payments on debt for the full year is $54.5 million and we're scheduled to pay approximately $10 million per quarter for the rest of 2014.", "During the quarter, we had a net increase in cash of $26 million and still had an outstanding NetSpend shareholder liability of $26 million waiting to be resolved.", "Also during the quarter, we had many moving parts that we wanted to get through the Japanese deposition, the CPAY equity increase, as well as a few other things that are now behind us. We expect to be active in the market in the second quarter in regards to share repurchases, as our cash has strengthened since the end of the quarter.", "On the next slide, cash flow, our trailing 12 months on financial highlights as we anniversary a number of items from the early months of 2013 when our free cash flow was slightly negative. We're beginning to see our more normal cash flow.", "If you recall we mentioned during last year's first quarter earnings call that we made investments to obtain software licensing and maintenance agreements for our core processing systems to secure pricing arrangements to benefit us over the long-term, which resulted in an unusually high CapEx and low cash from operating activities.", "For this quarter, our cash flow from operations was $149 million, up $96 million over 2013. And our free cash flow was $101 million, up $104 million. These results significantly improved our trailing 12-month numbers on this slide.", "We continue to expect our free cash flow for all of 2014 to be in the range of $35 million to $37 million per month or $420 million to $444 million for the full year. We do not see any change to our CapEx estimate of $200 million to $210 million for the full year.", "I will say also we're comfortable with our overall current debt level. Our strategy to use our capital remains the same, scheduled debt reductions in dividends, and then we will look to acquisitions to stock buyback as use of our capital going forward.", "The next slide is our revised guidance for 2014 and is due solely to the sale of both of our businesses in Japan. We're changing our 2014 guidance as well as reported results in 2013. The financial results for these two businesses were moved to discontinued ops.", "Total revenue ranges included in our original guidance for 2014 were reduced approximately $70 million and $68 million in 2013 reported total revenues. We also reduced our revenues before reimbursements by the same amounts.", "2014 adjusted EBITDA guidance was reduced by approximately $13 million due to the sale and 2013's by $10.1 million. We maintain our estimated 2014 tax rate to be the same at 34% to 35%.", "Our adjusted cash earnings per share from continuing operations guidance remains the same at $1.90 to $1.93, unchanged from our original guidance. Due to removing Japan's operations from our 2013 reported results, our year-over-year growth rate is now estimated at 10% to 12% versus our original growth rate of 11% to 13%.", "The growth rate changed as a result of adjusted cash earnings increasing in 2013 by approximately $0.01 when Japan's financial results were all moved to the discontinued outline. Our estimated share count remains the same as original guidance. We would have reaffirmed our original guidance for the full year if the transaction had not occurred.", "With that, Hannah, we'll open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)", "And your first question comes from David Togut.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Thank you, and good afternoon, Phil, Troy, and Jim.", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "Good afternoon.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Appreciate the detailed analysis of why margins were down significantly in three of your four businesses. My question really relates to given the year-over-year change in the quarter in margins in international merchant and NetSpend, what underlines your confidence that we'll see a substantial recovery in all three for the balance of the year?", "M. Troy Woods", "Well, a couple of things, David. One is we look at all of our operating plans for all of our segments as we put these plans together for the year. I've indicated this on the road on several occasions through webcasts that, without exception, all of our segments show increased operating margins from the second half of the year. No exceptions.", "So, we feel very confident about these plans. We've talked about many of these activities that anniversary throughout the course of 2014. Some of these one-offs that we had in international in 2013 will also anniversary. So, again, this shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that each quarter here on out without exception these segments will improve their operative margins.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.", "And you mean on a year-over-year basis. Understood that the seasonality points to weaker trends in the first quarter every year, anyway, but you're saying on a year-over-year basis we should see significant improvement in margins for three of the four segments?", "M. Troy Woods", "I'm specifically speaking, David, to the sequential quarter improvements with the margins. As you go through these four segments that I went through a minute ago, each one, each subsequent quarter will improve over the previous quarter -- go ahead.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.", "I was going to ask how should we think about the year-over-year trends as we go to 2Q, 3Q, and 4Q.", "M. Troy Woods", "It was up. I've indicated on several occasions when you think of North America, we've guided 34% to 36% margin. We don't come off of it at all. We guided international segments with [year] (ph) low 14s, which is a significant improvement year-over-year.", "NetSpend margin we said will be in the high 20s to low 30s. So, again, you've got that compared to last year. And we said the merchant segment will be 31% to 33%. And we've given I think a lot of color on why that margin is lower than last year, but significantly higher than the first quarter. Does that help?", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.", "That is very helpful. Thanks. Just shifting gears for a minute over the North American business, you highlighted the 91 million accounts you are converting in Q3. What will the revenue and margin profile look like as we shift from Q2 to Q3 in the North American business? We've never seen such a large convergence -- conversion before, at least not that I can recall at TSYS.", "M. Troy Woods", "We haven't either. It is the first rollout as -- David and everyone is working mighty hard and as I said earlier pretty excited about getting the rest of these accounts in the pipeline over the finish line.", "When you think about North America, when you look at the revenue guidance range that we provided of 8 to 10, what I've been consistent in saying that the second half of the year, revenue growth will be higher than that range.", "So that will help you look at third and fourth quarter. Same with margin. The margins in the third and fourth quarter shouldn't be higher than the range that we provided. Does that answer your question?", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.", "It does. Thank you. Just a final question. You indicated the nice win, the Virgin Money win in the quarter. Can you quantify for us how many accounts Virgin Money has?", "M. Troy Woods", "Well, as I indicated in my prepared statement, David, we'll launch them in the fourth quarter, start-up program with old and new accounts and we'll convert about 600,000 accounts the first quarter of 2015.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Is that the total amount you expect from Virgin Money?", "M. Troy Woods", "That's the total number that we expect to convert.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Understood. Thank you very much.", "M. Troy Woods", "Yes sir.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane [Deutsche Bank].", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "Hey, Brian.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank", "Hi, guys. How are you doing? Just A couple of follow-ups on the guidance. On the international segment, what should we expect for the revenue on a constant currency basis for the year? I understand it is going to improve sequentially, but is there a full-year number we can think about on a constant currency basis?", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "I don\u2019t have a pulled number right here with me for the whole year on constant currency.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank", "Well, how about on total revenue then?", "Jim B. Lipham", "What we said before, for full year it will be low to mid single digits.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank", "Low to mid single. So when we go forward in international, is there some drivers we should think about that\u2019s going to pick up the overall revenue growth as your accounts coming on? I just want to make sure I have my arms around it. Besides the Virgin business, of course, yes.", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "Yeah. I\u2019ve indicated before, we are working on three conversions and five launches one of which that I\u2019ve just mentioned is Virgin money representing about two million accounts. So I\u2019ve given you the answer to 600,000 of the two million.", "We\u2019ve got some ramp-up of some product stand in Brazil. We\u2019ll bring it on pro in the Brazil\u2019s projects, I don\u2019t have it all in front of me Bryan, but I\u2019ll say we will finish the year in the low to mid single digits revenue growth for the segment.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank", "No, that helps. And then I missed it, but I think you just said what the adjusted segment margin should be for the year for international. I know it picks up quite a bit, but I missed the number?", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "It ramps up significantly in the third and fourth quarter and what we\u2019re indicating before is that it will be in the low 14% range.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And so if I think about it, the only real change on -- the revenue stays the same, but the only real change, it sounds like NetSpend revenue -- I know we originally thought high teens, now it is low to mid teens -- but the revenue stays the same for the full year.", "If I had to guess I would guess that the North American segment's a little bit ahead of game plan and obviously that being bigger and so net net, those are the moving pieces that kind of -- everything else stays the same so net net that keeps us at the same revenue for the year.", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "You are correct, Bryan.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. All right. Super. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler [Stifel Nicolaus].", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "Chris Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus", "All right, thanks. Good evening. First on the international segment, the divestiture in Japan. Is that the first many or do you think you are \u2013 this is just a one-off in terms of consolidating some of your international operations?", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "Can you repeat the question?", "Chris Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus", "In international segment, is the decision to exit Japan more of a one-off or is it this first of many sort of strategic actions trying to refine the profitability of your international segment?", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "Oh, no, it's just clearly a one-off. As we\u2019ve indicated before, I\u2019ve telegraphed this that going all the way back in 2011, we\u2019re looking at all of our geographies. Now there\u2019s probably one more area very, very relatively small area that we\u2019re not happy with, but there are no other geographies that we\u2019re looking to exit.", "Chris Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Great. And then in the merchant segment, some decent trends in the direct business continue. Talk about any sort of -- anything that may have contributed to the growth this quarter? I haven\u2019t really seen a lot of acquisition activity. You seem to be getting some good traction with direct business. Anything new to talk about there?", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "Well, nothing really new, what we\u2019ve indicated before, I think I told you last quarter that we\u2019re looking to get the low \u2013 I mean the mid to high single digit growth out of our direct business.", "We\u2019ve got a lot of activities going on that space. We talked about the increased productivity of our sales people. We rollout the tablets and we\u2019ll talked about merchant inside product to help our customers, look at their revenue trends and take better advantage of the social channels.", "So hopefully we can continue to click with all of that to generate the revenue we\u2019ve outlined for the direct business. I\u2019ve also indicated in the past that we\u2019re not getting into quarterly guidance, but what I have said before that our expectations are that the revenue growth for direct should increase slightly each quarter for the rest of the year from what you\u2019ve seen this quarter.", "Chris Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus", "And that is a function for new product and some of the new relationships?", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "It\u2019s a combination of new relationship, new products. We\u2019ve got one relatively large direct piece of business that will anniversary latter in the year. So it\u2019s a combination of all of those things, sales productivity increases.", "Chris Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus", "Great. Thanks. I appreciate it.", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "Yes, sir.", "Operator", "You next question comes from the line of Tulu Yunus [Nomura Securities].", "Tulu Yunus - Nomura Securities", "Yeah. Hi, good evening guys. Just question on -- staying on merchant segment, can you tell us what the impact of bands was in terms of deconversion there?", "Shawn Roberts", "Well, as you know, they\u2019re still reconverting. It was about little over $3 million less in the first quarter of \u201914 than it was in the first of \u201913. It\u2019s still on a significant one-off mode. We do expect the revenues that they will pay us in 2014 will be about 30% to 35% less than they paid us in 2013.", "Tulu Yunus - Nomura Securities", "How much less, I\u2019m sorry?", "Shawn Roberts", "30% to 35% less.", "Tulu Yunus - Nomura Securities", "30% to 35%, okay. Got it. Thanks. And then actually more broadly on pricing and lost business overall. Can you just remind us if there\u2019s anything, any other large impacts coming up in 2Q, 3Q particularly that we should be mindful of across any of your segments?", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "If you look at our projection for the rest of this year on lost grants and price concessions is probably going to run somewhere in the neighborhood of 5% whereas last year it was 7.8%. So we\u2019ve got about 36% or some percent improvement.", "I think the exciting thing there for us as we\u2019ve talked about this before is when we think about our lost business that we\u2019ve looked at for \u201914, we\u2019re projecting about $20 million less than \u201913 and for price concessions about 20% to 25% less and price concession to \u201914 than we had in \u201913. So those are the components you kind of come back to what Jimmy just said.", "Tulu Yunus - Nomura Securities", "Got it. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Georgios Mihalos [Credit Suisse].", "George Mihalos - Credit Suisse", "Hey, guys thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to circle back on the guidance specifically you were reiterating your margin outlook per segment. But it looks like now you are striping out at least in your presentation the stock-based compensation. So I just want to make sure we\u2019re talking apples-for-apples. When you say 34% to 36% margins for North America that would be adding back the stock-based comp?", "Shawn Roberts", "Yes.", "George Mihalos - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Okay. Thank you. And then just looking at the international segment, appreciate the color you gave there as it relates to the one-timers from a year ago, but if I sort of adjust for the math there, you are still up only slightly year-over-year on an absolute basis in terms of revenue. What is causing that sort of divergence from the very strong account on file growth and very strong transaction volume growth that you saw in the first quarter?", "Shawn Roberts", "George, I\u2019m not sure I really followed that question.", "George Mihalos - Credit Suisse", "Sure. So, if I look at your year-over-year revenue growth at international, even if I sort of add back though the $4 plus million of one-timers to remove them from the first quarter of \u201913, the rate of growth year-on-year were significantly lower than what we\u2019re looking at for your accounts on file growth and your transaction volume growth. So I\u2019m just sort of wondering how to reconcile the two?", "Shawn Roberts", "Well, I think I follow with him George. There\u2019s a couple of things I might just throw out there that might help. I think on accounts on file, we did purchase 600,000, 700,000 accounts in the first quarter. I would say, number two that when you think about the revenue mix of the international segment, only about half of revenue comes from account on files and transaction.", "And I think we talked about this before too that about 27% of the transactions and about 28% of the accounts on file for the segment are bundled pricing. So you are not going to get the same correlation of account on file and transaction growth revenue that you would for individual items.", "Also I might add and we talked that this now for couple of quarters, we've added a significant amount of debit accounts and debit activity over the past several quarters. Clearly they don\u2019t carry the same type of revenue profile is our credit portfolio. So I think those will be the \u2013 If I understood you question and tell me if I didn\u2019t.", "George Mihalos - Credit Suisse", "No, that is exactly right. That's the color that I was looking for. And maybe one last question. You mentioned card reissuance being a driver in the North America segment. Did you find a substantial portion of the cards reissued because of the breaches were chip-enabled or even V-compliant.", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "No, George we have not. We are running zero to low 5% of all the card re-issuance that we do here thesis or EMV capable of plastic. So it hasn\u2019t been in the push pull uptake in any shape on the fashion.", "George Mihalos - Credit Suisse", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of Jason Kupferberg.", "Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies & Company", "", "This is Ramsey El-Assal for Jason. Following up on that last question. In the North America segment you mentioned that some of the revenue outperformance was driven by that increase in car production related to reissuance from the breaches. How meaningful of a contributor was that to that 9.1% growth rate? And I guess, would you expect that to tail off pretty sharply next quarter or are you still seeing some of this occurring and will continue for a little bit?", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "We are in the scheme of the North American segment. It\u2019s not a significant amount of money that generated that 9.1% increase number one. Number two, no, I wouldn\u2019t say that we are expecting that to continue this quarter from what we are seeing at least through mid late April. And that doesn\u2019t mean over the next months and months to come, people get in the queue.", "We do that -- a significant queue that is built up around EMV trying to better understand what they need to do at TSYS to get into the project queue to get it going.", "But it was not a significant contributor to the number. What I said earlier was we did experience increased activity around sales I mean fraud, as well as card production. So there were three or four things that really drove the 9% increase.", "Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies & Company", "All right. Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. Switching gears over to the merchant business, you mentioned I think last quarter that 2013 was the first year you saw your direct merchant business generating more revenues than the indirect side. I think you also threw out an 80% target in terms of total merchant revs is to come from direct versus indirect in the not too distant future.", "Can you give us a little color in terms of where that mix sort of shook out in Q1 and how soon we can expect you to get to that 80% target?", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "Sure. What we said, was, it is our expectations, our aspirations if you will to move that mix close to that 80% in the near term. We never did put a timeline on it. We ended the first quarter at 57%.", "", "Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies & Company", "57%, okay. All right. And last for me also on the merchant business. You have been seeing an ongoing mix shift in bundle pricing from the bundle pricing. Can you also give us a sense of where that mix stands today and where it might end up let\u2019s say by the end of the year? ", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "Well, as I've indicated a few times before I wish I had a crystal ball. This continued to move down the percentage of bundled versus unbundled. We've been seeing about 200 basis points per quarter over the past three quarters.", "I think the good news in that is if you can call a good news is where we were little over a year ago, we've seen that slow up. We put in some mitigating factors that we talked about before some incentive programs, etcetera, some training. So we are still moving south just not as fast.", "Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies & Company", "Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Smitti Srethapramote [Morgan Stanley].", "Smitti Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley", "Thank you. Just had a couple questions on NetSpend. So based on some of the new initiatives that you guys spoke about, should we think about revenues for NetSpend as being higher this year than in the previous guidance, or will most of the benefits show up in 2015 and beyond?", "James B. Lipham", "Can you repeat that for me? I am so sorry, I missed that.", "Smitti Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley", "Yes, so, based on some of the new initiatives on NetSpend that you guys spoke about today, should we think about revenues for NetSpend as being higher than in the previous guidance? Or will most of the benefits, the new initiatives show up in 2015 and beyond?", "James B. Lipham", "Well I think if I had been. Bryan, I mentioned this earlier in the question, but what I have indicated is that we are looking for the NetSpend segment to produce revenues in the low to mid teens increased over '13 and Bryan was correct.", "Earlier we had talked about NetSpend segment producing revenues in the mid to high teens. So we have come off that number solved. And it\u2019s as I said earlier primarily driven by the two initiatives that I mentioned earlier.", "Smitti Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley", "And then maybe can you also give us an update on competitive dynamics? Green Dot seems to be making more of an aggressive expansion into the distribution, into the check-cashing channels over the past couple of months?", "James B. Lipham", "I really can\u2019t to be honest with you. I think their earnings call is maybe later next week, but we have not really seen any significant inroads into our alternative financial group the check-cashing channel as you called it.", "As I've indicated before, we have the top guys under exclusive contracts, so we wouldn\u2019t be necessary be privy to some of the check-cashers, so we don\u2019t have exclusivity with that they moved into and perhaps I've signed them up during the quarter. But beyond that, I don\u2019t really have anything to add to it.", "Smitti Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley", "", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh [Macquarie Research].", "Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Research", "Great. Thanks. I know you spent a lot of time, but I just wanted to make sure I was clear. It looks like you tweaked the EBITDA guidance but were able to reaffirm the EPS. Is that a function of a lower tax rate or how should we think about that?", "James B. Lipham", "No, we've reaffirmed our cash earnings per share and tax rate still around 34%.", "Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Research", "But the adjusted EBITDA, did that come down or am I misreading that?", "James B. Lipham", "Well, we have a little bit of Japan. Basically the change, basically on Japan and cost us penny.", "Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then in terms of Central Payment your step up in that, did that impact the guidance at all or no?", "James B. Lipham", "No.", "Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Research", "Okay. Thank you.", "James B. Lipham", "We\u2019re already consolidating the revenue side of that given 11% of revenue.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steven Kwok [Keefe, Bruyette & Woods]", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had a quick question around the CFPB and was wondering, are there any proposals that you expect out there around the prepaid space this year? And the follow-up is with regards to NetSpend, how much of your revenues come from overdraft fees? Thanks.", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "Steven as it relates to the CFPB, the short answer is yes. We do expect something out of them this year. This is their own pronounced. They indicated at one time that they would out by now and they\u2019ve delighted it. So I am not sure what their expectation maybe over the next month or two.", "We would expect to get something from it and I think we will have 60 to 90 days as an industry to respond and look at it. As it relates to overdraft, no that\u2019s not a number that we have provided in the past from overdraft revenue.", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Is there anything around how material it is to you?", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "Again this is not a number that we provided either for this segment or the percentage of consolidated revenue.", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Okay. Fair enough. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim Willi [Wells Fargo].", "Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo", "Hi thanks. Good afternoon. A couple of questions. First on North America, Troy. Even though it's on the backside of '15, once you lap BoA and the other big conversions, how do you think about the growth in North America?", "Obviously there's still a couple of large institutions that seem to be resistant to outsourcing. Do you think that what you are seeing with Community and Regional Banks will be building enough momentum that account on file Europe and North America on the backside of all these big conversions and will be a pretty decent metric or do you think that will have to be a different sort of driver of revenue growth in North America once we get out past that?", "I know it's a little bit out there, but just sort of your thoughts as we start to bring on those accounts and people start to think about the encore if you will once we anniversary all that stuff up. And I have a follow-up on NetSpend.", "M. Troy Woods", "Hey Tim, we are counting on you to help us with your bank.", "Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo", "I'm sure I can help you out with this.", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "I like that a lot. I had a guy tell me one time Tim that you eat you eat a watermelon truck by eating one watermelon at a time, and my goodness, we got to get this digested and we still have 19 paying accounts to get converted. So I think it's just a little bit early for us to start talking about expectations growth for the North American sector, but yes\u2026", "Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo", "Maybe I can phrase it differently, then. So in the here and now, do you feel like the efforts -- I think it's a renewed focus or heightened focus to go to these community and regional banks, is that tracking? Are you happy with where the momentum is in the reception and the productivity, the salesforce for that effort?", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "Well, we've talked on several occasions that we've been extremely fortunate and successful in what we call the TPS space. As you well know, we've signed up some very large names like Huntington Bank and Regions Bank. We've got about 30 or 30 pound new customers large and small in that group.", "I think time will tell what kind of scale they can build and growth they could produce, but it's not a small number of customers that are beginning to get into that group and I said 30 to 35.", "Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo", "Okay, fair enough. I didn't mean to put you on the spot. I guess it is sort of\u2026", "M. Troy Woods", "I was sitting in here with those and you choked on that I think when you were talking about growth being on '14.", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "One way of looking at it is the large base that will put on and what we have seen preliminaries is these customers are growing faster than our other traditional customers as an aggregate. So we look at that as a feeder to growth.", "Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo", "Okay. That's very helpful color. Thank you. On NetSpend. Just one thing I wanted to ask there. So the direct sales channel prior to when NetSpend was independent, able to talk a bit more in depth about the business outlook of the channel I think to talk about, really starting to come on and get leverage out of this unknown.", "I think it was something like one third of new accounts were coming from the direct marketing channels that they had built as opposed to PayCard or check-cashing, what have you. Just an update, has the active momentum remained strong or has it gotten stronger with those direct channels they have been building.", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "Tim, all in all, the direct channel is the fastest growing channel that we have and it continues to be -- now there is significant opportunity for us to reach out if you will for direct mail, through online account capability. So I mean it's expensive from one standpoint, but at the same time, it's a channel that we don't have to share commissions and that type of thing like we do in some of the other channels. So again it is the fastest growing channel we have of the four.", "Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo", "Yes, perfect. That is all I was looking for. Thanks very much for the time.", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "Thank you, Tim.", "Operator", "And your last question today comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar [Citigroup].", "Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citigroup", "Thank you, guys. I guess my first question is to ask you a clarification on the -- ordinarily I would not ask you for timing within a quarter when you are going to convert a set of accounts. But given the magnitude that we are looking at with 3Q, is it more towards the beginning of the quarter, more towards the end of the quarter in terms of conversions? Could you help with that?", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "Yes, Ashwin, we'll give you a little bit more color on that. What we've said is when you look at the accounts and the conversion pipeline, we've indicated that BMO is scheduled in May and Bank of America is scheduled in August and TD is scheduled in September. So\u2026", "Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay. So that's not changed from before.", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "It has not changed.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay, got it. The second question I had was you took out, if I'm not mistaken, roughly $13 million out of your adjusted operating income. That is associated with the discontinued business. But you kept your EPS the same. And I am looking at -- and that's -- it is not that significant, it is a couple of percent, but I am looking to see where you are making that up.", "It is about $0.04 or so, $0.035 to $0.04. Is that a bigger buyback that is going to help you? Obviously the tax rate does not change from before. Are you looking for higher equity income? I mean, can you help with that?", "Jim B. Lipham", "Yes, the real profit that was being made in Japan had to be with GP net, which we own 54%. So we had to exclude when you get to the bottom line, the minority interest there and that was once you excluded that and put the loss from the issue and piece together, you had no effect on the bottom line.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citigroup", "Great. No that is extremely helpful. The last question I have is with regards to the NetSpend changes. The two reasons you specified for lowering the revenue growth rate, one was trying to move clients to a monthly plan basis and the second was lower overlap charges. And my question is why? Why now? Is this -- are you trying to preempt any potential CFPB action? What's the intent with the timing here?", "M. Troy Woods", "So Ashwin, the fact that two particularly were initiatives. The first one was around the switch from the pay as you go to the monthly plan and really working with several of our significant partners and we give a lot of credit to our partners because they also go though and experience a short term revenue hit.", "But we all want to be in this for the longer term. So our goal is to find ways to increase the longevity of an account and one of the things that several of our partners and they stay on working on, is to how do we drive or how do we move, how do we ship some of these pay-as-you-go to more monthly type planned accounts.", "So in the short term, you may experience a revenue shipped, but long term everyone should come out better with lifetime value because you keep the account much longer.", "As to the overdraft question, there was just a coincidental timing issue really more than anything else. As I indicated when we had the opportunity to convert to PayCard business back in November from the Skylight platform to the NetSpend Austin platform, we took that opportunity to more align the PayCard overdraft program with the GPR overdraft program that existed on the go-to platform.", "Things like grace periods and things like that we wanted to get aligned and as a result of that alignment, and getting them together on one platform, we made some decisions that will cost us some short term revenue on overdraft. So that's the only reason.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay, understood. That's very helpful explanation. Thank you, guys, and all the best.", "M. Troy Woods", "Thank you, Ashwin.", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "Thank you. I want to take just a few minutes and try to close this out and do a housekeeping at the same time. As we continue to review our operating plans for the remaining three quarters against the current consensus for those same periods and as evidenced by the day two, we see the need to reset the street\u2019s quarterly expectations somewhat.", "So all along, we have indicated our guidance of $1.90 to $1.93 was certainly second half weighted and it's a fairly substantially more backend loaded than most of you have apparently built into your models.", "Hopefully, we've cleared up some of that today. We are not going to provide quarterly guidance and we won't be as transparent as we can and felt the need to may be just provide a little more clarity regarding the remainder of the year, particularly the third and fourth quarter. I hope that's a little bit helpful.", "As you\u2019ve heard, we continue to win in the marketplace. Our cash flow was stronger than ever. Got 90-plus million accounts in the pipeline. It's the biggest pipeline we've very had in our history. All that is scheduled for the third and, really, the third quarter and you just heard about Virgin Money, Western Union and Paychex.", "Those are all I think will be big deals for us, big wins. As Troy said, we expect these conversions to be on time and happen with quality. We've completed the total rewrite of our merchant accounting system. It's alive, it's doing well and the conversion is complete.", "The surround project on only issuing side of the business is on target and I think is a long term game changer to a lot of -- in a lot of ways. We'll probably talk more about that as time goes by.", "Synergies and cross-selling relationships are taking hold with NetSpend as we expected. And really in an economy that's experiencing a weak rebound, we are doing what is necessary to ensure our continued success. We have tried today to clarify and reaffirm our annual guidance.", "We are well positioned for continue to move forward with our growth strategies. So we really do appreciate your interest and participation on this call today and remember Shawn Roberts and Investor Relations is here to serve your need. So please don't hesitate to call him with any follow-up questions that you might have. And with that, we'll close the first quarter call down.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the TSYS Conference Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Shawn Roberts, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Roberts, you may begin.", "Shawn Roberts", "", "Thank you, Shinelle and welcome, everyone. On the call today, our Chairman and CEO, Phil Tomlinson will begin with his opening remarks. Our COO, Troy Woods, who will provide business highlights on our four segments. And then, turn it over to our CFO, Paul Todd, who is going to review our consolidated financials. And as usual after that we will open it up for Q&A.", "I would like to now call your attention to the fact that we'll be making some forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS' actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in TSYS' reports filed with the SEC.", "At this time, I would like to introduce TSYS' CEO, Phil Tomlinson.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "", "Thank you, Shawn and good evening everybody. We have been on our best behavior tonight because one our directors is here, Bill Isaac, who I\u2019m sure a lot of you know. We\u2019re thrilled that Bill was here with us and Bill we\u2019re going to try and make us proud so, bear with us. ", "I just want to take a few moments and make a comment or two regarding the June 23 press release announcing my outcome and retirement here at the end of the month. At this transition, really as a result of a carefully developed long-term succession planning process and we believe the passing of the torch has been and will be seamless the fact that you all know we\u2019re uncomfortable with Troy makes that even easier for us.", "I\u2019ve been talking to friends and families since the announcement, realized several things first over my tenure as CEO of \u2013 lot of very bright sale and buy-side analyst and investors. They have been very, very instrumental to our long-term market success. And I appreciate that very much, fortunately you have had the opportunity to Internet, with most all of you in many different venues and I have to say, I\u2019ve enjoyed every minute of it. I\u2019ll cherish the relationships that you have with our company and trust all of you will continue to see TSS as a good company that you want to own. Second, as I start thinking about my potential retirement a couple of years ago, you always find out that there is always is a few things that you want to do or that you have a bucket list of a few issues. And the first thing was I want to try to get TSS back to a growth story through new client wins and total revenue growth, developing and bringing new products to market faster and better and building a stronger and more skilled acquisition capability and I think we\u2019ve done all of those things.", "Also as I have talked to many of you, you know it was important to me personally to do everything possible to get the BoA business back, the Bank of America business back to TSS, it was a heartbreaker in 2005 when they left and that\u2019s a relationship that we are incredibly proud of, so I\u2019m very happy about that. And certainly maybe and no doubt about it, maybe the most important is to increase shareholder return in a meaningful way.", "I\u2019m thrilled that we have a very skilled management team and a passionate smart TSS team and they have made all of this possible and I think as you go see a lot more of it you have not dreamed of. Thank you all of you for your support. I would like to again thank the entire TSS team for theirs. I\u2019m confident in Troy\u2019s ability to lead TSS as our new CEO and also I\u2019m thrilled that Paul Todd is our new CFO and trust that you support them and listen to them as you have me over the years.", "I told you several years ago that the story of Sunday afternoon, dinner when my mother would come around to me and my three brothers and tell us the hold on to your fork and when she said that we knew that we had some good dessert coming, some pie or cake or something and so we always knew there is something big and better was coming along. And so I\u2019m telling you today again to hold on to your fork, because I truly believe that best of TSS is yet to come. So with that thank you and now I would like to turn the call over to Troy Woods for more color about our second quarter.", "M. Troy Woods", "Thank you, Phil. I appreciate very much for your very kind and thoughtful comments about me and the team and I would be absolutely total remised if I did not take this opportunity to thank Phil for his extraordinary leadership as well as his vision and passion for TSS. As Phil indicated he officially retires July 31 as CEO and what many of you may not realize is July 31 will also be his 40th anniversary with this company. And it would truly be impossible to calculate or quantify the positive impact Phil has had during his career on TSS, our team members and clients around the world. We are truly blessed to have had his leadership during some of our most challenging and exciting growth periods and I know we will benefit from his contribution far into the future.", "So Phil all the best to you and your family and may the win continue to be at your back. We will miss you. ", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Thank you.", "M. Troy Woods", "We will miss you. Just as we have seen with the transition of our CFO responsibilities from Jim Lipham to Paul Todd I predict the transition of midst and executive responsibilities from Dan Henry to care us and CEO responsibilities from Phil to me will also be seamless. And this all made possible because of 10,000 plus team members with a passion for our customers, the business, and a drive to win which differentiate us in the marketplace. These team members truly do make it all happen.", "Now let me quickly review some of the highlights for the second quarter as it was an incredibly busy and productive one. Consolidated total revenues were up 30.4% to $602 million. Our first time ever over $600 million on a quarter, adjusted EPS was up 19.8% to $0.45 per share. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 24.94% an increase of 357 basis points, over last quarter.", "During the quarter we repurchased 3.7 million shares of our stock for a total spend of $115.7 billion. We completed the exit of our Japanese businesses which included the divestitures of our issuer processing business and our 54% stake in GP net. We achieved the highest number of accounts on file on our history, for the North America and International segments. We also say transaction volume records in the North America and International segments as well as our SCS business and our merchant segment.", "As always nice to be recognized for your hard work and dedicated service, and we were fortunate we recognized in the second quarter for several awards and recognitions. Earlier this quarter, we were honored by Visa for Superior Service Quality in the area of issuer processor our authorizations, receiving two quality performance awards. Tonight in Washington D.C., we are receiving the Financial Services Roundtable 2013, corporate social responsibility leadership award.", "I might add the TSYS is the only payments company being recognized by the financial services roundtable. Both are great recognitions and we are proud and honored to have been recognized. And finally, and probably most importantly all four segments expanded their adjusted operating margin sequentially from the first quarter as well as TSYS on a consolidated basis.", "Now I\u2019d like to turn your attention to each of our four reporting segments for additional color on their respective performance for the second quarter. I\u2019ll begin these reviews with the North America segment which begins on Slide 6. The North America segment produced year-over-year quarter revenue growth of 8.7% for a total of $233.2 million, this is the second largest year-over-year quarter increase in five years only surpassed our last quarters 9.1% increase.", "The 8.7% revenue growth for the quarter was primarily result of higher transaction and account file volumes. But we also experienced increases in revenue from fees and services associated with data retention, messaging, loyalty processing redemption and rebates, managed services and fraud related services. This quarterly growth rate also includes the grow-over of the Chase licensed revenue which anniversaried the beginning of this quarter. The North America adjusted operating margin was 36.3% a 310 basis points sequential improvement over the first quarter.", "On the business development front, we signed new agreements in the community and regional bank space with Nicole bank and People\u2019s Bank of Alabama. As well as extended contracts with Barclays Bank and First-Citizens Bank & Trust.", "On the conversion front during the quarter, we converted approximately 5 million accounts made up of existing client portfolio acquisitions and that brings our last 12 months converted accounts to approximately 17 million.", "As we stated last quarter, we have 91 million accounts scheduled for conversion in the third quarter. A tremendous amount of thesis and client work is underway as we diligently move toward these conversions. We do expect decisions around final conversion dates to be completed soon and these decisions could affect the current conversion schedules. Leave our client sensitivity around providing specific conversion dates we will no longer provide specific conversion dates for any of our converting customers.", "So based on where we are in these processes and what we know at this time our corporate guidance remains unchanged. We are also guiding our revenue growth for the North America segment to be in the 8% to 10% range for the year and adjusted operating margin for the year to be in the 34% to 36% range. We are continually encouraged with the robust account and volume growth of the North America segment.", "The phase of credit card direct mail offers in the United States was up 7% last quarter to $992 million and the recent JP Morgan Chase and Cap One card growth announcements were also encouraging data points for the sector. All in all, it was another very good quarter for the North America segment.", "I would now like to review the international segment on slides 8 and 9. Last quarter I mentioned that the first quarter was a very difficult comparison quarter with the number of moving parts. I am pleased to report that the second quarter results are much better and reflect the continued focus on positioning the segment for sustainable revenue and profit growth.", "Revenues for the quarter were $84.7 million, about 10.6% over the second quarter of 2013. Again, just as in the first quarter revenues were positively affected by movements and the exchange rate. For the second quarter this amounted to $6.7 million. On a constant currency basis overall revenues for the quarter were up 1.8%.", "Our top line growth profile continues to be adversely affected as we close lower margin businesses. Also during the quarter we experienced lower client project revenue as our customers have delayed some projects to later in the year. However, we did note an uptick in new project revenue in June and we believe this trend will continue for the remainder of the year.", "Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $11.7 million, resulting in a 13.9% adjusted operating margin compared to 10% for the same quarter last year. We anticipate the margin will continue to expand through the remainder of the year as we drive additional efficiencies across the segment and we also remain confident in reaching our margin improvement build for 2015.", "Our account growth for the quarter was primarily driven by our commercial, single use commercial and debit accounts as we continue to board new customers on to the TSS platform. Our business development activities are continuing to gain momentum as well. This quarter we supported an international launch for a major commercial product issuer for single use accounts for the travel sector.", "We are currently working on three conversions and three program launches that will deliver approximately 3 million new consumer and commercial accounts over the next 24-months. We continued to win in the marketplace and retain clients against tough competition as evidenced by a newly signed managed services agreement to support a new client in the UK.", "And finally, a new letter of intent was received this quarter to process for a major new high street retail bank brand, that includes credit and debit card processing as well as back office managed services.", "Our review of the merchant segment begins on slide 10, the merchant segment revenues were $108.3 million, down 4.1% for the quarter compared to the second quarter of 2013. Well, we are very pleased with the growth performance from our direct CPay joint venture and ProPay businesses, our growth from our legacy TSYS Merchant Solutions Group was less than expected for the quarter.", "In spite of setting a record this quarter for SBS sales volume, we were not able to translate this volume growth into comparable revenue growth. Several factors contributed to the sluggish direct TMS revenue growth. One, the projected organic growth rate for our national managed account portfolio is running below expectations. Two, the number of net merchant locations added are also running below expectations. And three, there were a few one time challenges on the months subsequent to our back end conversion, which has negatively impacted revenue. These areas have clearly presented some headwinds for our direct business and we are aggressively addressing each one of them.", "And the area of new business development for our direct business, during the quarter we signed three new large national accounts and two large notable healthcare system providers, which will further expand our reach into the healthcare sector.", "We also signed over 30 new value added resellers, financial institutions and referral partners, which will act as a feeder source for new merchant leads down the road. Now, some commentary on our indirect business, even though our indirect business has exceeded plan for the two straight quarters, it will continue to be a full on the segments overall revenue growth profile, the reasons we have addressed in previous quarters.", "For example, last quarter I indicated that clients would probably pay us approximately 35% less in 2014 than they paid us in 2013. However, we now believe that number will be closer to 50% less. As we have stated previously, the indirect business remains critical to the long-term success of the merchant segment and to TSYS due to the economies of scale the strong cash flow and the expanded capability set offered to both our indirect and direct lines of businesses.", "During the quarter, we were able to expand our merchant segments operating margins to 30.4% versus 28.8% in the first quarter the 160 basis points improvement. Past January we guided at the merchant segment revenue would be down 1%, 2% for the full-year.", "For the first half of 2014 the direct and indirect businesses have performed in opposite directions from our initial expectation, due to these movements, a mix of our business and for reasons I addressed earlier and as we shared with you at our Analyst Day meeting in May. We still expect the segments overall revenue will be down and for single-digits for the full-year over 2013. We still expect to meet our guidance range for operating margin of 31% to 33%. We will continue to aggressively address our TMS Direct business, as we remain keenly focused on organic growth, selective M&A opportunities prudent expense control.", "And finally, our NetSpend segment review begins on Slide 12. NetSpend revenue for the quarter was $116.8 million up 11.4% over the second quarter of last year. The decrease in revenue from the first quarter to the second quarter is typical coming out of our tax season and you can see the same type drop off from the first quarter of 2013 to the second quarter of 2013. And even though revenue declines in the second quarter versus the first quarter we were able to increase our margin quarter-over-quarter.", "Last quarter I mentioned that we were working on two very important initiatives that could have significant meaningful impact on our customer satisfaction and should also resulted in increasing the lifetime of our accounts and ultimately drive higher lifetime value. As a reminder these two initiatives are the overdraft platform migration and the shift from pay-as-you-go plans to the monthly fee plan.", "We are beginning to see a leveling off and the shift from pay-as-you-go customers to our monthly fee plan to a more normal rate versus the accelerated rate we saw in late 2013 and earlier this year. For example the negative revenue impact associated with the shift declined more than 50% from the first quarter to the second quarter. This leveling of coupled with the implementation of new business previously announced, we\u2019ll result an improved revenue growth metrics in the third and fourth quarters.", "During the second quarter we added 2000 retail locations and over 80 PayCard clients bringing us to a total of 1980 trusted companies who distribute our PayCard\u2019s to their employees. We are currently operationally focused on the launch of Western Union which is scheduled for later this quarter. And we also launched the Paychex PayCard program approximately three weeks ago and its clients are already paying their employees on our cards.", "I think it is also important to note that we have already received well over 600 leads through the PayChex channel and we believe this will be a great source of new PayCard accounts in the future. We are also pleased to announce that the Brink's Company a global leader and secure logistics and respected brand to mitigate to all as partnered with NetSpend on a general purpose reloadable card it will began offering under the Brink's brand.", "This endorsement is a big win for consumer payments and in particular prepaid for brand like Brink's that is enormous with trust and security. This Brink's brand and GPR card is an addition to the Brink's money payroll card that we launched last year. While the ramp-up of all of these new initiatives does require some additional upfront investments, we are still expecting our adjusted operating margin to be in the high-20s to low-30s for the year.", "Prepaid customers continue to be very sawy consumers and they look for established trusted brands that they know would deliver the futures, experience and value they are looking for. And no one in the business can match our breadth and depth of trusted brands. ", "Trusted brands, a wealth of innovative features, preplan options, convenient places to buy and reload. It all adds up to making ours the card of choice for millions and counting, giving our cardholders the freedom to choose how, when and where they buy.", "Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to our CFO, Paul Todd for more in-depth financial review of the second quarter financials. Paul.", "Paul M. Todd", "Thank you, Troy. Before I dig into the consolidated operating results for the quarter, I want to highlight several things as it relates to our performance and achieving our strategic goals. First as Troy has reviewed with the segmented results for the quarter, I want to again reiterate that we have been on a transformational journey that TSS over the last several years to being a diversified payments company.", "And as part of this journey, our four segments operate strategically in different markets with different growth profiles, margins, opportunities and challenges and produce different, but complimentary strategic and economic benefits to us on a consolidated basis. This quarter and the remainder of this year highlight this fact as 2014 has a lot of moving parts on a segment basis that\u2019s somewhat balanced out on a consolidated basis.", "Also its important to point out that each of our segments results for the quarter delivered against their own key segment strategic goals, first on the North America side the $18.7 million in quarterly revenue growth from last years second quarter was good progress toward our strategic goal of being the number one global provider of credit card issuer processing solutions. The work done during the quarter on the conversion pipeline also continues to deliver against that strategic goal.", "Second, on the international side. During the second quarter we made considerable progress against our strategic goal of increasing international segment margins to the mid-teen. Third on the merchant segment, while we were not as successful as we would have liked in making significant progress in becoming a top ten global acquirer, we did continue work on strengthening our organic growth plans and we believe that strategic benefits of completing the back end conversion, while impacting our short term results will pay longer-term future benefits as we move toward achieving our strategic goal in the future, we will continue to refine our organic plans and look to make complimentary acquisitions in our merchant segment on a go forward basis to achieve our strategic goal in this segment.", "And finally in our NetSpend segment are a 11.4% quarterly revenue growth and the recently announced new business signings of PayChex, Western Union and Brink\u2019s made significant progress in delivering against our strategic goal of becoming the number one U.S. provider of branded prepaid solutions. While our strategic goals are important on a segment basis, they are equally as important on a collective basis as they fuel our consolidated growth and create a unique people centered payments platform and company that is unlike any other in the industry.", "Now let me dive into the numbers starting on Slide 15. As we stated in our release, we are pleased with our results for the quarter with revenues before reimbursable up 34.2% or a $137.1 million for the quarter versus the second quarter of 2013. NetSpend contributed most of that with a $116.8 million in revenue for the quarter while North America had another outstanding quarter of 8.7% and our international segment was also up over the second quarter of last year coming in at 10.6% reported growth or 1.8% on a constant currency basis.", "Total revenues were up a $140.2 million or 30.4% to $602 million and as Troy stated earlier, it\u2019s the highest quarter of revenue in the company\u2019s history. Adjusted EBITDA was a $170.9 million up 22% over last year for the quarter, bringing the year-to-date growth and adjusted EBITDA to 21.6% over last year. This year-to-date adjusted EBITDA excludes $17.6 million of stock-based comp and $2.4 million of M&A expenses related to NetSpend.", "Finally, adjusted EPS from continuing operations was up 19.8% for the quarter to $0.45 compared with $0.37 for the same quarter last year. In order to avoid any confusion between liquidity and profitability measures we will use the term adjusted EPS as a profitability measure going forward instead of the adjusted cash EPS that we either use previously.", "Turning to page 16, our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 24.9%, up 357 basis points on a sequential quarter basis and driving us to a 23.2% adjusted operating margin year-to-date as shown on slide 17. We have seen some margin pressures in some of our businesses in the first half of the year, we believe the margins in the second half will improve on a consolidated level. And as we said on our last call, we still expect the adjusted operating margin on a consolidated basis to be in the range of 25% to 27% on a full year basis.", "Also recall that our segments report their results on an adjusted segment operating income basis, which excludes amortization of acquisition intangibles, NetSpend M&A expenses, and corporate admin which includes stock-based compensation.", "And slide 16 and 17 provide a bridge between the adjusted segment operating income for each of our segments and our consolidated adjusted operating income.", "On slide 18, we provided a roll forward of our cash balance beginning with the $307 million from last quarter and ending with $251 million for this quarter with our two largest outflows being our share repurchases of $115.7 million and our CapEx of $59 million up which about 40% as related to property and equipment, 37% related to conversion activity and the remaining 23% being related to both internally developed and license software and we ended the quarter with a strong cash position up $251 million.", "On cash flow year-to-date, our free cash flow was $133.7 million, up $54.9 million or 69.6%. Free cash flow was negatively impacted by $42 million resulting from our Japan exit. And as we stated in our last call, we continue to expect ongoing free cash flow to be in the range of $35 million to $37 million a month, and excluding the one time $42 million negative Japan exit impact on an annual basis, free cash flow is expected to be in the range up $420 million to $444 million a year. We also do not expect any change to our previously stated CapEx estimate up $200 million to $210 million for the full year.", "Speaking of cash, while we remain optimistic about the growth opportunities of our businesses, we are also fully committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders and as we mentioned at our Analyst Day in May, and as Troy mentioned earlier, we purchased 3.7 million shares of our stock in the quarter at an average price of $31.26 for total cost of $115.7 million leaving 8.3 million shares remaining under our current plan.", "We will evaluate opportunities in the second half of 2014, and could resume buyback activity in an opportunistic way at anytime. As it relates to shares at the end of June we had $185.6 million of common shares outstanding and the average basic weighted shares outstanding with a $186.4 million on a quarter to-date basis or a $187.1 million on a year to-date basis. As it relates to leverage we are comfortable with our overall current debt level and our strategy to use our capital remains the same.", "We scheduled debt reduction, dividends and a balanced approach to acquisition and buybacks as use of our capital going forward. On taxes we maintain our estimated 2014 tax rate to be in the 34% to 35% range and finally as Troy mentioned earlier our full year consolidated guidance remains unchanged.", "And with that we will open it for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question is from David Togut with Evercore. Please go ahead with your question.", "David Togut \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.", "", "Thank you congratulations Phil on your retirement and great success that TSS had on to your watch.", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "Thank you, David.", "David Togut \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.", "If I could just dig in a little bit to the NetSpend results. Troy you highlighted some of the business model changes that has contributed to the slowdown in revenue growth just perhaps flush out a comment you made in the call can you address whether the revenue that NetSpend has now bottomed out at 11% and in connection with that what do you think is a sustainable growth rate for the business, with the new business model that you are pursuing?", "M. Troy Woods", "Thank you David. Yes couple of comments to that as it relates to the rest of this year, yes it has bottomed out and you can expect to see is that I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks at the third quarter and the fourth quarter you will see elevated growth metrics for NetSpend. And also mentioned with respect to the shift and play as you go to monthly plan we saw a significant improvement from the first quarter to the second quarter with that shift being 50% less. So, really beyond 2014 David obviously we are not going to get into the growth profile beyond that of what we have said in the past and we certainly still stand behind it that NetSpend is absolutely a double digit top line growth company for the foreseeable future.", "David Togut \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.", "Got it. And just shifting over the merchant business you update us on unit pricing trends that you are seeing both in the direct and the indirect business on a year-over-year basis?", "M. Troy Woods", "", "Yes, David a couple of points there we\u2019ve talked about that some in the past as well as the shift in going from bundle to unbundle on the couple really good point to talk about really one as it has been the case for the past several quarter the actual per unit pricing if you will for the direct business is basically unchanged there is really not a penny difference per trend between this time last year and this year. Now the mix is changed as we\u2019ve talked about before with more unbundle business versus bundle business. But the good news is we talked coming out of the fourth quarter about some projects and initiatives that we\u2019re initiating to try to get our arms around slowing that shift and we have seen a significant change in new business that we are signing up, we\u2019ve seen about 12 basis points shift in new business that we\u2019re signing up that are now bundled versus where it was towards the end of 2013. And as it relates to our plan if you will, or our expectations, we are not seeing any degradation beyond what we planned for 2014 at this moment for the bundled to unbundled shift.", "David Togut \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.", "Quick final question from me, could you discuss any changes you intend to make as you become CEO of TSS?", "M. Troy Woods", "Well, I\u2019m still President and COO and there will certainly be plenty of time to address that David and I appreciate that. I will share this with you at 25,000 feet, David, and I told this to our executive leadership and I told this to the board that if the board was looking for someone to turn this company upside down to change all of a strategic direction of this company and to change the culture of this company that may get the wrong guy. So we\u2019ll make tweaks and changes, there will certainly be some changes along the way. But overall, that\u2019s probably the best way to sum it up today.", "David Togut \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.", "Congratulations on your promotion, Troy.", "M. Troy Woods", "Thank you, David.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Glenn Fodor with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead with your question.", "Glenn T. Fodor \u2013 Autonomous Research US LP", "Thanks for taking my question, and Phil, definitely, congratulations. I\u2019ve pilot you guys for a long time, so good to see you are finally taking a much deserved break, and Troy congratulations to you. Paul, just on share buybacks, I mean you bought $3.7 million as of the Investor Day I believe that was account, none after that, much of the resources, because of blackout restrictions, but it doesn\u2019t sound like you did anymore after June 30. Sorry, if I missed the texture, but could you just explain a little more on the pattern that we\u2019re seeing on \u2013 why you\u2019re active to a certain point and held off after that?", "Paul M. Todd", "Yes, Glenn, thanks for the question. I think there is no way to categorize any kind of a pattern as we\u2019ve approached stock buybacks in the past, we look at this as it relates to acquisition opportunities and kind of balancing the opportunities set from an acquisition standpoint, and also balancing that against the buyback scenarios. And so we make decisions on those kind of opportunistic situations, and so there is no way to kind of have a linear description of exactly, why one period we did one thing, and why one period we did another thing and we\u2019re going \u2013 as I said, we\u2019re going to constantly evaluate the buyback opportunities in the second half of the year, but those are constantly being kind of balances, we\u2019re looking at acquisitions. So a lot of times what we\u2019ll do is not evident to the public, because we\u2019re not seeing what we\u2019re doing from an acquisition evaluation standpoint. So I think that would be kind of the commentary around that one.", "Glenn T. Fodor \u2013 Autonomous Research US LP", "Okay, thank you. And then Troy, on prepaid, last quarter, you guys made some comments that you are expecting some type of regulatory changes at some point and then we\u2019re all waiting for something that handed down. But it sounds like it\u2019s going to surround disclosures and fine print and nothing too egregious on the industry. But number one, would you concur with that assessment? And number two, if that is the case, is there \u2013 if you had to make any sort of adjustments to the model or any of your packaging on such, any material investment costs that we should be thinking about? Again, within reason of the possible scenarios? Thanks. ", "M. Troy Woods", "", "Sure, Glenn. I think what I have said in the past it\u2019s not so much that we\u2019re expecting regulatory changes, what we\u2019re expecting is that the CFPB and now they have come out and proactively said that they\u2019re going to address, overdrafts and prepaid. Really to go beyond that, Glenn it would be difficult when you talk about what kind of investment we might need to take to change systems we don\u2019t know what it is. Obviously, we have an overdraft program at that prepaid if you will know, we had it for years both from the PayCard and the GPR side. We do all things that are required of us to do and then some. And so I think we\u2019ll just have to see what comes out of the CFPB later this year and as I understand it will have some relatively reasonable period of time to comment on that as well everybody else and probably only get that time where we get some sense of whatever they say and if it sticks what would be required at TSS, NetSpend to go make those proposed changes.", "Glenn T. Fodor \u2013 Autonomous Research US LP", "", "Thanks, Troy. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "", "Your next question is from George Mihalos with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.", "Georgios Mihalos \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Great, thanks for taking my question and let me add my congratulations to you both Phil and Troy. Wanted to start off on the merchant side just as it relates to the direct revenue growth. Should we be thinking of a return in direct revenues to sort of the mid-single digit range? Something more like a 4% you posted in the first quarter over the back half of the year, or will take longer?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "", "George, the short answer is going to take longer. It will be higher than the second quarter and it will be better in the third quarter. But, it's not going to get back to that number at least for the next two quarters.", "Georgios Mihalos \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. And then maybe just shifting gears to be the North American operation which continues to outperform. Looking at the margin profile the outlook for 34% to 36% for the full year I think you are all ready at about 35% over the first half of the year if I\u2019m not mistaken your margin should go up over the back half of the year is there your reason why you won\u2019t do better than the 36% or you just sort of being conservative there.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "", "Well, you are right. You make a good observation. Obviously, you know where we\u2019re here today as I indicated in some of my opening comments George we\u2019re expecting some decision soon around so many of these conversions we have stacked up for the third quarter and I think just knowing where we\u2019re today and knowing where those conversions stand, we certainly stand behind the 34% to 36% and what we\u2019ve said and in the past that you can expect for the most part that the third and fourth quarter will be a little bit higher probably than that range.", "", "George Mihalos \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. That's helpful. Just ask question from me. I know in the past, you guys had a slot in your presentations of sort of a broke out for us what the impact on the business has been from pricing and from lost business. I was wondering if you guys could update that at all for us, here, in the second quarter. Thank you.", "Paul M. Todd", "It\u2019s relatively unchanged, George, from what we shared with the group earlier in the year. The good news is, both on a price compression standpoint and a lost business standpoint, both of those are about 20 plus percent improvements over 2013. And that\u2019s pretty much what we\u2019ve seen for the first half of this year. So, we\u2019ll track that for the year.", "Georgios Mihalos \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.", "Ashish Sabadra \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG", "", "Hi, this is Ashish Sabadra on behalf of Bryan Keane. Let me also add my congratulations to both you Phil and Troy.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Thank you.", "Ashish Sabadra \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG", "Just wanted to dig further on that merchant acquiring business, the direct business which slowed down. You mentioned that the national managed account portfolio as well as the net merchant locations were running below your expectations. And I was just wondering if you could provide some more color on the reasons for that and have you seen any big disruptive changes in the industry from reticulated processing or change in the distribution model, which is causing those results to be below your expectations?", "M. Troy Woods", "Well, not really on the distribution model at all. We did have a couple of hiccups that I mentioned in the subsequent months from our backend conversion. But, it did cost us some revenue. We also are experiencing in out national account base, a much lower organic growth rate than we had expected and anticipated, going into 2014. But, beyond that, there are no other real reasons behind the slowdown of the national account base. It might have been in the third part Ashish that you asked, but I didn\u2019t catch it, distribution, national accounts and was there another part?", "Ashish Sabadra \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG", "No, just the net merchant location ads, so just on that front.", "M. Troy Woods", "I am sorry, I did not understand.", "Ashish Sabadra \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG", "No, no. I think you\u2019ve answered my question on the direct side of the business, just quickly on the international side, it looks like FX was a good tailwind and it will continue to be a tailwind in the third quarter and the growth rates, once you anniversaried the one time items the growth rate and given all the business development activity looks like we could see a potential improvement in the growth rate. So just going back to your guidance, sort of low to mid single-digit growth for international, could we see an upside to those numbers or more towards the higher end of that range?", "Paul M. Todd", "I think Ashish, this is Paul. I think that it will be to the higher end of that range, if the currency benefit continues.", "Ashish Sabadra \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay, that\u2019s great. And one final question was on the North American segment and I understand given the sensitivity around the plant conversion, you don\u2019t want to comment on the exact month. But given where you are in the process, is there any reason to believe, obviously pending the client decision, but if there any reason to believe that there could be any change in the schedule?", "Paul M. Todd", "Well, as I indicated earlier Ashish, that when you have got some many accounts lined up for conversion this quarter representing multiple customers. Meaning no go decisions are really in front of us here over the next very short period of time. So I think it\u2019s probably best to leave it at that let\u2019s see how these decisions go. But again based on what we know today, based on the conversations that we have had. We are \u2013 where we have indicated we are. So\u2026", "Ashish Sabadra \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG", "", "Okay. It sounds good. Thanks for the color.", "M. Troy Woods", "", "Sure, thank you.", "Operator", "", "Your next question is from Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.", "Darrin D. Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "Thanks guys. Phil, we are going to miss you at the helm. But Troy, we are looking forward to having you in \u2013 although it feels like you\u2019ve been very, very active for the last couple of years anyway. So congrats to both of you guys.", "M. Troy Woods", "", "Thank you, Darrin.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Thank you, and take it easier, Darrin.", "Darrin D. Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "Will do. All right, let\u2019s just jump in. Look I mean on North America revenue growth, I mean just a little bit of a follow-up to George\u2019s question, I guess, really for North America you are already at the midpoint of 8% to 10% g growth, here. Obviously, you\u2019re adding more business in the second half of the year. And so is there any other reason \u2013 anything just to be clear \u2013 is there and reason why the 8% to 10% is not conservative giving that you are going to be adding new business as you talked about 90 million accounts on file, etcetera. Even of the timing we\u2019re in the fourth quarter, I mean really, 8% to 10% is already where the trend is for the first two quarter, so just want to make sure we\u2019re not missing anything in terms of conservativism here.", "M. Troy Woods", "", "No, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re missing anything Darrin, to be honest with you. Perhaps it maybe a little bit conservative when you look at the first half numbers and again, knowing what we know at the moment, that growth rate will absolutely be on the high-end of that range.", "", "Darrin D. Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "Good, okay. All right, just moving forward now, I guess with respect to the overall margin I guess also, I mean I think at the Investor Day, you had said it would be 34% to 36% for the year, but I think you would said that as these accounts roll on, they are accretive, just to be clear, I mean, it could be accretive to the margin, all right. So, the North America margin would be above 36% in the second half, if you were to get these clients rolled on in time?", "", "M. Troy Woods", "", "Well, there are two pieces to that, Darrin. One is what we have said is that due to all types of activity going on in the third and fourth quarter, multiple accounts, multiple conversions, et cetera, and some anniversaries et cetera, et cetera that the margin for the third and fourth quarter for the North American sector would probably beyond the high-end of that range to each quarter, okay.", "Darrin D. Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "Okay.", "M. Troy Woods", "", "What we\u2019ve also said is that when you look at just say 34% to 36% margin for the segment, what we have said is some of these real big customers coming on board does not produce those kind of margin, so I am not trying to be on the one hand, but does that makes sense, we\u2019ve said before that we\u2019re not bringing our biggest conversion in the history of our business at the exact same range of margins that the North American segment has today.", "Darrin D. Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "All right. I think I understand. I appreciate that. And just lastly on EPS cadence, I mean you talked about obviously \u2013 you\u2019re maintaining your full-year. So besides the potential ramp-up in North America of new clients, just to be clear in terms of listing out a couple of either key things, we should keep in mind. I mean I guess there has been some headwinds in merchant acquiring that will continue to roll off. Anything else that\u2019s really driving the sequential material sequential pickup in the second half of the year, in terms of EPS? Quarterly earnings power that we should just keep in mind that you can remind us?", "Paul M. Todd", "", "Yes, Darrin, this is Paul. I think if you go back to what Troy had given as it related to the specific segments and just kind of follow through that story by segment. I think you kind of get to the added growth there. So it\u2019s not one specific Darrin, I think there is anything being missed. I think it\u2019s just a combination of all of those things kind of by segment and then rollup to a consolidated basis for the added growth there.", "Darrin D. Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "All right. That's helpful, thanks, Paul. And then last thing and I will turn it back to the queue. In the merchant acquired business came up a couple of times because of the growth rate, but you are seeing across the industry a lot of emphasis on different types of acquisitions and integrated POS and other types of specialty acquisitions in the space. Is there anything really out there that you think make sense that's beyond just traditional plain, vanilla portfolios to acquire \u2013 merchant acquiring? Are there still good properties out there that you think make sense from a specialty either integrated high power strategy or anything else that we should be looking out for?", "Paul M. Todd", "", "Darrin there are still some properties and assets out there, they are attractive to us and the spaces that we have and interesting which is primarily as we talked about the empowers and e-commerce, but as you know and we all know those assets are beginning to dwindle both domestically and internationally, but there are still a few that it have our attention. ", "Darrin D. Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, all right guys. Thanks very much.", "Paul M. Todd", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Brett Huff, Stephens Incorporated. Please go ahead with your question.", "Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "Good evening and congrats to all three of you on the changes. We are looking forward to working with you more as the CEO, Troy and you as CFO, Paul and Phil, we'll miss you.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Thank you, Brett.", "Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "Couple of quick follow-up questions, on the back end merchant transition that you talked about can you just \u2013 what was sort of the hiccup that you were talking about A and B what kind of impact that have on the 1% kind of went from 4% to 1% growth, how much \u2013 is anything can we attribute, what percent and what kind of checking \u2013 change specifically to the back end sort of hiccup?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, I would rather not get into the details of what that was Brett, it was significant amount to drop down that just under 1% growth for the direct based on the expectations that we had for that segment, as to what they were again I don\u2019t want to get into those details either they were just when you think about backend processing and think about the things that one needs to do around certain processing and interchange and processing of rejects and chargebacks in those kind of things. We had some hiccups and they are behind us, they are corrected, but on a portfolio of that size it affects our revenue for the quarter.", "As I said earlier we are aggressively addressing all of those short comings if you will this particularly one is behind us, so that some of the challenges we had coming out of the backend conversion, but we still need to address as I said earlier that the large merchant growth with the lack there are and some of the other issues we have in the direct segment. Almost all are contained within our legacy TNS direct business.", "Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "Great, that\u2019s helpful. And then on free cash flow seasonality it seems like the free cash flow is little bit lower than we expected this quarter. I think Paul you called out one item related to the JV exiting I think it was a $40 million deal was that the main reason why we had some negative seasonality?", "Paul M. Todd", "It is, and that\u2019s the main driver there and that\u2019s why called it out and it\u2019s just a one time kind of related to the discontinued ops of Japan.", "Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "Okay, and then last question just on renewals I know we are really focused on getting the new portfolios of card issuing in, is there anything we need to think about kind of vis-\u00e0-vis the pricing question it was asked earlier or do we need to think about any maybe second half as we look into 2015 any big renewals that we need to think about whether might be some negotiations going on that that we need to pay attention to?", "Paul M. Todd", "Not really Brett, we had two very large North American customers that we renewed early in the year which were baked into our forecast for the year. So, those are behind us. There are really no more than one or two in each of our segments for the most part, that are under some type negotiations and whatever they are, they are already baked into our guidance and our numbers.", "Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "", "The renewals does it get even easier once you get into 2015 and all or is there any kind of trend of that, or is it just kind of we take it as it comes.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, when you look at \u2013 yes there are two ways to really look at Brett one is just clearly when does a contract expire. And clearly we have all of that laid out by segment as you might expect. Second part of that that was, they don\u2019t always run linear, certain things go on. Sometimes we need to be proactive ourselves and renewing a contract maybe 18 to 24 months before it expires to get an extension and sometimes there are reasons with the customer. We would like to do that or would need to do that. So a point is a little bit difficult and just to go out and look at 2015, and say okay we got these three top 20 customers expiring in this segment and 2015. So those are the three you will have it doesn\u2019t always stack up that way, but the big guys if you will \u2013 they\u2019d not address we talk about those last 12 months really. So I don\u2019t have it in front of me, I don\u2019t know of anything of any real significants coming up in 2015.", "Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "Okay, that great. I appreciate your time guys.", "", "Operator", "", "Your next question is from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.", "Jim Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Good evening, thanks for taking my question and congratulations Phil, Troy and Paul. Just a question on North American segment for a second. I just want to confirm that irrespective of whether the conversions happened in the month of August, September, October, that you still expect that you'll get the full 91 million conversions happening by the end of the year, at least. Is that correct?", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Based on what you just said, and based on our early comments, the answer is yes.", "Jim Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Okay, thanks that\u2019s helpful. And then just want to follow up on the international segment for a second, can you just remind us of where you think longer term, you can take the international segment margins beyond this year and what the cadence would be to get you that goal.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Well, what we have stated in the past Jim is really through 2015 and we\u2019ve said is our current margin improvement plan has those on a trajectory of exiting 2015 at 18%. So we pretty much have stopped there for the moment that will be a Herculean effort to Gaylin and his team to get there from what we started on those plan two years ago. And so, we\u2019ll end this year around 14% in our plan as to and 15% in around 18%.", "Jim Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from James Friedman with Susquehanna. Please go ahead with your question.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group", "", "Thank you and let me echo my fairly well comments to Phil and congratulations to Troy and Paul.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Thank you Jamie.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group", "So I wanted to ask also about issuer processing. Troy you had commented on unit economics in some of the businesses. I realize, there is considerable waterfall changes in volumes, but apples-to-apples how would you characterize the current environment in unit economics for issuer processing?", "M. Troy Woods", "", "Jamie, I\u2019m not sure I totally follow that on unit economics, you\u2019re talking about per account on file per transaction et cetera, et cetera.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group", "", "Either of the above Troy, either account on file or I mean I realized there might be a discount because you got a very large issuer, but net of the changes in volume, how would you characterize either on account on file or transaction basis?", "M. Troy Woods", "We\u2019re not seeing much change, when you think of again the three that we\u2019ve been talking about for so long, one of which is already converted back in the early second quarter and keeping in mind what you said about their size. I think the best way to approach that is just look at our margin profile. I don\u2019t think you see a significant degradation in our margin. Last year we did 36.3% margin in 2013 in North America and this year bringing home \u2013 well probably over 100 million for the year, 91 still to go. We\u2019re looking at 34% to 36%. So from that I think you might get deducted for some degradation, but clearly not much to bring home that size to be looking at 34% to 36% or 36.3% last year.", "And I think it is also important to remind you Jamie again, and I know you, know this, about a half the revenue in North America only about half comes from our account on file in the transactions. Then we\u2019ve got about 40% of those transactions were bundled. So you have to think of who we\u2019re bringing on board where they may fall and bundled versus unbundled pricing.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group", "", "Yes. That\u2019s all\u2026", "M. Troy Woods", "", "So, okay, maybe that\u2019s helpful.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group", "", "That is. And then, more qualitative question would be in light of the sort of record activity in that segment, in the year and in the second half, how do you feel that it positions the company competitively going forward for new opportunities going into 2015? I\u2019m sure it\u2019s great to have such a huge referenceable account. Does it create advantages or animosities after you go after that accounts competitors?", "Paul M. Todd", "", "Jamie, this is Paul. Can you repeat which segment specifically you\u2019re talking about?", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group", "", "North America.", "Paul M. Todd", "Staying on the North America, yes. And I think just kind of go back to that question again, I think what you\u2019re saying is after you get a big potential win there, is there any kind of a downward kind of pressure with other competitors in the marketplace. Is that the way you are coming at this?", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group", "I wasn\u2019t sure whether it was downward or upward. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s great to have such a referenceable account. I was trying to figure out if I might create animosity with that customers competitors\u2026", "Paul M. Todd", "I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t think we have quite understood it at first Jamie. I\u2019ll take a stab at that. Clearly we don\u2019t think so. If that was a case it\u2019d be a lot of customers, we would not be processing or when you look at the line up of large bank issuers that we already process for, large issuers that we have and the key to get converted and all the regional banks that we processed for, we dominate the financial institution credit card issuance space. So again I think if that was an issue, we wouldn\u2019t be where we are today. And I think another way to look at it to the second part of it is. Even though, we are extremely proud of which we have and what\u2019s in the queue. There is still 60% of the business just in the segment that you\u2019re talking about Jamie that we don\u2019t have. You know that\u2019s in-house, processed at another third-party provider. I think we\u2019re \u2013 I don\u2019t think \u2013 we are continually encouraged by things that I mentioned earlier about the direct mail offers in the first quarter.", "The commentary, the Capital One and JPMorgan Chase have come out with just in the last two days around their robust sales volume and growth of accounts. So, you know, all ships rise I think in that environment and we should certainly rise with it.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group", "Got it. Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our final question is from Tulu Yunus with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead with your question.", "Tulu Yunus \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "", "Thanks for squeezing me in. Let me add my congrats to all three gentlemen. I wanted to ask a question first accounts on file, momentum in North America. So, even if I strip out the $5 million that were converted in 2Q, you still saw a nice sequential bump from 1Q to 2Q. Can you just remind us excluding conversions what should you see organically typically in terms of accounts on file development here at your existing issuers to sort of typical seasonality what this one expect?", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "", "I'm not sure what that one is Tulu. We are looking at some numbers. Apologize for not having that one right in front of us.", "Tulu Yunus \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Okay. No problem.", "", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "Is that your only question?", "Tulu Yunus \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "That was one and I can follow-up later if you\u2019d like. That\u2019s no issue. And then the other question, Paul, really was on the topic of financial leverage. Just curious on your thoughts. Some have argued in the past that, perhaps, TSYS has been arguably too conservatively leveraged, in terms of its target of around two times. I\u2019m just more curious around your thoughts and whether you had a point now where perhaps in the near future to sort of rethink the balance sheet flexibility of the company?", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "Yes, Tulu, I think if I have said in the prepared remarks that from a philosophical standpoint, the philosophical positioning around leverage is similar, I think if you go back to what we did this time last year and took our leverage up to the kind of high two range and then kind of worked our way down to both growth and do deleveraging to get to the lower two range, which is where we are now. You could certainly for the right strategic opportunity, you can certainly see us make a move like we have made in the past that is indicative of something around that level, but any kind of dramatic change is not what we are expecting.", "Tulu Yunus \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Okay, got it. Given the fact that properties are, as indicated earlier in the call somewhat more limited to be able to flex and bounce on the right opportunity would be is sort of good to hear. All right gentlemen, thank you very much I can follow-up on the seasonality question off-line. Thank you.", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "I think we have an answer to that.", "Tulu Yunus \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Okay, all right.", "", "Phil W. Tomlinson", "It looks like, and again I\u2019m not going to go handicap it too much out there but, North America high single-digits international low, low, high single, low double digits. Would be the\u2026", "Tulu Yunus \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "", "Got it.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "", "Organic account on file growth.", "Tulu Yunus \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "", "Got it. Okay thank you very much.", "Philip W. Tomlinson", "Thank you. All right, we appreciate the call, we hope everybody enjoyed it, everybody knows my phone number, certainly feel free to give me a call later this evening, I\u2019ll be happy to cover anything we didn\u2019t cover or fill over in more detail.

And welcome to the TSYS Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I will now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Shawn Roberts, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Roberts, the floor is yours Sir.", "Shawn Roberts", "Thank you, Mike, and welcome everyone. I know today is an interesting day for an earnings call, a lot of people are probably working remotely and we appreciate everybody that's on the call.", "On the call today, our CEO, Troy Woods will begin with his opening remarks; then our CFO, Paul Todd will provide business highlights on our four segments, and then review our consolidated financials. And then after that we'll open it up for Q&A.", "I'd like to now call your attention to the fact that we'll be making forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS' actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in TSYS's reports filed with the SEC.", "At this time I'd like to introduce TSYS CEO, Troy Woods.", "Troy Woods", "Thank you, Shawn, good evening and Happy New Year. We're all very pleased with our performance for the fourth quarter and for the full year; the teamwork, focus, and coordination were exceptional. Our record setting transactions, authorizations, and volumes all contributed to these incredible results. This metrics aligned with multiple US economic indicators that demonstrate consumer\u2019s assurance sustained fiscal confidence which in turn leads to healthy spending. These trends were directly reflected during this past holiday season where we experienced the greatest number of transactions and authorization in TSYS\u2019 history for aholiday period.", "Holiday authorizations were up 24.8% in North America, 13.4% in international, and 9% in merchant excluding deconverting accounts. Delivering a flawless performance during the busiest shopping season of the year is not an accident. The financial performance and the superb execution of our services are directly attributable to the TSYS team who delivered with perfection and exceeded expectations. Paul will provide additional color on our fourth quarter and yearly results later, but there are a few highlights worthy of calling out.", "Total revenues for the year were up 18.5% to $2.4 billion, and fourth quarter revenue was up 8.9% to $635.1 million. Revenues before reimbursables for 2014 were up 20.2% to $2.2 billion and were up 8.4% to $569.3 million for the fourth quarter. In North America, we have the greatest revenue and the highest number of cargo transactions for the quarter in our history. It also marked our second quarter in a row of double-digit revenue growth. NetSpend also delivered double-digit revenue growth of 14.4% for the quarter, this is the twelfth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth for NetSpend, both segments also produced double-digit revenue growth for the year. Two weeks ago, the NetSpend Brink\u2019s payroll card, and the Paychex payroll card were both winners in the outstanding pay solutions category in the 2015 pay Paybefore awards.", "Moving to the international segment, we continued our history of breaking trends by recording the highest ever levels of transactions and a counseling file for the quarter. Also during the fourth quarter, we were very pleased to have the opportunity to extend our contract with Carrefour in Brazil for five additional years which will now take our great partnership out to 2024. This confidence Carrefour has shown in TSYS reflects the hard work, delivery success and tangible financial results generated from our joint operating model and technology solution. This extension is very positive for both parties and provides an even stronger foundation for future growth and higher value to Carrefour\u2019s customers both in-store, as well as everywhere Visa and MasterCard are accepted.", "Our market leading retail and credit platform also positions us well in the Brazilian markets to offer other traditional in-house providers with an attractive value proposition to have managed and grow their business.", "In the merchant segment, our direct smaller business sales volume increase 10.6% year-over-year, the strongest sales volume growth for all of 2014. Also during the quarter, we announced the hiring of Tom Boyer, a senior executive in the acquiring industry with more than 15 years\u2019 experience to head up our TSYS merchant solutions business. Tom is a proven leader and will provide us with the operational and business development leadership we need to take our direct sales business to the next level.", "On the topic of EMV readiness we are actively engaged with our merchant community to educate and provide them support to ensure they understand the impact of the fast approaching October liability shift deadline. As of this date, approximately 45% of our direct merchants have EMV capable terminals in place. In addition, we are continuing to work with each of our issuing clients to support their initiatives in the move to EMV as well. During last quarters call, I specifically addressed three very important business topics that have received considerable attention are lines without a few updates from these issues at this time.", "First is the Bank of America conversion. I'm pleased to say that the Bank of America conversion project is on target for completion this quarter. Once complete, this will be the largest conversion project in the history of payments. Both teams have done an outstanding job to get us to this point and we look forward to this event occurring this quarter.", "The second topic is the CFPB. During last quarters call, I mentioned that we were expecting the CFPB to publish its long awaited proposed rules on prepaid during the fourth quarter. As you know, these proposed rules were announced on November 13, and subsequently published in the federal register on December 23. Although the proposed rules contain many protections for consumers that we can all agree on, we do not think the proposal to treat overdraft as a line of credit gets it right for our card holders. We have shared an abundance of data with the CFPB which demonstrates that our card holders use overdraft deliberately, and can anticipate and abort fees when they do so because of the consumer friendly protections that we have built into our program.", "During the 90-day comment period provided for by the CFPB which concludes March 23 if not extended, we will focus on two main things; one, we want to ensure that the bureau hears the stories behind the data we have shared with them; and two, we plan to provide our card holders the opportunity to voice directly to the bureau the realities they face and while overdraft works for them when they choose to use it. When the comment period concludes, the CFPB will need sufficient time to review comments and draft final rules before the 12-month implementation period before existing programs begins. While we do not know how much time the CFPB will need to draft the final rules, we do not expect the final rules to be effective for existing programs until at least 2016.", "The third business topic I addressed last quarter was capital allocation. During the fourth quarter we purchased 1.5 million shares of TSYS stock for total spend of $49.6 million. For the full year we repurchased 9.2 million shares for total spend of $165.2 million. The combination of our $165.2 million of stock buybacks and $74.8 million of dividends actually exceeds our new capital allocation target of returning at least 75% of available free cash flow to shareholders. In all of 2014, these repurchases and dividends exceeded 94% of the available free cash flow which we were pleased to return to our shareholders. Based on our expected free cash flow guidance for 2015, less our schedule debt payments and dividends, we could be in a position to deploy approximately $200 million of free cash flow or repurchases assuming no acquisitions.", "Also earlier today, our board approved a new share repurchase plan that authorizes up to 20 million shares for repurchases with no exploration depth. We are very pleased with our capital allocation execution during the quarter and with the board\u2019s action earlier today.", "On the awards and community involvement front in December we were delighted to again receive the Civic 50 Award recognizing TSYS as one of the most community minded companies in The United States. Companies that receive this prestigious award are considered the leaders in committing time, skills, and other resources to improve the quality of life in communities where we do business. Also in December our NetSpend team which handed [ph] the community connects effort performed random acts of kindness across the communities where they operate while also spending a day in our customer shoes learning more about their needs and how our prepaid products impact their daily lives in a positive way. So whether it relates to our business or the greater community, the people of TSYS make the difference touching someone\u2019s lives or business over 44 million times each day.", "As we close the books on a great year, I can say that it has never been more apparent that now is the time for the payments industry to shine, and this is the moment TSYS has been preparing for, for the course of three decades. It's a new era for both, our company and the industry, with the never ending changes in technology and consumer habits, and the disruption of legacy business models, we continue to commit to pursuing smart new strategies for growth. We are confident in our vision, our prospects, and the strategies that gather us. I hope you're sharing our excitement about our company that there is people at the center of everything we do which will fuel our growth and enhance our position of strength.", "I'll now turn it over to Paul Todd who will provide additional detailed financial information and provide our guidance for 2015. Paul?", "Paul Todd", "Thank you, Troy. And now I will review at a high level, each of our segments performance before I cover our consolidated results, and first I will cover the North America segment. And the key headline on the North America segment is one, organic revenue growth.", "Starting on Page 6, you can see that revenues before reimbursables was up 14.5% for the quarter to $255.5 million versus the fourth quarter of last year, and the first time we've seen mid-teen quarterly growth in this segment since 2006. As you can see on the chart, the businesses had positive revenue growth for the last eight quarters and this growth picture is cat stoned [ph] with the 4Q results. As we saw in the third quarter, this mid double-digit increase was driven from broad based growth in our core offerings, as well as our value added product offerings to include increases in fraud services, managed services, data retention, card production, and royalty processing and retention services. The businesses also were able to achieve these levels while increasing sequential quarterly margins by 50 basis points to 39%, and consistent with last year's 4Q margin. For the year, revenues were up to strong 10.9% from 2013 and the segment ended the year with 36.8% adjusted segment operating margin, both of which were higher than our previous expectations.", "Moving to Slide 7 with respect to segment volumes the picture is equally as strong with traditional account on file growth of 16.6%, and transaction volume up almost 20% at 19.8%. The 16.6% increase in traditional accounts on file is now the sixth straight quarter of mid-to-high double-digit growth in this important metric, and this overall account on file in transactional increases coupled with our same client transaction growth of 13% highlights the health and expansion that our issuing client base is experiencing. We couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the performance of this North America segment both on a quarterly and full year basis. The business is positioned well for 2015 as we expect increasing percentage levels of revenue growth in 2015 to the mid-teen range due to the organic growth I just mentioned above, as well as the large conversion activity this year.", "Now let\u2019s move over to our international segment with key headlines margins. Starting on Slide 8, our international segments finished the fourth quarter with $92.9 million of revenue, an increase of 2.5% on a reported basis, but more importantly up 5.7% on a constant currency basis, our second highest quarterly revenue percentage increase in eight quarters. We did had some onetime non-recurring revenue in the fourth quarter as we did in the fourth quarter of 2013 but both collectively were similar size, so the 5.7% recorded increase is largely indicative of the core revenue growth rate of the business. As I said, the headline of this segment is margins and we concluded the year with a 16.1% full year margin.", "Adjusted operating income grew $4.9 million compared to Q4 of 2013 and while the quarterly margin increased to 24.6% or 470 basis points, a more indicative margin read for the business is the yearly margin as we had some 4Q margin help from the onetime related item I mentioned earlier just as we did in the fourth quarter of last year. Q4 is traditionally the segments highest margin quarter and as we've seen in previous year's we expect the full year margin in 2015 to drop from the Q4 levels but I want to emphasize that our 15% overall margin for this business in calendar 2014 puts us on a nice trajectory to our 18% margin goal in 2015.", "Let\u2019s turn to Slide 9 and talk about volumes. The segment continues to deliver positive volume trends and we recorded an all-time high number of transaction and account on file levels in the quarter. The increase again was predominantly driven by debit and commercial card accounts and in Brazil alone we saw an increase of over 21% in both transaction volumes and account on file for the quarter versus the same quarter of last year. I think these revenue, margin, and volume success levels indicate the improved financial strength and strategic positioning of this segment. Troy mentioned earlier about our contract extension in Brazil which dramatically improves our strategic position in this important card market and allows for our business to experience the growth that this market can offer going forward. We also extended relationships with two important European clients and relationships with these institutions.", "While the story for international is clearly about achieving the 18% margin level for 2015, I will point out that we do not expect revenues to growth in this segment of 2015 as we complete our margin expansion work and begin to shift our focus for one, almost exclusively focused on margin expansion to one of revenue growth while maintaining the margin levels we have achieved.", "Now I will allude to the merchant segment starting on Slide 10. With a highlight of this segment for the quarter is continued performance improvement from the first half of the year. As I mentioned on our last call, a potential good indicator of 4Q performance with how the business had performed in the first and second quarters of the year, however, the business performed better in the fourth quarter with revenues before reimbursables contracting 2.4% versus a first half quarterly run rate of contraction of approximately 4.2%. The 29.2% operating margin for the quarter allowed the business to end with a 30.9% margin that was in line with our expectations. Overall the segment continued to be adversely affected by the significant bans run-off during the year but that effect will largely abate for 2015.", "On Slide 11 we're pleased with another strong quarter of double-digit SBS sales growth at 10.6% and it was the highest growth level of quarterly sales volume all year. Our 3% organic growth in direct revenue was in line with our expectations, and as you can see in the last two quarters the contraction in our indirect business is beginning to slow with single-digit declines. We were again pleased with the continued direct organic growth in our differentiated central payment and prepaid business units, and as we've stated in previous calls, we continue to work on improving our results from a growth standpoint in this business and during the quarter we made several notable moves in this direction with the hiring of Tom Boyer as Troy mentioned earlier, the signing of five new integrated POS partners from our recently launched integrated payments offering, the signing of two new clients in our indirect business and the renewal of three existing customers also on the indirect side.", "Also a quick word on Apple Pay, since Apple Pay was announced in September, we have 500 different merchant and developer leads we're working with on supporting Apple Pay and bringing it to their customers. And finally, as we look to 2015, because of the significant run-off of the bands related business in 2014, we expect this segments performance on revenue to show a positive improvement from the contraction of the business incurred in 2014 and we expect a positive growth rate for this segment to be in the low single-digit range for 2015.", "Now I want to discuss the NetSpend performance starting on Slide 12, and the highlight for this segment for the quarter with the increasing revenue growth percentage of 14.4% for the quarter from the 10% to 13% quarterly growth rates in the prior three quarters. 4Q was the highest rate of quarterly revenue growth in the year and it's the first sequential quarter revenue growth rate improvement in eight quarters. We have mentioned in our last call that the revenue growth rate of NetSpend would increase in 4Q and this 440 basis points of sequential quarter improvement shows the improvement we were expecting. This is the twelfth straight consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth for this business and shows that this business continues to be one of the fastest organic growing company in the payments industry. Our quarterly margin of 27.5% was in line with the overall yearly margin of 26.6%.", "And on Page 13, I want to spend a minute on our volumes for the business which also continue to be strong. We saw 21.9% growth in our direct deposit active cards to $1.6 million for the quarter which was the largest quarterly growth rate in this important metric of any quarter in the year and consistent with the quarterly growth rate we saw in this metric in 4Q of last year. We finished the year with over 20 big in GDV up 19% over the prior year. And while our card and volume levels continue to increase, we are constantly focused on expanding our distribution reach by adding more than 5,000 distributing employers and locations in the quarter bringing the current total to more than 85,000. We're pleased with the way NetSpend ended the year and the position it places us going into 2015. Our expectations right now for this business or for revenue growth to be roughly consistent with the revenue growth rate we saw on the business in 2014. However, I do want to call out that we should see some margin in compression in 2015 as we choose to invest in this business that will better position us for long term growth.", "Now I will cover our consolidated financial results starting on Slide 14. As I mentioned we're pleased with our results for the quarter with revenues before reimbursables of 8.4% or $44 million for the quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2013. For the year this increase $369.3 million or 20.2% as a result of both a full year impact of our NetSpend acquisition, coupled with organic growth that I mentioned earlier. Total revenues for the quarter were $635.1 million, an increase of $52 million or 8.9% from fourth quarter of last year and contributes to an 18.5% full year increase from 2013.", "Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $193.7 million, up 7% over the fourth quarter last year contributing to a 14.1% increase on a full year basis for 2014 versus 2013. The full year adjusted EBITDA excludes $30.8 million of stock-based comp, $3.2 million of M&A expenses related to NetSpend. We ended the year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 32.5%, and we anticipate that our adjusted EBITDA margin should expand between 100 basis points to 150 basis points in 2015 from the current levels.", "Finally, adjusted EPS from continuing operations was up 20.8% for the quarter to $0.58 compared with $0.48 for the fourth quarter of 2013. We finished the year with adjusted EPS of $1.96, up 13.2% for the year which was higher than our expectations due to several factors including high organic growth, a lower effective tax rate, and some non-recurring one-time items.", "On the margin front, turning to Page 15, our adjusted margins for the quarter was 27.2%, and we finished the year with an adjusted operating margin of 25.7% as we have seen on Page 16 which was primarily fueled by the better than expected 36.8% margin from our North America segment. We have mentioned on our last call that we expected consolidated operating margin to be in the 25% to 27% range, and the 25.7% falls into that expected range and we expect similar or slightly expanding levels of consolidated margin for 2015.", "Also I want to state that Slide 15 and 16 provide a bridge between the adjusted segment operating income for each of our segments and our consolidated adjusted operating income. We provide this because our segments report their results on an adjusted segment operating income basis which excludes amortization of acquisition intangibles, NetSpend M&A expenses, corporate admin, and stock-based compensation.", "A quick comment on cash turning to Slide 17, we ended the year at $289 million in cash as we saw a $23 million increase from the end of the third quarter. Our largest outflow of cash of $68 million was related to CapEx of which about 30% was related to property and equipment, 33% was related to contract acquisition cost, including conversion activity and signing incentive, with the remaining 37% being related to internally develop and license software.", "On cash flow on Slide 18, our free cash flow for the quarter was $102.7 million resulting in full year free cash flow of $325 million and in line with our previously communicated expectations of $314 million to $334 million. For 2015 we expect our capital expenditures to contract between roughly $50 million to $60 million from 2014 levels, primarily as a result of lower conversion and contract acquisition cost projected in 2015. This reduction in proposed capital expenditures to a range of $175 million to $185 million, along with stronger performance in our businesses will allow for our free cash flow estimate to expand to the $420 million to $440 million for the full year of 2015.", "As it relates to share, we ended the year with a 184.9 million of common shares outstanding with the average basic weighted shares outstanding at 186.2 million. On taxes, we ended the year at effective tax rate of 32% which was a little over a 100 basis points better than we expected and allowed for some of the over performance for the quarter and year related to our expectations, and we believe our estimated tax rate for 2015 to be into 32% to 34% range.", "And speaking of 2015 on Page 19, we highlight our full year consolidated guidance of total revenue growth of 7% to 9%, revenues before reimbursable growth of 8% to 10%, and adjusted EPS from continuing operations of 11% to 13% growth. Obviously this guidance hinges upon some of the assumptions I've already mentioned and the ones mentioned on Page 31 in the presentation.", "Finally, I want to mention some callouts that I think are key takeaways from today. The first callout is on organic growth. The fourth quarter was similar to the third quarter and that we are in that with no acquisitions completed during the quarter it allows for organic growth clarity in our results. When you look at the 14.5% quarterly growth, revenue growth in North America, the 5.7% constant currency revenue growth in international, the 3% direct requiring revenue growth in merchant, and the 14.4% revenue growth in NetSpend, all coming from non-acquisition activity, you see a strong picture of organic revenue growth that played out during the quarter.", "Also three of our four segment saw sequential quarter revenue increases, and while these organic growth trajectories are not likely to continue in the exact same manner for each business going forward, the callout here is that while we are pleased with the overall quarterly growth of 8.9% we are equally pleased with the cost segment delivery of organic growth expansion that our businesses have delivered.", "The second major callout is on margins. Each of our four segment delivered margins that were either in access or generally met our previously communicated expectations for the year. While I specifically called out the progress being made on the international margin front and their pursuit to the 18% level, I want to call out the strong margins across all of the businesses of TSYS platform, and while we are not providing specific segment margin expectations for 2015 beyond the ones I've mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the margin profiles of our segments and the consolidated margin picture, and equally pleased with the expected expanded EBITDA margin levels for 2015.", "And the third and final callout is related to the overall uniqueness that exist at TSYS at the current time. Our North America organic growth, our international margin progress coupled now with a strengthening position in Brazil, our improving segment revenue picture in merchant, and strong mid-teen fourth quarter revenue growth in NetSpend, we are seeing each business deliver unique successes that collectively are making TSYS a stronger company. The results in the fourth quarter and the year allow for us to wrap up 2014 with one of the best quarters of performance in many years across all of our businesses at the same time. We want to thank our unique team members from across the globe who delivered this great performance that allows for our company in 2015 to participate in the payments industry in the most comprehensive way in the history of our company.", "And with that we will open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question we have comes from Darren Power [ph] of Barclays.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thanks guys, nice job on the quarter. Look, I just want to start off with your outlook for 2015. We know that the large conversion you talked about I guess Bank of America is looking to going on in February. Your guidance for top line growth is going for about 7% to 9% and I think Paul, as you just said, one of the great thing to see would be the way you ended the year with an organic growth rate of over 8% for the fourth quarter, that excludes any benefit from this very large conversion you're about to get for the year. So I guess it's normal that looking at your organic growth 7% to 9%, we see 14% growth to North America, we see acceleration to 14% plus in NetSpend. I guess the question is really just how much conservatism is based in for the organic growth guidance when we think about the fact that be it - it's also going to be in top of your fourth quarter run rating so strong for the year.", "Paul Todd", "Darren, this is Paul, I will address the question. I mean, certainly as I said we are clearly pleased with the way we ended on the North America side with the growth that we saw that was higher than we had expected. I will state that some of those growth characteristics that occurred in 2014 that delivered some of that organic growth are non-recurring growth items in 2015 and specifically I'd callout December, the card production revenue that we saw as a result of some of the breaches, there is no way to anticipate that that type of activity would continue on a go-forward basis. We also saw some other services that were on the value-added side that were at higher levels than we anticipate for 2015 and kind of an ongoing basis. So you do have a blending effect a little bit there, on the North America side, I called out obviously the lack of growth on the international side on a constant currency basis, and then certainly on the merchant side, the growth is in the low single digits. So when you kind of look at all that and you put it together obviously you build out a picture that puts us in the ranges that we have provided for.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Alright, just let me clarify that, one follow-up. Is there anything in the fourth quarter when - again, you had about 8% plus organic growth rate that you considered sort of non-recurring? And then, what was FX, what should we consider FX being included in your guidance?", "Paul Todd", "Yes, we certainly have our current expectations around FX build in for the guidance based on the current expectations and what we know kind of, as of right now, certainly things could change throughout the year but our anticipated effects around FX are essentially based in.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And then, I guess it's the final question for me and I'll turn it back to the queue. You're talking now about free cash flow that's actually $420 million to $440 million, that's up to $35 to $37 per month range it talked about being - again, that's sort of the run rate when I guess we have a way coming through buybacks we're now saying $200 million, can you just give us a little color on; A, if your buyback plan is incorporated in your guidance for EPS; and B, potential uses of capital for deals?", "Paul Todd", "So, on the subject of buyback being in the guidance, there is no buyback level in the guidance and so obviously on an acquisition picture there is no way to exactly kind of predict what the time of things look like on the acquisition side and so clearly if there was an acquisition that completed throughout the year that would affect any potential buyback activity.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great. Alright, nice timing guys, thanks.", "Operator", "Next with David Togut of Evercore ISI.", "David Togut", "Thank you, good afternoon.", "Paul Todd", "Hey, David.", "David Togut", "In the North America business can you quantify any revenue contribution you had in the fourth quarter and perhaps for the year as a whole from producing EMV chip cards and to the extent that was material, can you please quantify what you might expect in 2015?", "Troy Woods", "Hi David, Troy. That is not a number we have made public before, I think what we've said on many occasions that clearly we are seeing the EMV ramping up, it ramped up towards the end of 2014. What we've indicated in the past that is really not enough revenue to significantly move the needle is not really material. I will end with that said just to give you perspective on growth, we are probably looking to do at least ten times more EMV plastics in 2015 than we did in 2014. So to give you some magnitude of how it's ramping up, which is had to be mindful of - is that all of that is not additive, most of our customers are choosing to go of dealing with the EMV reissuance at exploration, and so you can't sit back and look at every EMV as an absolute new opportunity. Does that help at all?", "David Togut", "It does, thank you. I guess perhaps just to put a fighter point on your comment, you said you expect a ten-fold increase in EMV plastics production in 2015, at that level is that a material driver of growth in North America?", "Troy Woods", "No, like I said before David, it's tied to it, there is a different revenue tied to it above and beyond what it would have been for regular match stripe. We issued plastic that might have hit the timing in 2015 but it's not the kind of money, it's clearly based on our forecast as Paul shared with you, but it's not a needle moving number.", "David Togut", "Understood. Just shifting gears over the NetSpend, nice to see the acceleration of revenue growth there, to what extent does the new Wal-Mart contract contribute to that?", "Troy Woods", "Well, it clearly was a contributor to some degree, we didn't give all over 4,000 stores totally rolled out until towards the end of the quarter but a lot of things contributed to it for the growth, primarily the items that we had mentioned earlier in the year, Paychex, Brinks, Western Union, and Wal-Mart coming on a little bit later in that timing but all along contributed to the great 14% growth rate for the quarter.", "David Togut", "Your comments Troy, you highlighted your views of the CFPB action, can you quantify for us if the current CFPB proposals go through on late fees, what is that would that have on your revenue and earnings at NetSpend on an annualized basis?", "Troy Woods", "First of all David, it's not late fees, it's overdraft fees, if I understood you correctly. I'll let Paul give in some details but the short answer is we are not quantifying that, we have not shared publicly what revenue we received there by overdraft feature. Paul, you want to add to that?", "Paul Todd", "Yes, sure. David I think one thing I could point you to is back in 2012 on the 10-K of NetSpend before we did the acquisition of NetSpend, in their 10-K they did make a number public that said that 7% of the revenue on the GPR cards was related to overdraft. What's missing out of that 7% is obviously the overdraft for K Cards, you have to add several percentage points to be able to get to kind of a complete picture back in that timeframe and I think the only other thing I guess I would go out is, we have said that this overdraft revenue as a line item has not meet our growth expectations over the last year but outside of that that would be, we would say on that right now.", "David Togut", "Thank you. Just a quick final question if I could sneak one in on merchant. Troy, can you just update us on unit pricing trends in the merchant business both on the direct and indirect side?", "Troy Woods", "Sure David. They are pretty much in line with what we've said the last several quarters from a unit pricing perspective, both our bundle and unbundle pricing on the direct side and holding up actually slight improvement on unit pricing. Indirect - if you take out the continuing negative impact of Bank of America and just go to pure pricing, mark this year, I don't know if you want to add to that, is pretty demonomous [ph].", "David Togut", "I'm thinking if I can continue that overtime with end products of those relationships to offset some of the pricing pressure.", "Troy Woods", "We do have a few renewals that we're working on in the merchant segment that were also baked into our guidance for 2015, so all in all very little change if anything, some slight improvement in the unit pricing for bundle and unbundle on the direct side.", "David Togut", "Understood, thank you very much.", "Troy Woods", "Thank you, David.", "Operator", "Next, Steven Kwok of KBW.", "Steven Kwok", "Alright, thanks for taking my questions. I guess the first question I have was, if you could give a update on the pipeline of new account conversions excluding the Bank of America.", "Troy Woods", "Sure, Steven. We've got around 500,000 or 600,000 accounts I think in the pipeline for international and North America so around a million at this point in time, not counting of course the one you mentioned.", "Steven Kwok", "Got it. And then just going back to NetSpend a little bit, you talked about how the margins are going to be down in 2015, and as a result of investments, how much of that is onetime investments, I mean how should we think about margins in that spend over the longer term?", "Paul Todd", "Steven, this is Paul. I think clearly, we're not expecting over the long term further margin degradation from the levels that we're going to see or are expecting to see in 2015, the investments we're making in 2015 are more infrastructure related investments to allow kind of the growth that we signed up, to be able to facilitate that growth and so we either do support longer term growth, we've got some product related investments specific that we're wanting to make. The whole kind of lifecycle as it relates to some of the new business, there is a little bit of a time lag on some of the start-up programs till you get those to kind of a whole run rate margin and so that has to play its way out. So I think we're seeing a lot of different things happening as it relates to 2015 on that front, and we think that stabilizes in 2015 and shouldn't see more degradation past that.", "Steven Kwok", "And then last question I had was more around data. You talked about that was being a onetime item in international in the fourth quarter, do we know how much that is and then is that expected to repeat again in 2015 given that you have it the last two years?", "Paul Todd", "This is Paul again, I mean we are calling out this specific amount, but I will state that it will not repeat itself and the source of that was different in 2013 than it was in 2014, it's just coincidence actually that there were two one-time items that have kind of similar amounts than the two in the two fourth quarters. So that wouldn\u2019t be something that we would continue on a go-forward basis.", "Steven Kwok", "Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Operator", "George Mahelos [ph], Credit Suisse.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter guys. I want to make sure I have - I'm thinking about the margin growth on that share correctly, I think you guys said a total improvement of 100 basis points to 150 basis points, you called out some segments - does your guidance sort of imply though that at least for North America and/or merchant, that the margins are likely to be down somewhat from what we saw in 2014?", "Paul Todd", "No George, and this is Paul. I think that to be clear, the 100 basis points to 150 basis points was actually on the EBITDA margin, so that was the expansion that we expected to see on the EBITDA margin. I think the comment on the consolidated margin was that we expect basically similar levels, maybe slightly expanding on a consolidated basis and so I obviously made the comment as it relates to our NetSpend specifically around the margin contraction there and I think if you start with the total and work the way back, you probably get to what the margin components look like for the other businesses.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Will there be indicators on the North America margin side between first half and second half given the timing of the large conversion?", "Paul Todd", "I think that clearly the business as you saw in 2014, the margin expanded as we moved along due to the seasonality effects that occur in the North America segment, and so you can expect that kind of necessarily exactly linear to what happened in 2014 but if you look historically that business has driven higher margin in the second half of the year than it has in the first half of the year due to the scale and the seasonality of the way that North America business with the volumes, and how the volumes come in with the first quarter being the lowest.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. But that can be more exaggerated given the timing of the conversion?", "Paul Todd", "I mean clearly we have a size impact here that with the conversion there is going to be some movements due to the size but I think that if you just try to kind of look at a historical basis and use that as a guide, that would be the most helpful guide.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And just last question for me, if you can quantify for us your expectations for growth in the equity and investments line which I think was up 35% in 2014, how you're thinking about that contribution in 2015?", "Paul Todd", "Certainly we saw - as you mentioned some nice pick up on that line and we don't call that out as a specific growth expectation line but I will say generically speaking, we continue to be pleased with the performances that data continues to deliver year-over-year. And so - not specifically calling out any growth from that line there would be growth that would come in there.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Bryan Keane, Deutsche Bank", "Bryan Keane", "Hi guys, just a couple of clarifications. On the international I think Paul you said flat revenue growth, is that just constant currency flat revenue growth or is that all in reported for fiscal year 2015 guys?", "Paul Todd", "That would be constant currency.", "Bryan Keane", "Constant currency, okay. And then just on North America margins and merchant margins, you obviously have left those out, I just - the rational why not guide, I mean you guided everything else, why not guide in those two areas I just want to make sure I understand why?", "Paul Todd", "Well I think obviously if I'm not making a comment, I'm calling not specifically, I think the assumption is that there is not something kind of worthy of calling out as form of change that point. So I called out the ones that I think required some type of comments. I think if you kind of get back to looking at that consolidated margin, then kind of working from there and then using the callouts related to the ones that I did, I think that kinds of time get through a picture that is most helpful.", "Bryan Keane", "Okay, that helps. And then just on looking at my model here, interest income and other income on that line and minority interest, just trying to get an idea of what those numbers will come out for next year for 2015 so we can get to the right EPS number. Thanks so much.", "Paul Todd", "I'd callout anything specifically there that would be worthy of any kind of significant enough change to highlight it. So I think if you used the overall consolidated margin I talked about the overall EBITDA margin and use the tax rate kind of range that provided, I think you can get to the consolidated EPS amount and if there is obviously a differential then it's flowing through there into some way there.", "Bryan Keane", "Okay, that helps, thanks guys.", "Operator", "Next with Mad Lipton [ph], Autonomous Research.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good evening, thanks for taking my question. Nice set of results here. There has been a lot of questions on FX and the guidance, I guess just to kind of get to the heart of it with the current fees down to 10% to 15% in the countries we are exposed. Should we just take out to assume that your guidance right now is inclined 1% to 2% of revenue had been on topline from FX?", "Paul Todd", "Well I don't think we specifically obviously callout in guidance what's implicit but as I said earlier, we're kind of the expectations that we look at right now, they are effectively based in, we'll highlight that. We do have this natural hedge that exists with our expenses and revenues and so the contraction on the revenue side does get muted as it goes to the operating income side with the strengthening dollar. So those would be the comments I would provide on that front.", "Unidentified Analyst", "That's very helpful, thank you. And then, most of the questions are answered but on the 30% transaction growth in North America, very strong, could you just walk us through how the month wound up in the fourth quarter and if that was accelerating or decelerating as the year finished. Thanks.", "Paul Todd", "Well, I think without speaking specifically to months I think generically speaking we saw improving kind of performance in that North America segment, so clearly the seasonality that business links itself as Troy talked about earlier, the high shopping volumes that existed certainly this year was a very robust transactional holiday season for us and so we certainly were pleased with the way things ended up and certainly as I mentioned earlier, pleased with the way we're positioned for next year.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Next we have Brett Huff of Stephens.", "Brett Huff", "Good afternoon Troy, Paul & Shawn.", "Troy Woods", "Hi, Brett.", "Brett Huff", "Couple of questions, just on the North American outlook again for next year, Paul I think I just want to make sure I heard you right, you ended on strong note, 15% overall for the year is little bit lower than that, it's sort of the low to mid-teens as the way we just think about North America next year, is that what you said?", "Paul Todd", "Brett, it was, yes, I think I used those terms and so kind of that low to mid-teen is the right kind of comment that I made there.", "Brett Huff", "Okay. And then the new hire in the merchant segment, it sounds like that person will be focused obviously mostly on the direct but what specific things will be on his agenda to improve the growth in that particular segment or what changes can we anticipate there?", "Troy Woods", "Hey Brett, Troy. Tom Boyer, he has joined us. He has moved to Omaha. He has taken full ownership of the old TMS if you will, the first national bank legacy direct business. So he will have responsibility, both operationally and from a sales perspective of that business. He does not have just for point of clarification, he does not have a direct line of sight ownership if you will for the C-pay and ProPay direct business, it's the legacy FMB and [TMS] business. And so - something we felt like we needed to do to consolidate under one owner if you will and we were excited about Tom boarding, of course he is a direct report to Mark Pyke.", "Brett Huff", "Okay, that's great, thank you for your help.", "Operator", "Tulu Yunus of Nomura.", "Tulu Yunus - Nomura", "Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question guys. First, I just wanted to touch on the free cash flow outlook and recognizing this CapEx benefit if you will next year. I was wondering on the cash conversion which I define as free cash flow as a percentage of adjusted EBITDA, is that also improving because the last two years you had a working capital build in 2013 and last year I believe you had Japan exit that required some cash, so I wondered did that conversion get better.", "Paul Todd", "I think yes, this is Paul. I think if you do the calculation based off of the comments I made early, I think you actually will see that yield actually improving. So with that expanding EBITDA margin I mentioned earlier, and if you look at the free cash flow I think you're going to see an expanding yield there.", "Tulu Yunus - Nomura", "Got it. So there is a double benefit there, better yield, as well as lower CapEx that should - that makes sense, and that sort of baked in your $420 million to $440 million. Okay, so the next question just on the difference between your margin commentary and adjusted EBITDA versus EBIT, what's going on there, is DNA going to be a bigger portion of next year because of all the elevator CapEx or is there something else? I think you mentioned 100 basis points to 150 basis points on adjusted EBITDA but I think your comments were more measured on EBIT.", "Paul Todd", "Yes, as we didn't callout anything necessarily specifically on that front and obviously we'll see some pick up a little bit as it relates to some of the conversion activity with the large conversion that we've had and so outside of that I wouldn\u2019t call out anything specifically unique if it relates to that. We also are seeing a little bit with our surround investments in some of the stuff there, I think it is also playing through there a little bit but there is nothing outside of those that I would callout specifically.", "Tulu Yunus - Nomura", "Okay. And last question for me, the North America revenue pickup if I look at that sequentially was very strong. On a percentage basis much better actually than the AOF growth suggesting better revenue for AOF, what is underlying that - are you actually - is there more transactional activity, given maybe lower gas prices or is there - are you doing more value-added services, more [broad] stuff or anything you had called out?", "Paul Todd", "I think when I went through the prepared remarks the value-added services and the growth that we saw in the fourth quarter in the value-added services was extremely strong and so if you link that up to my comments earlier around, why that kind of core organic growth rate is not necessarily going over in what step to the way the fourth quarter looks, some of that is we had a higher than expected realization on the value-added services side.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, I actually missed that, thank you.", "Operator", "Next we have Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.", "Jason Kupferberg", "Hey guys, I wanted to come back to your comments. Troy at the outset of the call around the health of the US consumers, he sounded quite polished there, obviously gas prices have come down significantly but some of the macro data point suggest that consumers aren\u2019t necessarily spending that savings in other discretionary category if you will but what are you guys seeing in your data, do you think some of that is starting to take hold?", "Troy Woods", "I think there a couple of things, one that you heard of course the number that Paul shared about the expected revenue growth from the North American sector in 2015 which is clearly getting a boost from the big conversion coming up. But I think there are a couple of other things, I think when you look at the confidence that we've seen from the studies that we've reviewed, just earlier this week you saw where all of the large issuers reporting significantly higher spend in marketing dollars. All of them, and the teams and up, delinquencies coming down, economies improving. So all of that we think is that said in our earlier prepared remarks lends itself in turn to what we think can see as healthy spending 23% to 24% increase in North America for authorizations, just doing the back half of the quarter. So all of that leads to what we see as a pretty healthy organic growth year for the segment.", "Jason Kupferberg", "Okay. And the new buyback authorization, obviously pretty substantial, I mean should we read anything into that with regard to the M&A pipeline, as far as what might be in that pipeline that could theoretically be converted this year?", "Troy Woods", "No, I don't think so Jason, I wouldn\u2019t read anything into it, we're [playing] these programs on all through the year, we had one of course that was expiring in April and we felt likely needed to deal with it, and as I indicated in my prepared remarks, sans an acquisition in 2015, you might expect TSYS to stay on the path of our capital allocation that we outlined last quarter, and that's the kind of numbers I shared with you earlier.", "Jason Kupferberg", "Right. And just last question from me, your latest thoughts on the strategic nature of the CUP data JV, is it possible you could look to monetize that asset at some point, are there any restrictions on your ability to do that?", "Troy Woods", "No Jason, I don't think we have any interest. Our executive team is over there just a couple of months ago for board meeting and from time to time perhaps there is a subject of discussion but it is not something in our path at this moment in time to monetize our ownership with CUP data, no.", "Jason Kupferberg", "Okay, I appreciate the comment, thank you.", "Operator", "This will conclude our question-and-answer session. I will now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Shawn Roberts, Director of Investor Relations for any closing remarks. Sir?", "Shawn Roberts", "Thanks, Mike. And I would like to thank everyone who have participated in this call, as well as those who participated in the webcast. As always if anybody has any follow-up questions, I'll be here all night. Thank you.", "Operator", "Now we thank you Sir and to the rest of the management team for your time today. The conference call is now concluded. At this time you may disconnect your lines.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Shawn Roberts. Please go ahead.", "Shawn Roberts", "Thank you, Amy, and welcome, everyone. On the call today, our Chairman and CEO, Troy Woods, who will begin with his opening remarks followed by Paul Todd, who will provide business highlights on our four segments and then review our consolidated financials. We'll wrap it up with Q&A.", "I'd like to now remind everybody that each person will be able to ask two questions before the operator will place you back into the queue. I'd also like to take a minute to just thank everyone who participated in the TSYS Perception Study that was conducted by [Rebel Research]. Your feedback in this study is definitely going to help our company in many ways.", "I'd like to now call your attention to the fact that we'll be making some forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS' actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in TSYS' reports filed with the SEC.", "I would like to now introduce Troy Woods.", "Troy Woods", "Thank you, Shawn. And welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We had a fantastic third quarter as we again exceeded our expectation in all financial metrics, delivering strong financials across all of our segments. Corporate highlights for the quarter include adjusted EPS growth exceeding 40%. Revenue before reimbursables increased 15.1%, and year-to-date free cash flow has increased over 45%.", "As I've said in the past, TSYS benefits when our clients perform well, when the businesses reserved prosper and when millions of consumers buy and use our products each and every day. I'll particular note our issuing clients continued to perform better than the industry average against a backdrop of a tepid global economic environment. Although we did not buyback any shares during the quarter, we intend to resume this activity in the fourth quarter with our stated goal of returning approximately 75% of available free cash flow to our shareholders in a form of dividends and share repurchases.", "Turning to the top line highlights of the quarter for our four operating segments. I'll begin with North America which delivered another very strong performance. The North America segment delivered the largest single segment revenue quarter in TSYS' history, exceeding the previous two [quarter marks] in the second and first quarters of this year. This is the fifth straight quarter of record setting revenues and the fourth straight quarter of record setting operating income for North America.", "During the quarter, we signed a new five-year contract with [Tangent Ring Bike] in Canada and a new seven-year contract with Atlanticus Holdings formally known as CompuCredit. In addition to our business, we signed contract extensions with First Hawaiian Bank and Servis1st Bank. All of the individual lines of business within the segment were contributors to these great results for the quarter. Plastic reissuance associated with the EMV, record transactions, record accounts on file, and productivity improvements propel the North America segment to a 38.8% margin for the quarter. 33 basis points above the same quarter last year and 107 basis points increase on a linked quarter basis.", "Now let's turn our attention to the International segment. The story here continues to be steady improvement in year-over-year constant currency revenue growth and continually improving margins. With record transactions on accounts on file, the International segment produced 7.9% constant currency revenue growth and a 21.3% operating margin for the quarter.", "Our initiatives to refocus on improving our top line growth profile was certainly beginning to pay dividends and we are also on track to deliver on our 2015 goal to produce an 18% operating margin. The new sales pipeline in our core European processing business remains healthy, and we are in active discussions with multiple European entities regarding their card processing business.", "On the business development front in Europe, we announced the launch of Metro Bank in the U.K., the first new high street bank in more than 100 years, which includes both debit and credit processing. Also in partnership with the Bank of Ireland, we are now supporting their new financial services partnership with the Automobile Association of Britain via our TSYS TS2 platform.", "During the quarter, we launched Apple Pay in the U.K. and TSYS was the only third-party issuer processor ready for the delivery of this major payments event. We're now supporting 24 clients in North America and the U.K. for Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay and are expecting to add several more by year-end. We've also begun supporting a global payments company with an innovative credit installment proposition in the U.K. and now in Germany.", "During the quarter, we extended our relationships with ING and U.S. Bank to provide commercial card processing and managed services as well as two other large clients in the U.K. We continue to see solid growth in extended agreements on our managed services joint venture with three key clients, an expansion of our end-to-end capabilities to support our clients' core processing needs. All in all, it was another solid quarterly performance by our International segment.", "Moving to the Merchant segment, we had a 14% increase in our direct revenue which marks our third straight double-digit growth quarter for direct since the anniversary of our acquisitions in January of last year. The segment also benefited from a slower deceleration of the large deconverting indirect portfolio that we had discussed on many occasions. Overall, the segment revenue grew 7.6%.", "Robust SBS sales volume and double-digit POS transaction volume growth were significant contributors to the Merchant growth story this quarter. We are also benefiting from growth in our new channels and products such as Amex OptBlue, growth in the integrated point-of-sale space and the launch in Android Pay and Samsung Pay. In fact, we now support all three of the major general purpose wallet providers in both our issuer processing business and our Merchant acquiring businesses.", "Additionally, our integrated software vendors accounted for over 20% of total new TSYS' Merchant solutions merchants for the quarter exceeding our expectations. All of these factors contributed to another quarter of strong margins at 34.3%. We saw significant increases in EMV certification activity from our merchants toward the end of the quarter as the October 1 EMV liability shift deadline kicked in. These and recent reported in less than 5% of all Merchant locations in the United States were EMV enabled by October 1 deadline. We expect this increased activity to continue for the remainder of this year and beyond as this will be a long journey to reach critical EMV reterminalization penetration.", "Now let's turn our attention to NetSpend. NetSpend continued its excellent performance in the third quarter. Revenue growth exceeded 22% and this represents the 15th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth for NetSpend. The third quarter gross dollar volume or load was $5.4 billion up over 22% over the same quarter last year. This is the highest year-over-year quarter increase in GDV in two years. And in Q3 with a series of key extensions and agreements NetSpend continues its impressive expansion signing a multiyear distribution relationship with Rite Aid, the third largest pharmacy chain in the United States. Adding to their continued success, NetSpend also signed a five-year renewal of its distribution relationship with [inCall] a retail aggregator who assist in delivering NetSpend, PayPal and Western Union branded products through their tier 1 retail convenience, pharmacy and dollar stores.", "As we have discussed now for several quarters, NetSpend continues to invest significantly in new and innovative products and solutions to deliver to our broad customer base. In addition to these investments, we are continuing to prepare for the issuance of CFPB's final rules on prepaid which are expected to be published sometime early in the first quarter of 2016.", "In summary, we are very delighted with the result of all of our segments and the overall performance of the company for the third quarter. As a result of our strong performance and team members executing to our strategic plan, we are raising our guidance for revenue before reimbursables to a range of 12% to 13% and adjusted earnings per share to a range of 24% to 26%.", "Now I would like turn the call to Paul Todd. Paul?", "Paul Todd", "Thank you, Troy, and I want to begin by echoing by your positive comments about the quarter. While we have used the terms all-time high or record high this year on several occasions as it relates to various aspects of our performance, the great work by our team in executing against our strategic plans in our segments has put us in a position again this quarter to achieve certain record levels of performance, exceed our internal expectations and be in a position to raise our guidance again as we look to finish 2015 in an unmatched way in our company's history.", "Before we dig into the numbers starting on slide 6, I want to address the impact to operating expenses and earnings per share we recognized during the third quarter from certain one-time state and federal tax benefits that resulted from prior years but were recognized in the third quarter. There are two components of benefits related to these items. One on the operating income side and the other on the tax line. On the operating income side, there was approximately a $15 million reduction of employment tax expense in corporate admin that positively impacted our consolidated margins but does not affect the segment reporting. On the tax line, we saw our tax line benefit by a net $8.5 million which I'll cover when I discuss our tax line information. With this background I'll now discuss our consolidated results on a reported basis as well as the exclusion of these items given they are more one-time in nature.", "Now on slide 6, at the consolidated level, a revenue before reimbursables increased 15.1% for the quarter, resulting in a 14.2% increase on a year-to-date basis and accelerating our year-to-date growth rate from the second quarter by 47 basis points. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $238.9 million which was a 20.6% increase. Excluding tax items adjusted EBITDA was $223.8 million an increase of 13%. Finally, adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $0.78 for the quarter represents a 40.2% increase from 3Q of last year and a year-to-date increase of 36.8% excluding approximately $0.13 of adjusted EPS, arising from the above mentioned items adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.65, an increase of 17.2% over 3Q of 2014.", "I want to point out a few highlights on the consolidated performance on slide 7. First on revenue growth, the consolidated 15.1% quarterly revenue growth was another mid-teen revenue growth quarter following on the 15.6% organic revenue growth we saw last quarter. I want to remind you that all three quarters of double-digit quarterly revenue growth this year are purely organic with no impact of any acquisitions. On the operating income side, the $37.5 million increase in consolidated adjusted operating income represents a 209 basis point improvement in our consolidated margin for the quarter from 3Q of 2014. And finally on a reported basis, our adjusted operating margin was 31% and without the tax benefit our adjusted operating margin would have been at 28.6% for the quarter and 200 basis point improvement from the second quarter.", "Now let's discuss the North America segment starting on slide 8. And the key point for the North American segment is consistent with previous quarters around organic growth and performance. Segment revenue before reimbursables was up 21.8% for the quarter to $293.6 million versus the third quarter of last year, and the segment increased this operating income by 22.9% from the third quarter of last year. The $2.6 million increase in revenue was driven by the new business that's been converted over the last year as well as overall strong organic growth from existing clients. As we've mentioned previously, we had expected our North America segment margins to be in a tighter quarterly range in 2015 versus previous years and the third quarter's adjusted segment operating income margin of 38.8% was consistent with the prior two quarters and represents a slight improvement over the third quarter of 2014.", "Our total accounts on file for the quarter increased 26.6% with our traditional accounts on file increasing 36.9% showing the dramatic growth in this important metric. I will point out that the total accounts on file will start showing some decline in the coming quarters as the previously discussed deconversion of Rush Card and Green Dot begin to play out in the volumes. This is why we continue to reflect the traditional accounts on file which exclude prepaid, government services, and single-use accounts that can vary substantially but have less revenue correlation than the traditional account on file metrics. It's been a better year so far for the North America segment in terms of revenue, accounts on file, and operating income growth, and the segment has made great progress this year in delivering against its strategic goal of becoming the number one global provider of credit card issuer processing solutions.", "Now I want to move over to the International segment highlights on slide 9, where the key headline is continued margin growth consistent with the segment strategic target of 18% for the year. It was a solid quarter for the segment with segment revenue of $86.4 million, down 1.1% on a reported basis but delivering higher than expected constant currency segment revenue growth of 7.9%, continuing a string of six quarters of constant currency revenue increases while delivering against the margin goals of the business. While this will likely not continue in the fourth quarter due to a one-time item in the fourth quarter of 2014, it does point to a better than expected revenue growth picture for this business.", "The revenue growth for the quarter was partially fueled by the four new clients we've converted since last year. These new clients coupled with our existing client base are outperforming the market. And as we mentioned on the last call, we're lifting this segment from being a roughly flat constant currency growth picture to one of low to mid-single-digits. I would also like to highlight a performance goal that segment achieved during the quarter. Four years ago, this segment started a platform and service rationalization effort with the goal of reaching an 18% margin in 2015. During the quarter, we closed the final platform identified in the program moving our last client on this platform from a fully outsourced solution to a hybrid licensing solution. In total, we shutdown or disposed off 15 platforms of services as part of this program and we have a more efficient and margin improving business as a result of these efforts.", "On the margin front, the third quarter 21.3% adjusted segment operating margin was a 300 basis point improvement from the 18.3% margin in the third quarter of last year and puts us on a good path to achieve the four-year goal of approximately 18% for the year. I will call out that we expect the margin to decline in the fourth quarter from fourth quarter 2014 level due to significant one-time item in the fourth quarter of '14. From a volume perspective accounts on file grew 10.8 million compared to the same quarter of last year, over half of which was due to new clients. We now process a segment record 74.9 million accounts on file.", "I would like to emphasize again that most of this growth is in commercial card in single-use accounts. As in previous quarters, we also experienced significant growth in debit portfolios we process. This segment experienced high single-digit transaction growth with same client transactions growing by 8.9%. This was partially fueled by further strong growth in the debit portfolios we process which grew 21.1%. In summary, on International, we're pleased with the continued execution of margin improvement coupled with an improving constant currency revenue growth picture compared to last year.", "Now moving on to the Merchant segment on slide 10, where the key headlines for this segment is organic growth driven by double-digit quarterly revenue growth in our direct business. While we are pleased with the growth in direct, we're equally pleased with decelerating decline in our indirect business from last year's level driven by the renewal of existing customers, the signing of some new business and product initiatives such as Amex OptBlue as well as some positive one-time events.", "Our revenue mix remains in line with our previously stated goal to trend towards 75% of revenue for the segment driving from our directed business. On the margin front, as we've previously communicated, we expected a tough comparison quarter due to some one-time related items in the third quarter of 2014. So while the 34.3% adjusted segment operating margin did not reach the levels of 3Q of '14, the segment [did see] our margin expectations for the quarter.", "We had another impressive quarter on the volume front with SBS sales volume growth of 9% and POS transaction growth of over 11% excluding deconverted accounts. And also we had the benefit of new products that we introduced in the third quarter of last year that anniversary this quarter. In summary for this segment, we're pleased with the mid double-digit organic revenue growth of our direct business, the continued deceleration of decline year-over-year in our indirect business and the strength of the margin picture for the segment.", "Now I want to discuss the NetSpend performance starting on slide 11, where the key highlight for this segment is the organic revenue growth of just over 22.4% for the quarter. This better than expected growth was driven by a combination of factors to include growth in direct deposit, active cards of over 18%, growth in gross dollar volume of over 22% and the continued success in maturing the new relationships we launched during 2014 which brings Western Union, Paychex and Walmart. We finished the quarter with approximately 3.6 million active cards adding approximately 1,000 distributing locations and employers are now over 89,000 strong distribution network.", "NetSpend strong Q3 revenue growth marked a 15th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth to $139.6 million. Revenue growth continues to be strong both in total and by acquisition channel with three of our four distribution channels delivering double-digit year-over-year revenue growth for the third quarter in a row. We continue to see a meaningful contribution to our year-over-year revenue growth driven by the new relationships we launched in 2014.", "I mentioned on our last few calls about our strategic decision to invest in the NetSpend business in 2015 that would cause some pressure on the segment margin that is what we saw in the quarter with the 3Q adjusted segment operating margin and 26.7% down 500 basis points from 3Q of 2014. We continue to invest in our distribution relationships so that are unique distribution channels win in the marketplace, growing faster than industry level growth rates. We will continue to opportunistically make some margin tradeoffs for growth just as we said we would do start at the start of the year.", "As the revenue growth picture began to improve this year, I commented on our last call that we were now expecting this segment to increase revenue in the mid to high teens and we continue to believe that to be the case with the trending more toward high-teens year. And as I said, we continue to expect the margin to contract from 2014 levels largely due to the investments that I mentioned before. In all, NetSpend demonstrated another great quarter of performance.", "Leaving the segments now and moving to consolidated level again, you can see on slide 12, how each of our segments' margin contributed to our overall adjusted reporting operating margin of 31% for the quarter with an adjusted operating margin 28.6% excluding the tax impact. Also I want to state that this slide provide a bridge between the adjusted segment operating income for each of our segments and our consolidated adjusted operating income. We provide this because our segments report the results on an unadjusted segment operating income basis which excludes amortization of acquisition intangibles, corporate admin and stock based compensation.", "On slide 13, you can see the strong Q3 margin has helped to deliver a 27.9% year-to-date adjusted operating margin a 27% excluding the tax impact I noted earlier.", "Moving our cash picture on slide 14. We ended the quarter with $448 million in cash, an increase of $99 million from the end of the second quarter. Our largest outflow of cash was $40 million of CapEx of which about 35% was related to property and equipment, 28% was related to contract acquisition costs, with the remaining 37% related to internally developed and licensed software.", "On cash flow on slide 15, we show our trailing 12 months of cash flow stream, and I want to point out that our free cash flow for the quarter was $135.6 million. Based on this 3Q performance and year-to-date results on cash flow, we continue to believe that our annual free cash flow estimate of $420 million to $440 million for 2015 is still appropriate. As we finished the fourth quarter, we obviously have decisions to make around CapEx that could improve or moderately reduce the mid-point of this range.", "Now let me come back to taxes, as I discussed our expectations around our effective tax rate. First as I mentioned on our last call, we had expected our tax rate to improve from the approximately 34% range we had experience on a year-to-date basis at the conclusion of the second quarter to more of the middle of the 32% to 34% range representing an approximate 100 basis point improvement from our year-to-date actual level. However due to the favorable results that I mentioned at the beginning, we saw an additional net $8.5 million of pickup on our tax lines, and as such we are now adjusting our expectations for our effective tax rate to be in the 30% to 31% range. We are pleased that our effective tax rate range has improved throughout the year and the new expectation range of 30% to 31% compares favorably to the 32% effective tax rate we saw in 2014.", "And finally on guidance as Troy mentioned given the strength of all of our segments, less than expected currency headwinds and the improvement in operating results and our effective tax rates due to the discrete items I just mentioned for the year, we are revising our full year total revenue guidance from the previous 9% to 11% growth range to 11% to 12% growth range. We are revising our revenue before reimbursables guidance from the previous 10% to 12% growth range to a 12% and 13% growth range and we're revising our full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations guidance from the previous 15% to 17% growth range to a 24% to 26% growth range resulting in a $2.43 to $2.47 range.", "To wrap up, I have three callouts that I think are key takeaways from today. The first callout is the continuing organic revenue growth that has occurred across all of our segments on a constant currency basis. The third quarter 21.8% organic growth in North America, the 7.9% constant currency growth in International, the 7.6% growth in the Merchant segment, and the 22.4% growth in NetSpend are all impressive, but particularly so compared with their comparison growth rates from the third quarter of 2014. Each segment has accelerated in some cases rather significantly the growth rate of their businesses for the same comparison quarter of last year. When each of our segments does that at the same time in a quarter, it substantially changes the organic revenue growth picture of the company which happened in the quarter with consolidated revenue growing 15.1% all organically with no help from acquisitions compared with the revenue growth rate of the third quarter of last year of 8.5% on a consolidated basis. While this trend won't continue in the same form on a go forward basis, it points to businesses that have improved their competitive position relative to the industry during the quarter.", "The second callout is around capital deployment. As you saw on our cash position graph, we did not repurchase shares during the quarter and our cash balance has improved significantly. While we have been transparent around our capital allocation principles of returning approximately 75% of available free cash flow back to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends and largely achieve that level during the first half of the year, we consistently stated that this principle is balanced against M&A opportunities and other capital needs. We do intend to resume our buyback activity in the fourth quarter.", "And the third callout is around execution against our strategic plan and how that has unfolded as we look to finish 2015. Our North America business has executed growing accounts on file to 685 million this year with record setting financial results. Our International business improved their efficiencies on the march to an 18% operating margin with the now improving constant currency revenue growth picture. Our Merchant business has stemmed a year-over-year percentage declines in indirect with a better than expected performance on the direct side, and NetSpend used their unique distribution to grow their industry leading business. And all of these businesses delivered against their plans at the same time allowing for the performance that we talked about today. I said at the beginning of the year that it was an exciting time to be in payments and even more exciting time to be at TSYS and the third quarter proved that out in unique and compelling ways.", "I will conclude by reiterating Troy's comments around the excitement we have related to our third quarter's performance and restate that none of this is possible without the extreme dedication and execution by our colleagues around the world to enable these results to happen.", "And with that we will open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays.", "Darrin Peller", "Thanks guys. Nice job on the quarter. I just want to start off with the North American growth rate. I mean and obviously it's been extremely strong on top of a number of other quarters being strong. And I'm curious to just revisit the topic of [indiscernible] in the next year, I know it's been working, so what work do you expect from a modeling standpoint that growth rate today on what is a tough compare but seeming like the organic growth if you sort of back out BMO, TD and some of the ads, what it could be next year, and just remind us I think fully on those anniversary in terms of what you added on maybe in the first half of the year and you're still growing well north of 20% in North America?", "Paul Todd", "Darrin, this is Paul. You broke up there in about half of the question and so it might be helpful if you don't mind to kind of go back to it. I hate to ask you to do that but we only picked up about half of what you were asking for it. I think it was mainly around North America growth rate for next year, but we missed so much of it, I think it would be helpful if you could repeat it.", "Darrin Peller", "Sorry, can you hear me now a little better?", "Paul Todd", "Yes.", "Darrin Peller", "Alright. What I was getting at is the growth rate in North America was obviously sustainably strong, and I guess number one just to revisit what your expectations are for 2016. You talked at your Investor Day about a high single-digit growth against a tough compare just being sustainable. And then just remind us, I think some portfolios anniversary in terms of what you've added on like whether it was BMO or I don't exactly which one TD and the timing, you're still growing north of 20% despite that.", "Paul Todd", "So Darrin, I'll start off, this is Paul, and then I'll let Troy comment on it as well, but you are right. We did speak as it relates to North America business on more of a longer-term horizon of the mid to even higher single-digit growth rate is being kind of the range that make sense at our Investor Day, based off what we were seeing, I made some comments too around just wanting to make sure that the new ad had season, so we could get kind of the growth rate on the new base and so we wanted some more timing around that, but I do think that overall range on a longer-term basis based on the business that is in place, is still appropriate. I would comment that obviously, the 21.8% that we saw for the quarter, and if you do the math around the comparison periods in the four quarters that anniversarying that you're talking about begins to play itself out and so specifically as it relates to the TD business and we also have a full anniversarying of BMO, when there is well in the quarter that's playing, and also point out that obviously and we talked about this before the rush effect of not having the revenue related to rush is another factor that not only plays in the fourth quarter but also will play out next year as well as the Green Dot. So we will have the anniversarying effect obviously next year with some other clients as we can talk about that as we get into our '16 guidance in a more formal way, but those would be the comments I would add there. Troy?", "Troy Woods", "I think the only thing, I would add to that, Darrin, and Paul was certainly correct about first quarter being the biggest catalyst for those anniversary portfolios, is to add that most of those if not all those portfolios that you make reference to those anniversary portfolios are performing extremely well, and so I think it's going to continue to give us a little bit of tailwind as we get into '16. So granted we will anniversary the big bulk of it, but they are really performing beyond our expectations.", "Darrin Peller", "Okay. That's great. Just a quick follow-up on NetSpend and then I'll turn it back to the queue. But on the NetSpend business again growing very well. You mentioned the potential regulatory headlines for the first quarter you'd expect. So remind us what's left in your portfolio that not necessarily -- and you haven't changed in terms of the way you has approached for [draft]. I think you went through an overhaul where there was only a single-digit percentage of your cards that actually still has different fees in overdraft?", "Troy Woods", "I'll take first half of that, Darrin, and I think Paul can come on the bank and give you a few more stats, but you're right we have indicated in the past some of those numbers, and I'll let Paul handle those. We have not done a complete overhaul, if I understood your question correct. We are looking at many different products, many different ways to address the potential negative impact of overdraft in the NetSpend segment. For the most part it would kick in late '16 and for the full year of '17. We haven't come out and telegraphed, if you will, what that's going to be, we're going to wait, we get those final rules early in '16. Paul, you want to handle that?", "Paul Todd", "Yeah. I think Darrin, I would echo Troy's statements there around that and I think that as we mentioned before we are expecting the potential final rules to be coming out in January. As Troy mentioned, there could be one quarter of performance impact related to potentially the fourth quarter of next year, but this is primarily a 2017 [NetSpend], as it relates to the financial impact. I also comment that I think as we've said before as it relates to the overall sizing of that, that when NetSpend was a separately reporting public company that they had commented in their public filings around overdraft representing around 7% of overall GPR. And then to really get a complete picture, you'd have to add several more percentage points on top of that 7%, and I'd also state that overdraft is growing, it is a growing revenue item, so that would be the comments that I would make online.", "Darrin Peller", "Alright, guys. I'd leave it there. Thanks.", "Paul Todd", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question is from Jason Kupferberg at Jefferies.", "Ryan Kerry", "Hey, this is Ryan Kerry for Jason. Thanks for taking my questions. Just starting with EMV, did you hit the liability shift that I know you call out some benefit in the quarter from EMV, just help me provide a little more color on how meaningful this was and how long the tail could benefit in the quarters going forward?", "Troy Woods", "Well, again, I'll take that Ryan, I appreciate it. I think you look at it on two different fronts. On the issuing side as we've been talking about it now for several quarters. Clearly, we've had a tremendous amount of cards that TSYS has been involved in reissuing on EMV front. What we've indicated in the past that although it is a significant number of plastics, some are just in the normal reissue cycle, some might have been accelerated, and we've indicated that although it is accretive, it really is not kind of numbers that move the needle. On the acquiring side, again, as everybody else, we've been working on it for a long time, but in the last two to three months, we've really seen a tremendous amount of increased activity like I've mentioned in my prepared remarks. I mentioned Visa less than 5% of Merchant locations. We are in the low double-digits from a TSYS' perspective, but as I indicated again this is going to be a long journey for any of us to get to a meaningful penetration, I think for EMV, particularly on the acquiring side.", "Ryan Kerry", "Great. And then just staying in the acquiring side, we've been hearing even more bullishness coming from the industry as it relates to growth prospects for the integrated channel. You've done good job more or less growing this business organically and with that said, is that how you believe you'll continue to grow the business or is M&A a possibility and even digging a little bit deeper, do you still see opportunities left in the space?", "Paul Todd", "Sure, Ryan, this is Paul. As it relates to integrated specifically we are seeing better than expected performance from the integrated channel and if you look at just our overhaul platform, we'd expect it about 15% or so of our new business to come in on the integrated channel, and it's coming in at a higher cliff than that on the new business that we're bringing on as it relates to the [overhaul], the TMS business, so from a new sales standpoint as well as just a performance standpoint, our integrated approach which was de novo more startup approach to integrated is performing really well. As it relates to -- we're still looking at acquisitions in the Merchant space. The answer to that is yes. We're still evaluating acquisitions both from a integrated standpoint, but also even on a broader distribution context for Merchant acquiring and so that activity continues as it has in past quarters, so nothing has changed.", "Troy Woods", "I think the only thing, I would add there, Ryan, is to what Paul said is, we continue to leverage our unique model in distribution. As you well know, we have a W2 channel, a [1099] channel. We're pretty large and significant in the micro Merchant area. We are very unique also in the sense that we support significantly large direct selling entities through ProPay, [indiscernible] in the integrated software vendor channel. So I think leveraging that model and continuing to rollout product as we've talked about already and look we still believe that the winners in this space are going to be the scale of players with integrated capabilities in a very diverse distribution channel and that hadn't changed.", "Ryan Kerry", "Great. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Troy Woods", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from [indiscernible] from Morgan Stanley.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hey there. Just wanted to follow-up on your comments about on the share repurchase spend in Q3. Can you just maybe give us a little bit more color on what was happening and if and when you do sort of move forward on the M&A front which area do you think we should be focusing on?", "Paul Todd", "Sure, this is Paul. As it relates to buyback activity, we've talked about our principle around returning 75% of available free cash flow back to the shareholders in the forms of share repurchases and dividends, that is a guiding principle, and over a longer-term basis on any one quarter, whether we're balancing at M&A activities or other capital needs that is not a prescriptive notion that in every quarter it's going to work out to the exact levels that the overall principle points to, and so that's one of the reasons. We don't include share buyback in our guidance because from time-to-time, we'll go into different periods where different things will play out and that can change the buyback activity level. So that would be the comments there. As it relates to M&A activity, I'd go back to the comments that we just made that, in our M&A activity, priorities have not changed, Merchant acquiring still is the biggest one that we focused on, but I would say I think the spectrum of activity has widened across all segments whether it's our issuing segment or NetSpend on International that I'd say it's much more balanced approach around M&A than more singularly focused just on Merchant acquiring.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Alright. Thank you. And maybe just a follow-up on the North American segment. One of your competitors recently became a [buffet] relisted company again with better financial resources, just wondering if you could maybe just comment on what you may have seen in terms of competitive dynamics in that segment over the past couple quarters?", "Paul Todd", "Well, if it specifically rates to the company, I guess, maybe you're mentioning [royal pay] as the one that -- as it relates to the fundamentals there I'm not exactly sure where you're referring to, but just as it relates to our Merchant business, I would say that our Merchant performance has exceeded our expectations. If you look at the last three quarters and you look at the double-digit direct organic growth rate that we've seen in that direct channel coupled with that decelerating the client in that indirect, it has produced better than expected results in our Merchant segment. And so we're pleased from a volume standpoint, we're pleased with as I said earlier, with what we're getting out of our new integrated channel, and so as we look at that segment, we are pleased with the financial results as they have played out for the first three quarters of this year. I would echo Troy's comments around the scale and our need for additional scale in that business over the longer-term to kind of better effectively compete in the Merchant industry, but we are very pleased with the results from our segment.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from David Togut at Evercore ISI.", "Mike Landau", "Hey, this is Mike Landau in for David Togut. Can you call out the same [card issuing] their transaction growth for the third quarter and talk about what level of growth you believe would be sustainable on that metric over the next 12 to 24 months?", "Paul Todd", "I'm assuming you're making reference Mike to North America for our card issuing business?", "Mike Landau", "Yes.", "Paul Todd", "It was 11% and that's very much in line with the last few quarters and we see no reason for that not to stay in that same ballpark.", "Mike Landau", "Great, thanks. And on the Merchant segment, can you update us unit pricing trends in both direct and indirect Merchant businesses?", "Troy Woods", "I'd be glad to, Troy again, Mike. We continue to see improvements actually in our basis point pricing for both our bundle and unbundle in our direct business, so they are both up in 3Q versus 3Q of '14.", "Mike Landau", "Great. Thanks.", "Troy Woods", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "The next question is from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.", "Korey Marcello", "Hey guys. This is Korey Marcello on for Bryan Keane. Just wanted to ask first quickly on NetSpend, you caught up the Rite Aid distribution opportunity, any sort of incremental color you can provide there, is that across all other stores or how should we think about that?", "Troy Woods", "Well, obviously, it's way too early Korey to handicap what Rite Aid is going to do for us. We just have that contract signed and of course announced today. So I think we can give more color on that as the quarters develop just like we have in the past to some degree with the other large ones we signed back in '14. It's just a little early on Rite Aid.", "Korey Marcello", "Sure, no ways, that make sense. Second question was just in terms of Europe, with regards to interchange caps in Europe coming on in December, you mentioned sort of in the past presenting opportunities to the issuers to replace the last interchange. Can you just provide sort of an update there as we sort of near the implementation? Are you seeing more interest on some of those initiatives? How should we be thinking about that?", "Troy Woods", "Well, we are Korey, as I mentioned if not last quarter or quarter before last, it's certainly is a headwind that's facing all of the issuers in Europe, it's a pretty significant interchange headwind. I've seen reports of \u20ac6 billion. As I've indicated in the past, we see it as an opportunity and talking to a lot of people in the Eurozone. They are seeking strategic partnerships. We look at this as a good opportunity to partner with them. Almost all of these FIs are wanting to grow their payments phase. It is still a very attractive ROA asset, cash and cheques continue to move towards the electronic payment side, of course, we might be biased on this, but when we work with these prospects, they tell us that TSYS is a very feature-rich function platform. So I think you put all those in and look at the fragmented market as well. We see some good opportunities to help them. We've actually talked to some that have indicated they really like some of the products that we can bring in the market to help them, begin to offset some of those possible interchange [dogmatization]. So our pipeline is pretty strong rightly on the International side.", "Korey Marcello", "Okay. Thanks very much guys.", "Operator", "The next question is from George Mihalos from Cowen.", "George Mihalos", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the nice quarter.", "Troy Woods", "Thank you.", "George Mihalos", "I wanted to hold in a little bit on Merchant specifically, if we look at a transaction growth that really accelerated, it was up 8%, I think up 4% in 2Q, but then the actual volume process that seemed to slow a little bit. It was up 1.5% versus 4% in 2Q. Just wondering if there is anything to read into over there and maybe how should we be thinking about revenue growth going forward, would it be sort of more correlated to a transaction growth number?", "Paul Todd", "Sure, George. This is Paul. And I think it relates to the transaction volume, it would be on our managed accounts. We don't talk about it much because our focus is on our small and medium sized our SBS business, but we do have some large national business that is not recurring in nature and so that's what's impacting the volume. And that's why you're not seeing that same correlated impact into the revenue because on a per unit basis that business is obviously dramatically different than what we see on a more of a mid-sized basis. I would say as it relates to revenue growth, I mean we got a trend now of three quarters of revenue growth for the segment that I think is indicative of where we think the year looks like and so there is nothing dramatic that I would point out, kind of positively or negatively from that cumulative three quarter, we did see some movement obviously between the first and second quarter, we had some things in the third quarter year-over-year that were moving around on the revenue side. And so if you look at the component tree the way that that's being built up and you take the decelerating decline on the indirect side and then what's happened on the direct side. I would point out on the direct side that we will see some compression in the fourth quarter as it relates to fully anniversarying some of the products that we rolled out in the third quarter of '14, and so we will see some depression there, but nothing that I would point out that would be dramatically different from what we've seen on a year-to-date basis on the first three quarters.", "George Mihalos", "Okay, thank you, that's helpful. And then as a quick follow-up. I think there have been some well publicized issued that Russia has been experiencing, I think a computer glitch. I wonder if that potentially pushes out any timing around a deconversion from your platform or potentially causes them to rethink moving off of [thesis] given some of the near-term issues that they have.", "Troy Woods", "Hey, George, Troy here. Yeah, we're certainly well aware of those issues you make reference to, but I think as it relates to Green Dot, that's really a question you need to Green Dot about. From our perspective, we continue to work with them and beyond that I think it would be up Green Dot to make that call.", "Operator", "The next question is from Jeffrey Chen with Goldman Sachs.", "Jeffrey Chen", "Hey, guys. This is Jeff Chen in for Jim Schneider. I was wondering if you can comment on NetSpend. I understand that investment levels are elevated right now to kind of [drive pro], but what do you expect these investments to begin normalizing. I'm just trying to get a timeline.", "Paul Todd", "Sure, Jeff. This is Paul. We had an additive investment in this third quarter and as I spoke in my prepared remarks around the continued additive investment in the fourth quarter that we expect to continue at roughly around the same levels. We are doing that as I said opportunistically as it relates to growth particularly around the new programs that we launched in the late '14 timeframe or in the '14 timeframe that began to scale some to the late '14 timeframe. And I think we're tying a lot of that investment around the scaling of those programs, and so obviously at a certain point, you look and you say, okay, that next incremental investment we're going to get the commence to our return that we need or has it reached a level of scaling where that growth rate differential is not worth essentially, the additional investment in the spend, and so specifically just talking around marketing spend and other growth related spends that will play itself out over the coming quarters and obviously we'll comment on it as it relates to the '16 levels when we come out around our '16 guidance. I would also say that while the spend I highlighted it around the growth initiatives, we are investing in the business around the significant growth that we've seen, so while I'll comment more around the growth initiatives we are investing in the infrastructure and the scalability of the business and so there is both dynamics at play relates to the increased spend.", "Jeffrey Chen", "Great, that's very helpful. And switching gears to issuer processing and specifically in the International business. One of your competitors first -- one of your largest competitors has been spending aggressively on kind of investing in their sales and expanding particularly in the International. So I was wondering if you guys had any updates on the competitive landscape in your international issuer processing business, are you seeing incremental competition from them.", "Troy Woods", "Jeff, Troy here, no I wouldn't say so at all. [FTR] has been a competitor of ours for decades both domestically and internationally. We don't see any changes whatsoever. We respect them. We lined up against them almost weekly, but beyond that we don't see any differences.", "Jeffrey Chen", "Great. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Troy Woods", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar, Citi.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Thank you. Congratulations guys.", "Troy Woods", "Thank you.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "So 2015 was not in the bag obviously a stellar year for you guys. I guess the big question most investors ask is about 2016 now. And I appreciate that you guys cannot give specifics with regards to guidance, but as you go through the financial planning process for next year, could you walk us through the primary puts and takes as you think of top-line and bottom-line growth? I mean it would seem to me that, for example, mid single-digit growth in North America in spite of the headlines you've pointed out, with the headwinds you've pointed out, it should be very achievable and so on. So could you walk through the puts and takes?", "Paul Todd", "Sure, Ashwin. I'll do that, and then if Troy wants to add any commentary. At the end of that as it relates to just the overall tone for '16, and as you write, we will comment on '16 specifically when we come out with guidance, but just topically, if we think about our segments, certainly on the North America segment, we have talked about not just '16, but just an overall growth rate for that segment. I would point out that obviously we have the anniversarying in '16 of the big conversion that we did earlier as well as the loss of rush that we've talked about in Green Dot which we've talked about, which we've also sized for you also. You have to balance that overall growth rate picture and then provide for those exceptions of the known lost business on the sizing that we provided. I don't have anything to comment necessarily on the international side. I wouldn't highlight anything specifically on the international side, as you phrased the puts and the takes there, obviously we have brought on some business this year and we'll see some benefits of that as those flow through next year. Also I wouldn't really comment on anything specially as it relates to the Merchant business per se. Although on a comparison basis, you're likely not to see the significant change that we saw in the indirect side this year compared to the indirect side of last year and so you got that dynamic in some of those more meaningful things largely muted out in the '15 results. And then on NetSpend, I think we clearly will have a full year anniversarying on some of this growth that we have seen from the new business, but NetSpend obviously is a business that is very dynamic in nature. Obviously our projections around tax season will be critically important as to what that road picture looks like from a NetSpend standpoint. So that gives you some overall flavor if you walk down the four segments of what will be facing with as we progress in our planning for '16.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Okay. The follow-up question is on international margins as you shutoff that last other platform and consolidate on one. Is there step up in margins associated with that? Could you sort of quantify? Is it safe to assume that next year's margins target is going to be 19% to 20% or much more muted than that?", "Paul Todd", "So Ashwin, just a follow-up on that. That specific platform, I talked about, wouldn't have any type of meaningful enough margin impact that I would call it out. I was mainly calling out that one mainly to talk about the overall completion of that effort and how the entire effort has played into the overall improving margin picture for the year. So I wouldn't highlight that having any kind of meaningful margin impact. And as it relates to the overall margin impact for '16, we'll comment on that when we come out in '16 as the whole mix of business gets play through in all of our costs are played out.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Got it. And look forward to that, see you in couple of weeks. Thanks.", "Paul Todd", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Tim Willi at Wells Fargo.", "Timothy Willi", "Thanks and good afternoon. Two questions sort of on the same topic. [indiscernible] conversed that first part of that in card issuing, are there products specifically around security or revenue model around e-commerce transaction, are they are different than sort of the traditional card present that may over time if we have an opportunity around selling security products or just sort of how the revenue stream in North America works as we see more and more e-commerce and card present transactions?", "Troy Woods", "Hey, Tim. I'll take stab at that and see if anybody else can add to it. I think a couple [thoughts] coming to mind there with respect to the question around e-com and issuing side. I think one when you think of the Apple Pay and Android Pay and Samsung Pay, we talked about earlier that we are supporting, I think it's 24 plus customers with several more to come on this year. Clearly there are opportunities there for us to receive certain type fees and setup fees and so forth and so on, so you might want to put that into that category, also around EMV, but I wouldn't necessarily put that into e-com category. There are some other security type things that we do, products that we offer to our customers, tokenization and EMV that would fit into that category, but those are the ones that come to mind right off.", "Paul Todd", "Yeah, Troy. I might just add, not necessarily e-commerce but if you kind of -- I know we use these terms a little bit interchangeably, but m-commerce is kind of just from a mobile phones standpoint certainly some of the things we talked about as it relates to the card on-off, using your mobile phone which also has to do with security products related to that could also come into play and kind of more of an m-commerce related context.", "Timothy Willi", "And then my second question, again on the topic of e-commerce, just sort of turning to the Merchant side and how you guys think about your Merchant business and e-commerce or app-commerce. Is it an area where you have a platform that you plan to invest in to more fully take advantage of this evolution or more focused on acquiring a property or just sort of it is what is and probably not going be a big part of that discussion as the U.S. marketplace evolves?", "Paul Todd", "Sure, Tim. I'll start off and maybe Troy can add some comments to it as well. E-commerce has clearly been a strategic distribution area of interest for us for a couple years now and we do actually process today a significant amount of what I'll call card not present transactions, whether they are coming through an e-commerce or an m-commerce or whatever the entry point into as they are in card not present transaction capacity, and so we have taken more of a partnered approach as it relates to the platform, so the platform capability, we certainly think our capability is around that area are at market, but instead of being more around build a proprietary platform around that, it's been more of a partnered strategy around the capability there. And I think we'll continue down that path specifically around making sure that they capabilities are at market, and the ability to use partners for different solutions around the e-commerce area, and specifically as you get into certain verticals around e-commerce which on the acquiring side becomes even more important. From an acquisition standpoint, we have evaluated e-commerce opportunities on the acquisition side and haven't been successful in getting anything of any size over the finish line on the acquisition side, but it's certainly would be in scope that something that we bought from an acquisition standpoint on the Merchant side have a strong e-commerce play. Troy?", "Troy Woods", "I think the only thing I would really add to that, Tim, is something I've said a few minutes ago is back to, I don't think it's necessarily just one channel and I know your question is primarily focused around e-commerce, but we are out there supporting m-commerce, e-commerce, as I mentioned, we are beginning to grow and broadening our base in the integrated software vendor space with about [fifth] of our new Merchant side this past quarter coming from that channel, a very diverse direct channel as I have indicated before with W2, 1099 and so forth. So I don't think you won't see TSYS really [securing] in a one particular win to make it the main focus. I think it's a [normal] channel approach and that's how we plan to approach it.", "Timothy Willi", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Troy Woods", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Tom Macrowen at CLSA.", "Tom Macrowen", "Hey guys, most of my questions have been answered. I'll just ask one on the pipeline in North America, can you just give a comment on how that's shaping up? Thanks.", "Paul Todd", "That was indicated on the few quarters passed.", "Troy Woods", "We decided to discontinue going there with the numbers. We did that a little over a ago, when it was over $100 million and it got very complex and a lot of it was moving around. We continue to have good dialogue with not only those that are processing in-house, but those that are processing with some of our competitors. We still look at the market, a little over half of the market has not processed to TSYS in North America, so we see that as a big, big opportunity. So we continue to work hard every day at it to get that business. I think we've been proven that we've been pretty successful at it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brett Huff at Stephens.", "Brett Huff", "Good afternoon, guys.", "Troy Woods", "Hey Brett.", "Brett Huff", "This is a big picture question on what your thoughts are on the announcement of ChaseNet at Money20/20, and I didn't know if you all had thoughts on that and how that might reshape any of the Merchant acquiring landscape at all?", "Troy Woods", "Well, Brett. Obviously, we are aware of what Chase has indicated over the past almost two years of their intent of with ChaseNet etcetera, etcetera. To be honest with you I have been tied up on board meeting all day. I did see their announcement briefly before we got on the call at 5 O'clock about their announcement at Money20/20. I think time will tell. I think everyone would agree that it's an interesting concept. I think most people would agree that MCX has been on interesting journey and we'll just have to see how it falls out. Paul, I don't think if you have anything to add?", "Paul Todd", "I don't. I think it's still too early to tell what the impact would be both obviously to our business and the industry as a whole.", "Brett Huff", "Okay. Then just a final -- last question the follow-up is, this is a question, housekeeping question on the tax, Paul. The $0.70 to $0.65 pro forma EPS number, which are the tax items does that take out specifically and then can you just describe how we get there?", "Paul Todd", "Yes. So Brett, I think the best way to see that is to go to the slide, I think, it's 12 in our press release that breaks that out. It's going to walk you through actually each one of the items, we actually provided a separate breakout both from an EPS standpoint, you also see it down on the adjusted EBITDA, so you can actually see the component tree as it relates to the computation of how it's playing in the EPS of the $0.78 versus also how it plays on the adjusted EBITDA.", "Brett Huff", "Okay. So just maybe it's a simple question, does the $0.65 basically adjust for both of those discrete tax items?", "Paul Todd", "It does.", "Brett Huff", "Okay. Thank you guys.", "Operator", "This concludes the question-and-answer session. Would you like to make any closing remarks?", "Shawn Roberts", "Yeah. This is Shawn Roberts. We appreciate everybody's participation in the call and look forward to visiting with any and all of you in the future. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "The conference is now concluded.

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Shawn Roberts. Please go ahead.", "Shawn Roberts - Senior Director-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Amy, and welcome, everyone.", "As you can probably imagine, tonight's call will be different than our normal quarterly earnings call. TSYS Chairman, President and CEO, Troy Woods; TSYS CFO, Paul Todd; and TransFirst CEO, John Shlonsky, will review our fourth quarter and year-end highlights and financials and discuss our acquisition of TransFirst. After that, we'll open the call up for Q&A.", "I'd like to remind those of you participating in the Q&A that after your second question, the operator will place you back into the queue.", "I'll now call your attention to the fact that we'll be making some forward-looking statements about our future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS's actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in TSYS's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "At this point, I'll turn the call over to Troy Woods.", "M. Troy Woods - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Shawn. Good afternoon and Happy New Year.", "Without a doubt, this is the type of earnings call a CEO dreams about, reporting a great quarter, performing with operational excellence during the holiday shopping period, reporting a record earnings year, and from a shareholder perspective, producing a 47.8% total shareholder return for 2015, making TSYS the ninth best performing stock in the S&P 500 for the year. And of course, the icing on the cake is the announcement earlier today of the strategic and transformative acquisition of TransFirst, a leading U.S. acquirer of payment solutions.", "This will be the largest acquisition in our history at $2.35 billion. This is truly a watershed event for our company, team members and shareholders, and we are all very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. We're also very pleased to have John Shlonsky, CEO of TransFirst, here with us this afternoon, and he, Paul and I will provide additional details on the strategic rationale for this new partnership and take questions a little later in our presentation.", "Before we get to that, I want to take a few minutes to call out some significant highlights for the quarter and for the year. The fourth quarter was our best quarter in our 33-year history. We produced record-setting transactions, authorizations and volumes. Holiday authorizations on same-client basis were up 12.7% in North America and 10% in our International segment. We repurchased 3 million shares of our stock in the fourth quarter, bringing our total repurchases for the year to 5.2 million shares for $242.1 million. These repurchases, coupled with dividends, represented a return in excess of 92% of our available free cash flow to shareholders in 2015, a 31% increase over last year.", "On the segment front, there are a few call-outs I would like to mention. First is North America. The North America segment produced record revenues, operating income, and transactions for the year. Our traditional accounts on file increased to 37% on a year-over-year quarter basis, and we ended the year with 654.1 million total accounts on file. Our EMV chip card production soared in the fourth quarter, increasing over 400% over the fourth quarter 2014. All in all, it was another exceptional quarter for our North America segment.", "Turning our attention to the International segment, perhaps the biggest achievement for the International segment was the attainment of its four-year goal to achieve a minimum 18% margin by year-end 2015. We ended the year at 18.1%. The outstanding 24.5% fourth quarter margin was a catalyst to achieving our goal. We are very proud of the team for their relentless focus and determination to reach this very important goal by year-end. On the business development front in the International segment, we signed a letter of intent to provide processing solutions in two regional markets in Latin America. This processing will be performed in Brazil, generating scale by leveraging our platform investment that currently supports the market-leading retail cards business of Carrefour.", "As we move to Merchant, a few quick call-outs. For the quarter, direct revenue increased 15.4% and indirect revenue increased 10.4%. The excellent fourth quarter helped propel overall revenue growth for the segment to 8.8% for the year. Continued momentum in our ISV channel, new product offerings like OptBlue, improved sales productivity and EMV terminal activity all contributed to our strong growth for the quarter.", "And lastly, a few important comments about NetSpend; NetSpend produced its 16th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth at 20.9%. We were successful in introducing our payroll, incentive, and disbursement cards program within Capital One, the 10th largest bank in the United States. Also during the quarter, we expanded our products and our relationship with both Rite Aid and Walmart. All in all it was good execution and performance by all segments in the fourth quarter, providing a good foundation and momentum as we move into 2016.", "After today's announcement, our reach and distribution uniquely positions us to provide innovative products and solutions that our clients and customers need to adapt to the evolving payment landscape. Now is our moment to unlock these opportunities and payments and continue to deliver strong results for TSYS, our customers, and our shareholders.", "I'll now ask Paul Todd to provide additional detailed financial information on our quarter, the year end and review our guidance for 2016.", "Paul?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "Thank you, Troy. And before we review the transaction we are announcing today, I too want to reiterate how pleased we are with the performance of the company this year specifically related to the achievement of our strategic and financial goals on an individual segment and corporate basis. Each of our segments performed better than we expected when we started the year and provide us with a good launching pad as we enter 2016. I want to point out at the start that any guidance or expectations I give regarding segment or consolidated performance for 2016 does not include the transaction we have announced today.", "Now digging into the results, starting on slide seven, at the consolidated level, our revenue before reimbursables increased 13.3% for the quarter, resulting in a full-year increase for 2015 of 14%. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $195 million and $833.9 million for the year, representing a year-over-year increase of $121.7 million or 17.1%. Finally, on adjusted EPS from continuing operations, the $0.57 for the quarter allowed for a $2.46 adjusted EPS on a yearly basis, which represents a 25.5% increase from prior year and in line with our guidance range we provided last quarter of $2.43 to $2.47.", "This EPS performance was driven by the fantastic results from our segments, the tax benefits that I mentioned last quarter as well as other drivers. On a comparative basis for the quarter, the $0.01 decline from last year was primarily due to a one-time item in 4Q of 2014 in our International segment, higher incentive compensation in 2015 versus 2014 and strategic investments in net spend among other items.", "Before I leave the consolidated financial highlights, I want to point out that our quarterly revenue growth of 13.3% and the yearly revenue growth of 14% is all organic and was driven by cross-segment organic performance across our businesses throughout the year. And our ability to take that revenue growth to the bottom line was seen in our margin expansion for the year. This combination of pure organic revenue growth with margin expansion is the key takeaway from our 2015 consolidated results.", "Now to explain our results in more detail let's turn to slide nine, and I will cover our North America segment first. The key headline on the North America segment is the same as it has been all year, and that is mid-to-high teen organic revenue growth. Revenue before reimbursables for the segment was up 17.5% for the quarter to $300.3 million versus the fourth quarter of last year. As you can see on the chart, the business has had an impressive string of positive revenue growth and the 20.2% organic revenue growth for the year is the highest yearly revenue growth for this business since 1999.", "We had started the year expecting this business to grow in the mid-teen range of organic growth, so the 20.2% growth level exceeded our expectations for the year, which was largely driven by the successful conversion of a large client and better organic growth with our customers. Also contributing was the growth in our core offerings as well as other services to include fraud, loyalty, card production and managed services. We began the year expecting this revenue growth to be achieved at roughly the same margin levels that we saw in 2014, but to perform in a tighter quarterly band, and that's exactly what happened in 2015. Segment margin expanded from 36.8% in 2014 to 37.4% in 2015.", "On the volume front, total accounts on file for the quarter increased 18.9% with our traditional accounts on file increasing 37.3%, taking us to an all-time high of 415 million traditional accounts on file. I mentioned on our last call that the total accounts on file would start showing some declines due to the previously announced deconversions of RushCard and Green Dot. This is why we continue to discuss the traditional accounts on file metric, which excludes prepaid, government services, and single-use accounts that can vary substantially and are less correlated to revenue. We couldn't be more pleased with the performance of this North America segment both on a quarterly and full-year basis. The business is positioned well for 2016 as we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth for this segment in 2016 with slightly expanding margins.", "Now I want to move to the International segment highlights on slide 10, where the key headline, as Troy discussed, is the achievement of a full-year margin of 18.1%. We announced this as a target four years ago, and the management team in this segment has had a laser focus to not only improve margins, but to enhance the business model as well. And we are proud of this achievement.", "Segment revenue for the quarter was $87.1 million, down 6.2% on a reported basis and down 0.6% on a constant currency basis. I highlighted in our third quarter call that the last six quarters of solid constant currency revenue growth would likely not continue in the fourth quarter due to a one-time item in the fourth quarter of 2014 that provides a challenging grow over comparison. Excluding the impact of this one-time item, constant currency revenue was up 6.3%, which is a better reflection of the performance of the segment.", "The revenue growth for the quarter was again fueled by the four new clients we converted since 2014. These new clients, coupled with our existing client base are outperforming the market. And as we mentioned on previous calls, they are lifting the segment from being a roughly flat constant currency growth picture to one of low to mid-single digits.", "On the margin front, I called out on our last call that we expected the margin to decline in the fourth quarter from fourth quarter 2014 levels due to the one-time item in 4Q of 2014 that I mentioned earlier. And from a volume perspective, accounts on file grew $11.9 million compared to the same quarter of last year, over half of which was due to new clients. This means we continue to break records for the number of accounts processed in this segment now standing at 78.5 million accounts on file. I would like to emphasize again that most of this growth is in commercial card and single-use accounts. As in previous quarters, we also experienced significant growth in the debit portfolios we process. The segment experienced high single-digit transaction growth with same-client transactions growing by 6.7%.", "In summary on International, we're pleased with the continued execution of margin improvement coupled with a steady constant currency revenue growth picture; and for 2016 for this segment, we expect constant currency revenue growth in the flat to low single-digit range with a slightly improving margin picture.", "Now onto the Merchant segment, on slide 11, where the key headline for this segment is organic growth, driven by both lines of business, shifting the indirect line of business from being a headwind to finally being a tailwind for this segment during the quarter. The split in our revenue mix is now 61% direct and 39% indirect. Revenue in the direct line of business increased 15.4% for the quarter from last year with SBS sales volume also experiencing double-digit growth of 11.3% for the quarter.", "On the indirect side, we continue to retain our core customers, renewing two of our top 25 this quarter while also bringing on new customers signing two new full service agreements during the quarter. A key take away is that we achieved positive growth in our indirect business for the quarter and year, and that is a major accomplishment for this side of the business given the pressures it has had over the last several years. Segment margins declined 210 basis points for the fourth quarter due to some one-time expenses we chose to make around efficiency improvement in this segment.", "Overall, it was a strong quarter and year for the Merchant segment and we are well-positioned on this front to capture more market share in the future and expect the 2016 revenue growth for this segment to be in the mid-single digit range for the year with slightly improving margins from 2015 levels.", "Now I want to talk about the fantastic performance of the NetSpend segment starting on slide 12. The highlight for this segment is the 20.9% organic revenue growth for the quarter, bringing the overall revenue growth of NetSpend for the year over the 20% mark at 20.2%. The strength in NetSpend's organic growth is derived from a combination of its winning management team coupled with market differentiated channel offerings and excellent strategic execution to produce these outstanding results in this competitive and fast moving sector of the payments industry.", "While this business outperformed our revenue growth expectations, we did comment this time last year that we would invest in our business for growth; it could cause some margin pressure and that's exactly what happened in our fourth quarter with our quarterly adjusted operating margin of 19.9%, delivering a yearly margin of 23.7%, which is down from the 26.6% in 2014.", "I want to point out that these are investment cycle decisions that we're glad to make to support the business growth and we will continue to make these decisions on a go-forward basis as long as we see the line-of-sight path to growth. The volume growth behind these results is equally as impressive. We saw 17.7% growth in our direct deposit active cards to 1.9 million for the quarter. We finished the quarter with $5.7 billion in GDV, up 21.3%.", "While our card and volume levels continue to increase, we're also constantly focused on expanding our distribution reach by adding approximately 7,000 distributing employers and locations in the quarter, bringing the current total to more than 96,000. One of the most noteworthy contributors to the fourth quarter increase in distributing locations and employers was our launch in Rite Aid stores, a multi-year distribution relationship that we signed last quarter.", "Overall, 2015 was a banner year for NetSpend. Our expectation right now for this business is for the revenue growth for 2016 to be in the low double-digit growth range on a full year basis with a slightly expanding margin, although we could choose to make investment decisions for growth later in the year in 2016, as we did this year, that could impact margin.", "Turning back to the consolidated results on slide 13, our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 23.4%, and we finished the year with an adjusted operating margin of 26.7%, as seen on page 14, which was primarily fueled by the improving year-over-year margins in three of our four segments. This consolidated margin falls into the range that we anticipated at the beginning of the year, and we expect the consolidated operating margin in 2016 to slightly improve from this current level.", "I want to state that slides 13 and 14 provide a bridge between the adjusted segment operating income for each of our segments and our consolidated adjusted operating income. We provide this because our segments report their results on an adjusted segment operating income basis, which excludes amortization of acquisition intangibles, NetSpend M&A expenses, corporate admin and stock-based compensation.", "Now let's talk about our cash position for a moment. We ended the year at $389 million in cash, a $59 million decrease from the third quarter of last year. Our largest cash outflow of $159 million was related to our stock repurchase, with the next being about $67 million of CapEx, of which about 12% was related to contract acquisition costs, with 27% related to property and equipment and the remaining 61% being related to internally developed and licensed software.", "On cash flow, on slide 16, our free cash flow for the quarter was $72.5 million, resulting in a full year free cash flow of $397 million and slightly below the $420 million to $440 million we had projected. But as I said on our last call, we had some decisions that we made regarding CapEx in the fourth quarter that were good for the business long term, so we made them.", "For 2016, we expect our capital expenditures to be in a similar range as 2015 levels, and we estimate that free cash flow will be in the $470 million to $500 million range for the full year of 2016, an approximate increase of 18% to 26% from 2015 levels. This growing level of free cash flow is another strong indicator of the health of the business and the ability of our businesses to generate strong free cash flow.", "As it relates to shares, as Troy mentioned, we repurchased 3 million shares for $158.6 million during the quarter, which resulted in a total amount of shares repurchased in 2015 of 5.2 million. As a result, we ended the year with 182.8 million of common shares outstanding, with the average basic weighted shares outstanding at 184.1 million.", "On taxes, we ended the year at an effective tax rate of 29.9%, which was about 300 basis points better than we expected at the start of the year, and we believe our estimated tax rate for 2016 to return to the more historical range of 32% to 34%. I want to point out that this 300 basis point increase in tax rate change in 2016 expected levels from 2015 levels is the main driver as to why our expected adjusted EPS growth rate is not in the same range as the expected growth rate in adjusted EBITDA or operating income.", "And speaking of 2016, as it relates to guidance on page 17, we highlight our full-year consolidated guidance: total revenue growth of 4% to 6%, revenues before reimbursable growth of 5% to 7% and adjusted EPS from continuing operations of 4% to 7% growth. We also expect consolidated adjusted margin to increase by approximately 100 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margin to increase by approximately 100 basis points.", "Obviously, this guidance hinges upon the assumptions I've already mentioned and the ones mentioned on page 44 in the presentation. And I want to highlight that this guidance reflects the excellent operating leverage we continue to get, as if you remove the 300 basis point increase in our tax line, you see the growth on the bottom line exceeding our revenue growth by several percentage points. Also, this expected margin expansion is driven by expanding margins in all our businesses, continuing the trend of cross-segment delivery of performance we saw in 2015.", "And finally, I want to mention some full year call-outs that I think are key takeaways from today. The first call-out is on organic growth. The fourth quarter was similar to the third quarter in that with no acquisitions completed during the quarter, it allows for organic growth clarity in our results. When you look at the 17.5% quarterly revenue growth in North America, the constant currency revenue growth net of one-time item comparisons in International, the 15% direct acquiring revenue growth in Merchant, and the 20.9% revenue growth in NetSpend, all coming from non-acquisition activity, you see a strong picture of organic revenue growth that played out throughout the year. While the overall organic growth number is strong, we're equally pleased with the cross-segment delivery of organic growth that each of our businesses has delivered.", "The second major call-out is on margins. Each of our four segments delivered margins that were either in excess or generally met our previously communicated expectations for the year. The margin profile of our segments are strong relative to their respective competitors, and the ability to drive margin expansion or stability while also investing in the business was a big accomplishment for 2015.", "And the third and final call-out is related to how the performance of 2015 positions us for 2016 and beyond. Our North America organic growth story with a platform now of 415 million traditional accounts on file, our International margin progress, coupled now with a strengthening growth effort, our improving segment revenue picture in Merchant, and strong double-digit revenue growth at NetSpend all delivered with competitively strong margins, all at the same time, paints a picture of TSYS that is unlike any in our history.", "It is a unique time for a company to have all businesses performing in the manner that our segments are performing; and specifically, we want to thank each and every team member from across the globe who worked so hard to deliver the performance we've announced today. Without their daily efforts and commitment, none of this would be possible.", "Now I want to turn it back over to Troy to discuss this exciting transaction that we announced today.", "M. Troy Woods - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Paul. I'll provide some additional transaction details, beginning on slide 20.", "As all of you know, our intent over the past year or so has been to grow the scale and position of our Merchant business through accretive M&A. With the acquisition of TransFirst, we will have a winning combination of technology, scale, and partner-centric distribution capabilities that propels us to a leadership position in the acquiring market. Importantly, TransFirst's focus on partner-centric, vertically specialized distribution will accelerate our growth within the highly attractive integrated payments space. Post closing, this specific distribution model will comprise approximately 20% of the revenue of the combined businesses. Based on an analysis by First Annapolis Consulting, on a pro forma basis, this would make TSYS the third largest integrated payment provider in the U.S.", "As I have said before, I believe the winners in merchant acquiring will be the scaled players with integrated capabilities and a diverse distribution network. This transaction with TransFirst strengthens our sales and distribution network with the addition of over 1,300 partners and more than 350 sales professionals, enhancing our access to high growth, strategically attractive vertical markets such as healthcare, B2B and not for profit.", "In addition to the many strategic benefits, the transaction is financially attractive from both an earnings and valuation perspective. We currently expect the transaction to be accretive in the low double digits to adjusted EPS for the first full year post-closing. The transaction will be an all-cash transaction with an implied multiple of 13.8 times estimated 2016 adjusted EBITDA.", "On a pro forma basis, our balance sheet will continue to remain strong, as our investment grade rating is important to us. We are confident that the combined valuation and synergies will drive material shareholder value. A contributing factor to these financial benefits is the size and attractive growth profile of the industry itself.", "As you can see on slide 21, the U.S. acquiring market is a very large market. It is the largest addressable market in which TSYS participates. A materially significant portion of the $13 billion addressable market is the small and medium sized business segment, which represents approximately 75% of the total acquiring revenue pool. This segment of the market is currently and will continue to be our primary focus. The overall acquiring market is growing, almost twice the projected growth rate of U.S. GDP. Driving that attractive growth are e-commerce and integrated payments, which are growing at 10% and 12% respectively.", "This acquisition, coupled with our existing business dramatically improves our competitive position within these two important areas as you can see on slide 22 how they will contribute to our merchant transformation. At the end of the day, TSYS needed to enhance its Merchant business in order to remain competitive in the rapidly changing acquiring landscape.", "Today, with the acquisition of TransFirst, we are transforming our Merchant business to one which has a strong competitive position in high growth areas of the market, a business mix where over 80% of the segment's revenue will come from direct acquiring and scale across all key metrics: merchants, transactions and sales volume. Together, these attributes contribute to an improved growth profile and leadership position for the Merchant segment.", "We believe it is a strategic imperative to hold a leadership position in the markets in which we play. Slide 23 shows that this combination positions us as the sixth largest U.S. merchant acquirer based on net revenue with three strategically important benefits. One, an expanded sales and distribution network; two, a stronger integrated payments channel; and three, enhanced multi-channel payment solutions.", "With this established leadership position in all of our businesses, we have created a strong, unique and balanced portfolio positioned across the payment spectrum as indicated on slide 24. We have incredible strength in our issuer processing business, touching more than 700 billion card holders and 400 payment providers around the globe. Our market share reaches almost 40% of all credit cards in the United States, and we are the number one provider of these services in the United States and China and number two in Europe. Through our combinations with TransFirst, we will service more than 645,000 merchant outlets, process approximately 117 billion in annual volume and leverage over 2,300 distribution partners.", "In our NetSpend business, we rank number one based on gross dollar volume and number two based on revenue. TSYS now reaches several hundred banks, hundreds of thousands of businesses and millions of consumers. The scale, reach, and distribution network we are creating positions us to serve as a single destination for unparalleled payment technologies and enhanced services to the constituents we serve in a space undergoing massive change.", "We are excited to have John and the TransFirst team on board and are confident that through our combined talents, expertise and strengths, we will continue to win in the market.", "Now I would like to turn it over to John Shlonsky to make a few comments.", "John Shlonsky - President & Chief Executive Officer, TransFirst LLC", "Thank you, Troy.", "I'm so excited for all of us here at TransFirst and TSYS. We have actually been partners for quite some time. TransFirst has and still utilizes TSYS for front-end, back-end and gateway services. The combination of the two organizations makes perfect sense and gives us a strong leadership position in acquiring. I can tell you firsthand, my interaction with TSYS and particularly with the executive team, makes me feel confident that our values in how treat each other and our clients are firmly aligned.", "On slide 26, let me tell you a little bit about TransFirst and how our value proposition will be further enhanced as part of TSYS. First, we operate a partner-centric model. This model enables us to gain access to a large number of SMB merchants in a scalable and cost-effective manner. Joining TSYS will enable us to bring even stronger solution to these partners. Second, we operate a single integrated platform. This platform actually evolved from our utilization of TSYS payment solutions. Our mission with TSYS is to leverage our joint capabilities and products to our customers in a seamless way so they can rely on just one provider for all of their processing requirements.", "Third, it will be increasingly important to develop customized and user-friendly solutions that enable our merchant customers to sell our products in the store, on the Internet or remotely through a mobile device on our platform. And lastly, all of the information used has been built around a single database. This really provides customers with a high level of technical and customer service and support. For example, we provide error-free boarding in minutes, automatic credit approval, one-call resolution 85% of the time. We will strive to leverage best practices across both Merchant segments as we integrate these two already great companies.", "Slide 27 really illustrates how fortunate we are with this new partnership to have some businesses that overlap and some that complement our total addressable market. This is the clearest example of our go-to-market strategy. TransFirst goes to market with two distinct models: an integrated and a referral partnership model. Our integrated model is where partners really require more vertical expertise and technical specialization. Our referral partners will focus more on our service model and our product capabilities. Both of these models leverage our platform and our product set.", "Similar to TSYS, we work with financial institutions, trade associations, national business service providers to provide payments and solutions to their base and new merchant customers. These solutions provide enhanced brand loyalty and revenue opportunities for all of our combined referral partners. TransFirst and TSYS will combine automation and technology to support an integrated platform that will seamlessly deliver relevant products and solutions to our partners and merchants, not just process transactions. Our goal is for any merchant from any partner to have complete access to relevant and easy-to-use payment solutions.", "So on slide 28: why are we so excited? This is a strong cultural fit. Both companies share deep ethical values of doing the right thing and treating people right with shared values around integrity, trust, innovation and partnerships, relationships, ease of integration. The flexibility of TransFirst single platform that we've developed working with TSYS technology will allow for this easier transition. Our enhanced offerings, by leveraging each other's strengths, this allows us to bring best-in-class products and solutions to all of our partners and merchants, and most importantly, really foster a holistic growth. Now, this transaction will provide TSYS significant scale and strength across issuing processing, merchant services and prepaid program management.", "We are very, very happy about this partnership. We have some work to do, but couldn't be more excited to merge these two great organizations.", "I would now like to turn it back over to Paul.", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "Thank you, John, and I want to reiterate my excitement about this transformational acquisition.", "Looking at slide 30, as Troy said, we've entered into a definitive agreement to acquire TransFirst for $2.35 billion in an all-cash transaction. We anticipate the transaction will produce low double-digit adjusted EPS accretion in the first 12 months, excluding one-time deal-related expenses.", "The transaction will be funded with fully committed debt financing. At closing, on a pro forma basis, we will have approximately $3.8 billion of debt, and pro forma leverage for our company is expected to be approximately 3.9 times debt-to-trailing 12-months pro forma EBITDA. The strong cash flow generation of the business allows us to get back to our long-term target leverage ratio of the low to mid twos within 24 months of closing. We will limit our share buyback and acquisition activity during this period until we achieve our more targeted leverage ratios, and we are committed to our investment-grade rating.", "We're excited about the leadership of John and his team as they will be able to expand upon the great results I talked about from our Merchant segment earlier. We're also excited about the expense synergy opportunity from the efficiencies we can realize in our combined businesses. As such, we currently estimate we would generate at least $15 million of cost synergies in calendar year 2017, with that almost doubling to the range of $25 million to $30 million in calendar year 2018. And as I said, we expect the deal to produce low double-digit adjusted EPS accretion in the first 12 months after close, net of one-time related expenses with $5 million of synergies, and move to the mid to high double-digit range over the longer term as larger synergies are captured over time.", "This also does not reflect the anticipated revenue synergies that we believe are attainable from this new payments platform company. This new combined Merchant segment will be able to work with our strong issuer processing business, specifically with the bank referral partner business of TransFirst and with NetSpend, specifically with their pay card business. While these revenue synergies may take some time to materialize given the strong organic growth nature of each of these businesses on their own, there clearly is an opportunity set of revenue growth here that we expect to achieve. And this is a unique combination of capabilities and payments for one company to leverage.", "Given the strong historical track record of non-acquisition fueled organic growth from TransFirst, coupled with our Merchant segment's embedded organic growth capabilities and the overall organic growth of TSYS, we believe the combined organic growth profile of the company will be improved and will be unique in the payments industry as to its balance and diversification of payments related growth.", "While we have provided revenue before reimbursable guidance today in the 5% to 7% range, all organically, we expect the combination of TransFirst's historically organic double-digit revenue growth to improve TSYS's revenue growth profile by approximately 100 basis points annually on a pro forma basis. After closing, we will obviously come back and revise our 2016 guidance to reflect the positive impact we expect this combination to have on our 2016 financial results.", "Now on slide 31, I hope you can see why this acquisition is so compelling, as it establishes TSYS as a clear leader in this highly attractive market, accelerating our growth in integrated payments and strengthening our partnership distribution capabilities. These, coupled with the expected financial benefits I just reviewed, and under John's leadership, signal that we have completed another step in fulfilling our strategic vision of being the leading global payment solutions provider.", "And with that, we will open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays.", "James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. Thanks, guys, for taking my questions. This is James Berkley for Darrin. I just had a \u2013 congratulations on the deal. It looks like a great deal.", "I had a quick question on two things. I guess, first just on the indirect side if you could talk a little bit in more detail on what was driving that outsized growth? And then second, if you could just talk on the quarter and help us understand going forward how we should think about \u2013 I know you gave some guidance on margins in particular going forward in the North American Merchant Services segment, et cetera, but just \u2013 we saw some contraction there. I think about 200 basis points in the Merchant Services and then 400 or so on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter in North America. And I think we saw extremely strong top line growth, but I think just that contraction there just maybe drove EPS a little bit lower than we had personally anticipated.", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "Yes, James, so this is Paul. On both of those questions, on the indirect side, on the Merchant business, really two things there: one, we saw good organic growth in our indirect customers that was the primary driver for that growth. We also had some good product growth in that business that came through, as well as a few other items. So it was kind of a combination of factors, but the strongest factor was the organic growth of the processing customers that are in that indirect side of the business. And as it relates to margins, I think you know as it relates to 2016 margins, I commented in my prepared remarks on all of the different segment margins that we are expecting yearly margins to increase slightly in each one of our segments. And so I certainly would address the North America segment margin story.", "I think as I also commented, as it relates to fourth quarter margin, we did see, given the banner years that we had in kind of really all of the segments in the fourth quarter, we did have some incentive compensation and some pay relative to the team members delivering this great performance that impacted the fourth quarter margins. But I think the bigger story that you want to take away from a margin standpoint is strong margins, certainly in North America and we see that margin picture expanding in 2016.", "James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks. And then just real quick, if you don't mind commenting on the international pipeline as well, how that's looking? And then it just \u2013 it seems like maybe on the North American side organically if you're just looking at the kind of build you guys have on accounts on file that there could potentially be some upside to that mid-single-digit number? I just wanted to get your thoughts on those, especially on the international pipeline. Thanks.", "M. Troy Woods - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, James, Troy. And I'll take that on the front end, and Paul may want to add on the back end. But as Paul indicated in his prepared remarks that we continue to set records in the International segment for accounts on file and continues to grow. As it relates to the pipeline, we're sitting on several conversion related activities and several very important launches that should generate over 2 million accounts over the next 18-plus months.", "Paul, I don't know if you want to add to that.", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "Yes. I think the only thing I would add on the final part of that question as it relates to the North America organic growth picture, we did say mid-single digits, but I think it's important to remember that we do have the full effect of the two previously announced deconversions of Green Dot and Rush that are providing some headwind on that growth rate for the North America segment. So as I've commented before, over a longer period, we still think that's a mid to high single-digit revenue growth picture for North America, but it trends towards the middle side with these two headwinds of the deconversions on the prepaid processing side.", "James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "That makes a lot of sense. I'll turn it over.", "Operator", "The next question is from Timothy Willi at Wells Fargo.", "Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thanks. Good afternoon. Two questions, one on the North American business, and then I guess overall guidance around TransFirst. With that one first, Paul, when you say the double digits, I just want to clarify; is that nominal EPS contribution or is that accretion to the growth rate of the company when you talk low double-digits?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "Yeah, so that would be nominal EPS accretion, low double-digit.", "Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. And you said a $5 million number, I think, tied to the accretion in the first 12 months. Is that sort of the initial band of synergies? And then moving forwards that $25 million to $30 million eventually around 2018?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "That's exactly right, Tim.", "Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Perfect. And then just my question on North America, I guess just \u2013 I think typically you comment sort of on same-customer metrics, whether it's volume or transactions, just to get a better feel for the underlying business. Could you just give us some commentary there? I didn't see it in the slide deck.", "M. Troy Woods - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Same-client transactions for North America in the fourth quarter were about just under 10%.", "Tim, did you get that?", "Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "I did. Yes. Sorry. I got that.", "M. Troy Woods - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you. I'm sorry.", "Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "No problem. I'll jump back in the queue for follow-ups. Thanks.", "M. Troy Woods - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thank you. Hi, Troy. Hi, Paul. Congratulations on the quarter and deal.", "M. Troy Woods - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey. Thank you, Ashwin.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "And, John, congratulations to you as well. I just want to go back to the margin question. So was incentive compensation, was that adjustment all taken in 4Q? And how much was it? And then related question is, what do you mean by \"slight\" margin improvement? Obviously we all understand the need to make ongoing investments. Can (48:18) maybe commit to a minimum level of margin improvement?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "Yes, Ashwin. So as it relates to the specific incentive, I'd comment that that's kind of more \u2013 it's not something I'd want to isolate out. It's more broad \u2013 kind of a broad-based brush I would paint with that. And then as it relates to the margin expansion, I think that when I'm saying slight margin expansion, I mean less than 100 basis points. And so if you wanted to put it in a band, it's not greater than 100 basis points, but it's in, call it, a band of 25 basis points to the 100-basis point range would be the right kind of bandwidth there.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Got it. And the nature of the ongoing investments, if you can comment on what you're investing in and how long those investments might continue?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "So, as it specifically relates to the investment that I was referring to earlier, I think you're referencing the comments I made around NetSpend, and specifically on those investments, which we made in the fourth quarter of this year, and as I made some commentary around our expected margin expanding for next year in NetSpend, those are primarily around marketing. And so, obviously, we want to invest in marketing where we can see good line-of-sight growth. And so we've had those opportunities to gain market share, and so we're glad to spend that marketing money to be able to grow the business. So those are what I'd call discretionary spends around marketing that produce the kind of growth that we want to achieve.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Got it. And if I can sneak one more in, can you comment on the CFPB? I mean, I haven't seen anything come through. How does that \u2013 how are you planning for the evolution of the overdraft product? If you can provide some color around that, that'd be great. Thank you.", "M. Troy Woods - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, as you may know, Ashwin, the CFPB has indicated that there was going to be a slight delay and pushed out toward the end of the first quarter. And really beyond that, that's all we know. We continue to work and move forward as if the proposed rules are going to be very, very similar to the final rules. So, we'll certainly let you know a lot more about that as we get these final rules published.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from James Rutherford at Stephens.", "Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.", "Hey, guys. This is Brett Huff. How are you?", "M. Troy Woods - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Brett.", "Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.", "Congrats on the deal, everybody. A couple of quick questions on TransFirst while we've got some of the folks there, John, if you have a second. I was just looking at some of the financial numbers that are out there on TransFirst, and it looks like there was maybe $117 million of EBITDA in 2014, and it looks like the implied EBITDA range based on the valuation is about $170 million. That implies something like a 20% EBITDA growth. Is that the right math we should be doing from a profit growth point of view of your business?", "John Shlonsky - President & Chief Executive Officer, TransFirst LLC", "It's exactly the right math.", "Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.", "Okay. And then the leadership after this, John, how will you be integrated into the leadership? Will you be sticking around to manage the business? How will that look at the end of the day?", "M. Troy Woods - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Brett. I'll make a first shot at that, and John can certainly add to it. As I indicated \u2013 we indicated in the press release, that upon closing of the transaction, John will become Senior Executive Vice President of TSYS and President of our combined Merchant segment, reporting directly to me.", "Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.", "That's great. That's what I needed. Thanks again.", "M. Troy Woods - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Bryan Keane at Deutsche Bank.", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi, guys. I just want to go back on the operating margins in the fourth quarter for North America. I know they were down 430 basis points. It sounds like there was some bonus structure there. But the margins were up every quarter until the fourth quarter, and they're down quite a bit. So I'm trying to figure out if there was one-time impacts besides maybe some cost bonus structure? Or \u2013 and the follow-on question to that is what will \u2013 will it continue into next year and be kind of a negative comp, especially maybe for the first half?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "So sure, Bryan. This is Paul. I think as it relates to the margin for the fourth quarter, obviously, the compensation picture is one of those. Obviously, this deconversion that I talked about in the third quarter obviously kind of is playing in there as well. And so among some other things, that's at play there.", "As I commented on the expected margin picture for 2016 for North America, we expect margin to improve. And so there's not \u2013 this isn't like some turn in kind of the margin profile of the business, and we do expect to have kind of an improving margin picture on a whole basis for 2016 in the first half of the year, with a little bit more depression on the second half of the year. But when you look at it on a yearly basis, it is an improving picture than what it is for 2015.", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Okay, got it. And then just on the proposed rules, I know the final rules aren't there, but if the proposed rules go in place, what kind of impact can we expect to the NetSpend business? Maybe you can help us quantify some of the impact so people can get a handle around it? Thanks.", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "So Bryan, yes. I think I'd just point you back to what we've said on that in the past, as a data point of when NetSpend was a separate public company they reported that overdraft represented 7% of their revenue for GPR cards, and then you'd obviously have to add in several percentage points on top of that 7% to be able to account for pay card overdraft to get to a picture of what overdraft revenue looks like in the NetSpend revenue stream. So that would be, from a revenue standpoint; obviously there's also some other costs related to compliance that we'd need to factor in. But those would be the two comments I'd point to around that.", "Operator", "The next question is from Vasu Govil at Morgan Stanley.", "Vasu Govil - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess a couple of quick clarifications on NetSpend. You alluded to potentially making some more marketing related expenses in the second half in 2016. Is that already captured into the margin guidance for expansion or could we see margins not expand if you were to make those investments?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "So this is Paul. Clearly, had we decided not to make those investments in the fourth quarter, the margin profile for the fourth quarter would have been very commensurate with the margin for the third quarter. So yes, they did, that was \u2013 those marketing investments were the central driver between the margin drop between the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And as I said about our margin expanding on a year-over-year basis between 2015 and 2016 for NetSpend, obviously, there is a higher expense base that's already now built into the 2015 numbers related to that higher level of marketing spend.", "So, we'll continue to look at that as we progress in 2016. We expect, as I said, the margin to expand in 2016, but I also said if an opportunity presents itself like it did this year, in the latter part of 2016, for us to invest for future growth in this business, we may make that decision. I think I'd point out that that's one of the benefits of having strong businesses all together inside of TSYS is we're able to make decisions around pro-growth things that on one specific segment might depress a segment margin, but on the overall basis, we're still very margin strong. And so that's exactly the situation that we had with NetSpend. I've commented on this in the earlier part of the year that we might make those investment decisions, and certainly, we did here in the latter part of the third quarter and in the fourth quarter.", "Vasu Govil - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "A quick follow-up on the North America business. The mid-single-digit revenue growth expectation there, is that mostly on account of the organic growth you were seeing in the underlying portfolio or does that contemplate any potential for a notable new wins in conversion? Just trying to get a sense for how conservative the guidance there is.", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "It's actually a blend of both. So it's a blend of the organic growth of the installed base as well as the impact of the 2D conversions that we've talked about from the prepaid processing side with Rush and Green Dot.", "Operator", "The next question is from Gary Wei at SIG.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Hi. It's actually Jamie Friedman. Let me echo congratulations on the deal. I just want to follow up to your last comment, Paul. You did call out that it contemplates deconversions, meaning like your mid-single-digit growth. But does it contemplate any conversions?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "Nothing of any significance.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Okay. That was just a side. My other questions were about the slide 22, if I could. This is the one where you talk about the combined entities. The \u2013 so when you're going from 60/40 direct/indirect to 81/19 direct/indirect, I'm not sure of the math on this, but does that imply that TransFirst was almost entirely direct?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "That is correct.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Okay. And then the last thing is the public filing suggests TransFirst was doing about 13% growth in the nine months. When you say mid single digit goes to high single digit, I just want to make sure I'm getting this right; that's on the combined entity or that's on Merchant specifically?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "Okay. So on the \u2013 my comments around the mid-single digit to high single digit was specifically earlier around our North America segment where we had made comments around what's kind of the longer term growth rate of the North America segment. That was \u2013 I wasn't referencing the overall consolidated picture. What we have said is on a standalone basis, we expected mid-single-digit growth for our Merchant segment on a standalone basis. And you are right in what the kind of double-digit organic growth picture of TransFirst has been historically. They have a very strong track record of double-digit organic growth. And when you put all that together on a kind of a pro forma basis, we do believe that on a total company basis that additive growth will lift our revenue growth rate by roughly about 100 basis points annually.", "Operator", "The next question is from David Togut at Evercore ISI.", "David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC", "Thank you, and congratulations. Just two quick questions; the first is how does TransFirst state its EBITDA margin? Are you effectively showing residual payments to your network as a contra-revenue item or as an expense?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "Sure, David. We will obviously move TransFirst over to our revenue convention, and so we'll be working on that over the time between the signing and close. I'll point out, though that under kind of our conventions, you'll expect to see the TransFirst margins to be right in line with our adjusted EBITDA margin overall. So our Merchant segment margin overall margins will be very similar on kind of a go-forward basis.", "David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC", "So what would TransFirst's EBITDA margin be if shown on a TSYS based reporting convention?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "So, it's just roughly the same as our EBITDA margin overall.", "Operator", "The next question is from Dave Koning at Baird.", "Dave Koning at Baird, please go ahead with your question.", "Adam F. Dahms - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hey, guys. This is Adam Dahms on for Dave Koning. I just had one quick clarification on \u2013 you said it was a nominal low double-digit accretion. Do you mean $0.10-plus accretion in 12 months or 10%?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "Yes, 10%.", "Adam F. Dahms - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Oh. Okay. All right. Perfect. That's all I had. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from George Mihalos at Cowen.", "George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Great. Thanks for taking my question, guys. And, Troy and John, congratulations; John, very much looking forward to working with you.", "John Shlonsky - President & Chief Executive Officer, TransFirst LLC", "Thanks, George.", "George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC", "I wanted to start off if we can focus a little bit on TransFirst, just two quick questions. One, the percentage of revenue tied to ipos (62:49) and the growth you're seeing there; and then maybe, Paul or John, if you can clarify for us what sort of the ending 2015 adjusted EBITDA is for standalone TransFirst as we go to kind of the 170 number in 2016? Thank you.", "John Shlonsky - President & Chief Executive Officer, TransFirst LLC", "Okay. George, I'll take the first question. Our ipos (63:11) rollout is going to be consistent with kind of the EMV rollout. So right now, our mobile solution has had strong account production growth. It's a small percentage of our total revenue, given the size of TransFirst and the volume. So I would say it's a smaller percentage of total revenue with more expansion, both on the tablet-based solution and the mobile as we transition a lot of the merchants from non-EMV-capable devices to a more robust solution.", "M. Troy Woods - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "And let me ask, George, were you making reference more to the integrated side when you said ipos (63:50), talking about the integrated, the ISV-", "George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Yes, exactly. Exactly.", "M. Troy Woods - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, as I said earlier, that was closer to the 29%, 30% of the revenue of TransFirst.", "George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Yes.", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "And George, as it relates to the EBITDA piece, I think in the kind of \u2013 if you look there, I think it's in the low 150s, would be kind of the numbers there for the ending 2015.", "George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay, great. If I could just squeeze one more in. Paul, just as we think about the North America margins throughout 2016, should they be sort of relatively uniform or are we sort of going back to some of the cadence we saw in prior years, where we start off at a lower base in the first quarter and build up as we go throughout the year?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "Yes. So it is in that tighter band. So it's not \u2013 it's more of this \u2013 what we saw in 2015 than in prior years, where you saw that step-up throughout the year. But as I said, we do expect a higher margin profile in the first half of the year relative to the second half of the year, which is the lasting effect of the deconversion of the prepaid processing that's impacting the second half of the year. But it is in this tighter band range, just like we had in 2015.", "Operator", "The next question is from Jason Kupferberg at Jefferies.", "Jason A. Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC", "Hey, guys. Thanks. Just a question on the financing; I know you said that it is committed. Can you just give us a sense of what you expect the blended interest rate there to be? And what the structure of the debt will look like?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "So, as it relates to the blended interest rate, I think about a 50 to 100-basis point increase from our blended rate today. As it relates to the structure, we'll come back as it relates to our overall guidance and give specifics around the structure.", "Jason A. Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. And then just a follow-up on the cost synergies, I know you said $25 million to $30 million in 2018. I guess I might have thought that the number could be a little big \u2013 maybe if you can put it in some context of the overall cost base and whether or not there's some opportunity for upside there. And maybe just talk a little about some of the specific sources of the cost synergy. How much of it might be kind of platform integration versus real estate, head count, whatever the case may be?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "Sure. So on that $25 million number, if you kind of look at that on a combined cost base, it's just a little over 3% of the combined cost base of the two merchant businesses. And I think it's important to point out that this is a growth-based acquisition. It is not an acquisition where it's around kind of making the financials work due to expense cuts. The TransFirst historical organic growth model is a double-digit organic growth model and what we now have in our Merchant business also is primed for very strong organic growth and so in putting these businesses together, we want to make sure that we're maximizing the organic growth capabilities while also obviously taking the expense synergies that are available to take.", "As it relates to platform, there is platform synergies today because the TransFirst business is already using predominately our front-end platform, so it isn't like typical acquisitions sometimes where you have two different platforms and you're kind of shutting down one platform to get a lion's share of the synergy. But instead, one where we're trying to make sure we maximize the efficiencies while not trying to hurt the revenue growth trajectory. And so this is \u2013 the synergies on the surface might look relatively smaller compared to maybe some other things that you compared against, but when you put it in that framework, it's one that feels very right obviously, there's some upside as we dig into this and if there's some upside, we'll obviously take that upside. But this is very comfortable with what we've done the work with to support the growth profiles of the business.", "Operator", "Our next question is from David Scharf with JMP.", "David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC", "Hi. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. A couple on the acquisition; first, as we think about the free cash flow guidance you provided for this year, obviously, you'll be scaling back, suspending share repurchases while you delever, but can you give us a little bit of a roadmap, perhaps, of how we ought to think about the pace of deleveraging over the first 18 months?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "Yes, so I think if you look at the free cash flow generation of us as well as the strong free cash flow generations of the TransFirst business which has very similar free cash flow generation characteristics to our business, you see about 75 basis points of deleveraging turn each year, and so over the first two years, that puts us back into that mid-two range of overall leverage. So just shy of kind of call it one turn of leverage in the first year.", "David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC", "Okay. And just so I interpreted that correctly, around $2.5 billion of debt by end of 2017. Was that what you were implying?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "2.5 times debt-to-EBITDA. So it kind of takes the 3.9 times down to the more kind of, call it, mid-two range.", "Operator", "The next question is from Steven Kwok at KBW.", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to touch back on TransFirst a little bit more. I guess in terms of the revenues, could you just give us any of the pro forma revenue numbers for 2015 and what you're thinking that's going to be for 2016?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "No, Steve. I think what would be probably most helpful is to kind of \u2013 obviously, TransFirst has filed an S1 out there as part of their IPO process, and so kind of go to that to look for a guide as it relates to that. And I think we've also said as it relates to what we are expecting from an adjusted EBITDA margin, and given some of the EBITDA numbers, you can probably get into the right zip code as it relates to the revenue \u2013 the net revenue on a relatively go-forward basis.", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Got it. And then just in terms of thinking about the accretion, just going back to that, if TransFirst closes in the second quarter, and compared to your current guidance, should your EPS growth then be in the 11% to 15% range? Is that the right way to think about it?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "Yes, Steve, I think what we'll do obviously is when we come back out with guidance and have the exact timing around close, we'll come back and give the specific guidance and what the impact is relative to the guidance we provided today on a standalone basis.", "Operator", "The next question is from Tom McCrohan at CLSA.", "Tom McCrohan - CLSA Americas LLC", "Hi. Thanks and congratulations on the acquisition. I have a question on the NetSpend guidance for low double-digit revenue growth. Does that include any benefit from the growth investments that were made during the quarter?", "M. Troy Woods - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Absolutely. But it also adds the headwind that Paul has talked about with the proposed rules that could be kicking in late fourth quarter.", "Tom McCrohan - CLSA Americas LLC", "Okay. And the growth investments, Troy, that were made, or were they investments that NetSpend has made previously as we've had some sort of expectation for some sort of return on that investment?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "Sure, Tom. I mean, we do. I mean, we clearly have our models around our investment spend, and we are constantly kind of testing that on a real-time basis as we're making that investment to make sure that we're seeing kind of a commensurate return. I think a perfect example of that is the way where we started at the beginning of the year with our revenue expectations and how we have outperformed that.", "And as we continue to invest in the business throughout the year, we got more confidence around investing more to be able to grab some share there. So I will say that the earlier comment that Troy made \u2013 we do not in that revenue growth for this year have any impact related to the CFPB. And so this is all just on kind of a pure organic growth basis. And like we started last year, we started with a revenue growth picture of NetSpend that got better throughout the year, and obviously that is something that we would like to be able to see in 2016 as well.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Glenn Greene at Oppenheimer.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Thanks. Good afternoon, and congratulations to all. A few clarifications; on the North America mid-single-digit growth, can you quantify directionally how much drag from the two deconversions you highlighted?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "So Glenn, this is Paul. When we came out and talked about those two deconversions, we roughly sized those at being just shy of kind of 2% of overall company revenue. And so that gives you kind of a guide as to the overall kind of sizing, but clearly, there's timing, there's different things at play there, so \u2013 but that gives you an overall sizing as to what those two businesses are from a size standpoint.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "And then just to clarify on both your comments and Troy's, I'm confused; is the potential CFPB drag included in the NetSpend guide or is not for 2016 and just-?", "M. Troy Woods - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "It is not, Glenn. I was incorrect, thinking that some of those items for those would be kicking in in late fourth quarter, but I was corrected real quick; no. We'll wait and get the final rule out end of first quarter. No, it is not included in our 2016 numbers.", "Operator", "The next question is from Jim Schneider at Goldman Sachs.", "James Edward Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Good afternoon, thanks for taking my questions, and congratulations Troy and John on the transaction.", "I was wondering if you could maybe step back for a second and look at the two traditional merchant services business at TSYS and then the transfers business and from both a distribution channel perspective and now also from a geographic perspective, look at some of the overlaps or non-overlaps and maybe highlight some of the areas where, for example, geographically, you have much broader coverage today within the U.S., you might actually seek to extend new investments to kind of fill in any of those gaps.", "M. Troy Woods - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, let me take the first part of that, Jim. And I'm sure John can add to it.", "Geographically, when we look at the geographical disbursement of their business, it's not too dissimilar from what you find when you look at the geographical disbursement of our business, on our direct business. You know the states that you find contributing the most are typically the same top five or six states, number one.", "Number two, I think John touched on this in his prepared remarks, that there are some overlaps; there are some complementary areas of his business. But I think one of the things that we find strengthening to us is that he is very strong in the FI side. And as you know, we're very strong on the FI side of the issuing. So we see that as a complement. We both are in the ISV business. Ours began approximately a year ago on a de novo basis. As we've indicated earlier, John's business is pushing 30% of his revenues in that space.", "So I think over the next 60 to 90 days, we obviously will have to take some real quality time to understand all of our go-to-market dynamics as we look at our sales force, his sales force, his partners and our partners. And I think we can shed a lot more light on that at our first quarter call.", "John, do you want to add to that?", "John Shlonsky - President & Chief Executive Officer, TransFirst LLC", "Sure. Thanks, Troy.", "Jim, I think when you think about the combined growth strategy, it's really a two-pronged approach, and I think it'll include long-term both U.S. and international. But it's really, the first prong is we need to sell more. We need to expand our partner-centric model, allowing more sustainable and predictable growth. I think the second portion of that strong in (1:17:25) selling more is really leveraging multichannel solutions for all merchants and really extending the products in a holistic way for all that TSYS has to offer.", "The second prong is really about losing less, leveraging great operating excellence, and really what Troy was touching on with the integrated division, continue to change the mix of our business to more integrated and high growth verticals really we'll change the business over time long term both, again, U.S. and again, long-term, internationally as well.", "James Edward Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "That's really helpful. Thank you. And then maybe as a quick clarification follow-up; if you look at the North American segment and the accounts on file come in at 654 at the end of the year, given the net effect is, as you look at the deconversions, are those deconversions fully in that number? And similarly, as you look at any additional pipeline that might be coming in, is that kind of a good baseline number to use for 2016 and use that as a base of growth in terms of accounts on file to grow from throughout the year?", "M. Troy Woods - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Jim, the 654 number that I mentioned in my prepared remarks for North America ending the fourth quarter is total accounts on file, so it includes all the accounts that we had, of course, on file at the end of the fourth quarter. I think Paul made a very good point earlier that I think for at least 2016, the number that I would pay particular attention to is the traditional accounts on file, which will exclude, as Paul indicated, our prepaid, government services and commercial cards, single-use. I believe that number was around 415 million. So that's probably the number that would be more relevant throughout the rest of this year as it relates to those two deconversions. Does that make sense?", "James Edward Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "It does. Thank you.", "M. Troy Woods - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from James Rutherford or Brett Huff at Stephens.", "Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.", "Hey guys. Just one question, follow-up on housekeeping: any assumption about currency in the forward guidance, Paul?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "So, we just obviously baked in what we are expecting from a currency standpoint that's baked in to the guidance like we typically do at the start of the year, so nothing that I'd call out there.", "Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.", "So it assumes rates as of today? Is that fair?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "It's more of kind of a blended outlook of our rates, of what we're expecting from a blended output kind of standpoint. So that's how we typically do it, not kind of on just a spot basis, but more on a blended outlook of what we're expecting throughout the year. So that's what it's based on.", "Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.", "And any specifics you can give us on what that number is?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "No. As it relates to what potential kind of headwinds that could \u2013 I think you could see maybe half of maybe 1% of headwinds that could be coming in on a total revenue basis of potential there. But that would be the only kind of topical level range I'd provide you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar at Citi.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hey guys. So a follow-up: given you already have financing for the deal lined up, does that mean you're already assuming the higher cost debt in your guide? I want to clarify relative to your comment that nothing about the deal is included in here.", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "That's right, Ashwin. There is nothing in the guidance relative to the deal. So, the higher cost of financing obviously will be referenced when we come out with the new guidance that has all of the effects of the deal in it.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Got it. And then sorry to belabor the point, but I'm still a bit confused about the North America margins because if you were sequentially flat, that would still be a delta of about $14 million, which seems like a big number for a growth comp (1:21:42). So I'm wondering if there was anything maybe in your value-add service that had a materially lower margin, maybe with regards to EMV or if there was a Canada tax impact in there or something else.", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "Well, without kind of providing a detailed reconciliation of each of the ins and outs \u2013 I mean there's a lot of moving parts. Obviously, as I talked about, we had a compensation impact as it relates to team member compensation. We actually had a higher percentage of managed services in the fourth quarter, which has a lower margin to it. We had this impact of the deconversion of the prepaid. We had some deferred BofA conversion costs in the fourth quarter that played an impact. So there's a lot of moving pieces there. I was just kind of calling out the topical ones.", "But I think the key point, Ashwin, on this is it's not a trend. It's not something that we're highlighting that has dramatically shifted in the overall margin of the business. And as I said, this is a business that we have pretty good insight into as it relates to what the margin profile looks like from a longer term point. And I had pointed to the margin level for the year, and we knew it was going to be in kind of a tighter band for the year. And like I said, we're expecting that margin profile to expand in 2016.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Timothy Willi at Wells Fargo.", "Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thanks. Two questions, one maybe a bit on the modeling; Paul, could you talk about I guess how you're thinking about \u2013 I guess you say you have (1:23:30) the debt committed, and I apologize if I missed it, but have you talked at all about sort of the cost of that and a band of interest rates or anything like that? Again, and maybe I missed it, but if you could just \u2013 any comment there?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "Sure, Tim. So I made a comment that I think an overall blended interest rate of an increase of 50 basis points to 100 basis points is probably the right range to be thinking about what that future interest kind of cost, all in, would look like. And so that's a comment I made earlier around the potential future interest. And I'll \u2013 like I said, when we come back out with guidance on the deal, we'll give complete clarity on structure, blended increase of interest rate and factor all that in relative to the accretion of the deal.", "Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. And then the other question I had, I think it might touch a bit on the question earlier about geographic overlap, but if there was \u2013 for John, or Troy or Paul, if there was, if you could take that $25 million to $30 million of synergies and decide to just reinvest it in an area of the Merchant business, whether that's geography or product or add-on acquisition, what would be the areas that you see the most promise or most excited about that are on the investment priorities that maybe aren't fully scaled or really yet even started, but you think could be pretty dynamic, if there are any?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP", "So I'll start off, and maybe John can layer on any comments he might have. But I think it's a very relevant question, relative to the sizing of that. When we came up with the synergies amounts, those were what we felt were the relevant expense synergies to still allow for the growth profiles of the business without starving the investments in those two businesses, which will be the one combined business. So, it's not one of those situations where we're providing a tradeoff, where you're having to not invest on the growth side because you've got some higher synergy number to try to make deal economics.", "That's one of the beauties of this transaction is the high accretive nature of the transaction without having to have a very high synergy number that can then cost you on the growth side because you're having to chase the synergies on the expense side and starve the growth profile. So with that being the overall wrapper, that's the machination of how we got to those relevant amounts. But in general, I'd say that obviously we'll be investing on the higher growth side of the business, which John has done in his business and we've been doing in our business, around the integrated side, the e-commerce side, and those differentiated distribution capabilities in high-growth verticals.", "And, John, I don't know if you have anything to add on that.", "John Shlonsky - President & Chief Executive Officer, TransFirst LLC", "I think you got it right. I think as we start thinking about where growth is coming from, again, we need to continue to build that partner-centric model and get more sustainable and predictive growth. Obviously, in the integrated channels is a big area of growth for us. But I wouldn't classify substituting the synergy savings as an investment, this transaction, because of the like-kind clients in other business units, really affords us a benefit to cross-sell and get introductions across the company here. I mean, I think it's longer term, but it's really unique; you're one of the few companies that have a long-term potential to leverage issuing, acquiring and prepaid in one location with like-kind clients. So we'll be taking advantage of that.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Shawn Roberts for closing remarks.", "Shawn Roberts - Senior Director-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Amy. I hope you all could hear how excited we are here about our 2015 results, our 2016 outlook, as well as the acquisition of TransFirst. As always, I'll be here for any follow-up questions you may have, so feel free to give me a call. And have a nice evening.", "Operator", "The conference is now concluded.

All participants will be listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over Shawn Roberts, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Shawn Roberts", "Thank you, Amy and welcome everyone. We will begin this evening\u2019s call with opening comments by TSYS\u2019s Chairman and CEO Troy Woods followed by TSS\u2019s CFO, Paul Todd who is going to review first quarter segment highlights and consolidated financials. After that we\u2019ll open the call up for Q&A.", "I\u2019d like to remind those of you participating in the Q&A that each person will have the ability to ask two questions before the operator is going to place you back in the queue.", "I\u2019ll now draw your attention to that we\u2019ll be making forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties factors that could cause TSYS\u2019s actual results differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in TSYS\u2019s reports filed with the SEC.", "At this point I\u2019ll turn the call over to Troy Woods.", "Troy Woods", "Thank you, Shawn good evening and welcome to our first quarter 2016 earnings call. This has been a terrific first quarter for TSYS and a very busy start of the year for all of us. By almost any measure the first quarter exceeded our expectations. Some of the highlights for the quarter that I would like to call out are net revenue of 12.7%, adjusted EPS increased 22.8% and overall margin expanded 178 basis points. These results are further confirmation that executing on our strategy is delivering exceptional results.", "On another high note, we were delighted to complete the acquisition of TransFirst on April 1st, just 64 days from our announcement. I\u2019m very proud of the teams who worked tirelessly to make this happen. And the more time we spend with John and his team at TransFirst the more impressed we are.", "TransFirst is willing to provide us the additional scale and reach in merchant acquiring to approach that of our issue of processing and prepaid businesses. Combining TSYS\u2019s merchant business with TransFirst positions us as the 6th largest U.S. merchant acquirer and the third largest integrated payments provider. John and his leadership team were well underway with integration positioning our new merchant segment to deliver on dynamic strategies that will be implemented over the next 6 to 18 months. With our exceptional performance in the first quarter, and with the addition of TransFirst, we are increasing our guidance for 2016. Paul will provide additional details on all of our revised guidance metrics later in our presentation.", "Since our fourth quarter call, Paul and I have had the opportunity to connect with many of you directly to hear what\u2019s on your mind. I thought it might be appropriate to take a moment to share my perspectives on a few of the topics that have been shared with us. The three most discussed topics have been one, capital allocation plans; two, go forward growth in our North America issuer segment; and three the potential impact of the proposed CFTB prepaid rules with respect to overdraft.", "In terms of our capital allocation strategy, we as previously discussed our principle of returning approximately 75% of our available free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In 2014 and 2015 we returned 94.4% and 92.3% respectively. This principle has always been balanced against the need to deploy capital to fund M&A opportunities.", "Our immediate priority and plan over the next 24 months is to use our strong free cash flow generation to delever our balance sheet until we get back to our long-term target leverage ratio. Stock buybacks, M&A activities along with ongoing investments to drive exceptional business results are all part of our capital allocation strategy to drive long-term shareholder value.", "As to our North America issuer processing growth prospects, in 2015 we performed a strategic analysis of our business and corporate strategy for long-term sustained growth. Among other things, we determined that we have significant potential for growth in our core issuer processing business both North America and international in the form of delivering and cross-selling new products and services that clients both need and would prefer to buy from us as a trusted provider than from someone else.", "As such we have made and continue to make significant investments with the goal of enhancing our technology infrastructure and modernizing the technology framework that sits on top of our four processing platforms. We\u2019re building an open real time platform that allows developers, partners and the greater fin tech community to easily connect and leverage TSYS\u2019s platforms so that we deliver innovative products and services faster and with greater quality so our teams can prototype, deploy and iterate faster than ever before.", "Today just under 18% of our revenue is delivered from value added products and services across our core issuer processing businesses. By aggressively developing and deploying new products and services, expanding our footprint and continuing to win new business. We believe we can continue to deliver growth in our core issuer processing business.", "And lastly on the subject of the proposed rules on prepaid from the CFPB and how they may impact big spend and its overdraft feature. The CFPB has not yet delivered their final rules relative to prepaid products. So I really don\u2019t have much of an update to what we previously disclosed. I will remind you however, that nearly 6,000 consumers have commented to the CFPB regarding the proposed rules.", "Recently cardholders from five states listed Washington DC to make their voices heard and asking Congress to engage with the CFPB to ensure that new regulations do not eliminate their access to opt in overdraft protection, which would leave hundreds of thousands of cardholders with very limited alternatives to meet their small and short-term liquidity needs.", "We also continue our discussions with the CFPB as well. Since the proposed rules were published in 2014, we have considered multiple scenarios and possible outcomes. When the final rules have published and after an adequate review period, we will share with you what it means to our business and what our litigation plans are.", "Let me now shift to a quick review of our business from a global perspective. In North America where nearly 70% of economic activity is consumer generated. The economy of sale is a direct measure of an improving employment market, relatively strong auto sales, some of the lowest gas prices in 12 years and improved consumer confidence. These are the real catalyst for sustained growth.", "Generally, our customers in both the United States and Canada are performing better than expected and better than many of their peers. And when they grow we grow with them. Against this macroeconomic backdrop, our North America issuing business in the first quarter produced record quarterly revenues, record operating income and record traditional accounts on file. And they also expanded margin by 257 basis points.", "Our merchant segment increased sales volume and direct revenue by double-digits and also increased their margin by 90 basis points. And NetSpend delivered record quarterly revenues, record GDV and record operating income. They also exceeded 100,000 distributing locations and employers for the quarter. We were very pleased with the performance of all of our North American businesses in the first quarter.", "Now let\u2019s take a look at the other economies around the globe where we do business. China\u2019s $11 trillion economy is moving away from its reliance on manufacturing towards services and consumer spending. This is good news for TSYS. China\u2019s bank card industry is growing at a fast pace. At the end of 2015, bank card issued in China ranked number one in the world and bank card consumption rates have accelerated to the same level of those in other developed markets.", "Innovative payment initiatives are thriving particularly in the mobile and internet payment space. Overall TSYS\u2019s joint venture with CUP Data is performing extremely well and we do not see a slowdown in that business. We still expect double-digit revenue and double-digit net income growth in 2016.", "Brazil\u2019s economy is facing one of the longest and harshest recessions in history, with growing unemployment, rising inflation, a weakening currency and political unrest. However our steadfast client Carrefour maintains a strong motivation for investments and they continue to outperform the Brazilian market in both their retail and consumer credit businesses.", "Looking at Europe, the payments market continues to be challenged by regulation and competition. The level of change in the market is unprecedented and is allowing progressive issuers of credit and debit products to be created and pursuing growth strategies. Again we do change in disruption as a driver of new opportunities for TSYS clients and their customers.", "The India and Asia Pacific region is one of the fastest growing regions in a slowing world economy. The payments market is relatively under penetrated across most countries in the region, but growing fast. This contributes to the region having one of the highest growth rates in non-cash payments in the world, averaging over 20% annual growth in areas of cards, acquiring, online and mobile.", "Third party processing and hosting is a corresponding emerging need in the region. To take advantage of these opportunities TSYS is working to upgrade clients in the region to its latest prime system and promoting it as a consolidated platform for all issuing and acquiring. Across our international footprint in the first quarter, we produced strong revenue and transaction growth and ended the quarter with record accounts on file.", "Now I would like to take the opportunity to mention a few changes within the TSYS family. Later this week we hold our annual shareholders' meeting, where we will recognize two founding members of the TSYS\u2019s Board, Gardiner Garrard and Lynn Page who will retire. Gardner and Lynn have chaired and served on almost all of the various TSYS\u2019s board committees over the years and has been two of our most loyal supporters, astute advisors and greatest champions. We thank to each of them for their 33 years of service and wish them all the best in the future.", "Also at the shareholders' meeting we will welcome Pam Joseph who is elected to our Board in March and will become a member of the TSYS\u2019s executive leadership team serving as President and Chief Operating Officer beginning next Monday. We are very excited to have Pam to join our executive leadership team. Her experience, vision and direction will help shape the future of TSYS.", "I\u2019ll now ask Paul Todd to provide additional detailed financial information and review our revised guidance for 2016. Paul?", "Paul Todd", "Thank you, Troy and I too want to reiterate how pleased we are with the company\u2019s exceptional performance for the first quarter specifically related to the strength across each of our reporting segments, the closing of TransFirst and our revised guidance which incorporates the TransFirst\u2019s business into our expected performance for the remainder of the year.", "Digging into the results starting on slide six at the consolidated level, our net revenue increased 12.7% for the quarter. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $230.8 million, representing a year-over-year increase of $37.4 million or 19.3%. Finally adjusted EPS from continuing operations were $0.66 for the quarter which represents the 22.8% increase from prior year. This EPS performance was driven by strong segment performances across all of our segments as well as strong performance by CUP Data.", "One thing we discussed throughout last year was the growth across all of our segments occurring at the same time and the first quarter was a continuation of this trend. Before I leave the consolidated financial results turning to slide seven, I want to point out that our quarterly net revenue growth of 12.7% is all organic. And our ability to take that revenue growth to the bottom line was seen in the adjusted operating income growth of 20.5% to $186.2 million and adjusted operating margin of 27.7%, representing a margin improvement of 178 basis points on a year-over-year basis. This combination of pure organic revenue growth with this margin expansion is a key takeaway from our first quarter consolidated results.", "Now to explain our results in more detail let\u2019s turn to slide eight and I\u2019ll cover our North America segment first with a key headline for the segment is the strong organic revenue growth of 14.1%. As you will remember, this quarter marks the anniversary of the largest client conversion in history that happened mid first quarter of last year. The incremental impact from this conversion plus continued organic growth from much of our client base and a few onetime revenue items drove revenue before reimbursables up 14.1% over quarter one of 2015 to $303.6 million.", "This amount represents another record high for revenues in a quarter surpassing that of the fourth quarter of 2015. During the quarter, we signed four contract extensions that included commercial, consumer and managed services as well as a healthcare contract renewal.", "As it\u2019s been the recent pattern, this double-digit revenue growth was driven by the large conversion as well as by broad based growth in our core offerings as well growth in our value added services, managed services and loyalty services. However, I think it is important for you to remember that in the quarters ahead we will begin to see the year-over-year impact of our departure from the peak prepaid processing space within this segment due to the loss of Unit Rush and ongoing deconversion of Green Dot. But to reiterate our statement on our last call, we still expect mid-single-digit revenue growth for this segment for the full year.", "As for the segment\u2019s operating income, it also reach at historical level of $124.8 million, up 21.7% over last year resulting in a segment operating margin of 41.1%. This growth rate was aided by the one-time revenue items mentioned earlier and a one-time favorable impact of state R&D tax credits that flow to operations. Without these one-time items, this 1Q margin is consistent with the 1Q, 2015 margin of 38.5% and we expect the margin of this segment to remain in the approximate range of 37% to 39% for the rest of the year and still expect the margin on a full year basis for this segment to expand slightly from the 37.4% margin in calendar year 2015.", "From a volume perspective, you can see from the slide that our traditional accounts on file continue to show steady growth and we reached a new record level of 423.3 million accounts. The higher percentage growth rate reflected in previous quarters is obviously due to the large conversion last year and I will point out that we revised these bar charts to focus on our traditional accounts on file levels and growth rates, which we consistently stated are a better metric of our revenue performance.", "Historically these charts have shown total accounts on file that are the sum of both our traditional accounts on file as well as prepaid government services and single use accounts. As we said in the past, these non-traditional accounts can vary substantially and the number of accounts are less correlated to revenue. We rolled out some new formatting changes to our report this year and our graphs will now show traditional accounts on file given its tighter connection to revenue, but we will continue to provide information on both.", "As Troy mentioned we believe we have growth potential within our issuer processing business by driving additional growth and profits through the sale of innovative products and related services that our clients need. We are committed to being a more product driven organization and we are redeploying and refocusing resources within our issuer product group and across our IT teams. Overall, we are pleased with the strong first quarter performance of the North American segment.", "Now I want to move to the International segment highlights on slide nine, where a key highlight is the continuing expanding margin with an improving constant currency revenue growth picture. During the fourth quarter call we shared that the segment achieved a full year margin of 18.1% based on the target announced four years ago. With this as a base the segment will continue to drive for margin expansion with an improving revenue growth picture. The first quarter of 2016 saw strong results for the segment with net revenue of $75.4 million, up 2.2% on a reported basis and up 9.2% on a constant currency basis.", "Revenue growth for the quarter was again fueled by the four new clients converted last year coupled with strong organic growth from existing clients. We start to annualize these new clients in the March-April timeframe and this is why we still anticipate segment revenue growth to be in the low-single-digit range on a constant currency basis for full year 2016.", "On the margin front, our Q1 margin up 13.7% was a 420 basis points improvement over Q1 of 2015 and we still expect some margin improvement in 2016 net of any negative currency impact. From a volume perspective traditional accounts on file grew 4 million to a record level of 65.5 million, up 6.6% from the prior year and we continue to break records for the number of accounts processed in the segment now standing at 80.8 million accounts on file. I would emphasis that most of this growth is in the single-use and debit account areas.", "The segment experienced high single-digit transaction growth of 8.1% with same client transactions growing by 7.6% while not included in the segment\u2019s financial results are results from our CUP Data partnership were also strong for Q1, our joint venture with CUP continues to meet expectations for both of our organizations and we expect continued growth from this business despite the slowdown of the Chinese economy\u2019s growth rate. Overall we were pleased with our International segment\u2019s performance for the quarter.", "Now on the Merchant segment on the slide 10, where the key headline for this segment was the strong performance leading us to the announcement of our closing of the TransFirst acquisition. Our revenue grew 9.3% for the quarter versus the first quarter of 2015. The direct business saw 10.6% growth and our indirect business had 7.2% year-over-year growth. The growth of our small and medium business sales volume was up 11.9% year-over-year and our indirect business grew POS transactions by 10.8% year-over-year.", "Within our indirect business we continue to retain our core customers renewing to 2 of our top 25 while also signing a new full service agreement during the quarter. We remain commitment to our indirect partners and this line of business will continue to be important to the combined TSYS-TransFirst business on a go forward basis as it generates strong margins and cash flow and creates a platform that powers our direct business.", "On the direct side we have continue to gain traction on the integrated payments front with ISV and with the integration of TransFirst we can further expand across the entire merchant base we serve.", "From a margin perspective, we experienced an overall increase of 90 basis points for the first quarter, which is important in our plan is to expand the margin in this segment in 2016. Overall it was a strong quarter for Merchant segment and we still believe success in this space will require diverse distribution channels and scale for operating leverage. With TransFirst we are now well positioned with a robust partnership distribution model that held access to millions of SMB merchants in a scalable and cost efficient way. We\u2019re pleased with the Merchant segment\u2019s performance in the first quarter and we are merging the TSYS and TransFirst businesses from positions of strength.", "Now I want to talk about the strong performance of the NetSpend segment starting on slide 11. The highlight for this segment is the 19.3% organic revenue growth for the quarter. Revenue of $185 million represents a record setting tax season and this is the highest quarterly revenue in NetSpend\u2019s history. As you remember, we made significant investments for growth in this business during the fourth quarter of 2015; this resulted in excellent organic Q1 revenue growth in 2016 tax season volumes.", "The first quarter had over $9 billion of gross dollar volume of spend, up $19.6% over the prior year. We exited the quarter with almost 4.9 million active cards, almost 2.8 million of which are on direct deposit, which continues to be a relentless focus for the NetSpend. First quarter margins held consistent with the prior year of 22.8%. I\u2019ll remind that NetSpend\u2019s first quarter margins tend to be the lowest quarter of the year because of our investments in marketing and customer acquisition efforts to support a successful tax season.", "While our card and volume levels continue to increase. We\u2019re also consistently focused on expanding our distribution network by adding approximately 3,000 distributing employers and locations in the quarter bringing the current total to more than 100,000. The 2016 tax season has been one of the continued excellent performance by our NetSpend segment and we\u2019re pleased with the way we are positioned coming out of Q1. Our expectation for this business continues to be for revenue growth to be in the low-double-digit on a full year basis with the expanding margins for 2016 versus 2015.", "Now back to the consolidated financial results starting on slide 12. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 27.7% consistent with the expanding margin story I mentioned on our last call. Also I want to state that slide 12 provides a bridge between the adjusted segment operating income for each of our segments and our consolidated adjusted operating income. We provide this because our segments report their results on an adjusted segment operating income basis, which excludes amortization of acquisition intangibles, TransFirst\u2019s M&A expenses, corporate admin and stock-based compensation.", "Now let\u2019s talk about our cash position on slide 13 for a moment. We ended the quarter at $445 million in cash excluding $1.5 billion received from our notes offering, a $55.8 million increase from the fourth quarter of last year. Our largest outflow of cash of $44.4 million was related to CapEx of which $9.9 million was related to property and equipment, $21 million related to contract acquisition cost with the remaining $13.5 million related to internally developed and licensed software. We show our cash position on this slide net of the outflow for the acquisition of TransFirst.", "On cash flow on slide 14, our free cash flow for the quarter was $101.4 million and with the addition of TransFirst net of the additional bond expenses and one-time items, we expect free cash flow for the year to be in the $510 million to $540 million range. I want to make one comment on leverage with the closing of TransFirst our debt ended where we were anticipating at approximately $3.8 billion and pro forma leverage moved to approximately 3.8 times debt to trailing 12 month pro forma EBITDA excluding one-time items.", "Our $1.5 billion notes offering in March was extremely well received and we drew an additional $870 million from our credit facility to close the transaction. We anticipate our weighted average blended interest rate for our overall debt to be in the range of 3.15% to 3.4%, which is in line with our prior expectations of about 50 basis points higher than our pre-transaction rate.", "As Troy mentioned, regarding our capital allocation strategy, our immediate priority and plan is to use our strong free cash flows over the next 24 months to delever our balance sheet so we get back to our longer-term target leverage ratio of the low to mid two times range.", "From a share count perspective, we ended the quarter with 183.4 million our common shares outstanding with the average basis weighted shares outstanding at 183.3 million.", "On taxes we ended the quarter at an effective tax rate of 33.6%, which is about 150 basis points lower than in Q1 of 2015 and we expect our estimated tax rate for 2016 to be in the range of 33% to 34% with it being closer to the high end of this range and expecting it to stay in that high 33% or low 34% range for each of the next three quarters. I want to point that this effective tax rate increase from 2015 levels is the main driver as to why our adjusted expected EPS growth rate is not consistent with our expected growth rates and adjusted EBITDA or adjusted operating income.", "Now on guidance, we are raising our full year consolidated guidance based on the closing of the TransFirst acquisition and stronger than expected performance in the first quarter. On page 15, we highlight our full year consolidated guidance of total revenue growth of 50% to 53%, net revenue growth of 20% to 24% and adjusted EPS from continuing operations of 13% to 16% growth.", "We are introducing a new adjusted revenue disclosure net revenue that better aligns our reporting with how the company measures performance internally. A reconciliation of net revenue, which is a non-GAAP measure to GAAP revenues is included in the detailed schedules of our press release. We also expect consolidated adjusted margin to increase approximately 100 basis points over 2015, which is consistent with the margin expansion I mentioned on our last call.", "Finally, I want to mention call outs that I think are the key takeaways from today. The first call out is on organic growth. The first quarter was another impressive quarter of purely growth for our company and for each of our segments and continues stream of strong quarterly organic revenue growth in our businesses. With the closing of TransFirst we will now have acquisition related growth in our results on a go-forward basis. So this period of ongoing success and organic growth across all of our businesses at the same time speaks to the strength of the TSYS platform of businesses.", "The second major call out is on margins and we will be talking a lot about margins in 2016 with our goal to increase our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin by approximately 100 basis points coming off the heal of a similar level of margin expansion in 2015. However, our goal is to expand each of our segment\u2019s margin profile to deliver a cross segment margin expansion similar to the cross segment organic revenue growth theme that we saw in 2015. Our first quarter\u2019s performance on the margin front strengthens our result around this call.", "And the third final call up is related to expected performance for the remainder of the year. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, I do want to call out two key points given the moving parts present in 2016; the first point is on North America. As I mentioned, when I was covering the North American segment we still expect this segment to grow in the mid-single-digit range that I mentioned on our last call. I also mentioned on our last call that the second-half of the year will have lower growth than the first half given the expected run off of the prepaid processing clients previously mentioned as well as other effects.", "We have stated, we expect this segment to grow in the mid to high-single-digit range over a longer term horizon with expected growth being closure to the mid-single-digit and while we expect to achieve that in 2016 the path to that level is heavily weighed on the front half of the year.", "The second point is on our third quarter and specifically related to tax comparisons. In the third quarter of 2015, we have $0.13 of tax benefits in the quarter that we detailed in our 3Q, 2015 earnings call and schedules. Given that we have significant positive impact in 3Q of 2015 extra care must be used in modeling our 3Q expected 2016 results as the $0.13 doesn\u2019t repeat and in fact our expected effective tax rate for 2016 approaches the high end of our 33% to 34% range, which is higher than our 30.5% effective rate in 2015 with a significant change in the third quarter of this year over the third quarter of 2015.", "While there are other effects in the third quarter of this year versus the third quarter of last year specifically in North America, this effect of the $0.13 in the third quarter of last year has to be properly handled at modeling to a better approximate the expected performance of the third quarter of 2016. And as I said on our 3Q call last year there was a $15 million operating benefit and a net $8.5 million benefit on the tax line that have to be adjusted for in last year\u2019s three quarter results to better model 3Q of 2016.", "Finally I\u2019ll wrap up by expressing how pleased we are to be raising our full year guidance for 2016 and the strength of our performance in the first quarter across all of our businesses. This strength is complimented with the addition of the outstanding colleagues and business from TransFirst and we look forward to reporting on these combined efforts on our next call. Our team members from around the world enabled the results we have discussed today and they have proven again that they will deliver.", "And with that we will open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Darrin Peller at Barclays.", "Darrin Peller", "Thanks guys, nice job. If you can just touch on a little more on organic growth potential on the issuer processing side of the business. Just given the strength we\u2019ve seen and we know you\u2019re going to be anniversariying some slightly tougher comparison going forward. Just a little better understand on how that business should sustain going forward including the roll off of [indiscernible] and Green Dot?", "Paul Todd", "Yeah Darrin this is Paul. Yeah we - as I\u2019ve talked about in the prepared remarks, obviously coming off this very strong first quarter that had the impact of the large conversion that we did last year we got some additive growth there. The biggest single driver of kind of the growth story after that as you look forward in the remaining part of the year is this prepaid effect of exiting the prepaid processing side. And so that\u2019s why I mentioned the second half being lower than the first half. And we continue to kind of see mid to high-single-digit organic revenue growth story for the North America business. When we look at the fundamentals of the business, but this year because of the dynamics that we had to play with this large conversion as well as this exiting of the prepaid side in the second half, it presents kind of a two sided story that lands to kind of more of a mid-single-digit revenue growth picture.", "I think the key point around the organic growth side is that we\u2019re going to continue to focus on the processing side and seeing the growth there. And then as we mentioned and Troy may want to add to this, on the product side you\u2019re going to see us spend more and more time focused on the growth that we can get from the value added product side.", "Darrin Peller", "Alright, that\u2019s very helpful. So it sounds like I mean the mid-single-digit this year potentially better than that let\u2019s call it high-single-digit years out after you start to grow over the Green Dot change.", "Paul Todd", "Well I\u2019m not ready to say that it\u2019s high-single-digit coming out of that. I think we\u2019ll obviously address that as we get closer to that when we move into a 2017 picture. Obviously there will be still some impact in the first half of 2017 related to this prepaid roll off that we would have that in the first half of 2016 that would be an impact in 2017. So I wouldn\u2019t go there yet I\u2019m just saying that as we\u2019ve talked about now for over a year the overall outlook goal for that business is vary to be in the mid to high-single-digits with us trending more toward the mid-single-digit and that\u2019s what this year is looking like it\u2019s going - our expectations of it shaking out at.", "Operator", "The next question is from Brett Huff with Stephens Inc.", "Brett Huff", "Good afternoon guys and congrats on a nice quarter.", "Troy Woods", "Hey, Brett, thank you.", "Brett Huff", "A bigger picture question, we were impressed and sort of uniquely surprised by the fact that your - it seems like the ancillary sales in North America issuing processing really helped drive a lot of that growth I think the core AOF was up 7%, but the organic was up 13% or 14%. And Troy you mentioned in your comments that you guys see a big opportunity in the cross sale. Can you talk a little bit about if you had to look at the TAM for the business, is it winning new big issuing or even medium size issuing customers and getting more cards? Is it the same store sales at existing or is the cross sale for some of those value added stuff getting that 18% of rev in North America higher into the value added. Because this 1Q really seem to see some nice rev per card going up.", "Troy Woods", "Yeah Brett thank you and I\u2019ll take that and Paul may want to jump in on the back end of it. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks there are really several moving parts that I think help drive that and you\u2019re right we did bring in some outside help in 2015 to help us look at our corporate strategy and our product delivery strategies. And one of the things that came out of that that I mentioned was. We truly believe that we have some significant runway not only in just North America, but all the while issuing processing business to continue to build out value added products and services that our customers want and need and according to our feedback from our customers they prefer to get from us as their trusted advisors.", "So one, additional products and services to be built. You\u2019ll hear more about that in the coming months. Number two, while selling more aggressively the products and services that we already have. You\u2019re right, I think same store transaction on store, the same transactions for the quarter were up 12.7% in North America so very strong robust there. We also had some - continue to have good robust growth in our EMV output services area for card personalization. It was up several hundred percent over the first quarter of 2015. So Paul you may want to add to that?", "Paul Todd", "Well the only thing I'd add to that is Brett that it was a strong quarter from that standpoint. And while we will continue see a bit good growth, the growth that we saw in the first quarter because of some of the mix was better than we expect to see for the remaining quarters for this year. So it\u2019s still a positive growth picture on that front, but we did get some additive growth and some comparison benefit in the first quarter that won\u2019t repeat itself in the coming three quarters.", "Troy Woods", "Brett you mentioned that I just recall, you mentioned the large issuers and clearly as we talked about on many quarters the large issuers that are now processing with TSYS were always on our prospect list. We\u2019re calling on them all the time be it with other competitors or in-house. So that\u2019s not something we every quarter two or three or every year baked into our guidance, we certainly baked it in the targets and goals. As you know those are the long-term sales opportunities, but we worked on them relentlessly.", "Brett Huff", "That\u2019s helpful. And then my follow up is, Paul I think you mentioned that you\u2019re raising guidance both because of TransFirst and because of better than expected 1Q, can you give us just even a qualitative sense of whether a few pennies or a lot of pennies or whatever on the bottom-line and then some percentage in the top-line that came from just better legacy or organic guidance raise?", "Paul Todd", "Sure Brett. So on the bottom-line if you look at kind of the midpoint of the two different guidances, our guidance before this raises about a $0.22 improvement in the middle of that range. And roughly 90% of that $0.22 is related to TransFirst and the remaining $0.02 are related to improved performance or improved and expected performance from the business pre-TransFirst. If you look at on the revenue side it\u2019s more dramatic. It would be closer to kind of 95% to 98% of that revenue lift increases related to TransFirst. So on the revenue side it\u2019s a little more dramatic than it is on the EPS raise side.", "Operator", "The next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar at Citi.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Hello, this is Ashwin. Can you hear me?", "Operator", "Yes, please go ahead.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Okay, congratulations guys on the quarter. I guess my question was really as you look at each of these segments. Could you provide some incremental color with regards to the margin trajectory that we should expect through the course of this year?", "Paul Todd", "Sure, Ashwin. So just walking down the segments, we\u2019ll start with North America as I commented on our last call and reiterated again today we still expect to see an expanding margin picture there. I think in our last call when I\u2019ve said kind of slightly expanding margin picture I think I framed it as between 25 to 100 basis points and so that would still be the kind of the range to be thinking about and frankly I am going to make that same commentary as we walk down to kind of the band of range that I am talking.", "So from a North America standpoint that is the margin expansion that we expect to get out of that point. The one point I would make about North America is and I\u2019ve made it in the prepared remarks that although we were at 41% when you kind of take out the one-time items that pulls it down to about 38.5% and we expect that band to be more of the consistent band across the quarter than maybe what we have had historically where there has been more movement around the target.", "So as we move to international same type of margin expanding story the only caveat I would add is the currently impact that could have some negative impact there, but on a constant currency basis we look for the similar kind of margin expansion in that band. When we move down to merchant it\u2019s the same kind of story and as I commented on our last call and we will reiterate today, the TransFirst business with the guidance we have provided and our net revenue provides for an exactly almost similar margin picture.", "So our margin expansion story that we had pre-TransFirst continues over and kind of a push TransFirst acquisition scenario. And then finally on NetSpend the same kind of commentary, and if you kind of wrap all of that around the overall 100 basis points expansion of the margin for adjusted EBITDA and overall consolidated adjusted margin and look at kind of how that can kind of buildup given that commentary that\u2019s this margin call out I made at the very end and will be one of the key things we\u2019re focused on this year and we\u2019ll continue to talk about as the year progresses.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Got it. And then this question about the CFPB, Troy you had some commentary there with regards to potential timing. What we are hearing based on our checks really is it\u2019s not going to come out until the summer and if and when it does come out there could be some potential changes with regards to effective date and so. So is it I mean in your planning are you sort of thinking that you don\u2019t have to worry about this until the second half of 2017 at the earliest. How you are thinking about this from a planning perspective?", "Troy Woods", "Yeah, Ashwin, sure. Well I think we would agree with you from what you quote unquote, hearing with respect to when they may come out. Now I think it\u2019s helpful to remember this is about the second or third delay. So whether they hit this one or not I guess only time will tell if they get it out before the end of June number one. Number two I can assure you we are worrying about it. Whether it comes out May, June or July, a lot of people have been working on this and digging into this and looking at it as I have said in my prepared remarks many, many different scenarios and planning scenarios to look at what the impact may be.", "I think you mentioned perhaps some charges I think we will just have to wait and see what the final rule brings, but and again after some adequate period of review time we will certainly come out and share what we think the impact is and what our mitigation plans are going to be.", "Operator", "The next question is from Bryan Keane at Deutsche Bank.", "Ashish Sabadra", "Hi this is Ashwin Sabadra calling on behalf of Bryan. Congrats on the strong quarter. Just quickly on the guidance a quick follow-up question. If I do the math around revenue increase, I get TransFirst revenues of roughly $400 million for the three quarters, I just want to confirm if my math is right because that number seems to be significantly higher than the numbers that we\u2019ve seen in the S1 for historical context.", "Paul Todd", "Yeah Ashwin you are correct that $400 million kind of number is in the right range there. And I think the difference that you\u2019re probably alluding and I have commented on this on our last call was as we move TransFirst over to our revenue conventions and with this net revenue I think that\u2019s the difference of what you were referring to versus what you may have seen them on a standalone basis versus what it looks like for us on a consolidated basis.", "Ashish Sabadra", "Okay, no that\u2019s helpful thanks. And then my question was on the Merchant segment, how should we think about the organic growth there because it\u2019s been trending really well in the first quarter. And I think I believe you\u2019re guided to mid-single-digit. How should we think about the organic growth in the Merchant segment?", "Paul Todd", "Well obviously with TransFirst coming into the Merchant segment, it changes the future look of the revenue growth going forward, because it\u2019s roughly doubling in size from a revenue standpoint on a go forward basis. But if you didn\u2019t have that TransFirst impact that\u2019s playing out, we are still in kind of a mid-single-digit range for the Merchant segment from a growth standpoint. Yeah we did come out a little stronger in the first quarter, transaction growth was a little bit strong on the indirect side. But as some things anniversary and some product stuff doesn\u2019t repeat that mid-single-digit range is still the right kind of range on the business pre-TransFirst.", "Ashish Sabadra", "Thanks, congrats.", "Operator", "The next question is from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.", "Ryan Kerry", "Hi this is Ryan Kerry calling in for Jason thanks for taking my question. Staying on the Merchant side it looks like the indirect business continues to grow nicely in the quarter while growth in direct was a little softer than in the past few quarters. First anything in the quarter call it for the deceleration in direct? And then second, I believe growth in direct contributed to margin pressure in the fourth quarter, but it looks like margin grew nicely in the first. Just curious if there was anything else in the quarter that contributed to the 90 basis points of acceleration.", "Paul Todd", "No Ryan. As it relates to just I\u2019ll take the components to kind of as you laid it out. On the indirect side, it was slightly better than expected and the volumes were stronger. There is some as I said anniversariying and as few things in the following quarters that don\u2019t repeat themselves to point that to a higher as we\u2019ve said, I mean as not a growth business we expect that business to be a roughly flat business it can slightly squeeze out some growth in some years depending on some things. But it\u2019s still the growth trajectory of that business has not changed.", "On the direct side, I think the biggest thing relative to maybe what you\u2019re looking at from a prior basis would be the anniversariying of some of the product stuff that we had on the direct side last year that\u2019s fully played its way out on the direct side. But we feel very happy with the direct business growth and the volume growth on the small and medium business volume side was very strong and very in line with our expectations for the business.", "Ryan Kerry", "Okay great. And now that you have a TransFirst in-house any changes to your expectations for the $15 million in cost synergies for 2017 and the $25 million to $30 million in 2018?", "Paul Todd", "No, we do not have any changes to those estimates.", "Operator", "The next question is from David Scharf with JMP.", "David Scharf", "Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess maybe this is more just directly or qualitatively, but can you provide a little bit of an update on the first quarter performance just at TransFirst prior to the closing how that tracked relative to your expectations and some of the trends and I realized it\u2019s baked into the consolidated guidance, but whether or not you have any more positive or negative outlook for the expected growth rate this year?", "Paul Todd", "Sure David. The TransFirst business for the first quarter was strong. And I think the best thing - the best way I can characterize how the business is performing relative to our expectations was we came out when we made the announcement and said that the acquisition was going to be double-digit accretive. And if you do kind of the math of how I talked about raising the guidance here and you look at the nine months versus a 12 month over a calendar year period, it points exactly the kind to what our expectations were when we announced the transaction.", "So performance is on track we are very pleased with obviously what they did before the closing of the transaction, but also in our forecasting and looking at the remaining three quarters based on the revised guidance that we have provided today.", "David Scharf", "Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And inherent in the full year guidance at the bottom-line how much of the free cash flows is anticipated to be deployed towards deleveraging this year?", "Paul Todd", "So we have talked about David a $400 million deleveraging occurring in the first 12 months that is not necessarily specifically linear across all four quarters. And so our deleveraging profile as said that we plan to deleverage $400 million in the first 12 months of owning TransFirst and those are still our plans, but not necessarily in a perfectly linear way.", "Operator", "The next question is from Tom McCrohan at CLSA. One moment please.", "Tom McCrohan", "The America segment, revenue per account years ago say back in 2008 was close to $3.50 per account then you had this mix shift of lower yielding prepaid, which you\u2019ve talked about and the revenue per account has gone down precipitously. So we all expected to kind of start ticking up again is there any reason why revenue per account as you deconvert Unit Rush and Green Dot it could not return back to levels seen back in say 2008?", "Paul Todd", "Well I think there is a couple of moving pieces there at a simplistic kind of level yes, that the revenue per account obviously improves when the prepaid accounts kind of removed out the denominator. I think the only thing I would caution is obviously with the large conversion that come on the composition relative to the history of the business changes because it\u2019s such a base lift. So I would say that A; and B these value added products and how that mix can change specifically in both value added products as well as managed services. And so that kind of plays into it as well.", "So on a simplistic kind of math basis that\u2019s true, but overall I think there is some of cautionary kind of things there specifically as it relates to single-use accounts would also be something that could have to factor into that calculation.", "Troy Woods", "And I think the only thing I would add to that Tom is going back to really Paul\u2019s prepared comments about the change beginning this quarter of calling out more of a traditional accounts on file. So we would agree with you that clearly you take out the non-traditional as leading into really deaccelerate with the prepaid coming off so you should definitely see a difference if you\u2019ve been using total accounts on file and revenue.", "Tom McCrohan", "Okay. A follow-up on that segment, Troy what is the market share that TSYS enjoys today in issuing services do you have any sort of market share objectives and how would you characterize TSYS\u2019s competitive advantage in that space today?", "Troy Woods", "Well, I think [indiscernible] Tom is around 42%, 43% market share Canada significantly higher than that can\u2019t call it off top of my head we may have it here in the room. I think from a significant advantage standpoint, I think there are a couple of things one, when you think about our culture, our operational excellence focus, when you think about our technology and feature functionality that we bring to the table with our technology. I think investment grade is also extremely important, it\u2019s important to us, it has turned out to be very important to our customers not only current customers, but as well as working with the prospects and the potential customers. It\u2019s a selling point, it\u2019s an advantage.", "So I think those are the reasons we continue to win and I think those are the reasons that we feel like we are different when we go to market and it helps us enjoy as we have said before, we believe we are the number one credit card branded process in the United States number one in Canada with an 80% market share by the way, number one in China and number two in Europe. And we think those are the reasons why.", "Operator", "Next question is from Glenn Greene at Oppenheimer.", "Glenn Greene", "Thank you, good afternoon really nice results. I guess the first one maybe for Paul. I just want to sort of see if I could sort of summarize the guidance change. It\u2019s largely you\u2019re sort of adding in $400 million as for TransFirst or kind of $530 million annualized and most of the segments or all the segments look like directionally the same as they were before at a high level in terms of revenue growth and margins and first I just want to clarify that. And are we still thinking double-digit growth going forward for TransFirst and your comment margin where you\u2019re referencing EBIT margins for TransFirst being comparable to core TSYS?", "Paul Todd", "Yeah so generally Glenn what you said is the accurate, both on kind of the revenue add and then that add, as it relates to the expected performances of the business. And so I\u2019d say the businesses are expect to perform slightly better, which is evidence in the fact that the pre-TransFirst business we\u2019re raising guidance reflecting that general improvement. I think as it relates to the adjusted segment margin for the Merchant business, yeah, I mean that\u2019s based off of the adjusted segment margin for merchant of when you pull the TransFirst business and based on our revenue conventions. And you look at it on a segment basis, the margin profile is very similar to what it was on the business pre-TransFirst. And then also as I said we\u2019re expecting to expand that margin in that segment. So I think the way you characterize the guidance and change that we\u2019ve laid out today is generally accurate.", "Glenn Greene", "Okay. And then just a quick follow-up maybe just an update on the accounts on file pipeline both domestically and internationally?", "Troy Woods", "Yeah Glenn you go back to couple of quarters and we have not given that pipeline from the standpoint of North America. I think we have - we wanted to get a lot of these anniversaries behind this and I think when you look at international, we\u2019re looking at a couple of conversions and three or four launches but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve shared that number as well.", "Paul Todd", "Yeah it hadn\u2019t changed Glenn from what we\u2019ve talked about in the last couple of quarters.", "Operator", "The next question is from Steven Kwok at KBW.", "Steven Kwok", "Great, thanks for squeezing me in. Congrats on the TransFirst deal and good quarter. Just in terms of going back to TransFirst, if we look at that $400 million of revenues for this year embedded in your guidance what\u2019s the comparable number for last year over that same period of time? I just want to see what type of revenue growth assumptions you\u2019re using.", "Paul Todd", "Yeah it\u2019s because of the different convention as it relates to our net revenue that maybe reported in that way there wouldn\u2019t be the number I provide you there. But I think I would point to what we said in our last call which is TransFirst just had if you look at their results on the way they were reporting strong double-digit organic revenue growth over period of years.", "And so we\u2019re expecting strong organic revenue growth to continue in that same kind of generic kind of a range of where they were and obviously there is different moving pieces and you move into a higher base number. And so I wouldn\u2019t - you can\u2019t go kind of one-for-one in the correlation there. But the revenue profile of growth for TransFirst is very strong. And if you kind of go back and look at it on their history you kind of see what that track record looks like.", "Steven Kwok", "Got it. And then just in terms of seasonality how should we think about from the TransFirst business both in terms of revenue and operating income?", "Paul Todd", "Yeah there wouldn\u2019t be anything that I would call out as it relates to specific seasonality. It\u2019s a pretty straightforward quarter-to-quarter kind of look as it relates to TransFirst and pulling them overall onto our sides. So nothing I\u2019d call out there specific.", "Steven Kwok", "Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Operator", "The next question is from John Davis at Stifel.", "John Davis", "Hey, good afternoon guys. Maybe first quickly hit the indirect merchant side, after a couple of years of shrinking fairly significantly now we\u2019ve seen kind of two or three quarters of nice growth and it seems like Paul you little bit added emphasis on your confidence on that channel going forward. Maybe just talk a little bit about what\u2019s driving it and kind of what gives you confidence that it can continue to grow?", "Paul Todd", "Well yeah, I think that as it relates to growth I think the confidence around the first quarter was the 10.8% transaction growth that we saw on the indirect side. And so for the quarter that helped fuel the stronger kind of than expected growth on the indirect side. I think I did kind of comment earlier we don\u2019t expect this business to grow. So I wouldn\u2019t want my confidence around the first quarter to kind of probably lay itself into kind of an improving overall growth picture of the indirect business. I think what I was trying to hit on in my prepared remarks is that that the indirect side of the business is going to be an important component of the combined piece of TransFirst business on a go forward basis. It\u2019s got for all margins as I said it fuels our direct business from a processing standpoint.", "And so it\u2019s a good business that we have scale efficiency than, which improve our cost basis, it generates a lot of cash, it\u2019s got strong margins, it just doesn\u2019t have the same type of revenue growth potential that the direct side of the business has. Obviously with the TransFirst business added it takes a lesser contribution of the revenue going forward. So if you look I think it was about 39% of the revenue this quarter, that will diminish down to sub-20% on the go forward basis. So we probably talked about it less moving forward just because of the smaller percentage of the whole. But I did want to make sure that from a strategic standpoint I placed the proper amount of emphasis of it being an important business on a go forward basis.", "John Davis", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe on the EMV card issuance side, was the impact in 1Q big enough to call out kind of what inning are we in and does that play any role in kind of second half being a little bit tougher from a comp perspective? Any kind of color there would be helpful.", "Troy Woods", "Yeah John I\u2019ll be glad to take that again, Paul may add to it. But no, it wasn\u2019t anything of significance that we would call out neither Paul or I. I did indicate I think in response to part of the question earlier from Brett that part of the North America is clearly being helped by some EMV activity around card personalization and the percentage is with our card production was significantly up in the first quarter 2016 versus first quarter 2015.", "But again with that said, it\u2019s not enough to move the needle to really drive to kind of numbers that we gave for North America in the first quarter. I think what inning I think we\u2019ve indicated probably on our consumer business in North America we probably have around half of our business that we believe has been shift enabled if you will. And so maybe between 50% and 60%. So that will give you some relatively of what\u2019s left to go.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Shawn Roberts for closing remarks.", "Shawn Roberts", "Thank you, Amy and always we appreciate your participation in the call. If anybody has any follow-up questions, do feel free to give me a call this evening. Thank you.", "Operator", "The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation.

Troy Woods - Chairman, & Chief Executive Officer", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President", "Analysts", "Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.

LLC", "Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC", "Thomas McCrohan - CLSA Americas LLC", "Shawn Roberts - Senior Director, Investor Relations", "Dialing in and getting a busy signal or being told this was an improper number. We appreciate the number of you that did get in and apologize for any inconvenience. This evening, we're going to begin the call with opening comments from TSYS, Chairman and CEO, Troy Woods; followed by TSYS CFO, Paul Todd; reviewing the second quarter highlights and consolidated financials.", "Troy and Paul will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks and a copy of this presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental schedules are available on our website at investors.tsys.com. After Troy and Paul's remarks, we will open the call up for Q&A. I'd like to remind everyone that during the Q&A each person will be allowed to ask two questions before the operators will place you back into the queue.", "I'll now call your attention to the fact that we'll be making some forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS's actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in TSYS's reports filed with the SEC.", "We will also discuss items that do not conform to GAAP. We reconcile those measures to GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation and in the supplemental schedules to the press release.", "At this point I'll turn the call over to Troy Woods.", "M. Troy Woods - Chairman, & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Shawn. Good evening and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. This has been another excellent quarter for TSYS. Our team members across our global footprint delivered an outstanding performance for the quarter and for the first half of the year.", "As a reminder, this quarter's results include a full quarter of transfers. I'll address our integration activities with respect to transfers later, but by almost any measure, our first quarter together has been very successful and we are pleased with our progress and the new team.", "Some of the highlights for the quarter that I would like to call out are, consolidated net revenue was up 27.8%, adjusted earnings per share increased 27.9%, and consolidated operating margin expanded 202 basis points. All four of our operating segments contributed to these exceptional metrics for the quarter. I want to congratulate and thank all of our team members for their dedication, commitment and focus as we continue to deliver on our strategic plan.", "One final highlight before we move into the specific results for our segments. While we measure our success with our financials, we also take great pride in our community involvement and servant leadership. In June we were recognized as one of America's most community-minded companies by Civic 50, an initiative that identifies companies for their commitment to improving the quality of life in the communities where they do business. This is the third consecutive time we've been honored with this award and it is a complement to our dedicated team members who give back in the communities where they work and live.", "I now would like to address the highlights of each of our segments beginning with North America. Our strong financial performance in North America is partially a result of a positive U.S. economy, which posted job gains and overall strength in consumer spending during the quarter. April produced the largest increase in consumer spending in six years. And May and June were also robust pointing to a reasonably healthy American consumer.", "We still expect a significant portion of our growth in our North America segment to come from the cross-sell of products and services. We continue to play significant focus on cross-selling existing products and services to current clients, as well as a longer-term view of delivering and cross-selling new products and services. These new products and services will be delivered through the transformation of technologies and innovation, currently underway at TSYS.", "To this point, during the quarter we saw a 13.1% increase over the same quarter last year, from the sale of services across our value-added, loyalty and managed services groups in this segment. On the business development front, we signed a new long-term agreement with the Bank of Montr\u00e9al to process their MasterCard branded debit accounts and we also renewed three issuing contracts.", "We had previously indicated that Green Dot would be de-converted from TSYS during the second half of 2016. Green Dot has executed on three of their plan four deconvergence from TSYS; however, the final wave of accounts is not expected to be de-converted from TSYS this year.", "Now let's turn to the international segment, of course the headline grabbing news from our international segment was the Brexit vote in the UK. The early reaction certainly negatively impacted both the currency and equity markets. The UK vote to leave the European Union has created an overall air of uncertainty in political, social and economic circles across the globe.", "Following this vote, we spoke with many executives across our European client base and their current position is business as usual with TSYS. One of our clients published a report, which indicated that UK consumer spending remained resilient both before and after the Brexit EU referendum. There are many different views on Brexit's longer term impact and the potential implications that it may or may not cause. We will continue to monitor these developments closely. And we'll take appropriate actions when and if deemed necessary.", "Also during the quarter, our international managed services business became Financial Conduct Authority or FCA authorized. This puts TSYS in a unique position against our competitors and enables us to extend our current service offering to include broad customer care support and engagement across Europe.", "As I mentioned last quarter, our resilient business continues to make significant financial and operational progress. Although the Brazilian market remains challenging due to political and economic uncertainty, in the run up for the Rio Olympic Games, we are optimistic over the interest in our market leading payments platform from across the broader Latin and South America regions.", "In China, the economy has slowed to mid-to mid-high single digit growth. However, the underlying electronic payment transaction growth and overall upward trend in consumer spending and this $8.3 trillion card payment market continues to fuel our CUP Data joint venture above expectations.", "In our PRIME business, we continue to seek progress on the licensing and processing business lines with many new prospects in each area.", "Our focus will continue to be on leveraging our recently transformed international operating platforms to deliver cost effective solutions on both TS2 and PRIME around the globe.", "For our combined issuing segments, we added over 13 million traditional accounts during the quarter, which is further proof of the health of our issuing business. Our focus will continue to be on client retention, cross-selling products and services, as well as new targeted prospects around the globe.", "Now let's address our merchant business. As I indicated earlier, TransFirst is included in our second quarter numbers. We have just completed our first quarter of the TransFirst acquisition and we are pleased to report that the integration work and synergy goals are both on-track.", "As we've indicated from the beginning regarding this acquisition, our goal is to optimize the capabilities, products and services across our combined entities that will enable our customers to rely on one single provider for all of their processing needs.", "We believe this is a key market differentiator, although there is significant integration work that still must take place, we will remain relentlessly focused on growing the business. Today over 80% of our merchant net revenue is derived from our direct channels. We believe the scale and diverse distribution network that we've created in our merchant's business is one of the keys to our success. Our combined merchant businesses now gives us leadership positions in all three of our lines of business.", "And finally, I'd like to address NetSpend. Our NetSpend segment had another great quarter as well. Quarterly revenues were up almost 15%. Margins improved slightly year-over-year and 330 basis points sequentially and we surpassed 101,000 distributing locations and employers for the quarter.", "On the business development front, I am happy to announce that our long-standing distribution partner and industry leader Blackhawk Network has entered a 10-year strategic partnership that builds upon more than a decade of work we've done together. This new partnership will provide significant expansion or facings for NetSpend and Blackhawk's impressive US retail network and potentially provide additional distribution locations in grocery stores and other retailers.", "Another great win for our retail presence this quarter was a three-year extension of the NetSpend partnership with CVS. Our Paycard channel was also very active during the quarter. We signed new three-year agreements with the Gap and with JCPenney to be their exclusive Paycard provider. These new and growing partnerships are the manifestation of NetSpend's goal to meet consumers where they work and shop to provide them with a great solution fulfilling their financial needs.", "As to the CFPB, we now expect the final rules to be published sometime in September. When the final rules are published, and after we have had an adequate review period, we will share with you what it means to our business and what our mitigation strategies are.", "All-in-all, it was a great quarter with all four segments growing revenue, expanding our consolidated margin, executing on the TransFirst acquisition and winning new business.", "At our Investor Day conference in May, I discussed the launching of our TSYS 2020 initiative. This is an enterprise wide initiative to bring clarity and focus to our future business model.", "As a reminder, one of the tenets of TSYS 2020 was to provide us with an assessment of the ideal operating structure to maximize efficiencies and the scale of our operations. As I mentioned earlier, this process is well underway in our merchant segment, primarily as a result of the TransFirst acquisition. Through organizational consolidation, job eliminations and other efficiency initiatives, we are ahead of schedule to achieve our $15 million synergy goal for merchants in 2017.", "We are now in the process of taking this efficiency initiative to the rest of our company. As a result of this process, we do expect to have some one-time related expenses in the third quarter primarily related to severance. We are convinced that these moves will ensure we are operating at our full potential and will allow us to improve and strengthen our already very successful business model. Paul will provide additional color on this in his remarks.", "With that, I'll ask Paul to provide additional detailed financial information for the second quarter and outlook for the remainder of 2016. Paul?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Troy, and I want to reemphasize how pleased we are with the second quarter performance of our company as we continue to execute against our strategic plans. As I mentioned on our last two calls regarding 2016 expected performance, we would be executing on improving margins in our company while being focused on the integration of TransFirst and that is exactly what occurred during the second quarter. We couldn't be more pleased with the TransFirst acquisition as John Shlonsky and team have already started to reorganize and are successfully down the integration path to position the TSYS merchant segment in a unique way.", "When we announced the transaction, our goal was to achieve double-digit percentage accretion with the transaction, which we achieved in the second quarter and our synergy attainment goals are on track. So we see very positive momentum with TransFirst.", "Now turning to slide six and a review of the numbers. Total revenues were $1.15 billion, a 66.3% increase from the second quarter of last year and net revenue was up 27.8% from 2Q 2015 to $794.9 million. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 32.7% and adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased 27.9%, both in line with our net revenue increase.", "On a GAAP basis, basic EPS was down $0.07 to $0.38 as a result of the effect of the TransFirst acquisition. On a year-to-date basis, total revenues were $1.89 billion, a 39.6% increase and net revenue was $1.47 billion, representing a 20.4% growth over 2015.", "Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $504.9 million is 26.2% higher than through this time last year and year-to-date adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $1.40 is a 25.5% increase. On a GAAP basis, basic EPS was flat at $0.87 from prior year, once again reflecting the effect of the TransFirst acquisition.", "I mentioned on our last two calls about our goal to increase our adjusted EBITDA margin by 100 basis points this year and we achieved this goal in the quarter with an approximate 130 basis point increase for the quarter and a 160 basis point expansion through six months. It is still our goal to achieve this 100 basis point adjusted EBITDA margin expansion for the year, building upon the strong adjusted EBITDA margin expansion we had last year.", "Turning to slide seven, you can see that our diversification strategy around the contribution of revenue continues with the TransFirst acquisition included in our results for the first time and our merchant segment now represents a third of our net revenue, up from approximately 19% from this time last year. We believe this diversified revenue mix provides for strength and is a unique dynamic in the TSYS investment story as we continue to diversify our revenue mix to be more heavily weighted to the higher growth areas of payments.", "Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 28.6%, an increase of over 200 basis points versus Q2 of 2015 and our 28.2% year-to-date margin is also an increase of roughly 200 basis points. Importantly, three of our four segments saw their adjusted segment operating margins expand for the quarter from the second quarter of last year and speaks to the strength of the cross segment delivery of performance that I've mentioned as our goal on our last two calls. Clearly, we're pleased with our consolidated results, but we are equally pleased with the impressive segment results that are behind the consolidated numbers.", "Now let's dig into the segment results for North America starting on slide eight. As I mentioned on our last call, we expect the North America segment full year revenue growth in the mid single-digit range in 2016 and that is still our expectation. Revenue for the quarter was up 3.5% and we saw cross-sell growth in our value-added managed services and loyalty services up a combined 13.1% over the same quarter last year.", "The sequential quarter decline in net revenue growth from the 14.1% last quarter is largely due to the anniversary of the large client conversion in mid Q1 2015 along with our output services area returning to more normalized levels as we begin to anniversary some of the elevated growth we've seen in recent quarters related to EMV, other projects and some one-time items.", "As for this segment's operating income, it grew 4% over last year resulting in a segment operating margin of 37.9%, up 20 basis points. From a volume perspective, you can see from this slide that our traditional accounts on file continues to show steady growth and has reached yet another new record of $435.1 million. I'll remind you that this excludes prepaid, government services and single use accounts.", "We continue to redeploy and refocus resources in our issuer product group, our client experience initiatives, and across our IT landscape to provide a more proactive and focused delivery model, as well as focus on cross-selling existing products into the market leading distribution channel that we've spent years cultivating. Overall, we continue to expect this business to grow in the mid single-digit range for the year with slightly expanding margins.", "Now, I want to move to the International segment highlights on slide nine, where we continued to experience revenue growth and more importantly operating income and margin growth. Net revenue of $81.8 million was down 2.5% on a reported basis, but up 4.2% on a constant currency basis. The constant currency revenue growth of 4.2% is consistent with the low single-digit constant currency revenue growth we expect for this segment this year.", "We continue to see solid growth from our existing client base in Europe which was partly offset by previously expected loss client revenue. The segment's margin continues to grow in-line with our margin improvement plans, delivering over 330 basis points in margin improvement over Q2 of 2015 at 19.3%. We still expect this segment to slightly expand its margin this year net of any currency effects.", "From a volume perspective traditional accounts on file grew $2.9 million to a record level of $66 million, up 4.7% from prior-year. And the segment experienced high single-digit transaction growth of 7.3%.", "As I mentioned in our Q1 call, our CUP Data joint venture continues to meet expectations for both of our organizations and we expect continued growth from this business, despite the slowdown of the Chinese economy's growth rate. Overall, we are pleased with our international segment's performance for the quarter as the business continues to deliver against its strategic plans.", "Now on to the merchant segment on slide 10. First as I mentioned earlier, we're pleased that the integration and synergy plans for TransFirst are on-track. With the acquisition of TransFirst net revenue for this segment was $261.5 million, up 121.8%, and as I mentioned earlier, our merchant segment now represents roughly one-third of the net revenue of the company. Both TransFirst and our legacy merchant business are meeting our profit expectations but given the success of the integration and the movements between our businesses to competitively align our offerings, we already view this business as one entity as opposed to two separate businesses.", "As we discussed last quarter, our direct business is now more than 80% of segment net revenue achieving our long-term strategic goal of having over 75% of our net revenue derived from direct merchant acquiring. Our focus on the SMB space and ongoing traction and integrated payments continues to drive double-digit SPS volume growth. Combined our integrated payments channels are now approximately 30% of our total direct business's net revenue. While we still view our indirect business as a low or flat growth business, we did see positive net revenue growth of 5.7% year-over-year driven by POS transaction growth of 6.4% year-over-year.", "We do expect this to return to more of a flat growth picture for the remaining part of the year. However, similar to the comments I made last quarter within our indirect business, we continue to retain our core customers renewing four full service agreements, including one of our top five customers.", "I've mentioned on several occasions that the margin picture of the merchant segment would likely remain unchanged with the integration of TransFirst and that was the case in this quarter with margins at a strong 34.4% in line with the 2Q margin, up 15%.", "As I mentioned, John and his team are quickly integrating the two businesses and at the integration seasons we will likely be providing new metrics that will best measure and drive performance on a go-forward basis.", "We are not likely to continue to report on a direct and indirect basis given the smaller impact of indirect and the way we are now managing the combined businesses, but wanted to continue to provide this breakout this quarter to complete the picture that we had outlined at the time of the acquisition around revenue contribution mix.", "In all, we couldn't be more pleased with the performance of both the underlying merchant businesses, the integration that is occurring, the revenue contribution mix we now have, specifically in integrated payments and the opportunities that we see ahead for this segment.", "Now, I want to talk about the strong performance of the NetSpend segment starting on slide 11. Revenue for NetSpend topped $162.6 million, representing 14.8% year-over-year organic revenue growth for the quarter. Revenue growth is strong both in total and by acquisition channel with three of our four distribution channels delivering double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. This shows the results of a diversified distribution model where we continue to win new business, as well as expand and extend our existing relationships.", "The second quarter had more than $6.6 billion of gross dollar volume or spend, up 19.6% over prior year. We exited the quarter with 4.4 million active cards, almost 2.2 million of which are on direct deposit, which represents a 16.6% year-over-year increase.", "While our card and volume levels continue to increase, we are also consistently focused on expanding our distribution network by adding approximately 1000 distributing employers and locations in the quarter, bringing the current total to more than 101,000. This count does not include new distribution locations that we could add with the expanded Blackhawk relationship that Troy discussed earlier.", "Second quarter margins expanded slightly from the prior year at 26.1% and we are preparing for some larger card and marketing costs in the second half of the year associated with merchandising additional facing at Blackhawk distribution locations.", "We're pleased with NetSpend's position coming out of Q2. Our expectation for this business continues to be for revenue growth in the low double-digits on a full year basis with slightly expanding margins for 2016 versus 2015.", "Leaving NetSpend and moving to the consolidated level, again, you can see on slide 12 how each of our segment's margins contributed to our overall adjusted operating margin at 28.6%, up over 200 basis points from last year's 2Q level. The story is similar on a year-to-date basis with a 28.2% adjusted operating margin as seen on slide 13.", "Also I want to state that these slides provide a bridge between the adjusted segment operating income for each of our segments and our consolidated adjusted operating income. We provide this because our segments report their results on an adjusted segment operating income basis which excludes amortization of acquisition intangibles, M&A expenses, corporate admin and stock-based compensation.", "This slide also provides reconciliation to GAAP operating income of $287.5 million. As it relates to our cash position, we ended the quarter at $465 million in cash, up $20 million from the end of the first quarter which excluded the proceeds from the $1.49 billion we borrowed that was used for the TransFirst acquisition. We had $37 million of CapEx for the quarter, of which about 29% was related to property and equipment, 27% was related to contract acquisition costs with the remaining 44% related to internally developed and licensed software.", "When we announced the TransFirst acquisition, I highlighted our deleveraging plan of approximately $800 million of deleveraging in the first 24 months post acquisition. We deployed $125 million during the quarter for accelerated repayments on our bank credit facility, as part of our deleveraging plan and we remain committed to this plan and our investment grade rating.", "Our average basic weighted shares outstanding for the quarter were 183.7 million and 183.5 million on a year-to-date basis.", "Now a minute on cash flow, our free cash flow for the quarter was $157.6 million and our year-to-date free cash flow of $259 million is a 37.3% increase from the year-to-date levels of last year. And based on this performance, we continue to believe that our annual free cash flow estimate of $510 million to $540 million for 2016 is still valid, although I want to remind you that as demonstrated in our history, cash will not flow in a linear manner on a quarterly basis.", "On taxes, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.1%, which is higher than our normal levels due to some acquisition related effects that are one-time in nature and we expect the last half of the year to return to the 34% range, but on a reported basis the second quarter increase will move our expected full year rate from the 34% range closer to 35%.", "And finally on guidance, while our guidance remains unchanged at this time, I do want to mention that the surprise Brexit vote and its impact on the pound and euro to the dollar could negatively impact our international results in the back half of the year. If the two currencies remain at current levels, we could see an approximate 100 basis point decline or greater in our estimated revenue growth for the full year, and adjusted EPS pressure in the $0.02 range. It's too early to tell at this point, but I wanted to share that commentary with you and will update you further in 3Q on this effect.", "And finally, I want to summarize with three primary callouts that I think are the key takeaways from today. First callout is on margins, I mentioned on our January call that our focus for 2016 was going to be on margins following the strong year of organic revenue growth and margin expansion in 2015.", "Our goal going into the year was to expand our adjusted EBITDA margin by roughly 100 basis points and we wanted this margin expansion to be delivered in a cross segment way. Through the first six months we delivered against this goal with adjusted EBITDA margins increasing 130 basis points on a quarterly basis and 160 basis points on a year-to-date basis.", "With some investments made in the back half of the year, we still expect to expand this important metric by 100 basis points for the year roughly in line with what we achieved last year. Also we will be making margin improvement moves over the coming quarters to expand this story for the longer term.", "Continuing on what Troy mentioned about our TSYS 2020 efficiency and margin improvement initiatives, we expect to have approximately $5 million to $7 million of one-time related expenses in the third quarter, primarily related to severance that will be partially offset by salary and benefits savings in the fourth quarter.", "The second callout is related to the upcoming comparison in our third quarter. As you will recall, in 2015 during the third quarter, we experienced a one-time related EPS tax benefit of $0.13, which we detailed in our Q3 2015 earnings call and schedules. This $0.13 included a $15 million operating income benefit and a net $8.5 million benefit on the tax line, which had to be adjusted out of the 2015 results for a proper comparison to 3Q 2016 results and extra care on this should be applied to arrive at a better approximation of expected performance in Q3 2016.", "I want to continue to stress this point as I did on our last call and at our latest Analyst Day to allow for the proper handling of the comparison results of Q3 2016 versus Q3 of 2015. So there are three moving parts expected in the third quarter; first, you should consider the tax effect from the prior year needing adjustment. Second are the expected non-TransFirst one-time expenses of $5 million to $7 million primarily related to severance which would reduce 3Q adjusted EPS by approximately $0.02. And third, the potential currency impacts in the back half of the year that I mentioned earlier which could reduce our net revenue yearly growth rate by approximately 100 basis points with a potential $0.02 of negative EPS impact.", "The third and final call out is the continued execution against our strategic plan of creating a diversified payments company and platform. With the completion of TransFirst, we have largely completed our multiyear strategic goal of diversifying the revenue contribution to a more strategic balance of higher growth revenue streams in payments.", "We believe the balance we now have of 37% of net revenue from North America issuer processing, 33% from merchant acquiring with the acquisition of TransFirst, 20% from NetSpend and the remaining 10% from our international opportunities not including our China Union Pay JV, provides TSYS the strength of diversification that is unique in payments. When you couple this revenue diversification with our recent margin improvement plans that will continue into 2017 and beyond, you can see that the changing face of TSYS provides for a stronger and better positioned company in the future.", "None of this execution would be possible without the extreme dedication of our team members and we specifically thank our new team members from TransFirst who joined us during the quarter and made strong contributions to the success of this quarter. We thank our entire team for delivering another successful quarter of outstanding results.", "And with that we will open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from Timothy Willi from Wells Fargo. Go ahead.", "Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thanks and good afternoon. My first question was regarding NetSpend and Blackhawk. Could you just maybe talk a little bit more about what that partnership is and to what degree that would show up in the income statement or accounts on file just so we can sort of think about that?", "M. Troy Woods - Chairman, & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Tim, hey Troy, and I'll take that on the front-end and Paul may want to add to it on the backside. As I indicated in my opening remarks Tim, we've had long-standing relationship with Blackhawk for many years, primarily utilizing their expansive network for distribution to help us get into the retail arena. This new agreement, which is a 10-year agreement, allows us to move further and deeper into the program management with Blackhawk, primarily taking advantage of their large-scale operation in grocery stores and retail in general. And so I'll let Paul address the financial side of it, but it's a really big win and kudos for our NetSpend group to expand this strategic partnership.", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President", "Yeah sure, Tim, good question. And from a, first of all obviously, we don't ever give out specific client kind of impact, but I'd say it's relatively de minimis from a 2016 perspective, but does become meaningful if all the projections kind of play out in a 2017 context. And I would just kind of reinforce that the strategic nature of getting this partnership, if you think back to kind of the late 2014 timeframe where we had several strategic partnerships that we announced in that timeframe, we didn't have those in 2015 and that's actually kind of providing some of the rollover challenge in the second half of the year for NetSpend. So it's nice to have a strategic win of this of some meaningful size that we will get benefit for in the 2017 timeframe.", "Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. And my follow-up was still on NetSpend, but I know over the last year or so you've had a higher level of investment spending. You've talked about product and growth orientated. I guess just any thoughts around where you're at with that, if we should expect that to have peaked or as we think through 2016 and just conceptually into 2017 if there's still an appetite for a pretty heavy level of research development product type spending?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President", "Sure Tim, good question. I wouldn't say it's peaked, but I would also say that the trajectory has slowed, and so you're not going to see us spend at the kind of growth rate there specifically as it relates to marketing on a year-over-year basis and specifically as it relates to the fourth quarter that you saw us do last year. But I will say we are strategic in our investments with NetSpend and that when we see growth, we have the flexibility to want to deploy growth capital down that path. And so that certainly played itself out of our spend in the latter half of last year and what we saw in the first half of this year, which exceeded our expectations. And you heard my prepared remarks. We're going to provide for some added spending around this new Blackhawk engagement, but you are not going to see the trajectory of growth that you saw last year.", "Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thanks very much.", "M. Troy Woods - Chairman, & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, if I could just add to that, Tim, in addition to what Paul indicated, we talked on at least one occasion, maybe twice, about our small business rollout and it too requires investment. We have a lot of good plans for our smaller business rollout and it too again requires investment as we develop new products. So I think we'll continue that in the years to come.", "Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Darrin Peller from Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks guys. Just to be clear, I know you mentioned the North America revenue growth rate deceleration was really the anniversary of Bank of America and I think you said the impact of tougher comps on output solutions, but was there any impact yet from Green Dot rolling off? I know you mentioned I think three of the four initiatives needed to happen and it was almost there, but I just wonder if any revenue impacted now.", "And then if you can just comment on the high single-digit growth in AOF versus revenue growth rate of low single-digits, the disconnect now there and if that's going to be a sort of way to model it out, sustainable spread between the two. Thanks guys.", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President", "Sure, Darrin. As it relates to the sequential quarter revenue growth rate, you are exactly right. I mean that's exactly what happened. And as I said, we still expect the North America business to be at that mid single-digit revenue growth that we expected at the beginning of the year. We do have the comp issue with the large conversion from that sequential quarter comparison, but we are from a kind of a year-over-year basis, the single biggest kind of grow over challenge is in output services where we had a higher elevated revenue from output services last year related to EMV.", "And you recall last year throughout the year, I was saying that those services were coming in at higher than expected ranges. We kind of got an elevated level there that we're been dealing with this year and over time that will all kind of mute itself out. As it relates to Green Dot specifically, there is some decline there that plays out on a kind of a year-over-year basis, but outside of that, I wouldn't characterize anything else that's dramatically playing out there.", "As it relates to the account on file and the North America revenue piece, yeah, I mean, as we have gotten to be kind of have a more bundled piece with this new base that we're at, the connection points between the accounts on file and revenue growth is looser. And specifically when you have value-added services and you have a bigger portion coming from kind of the non-account on file base fees, then you get into that kind of disconnect, so I would characterize it that way.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. And just as follow-up, I mean, again nothing has changed on your view for mid to high-single digit growth for that segment longer-term? And then on the merchant side, what was the organic growth rate of that segment, if maybe I missed it or the pro forma organic growth rate if you want is fine too?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President", "Yeah. So, on the mid single-digit, obviously, what we said at Analyst Day and kind of on a longer-term horizon, we still believe that when you separate out the kind of one-time things in nature that mid single-digit revenue growth over the longer term is still valid on North America. As it relates to the merchant segment, high single digit kind of revenue growth is the right kind of range to be thinking about there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Please go ahead.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi, good evening, Troy and Paul. Let me start with a number of things that were laid out in the financial section of your prepared comments. You talked about the $0.02 severance \u2013 a potential $0.02 impact to Brexit. I think I heard you say, it's higher tax rate as well in there and you're kind of rolling all of these things in, but leaving your guidance relatively unchanged. So, I just want to get you to comment on what are the offsets that you expect to continue to see on the other side of it?", "M. Troy Woods - Chairman, & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Ashwin and you're exactly right. I mean, those are the items that we got facing us in the second half and a couple of things as it relates to offset, one is on the one-time expected kind of one-time related severance expenses in the third quarter. We do see some partial offset in the fourth quarter that I mentioned in the prepared remarks from the salary and benefit savings that we would see in the fourth quarter, so there's some partial offsetting there.", "And as we look at kind of the business and how it's performed, and you kind of put it altogether, it does kind of push us to a little bit of over performance that we've had in the first half of the year that didn't get kind of netted against some of these pressure points in the second half of the year. So, you're exactly right, the biggest thing I wanted to call out was those impacts happening in the third quarter and then some of those impacts kind of begin to mute out some in the fourth quarter.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Got it. And then just want to focus on the international side a bit. First half of the year, margins up on average 375 basis points by our math. But you're still looking for only a slight margin expansion, and I can understand there's maybe 100 basis points of international \u2013 of Brexit related exposure there, but can you remind us what goes on in the second half of the year, is it primarily tough comps that you're looking to bring the margin improvement profile down to that modest level, which I think you described as 25 basis to 100 basis points?", "M. Troy Woods - Chairman, & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Ashwin that's exactly right. And we had described it that way and that's still our expectation on a constant currency basis to be in that range of margin expansion. I think the key thing to point to \u2013 and this has been the case for several fourth quarters on a comparison basis is we do have the challenging comps in the fourth quarter of this year from a margin standpoint relative to the fourth quarter of last year.", "And when you look at our International segment now, once again net of currency impact it is in a much tighter band now that we've got to this kind of 18%-plus margin goal as you look on a sequential quarter basis is our expectation. Wherein the past you've seen ramp-ups quarter-to-quarter on a sequential basis that ramping up effect is more normalizing now, and we don't see any type of significant one-time things on the International side that kind of provide this challenge on a go-forward basis, but that's the issue is, is on a fourth quarter basis, the comparison challenge there is what's driving that differential.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from George Mihalos.", "Allison Jordan - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hi, this is Allison Jordan in for George. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on your reiteration of the 100 basis points of margin expansion for the full year, despite the strong expansion seen over the first half. Maybe if you could comment on where you expect to see margin expansion flowing over the back half? And then also for my follow-up, if you could comment on if margins north of 28% North America segment is still a fair expectation for the second half?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President", "So, Allison, yes as it relates to the adjusted margin on the second half of the year, I think I'll point to two things. One, and I commented on this on our last call, if you look at our North America segment margin for the first half of the year versus the second half, we had that 41% margin that I commented on the time being much higher than our high-30% range that that business is more normalized at. And so that has created some \u2013 when you look at second half to first half the comparison challenges that exist there.", "I'd also point to the second half of NetSpend relative to the first half and due to some of the investments that we make in the back half of the year that are pre-tax season in nature that also kind of plays things out, although we do expect the second half of the year NetSpend margin on a year-over-year basis to be favorable. When you look at the first half to the second half, that's planned in there as well.", "So those will be the two from a segment standpoint. There's other things that play out, but as I said, we still expect that overall yearly margin profile \u2013 adjusted segment margin profile to be at that roughly 100 basis points and you get to it with that componentry.", "Allison Jordan - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yes, hi, guys. Just looking at North American value-added products loyalty and services up 13% that number looks like and feels like an acceleration. Maybe you can talk about where that number has been tracking recently and what the outlook is for that business? And what percentage of revenue is it? I recall it being maybe 15% to 20% of the North America segment?", "M. Troy Woods - Chairman, & Chief Executive Officer", "I'll take the second part of that, Bryan. As we indicated on several occasions, we track our value add as a percent of our revenue. In North America for the quarter, it was 19% all in. The individual items that I called out, and I think Paul did as well, I'll let him specifically address those, but the same point...", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President", "Yes, that's right. And we didn't call out and, Bryan we captured three different sides of our business here, value-added being one, managed services being two and loyalty being three in that 13%, which is one of the ways that we've looked at the growth, and it is not actually an accelerating. In fact, it's actually little bit of a decelerating picture on a quarter to quarter basis, and we'll continue to actually de-sell in the remaining third and fourth quarters as well as some of the componentry in that year-over-year the growth rates are as robust off of his new elevated basis they were last year.", "And so the improvement from year-over-year is still very strong. It's still obviously much stronger than our overall growth rate of our business, which you would expect. Our cross sell initiatives around those are as robust as ever, but it is not fair to say it's an accelerating picture. It'd be more fair to say it's a decelerating picture when you look at sequential quarters, and that will continue in the third and fourth quarter. Once again that all comes together in a mid-single digit revenue growth expectation for the segment for the year.", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "I got that. And then just a follow-up on the segment, how big now is that output component that's going to become a drag as a percentage of that segment revenue? And then just a clarification on the revenue growth in the segment, I think you said mid-single-digit longer-term. Just making sure it's mid-single-digit because I've heard before or I thought I've heard before high-single-digit for the North America segment? Thanks so much.", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President", "Yes, so Bryan two things, on that we won't really breakout that output services as a separate line item, and so in the componentry there that's just not something from a competitive standpoint we break out. I would say this about output services, we do that business primarily as a service to our customers. And while it's causing some comparison challenges on a year-over-year basis, that is a lower-margin business than our overall segment.", "Now, as Bill Pruett mentioned in our Analyst Day, that is a business that potentially has some upside to it to the degree that we are more successful in cross-selling into our installed base. And so from a future growth potential standpoint, there is some there. But without that piece and with that higher EMV elevation that has occurred throughout last year that we're dealing with now in the second, it will increase in the third and the fourth quarter, we are having that rollover piece.", "As it relates to your second question, it is mid-single digit revenue growth expectation both for this year, and as I look out on a longer-term basis right now everything I see still points us to mid-single digit. I think two years ago at our Analyst Day we kind of said mid-to-high, but that was before we had the benefit of the seasoning of this large conversion that came into the base.", "I think, I did said at that time, we were closer to mid than high but I wanted to see the large conversion come into the base and relook at the portfolio with that in there. Now that we've done that we're at that mid-single-digit rate right now.", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. That makes sense. Thanks for the color.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Kwok from KBW. Please go ahead.", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Most of them have been answered. Just wanted to follow-up on TransFirst. Could you tell us what the revenue and adjusted operating income growth was for the quarter and what your expectations are for the rest of the year?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President", "Steven, no, we don't break that out separate. I know we did talk about this some in our last call as it relates to what some of the expectation was on a full-year basis, and I think we also said there wasn't going to be significant change on a sequential quarter basis as it relates to that contribution. But I would say this, it's from an organic growth standpoint, high-single digits with low-double-digit volume growth, it's the right range to be thinking about there. Obviously, as I pointed out on our last call, TransFirst now is under our revenue convention here, and obviously when you look at the margin picture, as I commented earlier, that margin picture and that contribution has been very consistent with what we had on a historical basis. So I think that gives you the color you need there on meeting the expectations there.", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Okay. Got it. And then separately as a follow-up, on the CFPB moving it now to September, is there anything we should read into the delay in the timeline? Just wanted to get your thoughts on that. Thanks.", "M. Troy Woods - Chairman, & Chief Executive Officer", "Steven, I wish I could handicap that for you. As you well know, this was probably at least the third, maybe the fourth delay in getting these final rules out, but really beyond that there's nothing we can add. We've just learned this in the last literally week or so that it was going to be September. I wish we could add more.", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Vasu Govil from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Vasundhara Govil - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just quickly, thanks a lot for your comments on Brexit. I wanted to ask if you could talk about your revenue exposure to UK. And then specifically given the uncertainty that it creates, do you expect that to be a hurdle in the decision making process of your prospective clients?", "M. Troy Woods - Chairman, & Chief Executive Officer", "Why not I'll take the second part of that, Vasu, and Paul can certainly address what he made in his opening comments as well as maybe go around the potential headwind around currency. As I indicated, there is a lot of uncertainty in the market over there around everything from the economy to trade to political to market uncertainty, and although the equity markets have rallied somewhat since the Brexit vote, I think it would be unwise to dismiss this as just an event. I think it's going to be a long process. It's not just an act. I think we'll just have to, as I said earlier, continue to monitor it and watch it.", "Some of our customers' stock took quite a beating there over the few weeks after the Brexit vote, down anywhere from 10% to 50%. I think as it relates to making a decision, as I indicated in my remarks, in talking to some of our customers across Europe, they've indicated that business as usual with respect to TSYS. But I really think over time we'll just have to see what kind of varying degrees of disruption that may bring. I think it's just going to take a long time to figure it all out, sort it all out.", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President", "Yeah, and I'll just add on to that as it relates to the sizing of euro-based revenues. So I think if you look at a 7% to 10% range, depending on which period you're looking at, depending on other moving pieces, that's kind of the right range of European-based revenue exposure. And obviously with the TransFirst acquisition, it moves to the lower end of that range as it relates to sizing there. So that would give you the color there that that relates to.", "Vasundhara Govil - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks, guys. I just wanted to ask a follow-up on North America where you guys broke out the value-added, the loyalty on the managed services. I know you said that the value-added piece alone was 19% of revenue. I thought I remember that those three buckets in aggregate from the Analyst Day might be upwards of 40% to 50% of North America. If that's right, I guess the implied growth for core processing would have been negative, maybe low-to-mid single digits in the quarter. Is that math right?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President", "Well, we've got several components there and what we're not adding in is the output services piece, and so the componentry there is you have to add that piece in to get to the total. So I wouldn't necessarily go to the core piece being negative, but obviously if that's growing at a 13% range with that piece and we have this negative impact on output services, the growth on the core side is lower than the mid single-digit range that we have for the whole year.", "Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC", "Okay, okay. And then just to clarify on the EPS guide for the year, I guess you are reiterating the $2.78 to $2.85. You've got $0.04, I guess a potential headwind from the currency and from the restructuring. Are you encouraging us to think about the lower part of the range as more likely, or do you feel like there's enough offsets from some of the first half over-performance? I just want to make sure we get the second half modeling right.", "M. Troy Woods - Chairman, & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, Jason, Yes, that is what I'm saying with that is that it does push us to the lower end of that range.", "Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Thank you for clarifying.", "M. Troy Woods - Chairman, & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tom McCrohan from CLSA. Please go ahead.", "Thomas McCrohan - CLSA Americas LLC", "Hi, guys. At the Analyst Day, you talked about an opportunity I think of about $500 million in North America value-added services, maybe split 60/40 loyalty and output services, and I'm just trying to square that opportunity with the deceleration commentary around value-added services. So is that number still applicable? Do you still think there is a $500 million of revenue opportunity for that segment and how should we reconcile the comments about this big opportunity and the deceleration in value-added services?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President", "Yeah so, Tom, they are kind of two separate pieces. The opportunity set that was mentioned at Analyst Day is still valid. But it is more of a multiyear opportunity set and requires successful cross-selling of that opportunity set. And you'll recall at Analyst Day, that was more of kind of looking at our base and taking a higher percentage of penetration. One of the examples was in output services, and then sizing what that opportunity set was. But once again, you have to be successful in achieving that through more multiyear execution.", "As it relates to what we're dealing with on the current year or even as you look into the more nearer term is this mid-single-digit revenue growth that we're still expecting for this year. And specifically as it relates to this output services, that's really more of a 2016 impact that we're seeing from a 2015 inflated base due to EMV primarily, although there are some other moving pieces in there, which we'll always have one-time items and moving pieces in this business. So you would almost need to think of them in two buckets: one, what's the current run rate of the business and what's that looking like? And two, then what's the longer-term future opportunity set of a higher penetration of cross-sell of our service into our installed base.", "Thomas McCrohan - CLSA Americas LLC", "Okay, thanks, Paul. And then a quick follow-up in International, about a sequential 470 basis point deceleration in looks like single use accounts, accounts on file. When you add in the single use, seemed like it kind of slowed down. So is there anything you can call out there on what's going on with single-use accounts in particular?", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President", "I wouldn't call anything out specifically there. And typically as we talked about before it's why we don't even really highlight the single use, those come with such a lower revenue concentration per account that it doesn't make that kind of a significant impact. There's also some purging activity on some of that single use that's also planned into that number. So nothing that I would call out from a significance standpoint.", "Thomas McCrohan - CLSA Americas LLC", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President", "We probably purged, what, pushing 1 million accounts in the quarter?", "M. Troy Woods - Chairman, & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Paul Michael Todd - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President", "International also.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Shawn Roberts for any closing remarks.", "Shawn Roberts - Senior Director, Investor Relations", "Thank you, Andrea, and thank you, everybody, for participating in the call this evening. As always, I'll be around for follow-up questions and we hope to see you on the road in the near future. Thanks.", "Operator", "The conference has now concluded.

Please note this event is being recorded.", "I will now like to turn the conference over to Shawn Roberts, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Shawn Roberts - Total System Services, Inc.", "Thank you, Angie, and welcome, everyone. As a result of the feedback and conversations with many of you, we've decided to make some changes to the way that we talk about TSYS in an effort to help you all better understand and model our company. As always, a copy of our slide presentation as well as the earnings release and supplemental schedules are available on our website at investors.tsys.com. After Troy and Paul's remarks this evening, we will open the call up for Q&A.", "I'd like to remind those of you those of you participating in the Q&A that each person will have the ability to ask two questions before the operator places you back into the queue. I'd now like to call your attention to the fact that we'll be making some forward-looking statements about the future of operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS's actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in TSYS's reports filed with the SEC.", "We will also discuss items that do not conform to GAAP. We reconcile those measures to GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation and in the supplemental schedules to the press release.", "I'll now turn the call over to Troy Woods.", "M. Troy Woods - Total System Services, Inc.", "Thank you, Shawn, and welcome to third quarter earnings call. We were very pleased with our financial performance, TransFirst integration activities, record free cash flow generation, and our overall execution during the quarter. All four of our operating segments exceeded our internal targets for the quarter and I would like to thank all of our team members for their commitment, focus and dedication. It's because of this commitment, focus and dedication that we were ranked number nine on the 2016 FinTech Forward 100 list of leading technology providers in the world and also recognized by the FORTUNE Magazine as one of the FORTUNE's Fastest-Growing Companies of 2016.", "I will focus my comments today on a few key initiatives across the enterprise and Paul will provide the financial highlights for the segments and the enterprise during his presentation. Let start with North America.", "During the quarter, we hired Karim Ahmad as our new Executive Vice President of Product and Innovation. As we have discussed on several occasions, accelerating our product capabilities will be crucial to our North America growth story. We are convinced that with Karim's knowledge, experience and leadership, we will get this done.", "During our second quarter earnings call, we may have created some confusion with respect to our 2016-2018 North America net revenue guidance. I certainly apologize for that confusion and would like to take this opportunity to address it today. Let's start with 2016 guidance. We have been consistent, since providing North America segment revenue guidance in January, that the segment will grow mid-single digits in 2016, but more towards the low-end of this range. It is also become a fact to me subsequent to our earnings call and after a few conversations and visits with many of you that the definition of low, mid and high means many different things to different people.", "To help clear this up, going forward, we will no longer refer to our guidance in terms of low, mid or high ranges unless we have previously defined what these ranges are or we will simply provide numerical ranges or absolute numbers. With just one quarter left in 2016, we expect our 2016 North America net revenue growth to be at or slightly above 5%.", "Now, let's address how we view 2017 and 2018. Based on what we know at this time, we believe the organic growth profile for our North America business will be in the 5% to 7% range for this period of time and that sequential quarter growth improvement will begin in the first quarter 2017.", "Our North America business is our largest and most profitable segment and we believe the core fundamentals of this business are absolutely rock solid. Our technology, people and service capabilities, along with a world class blue chip customer base, gives us confidence we can continue to grow and expand this segment.", "And I would like to make a few comments about our merchant business. We are now six months post the acquisition of TransFirst. We were very pleased that the integration activities and synergy goals remain solidly on track. Although there have been some leadership changes, we remain relentlessly focused on growing and expanding this business. Our team is very motivated and engaged and we continue to expect good results from this segment going forward.", "Now, I would like to address NetSpend. Of course, the big news here this quarter is the publication of the CFPB's final rules on October 5 governing the prepaid industry, all 1,689 pages. As you know, there was a lot of public commentary on the proposed rules on prepaid. Some of the technical matters were addressed. However, we were disappointed with some of the positions that CFPB adopted in the final rules.", "We do welcome the certainty that these new rules bring to the prepaid industry and the CFPB's recognition of prepaid cards as safe and practical financial tools that serve a rapidly expanding consumer base. These new rules will require us to devote a significant amount of time and resources toward revising our printed, digital and telephonic disclosures and other compliance-related activities.", "As you might expect, it is taking a considerable amount of time to thoroughly review and analyze nearly 1,700 pages of regulation and commentary. Based on the current but not yet complete analysis of these rules, we anticipate a loss of revenue between $80 million to $85 million based on expected 2016 revenues. This will be as a result of the elimination of certain fees and the decision to no longer offer optional overdraft protection on our current prepaid card programs.", "As NetSpend prepares for the next evolution of its business, we will focus on product innovations that help us reach new customer segments, deepen our relationship with existing customers, and attract new partners. This will include the launch of several new products to include a new demand deposit account product and a small business prepaid product. Our new demand deposit account product will include features such as check writing ability, enhanced savings features, and optional overdraft protection.", "Paul will provide additional details on our revenue and EPS timing expectations in his presentation. We continue to steadfastly believe that significant opportunities remain to grow our prepaid business. It is projected that over $112 billion will be loaded onto prepaid cards in 2018 alone, double the amount loaded in 2012. This is the growth profile that led us to acquire NetSpend in 2013 and we plan to continue to be a leader in this space.", "And finally, I would like to make a comment regarding our capital allocation plans. As I previously mentioned, we generated record free cash flow in the third quarter and year-to-date. This strong cash generation has allowed us to accelerate some of our debt reduction plans that Paul will also address. This accelerated debt reduction, strong free cash flow generation and our confidence in our momentum provides us the opportunity to re-enter the market in the coming quarters with respect to share repurchases.", "All in all, it was a very good quarter; all four segments grew revenue, three of our four segments expanded margins notwithstanding severance cost, 10 million new traditional accounts on file were added during the quarter, and we continued to execute on our overall business strategy.", "I now would like to turn the call over to Paul to provide detailed financial information for the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2016. Paul?", "Paul Michael Todd - Total System Services, Inc.", "Thank you, Troy, and I'd like to reiterate how pleased we are with the quarter's performance and our year-to-date results. But before I get into the segment results, I want to highlight a few things. First, each of our segments beat our internal projections for the quarter and each is in line with the expectations we laid out at the beginning of the year. Second, our TransFirst acquisition integration continues on track, with our expense takeout synergies from the combined businesses meeting our expectations.", "Third, the deleveraging of our balance sheet is ahead of plan, with $175 million of debt pay-down during the quarter, bringing our two-quarter total of deleveraging to $300 million. You may recall, we've said we plan to reduce our leverage by $800 million over eight quarters, so the $300 million through two quarters reflects our progress on this target.", "Fourth, as we discussed on our last call, through planned organizational efficiencies, we incurred severance expenses of approximately $9 million during the quarter, which was higher than our original estimate, but we were more aggressive in addressing the expense base that will position us stronger going forward.", "And finally, as we discussed on our last call, we absorbed some significant currency headwinds during the quarter that reduced our revenue growth by approximately 200 basis points and EPS by approximately $0.03. With these items as a backdrop, I will move into our financial results.", "Moving to slide six and our consolidated financial performance, quarterly total revenues were $1.1 billion, an increase of $62% from 3Q 2015. Quarterly net revenue was $790 million, up 24.1% from last year. GAAP net income was $85.4 million, down 29.2% from last year, and GAAP basic earnings per share was $0.46, also a decrease of 29.2% from last year. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $269.1 million, an increase of 12.7% from last year, and adjusted EPS was $0.71, a decrease of $0.07 from last year.", "You may recall we had a $0.13 adjusted EPS pick up in 3Q 2015 related to taxes, and isolating that impact on a comparative basis yields an increase of a much higher adjusted EPS impact than reported. Also, the additional $0.03 of severance we experienced in the quarter coupled with the approximately $0.03 of currency impact point to an approximate $0.19 of items in the comparative third quarter 2016 versus 2015 adjusted EPS growth picture.", "Our free cash flow for the quarter grew by 37.5% and 36.8% through nine months, showing that the cash flow generating strength of TSYS continues in the legacy business and is complemented by the strong contribution from TransFirst. This is the second straight quarter of double-digit free cash flow growth and we expect our free cash flow to be in the $550 million to $570 million range for the year, which is higher than the $510 million to $540 million range we had previously expected.", "Now, onto our segments' results, starting on slide eight with North America. North America business performed slightly better in 3Q than we had planned, increasing revenue by 2.4% on record traditional accounts on file of 444.6 million. Our expectation for revenue growth for this business for 2016 continues to be at or slightly above 5%. This is exactly where we thought the business would be when we entered the year and the core fundamentals of the business remain intact. Our margin for the quarter was 37.7%, but included approximately $6 million of severance expense for this segment. And without this expense, segment margin would have been 39.7%.", "Now on to international on slide nine. The 7.4% constant currency growth continues the trend of an improving constant currency revenue growth picture for international. While this added growth has been more related to across-the-board volume gains with a new record level of accounts on file, we are pleased that our pivot from margin focus to revenue growth is showing signs of success.", "While we started the year expecting this segment to be largely flat on a constant currency basis, we now expect constant currency revenue growth for this segment for 2016 to be at or slightly above 5%. We're also seeing some improving prospect pipeline activity in international that, while too early to comment on, could help this growth picture going forward.", "On the margin front, while the 19.5% is in line with our long-term margin goals, it was negatively impacted by severance. And without this, the quarterly margin would've been 21.9%. And finally, while not included in our international segment results, our CUP Data joint venture continued its historic trend of double-digit growth for the quarter.", "Now onto the merchant segment on slide 10, where we remain very pleased with the financial results of the newly combined segment, with the integration and synergy plans remaining solidly on track. While the 112% reported growth is impressive, our core organic growth for our combined direct business continues to be in the high-single digit range, in line with the industry, and our focus in direct continues to be in the integrated channel, which represents approximately 30% of our direct business.", "The indirect side had some contraction in the quarter due to some favorable items in 3Q of 2015 that I talked about previously and, without those indirect growth would've been approximately 2%. The margin for the segment remained stable at 34.6%.", "Finally, on to NetSpend on slide 11, the revenue growth of NetSpend of 11.2% for the quarter continued the four-and-a-half year trend of double-digit revenue growth. We saw an 18.1% increase in GDV and a 15.8% year-over-year increase in direct deposit active cards. Our margin of 26.3% was relatively consistent with last year's margin, and we continue to expect the business to grow in the low-to-mid teens for 2016, which is better than what we had previously expected.", "However, we do expect 4Q revenue growth to be lower than 3Q levels, partly due to not growing our marketing investment as significantly in the second half of 2016 as we did in the second half of 2015. We also expect as we have all year to have slightly expanding margins for the segment for 2016.", "Before I leave NetSpend, I do want to comment on the CFPB's final rules on prepaid that Troy mentioned. While we will be talking more about this in the coming quarters, I do want to provide some baseline information regarding the potential effect to our NetSpend business related to the rules. First, we expect no negative financial impact to our 2016 expected results related to the rules since they will not become effective until the fourth quarter of 2017.", "Second, we currently estimate that the 2016 total revenues that would've been impacted by the rules would be approximately $80 million to $85 million with estimated EPS impact of $0.19 to $0.21 including compliance costs. The $80 million to $85 million of impacted revenue consists of overdraft revenue, which was roughly 10% to 12% of NetSpend's revenue, and certain other fees that are disallowed by the rule.", "As it relates to 2017 and 2018, Troy mentioned that we have been and will continue to work on our business expansion strategies. Based in part on our current but not yet complete analysis of the prepaid rules and the CFPB's underlying intent, we currently estimate with the October 1, 2017 implementation date that our calendar year 2017 total revenues will be negatively impacted by approximately $20 million to $25 million.", "For 2018, we expect total revenues to also be impacted by an additional $20 million to $25 million. In other words, we expect to offset close to half of the negative revenue impact of the rules through our business expansion strategies. Regarding EPS, we currently expect $0.06 to $0.08 negative EPS impact in 2017 and an additional $0.05 to $0.07 of negative impact in 2018. In other words, we expect our business expansion strategies to offset roughly one-third of the negative EPS impact of the rules.", "I want to emphasize that these are preliminary estimates and are subject to change positively or negatively as we learn more and our strategies progress. The success of our strategies depend on the rate of adoption of our new products, both by consumers and our distribution partners, the rate of utilization of the various product features by cardholders, market regulatory dynamics, and a host of other factors that will play out over time, and our estimated impact could vary positively or negatively based on these and other factors. And we will comment more on these in our upcoming calls as we move closer to the October 2017 date.", "Also, I want to highlight that our NetSpend revenue growth for 2015 and 2016 would not change by more than 100 basis points positively or negatively if you excluded the revenue items impacted by the rules showing that the strong double-digit organic revenue growth has been delivered by the core fundamentals of the NetSpend business.", "Finally, as we mentioned in our press release, our guidance remains unchanged for adjusted EPS at $2.78 to $2.85, but we're no longer pointing to the low-end of the range as we did on our last call due to the over-performance we have experienced.", "However, we are adjusting our total revenue and net revenue ranges down slightly to reflect the year-to-date currency impact as well as expected currency impact for the fourth quarter. On a constant currency basis, however, our revenues on both a total revenue and net revenue basis would've remained in our original ranges and our EPS would have likely exceeded the top-end of our EPS range.", "To wrap up, the segments are on track with our expectations and we still expect our margins to slightly expand across all four segments. Our TransFirst acquisition integration and synergy achievement is on track. Our deleveraging plan is ahead of schedule. Our work to define the optimal operating structure for the company yielded greater cost structure efficiencies on a go-forward basis than we had planned.", "The uncertainty of the CFPB ruling is behind us and allows us to execute on our strategies in NetSpend on a go-forward basis with clarity as it relates to the final rules. And our core organic revenue growth targets for our businesses are on track. In all, the third quarter was an important one on many front and we're pleased with the position we are in.", "And with that, we will open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from Darrin Peller from Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. Nice job and thanks for the clarification around the CFPB. It's good to see. First of all, on the North America segment, the non-prepaid growth did look strong to us. I know it's been \u2013 it looks like it's been accelerating actually against even tough comps over the past couple of quarters. Can you just start off there, explaining what's driving that, are there new account wins, is it current accounts adding more than expected? And then maybe what we can expect on that front in terms of AOF (23:36) growth. It looks \u2013 it was a little bit better than our expectations. Thanks.", "Paul Michael Todd - Total System Services, Inc.", "Sure, Darrin. I'll start off and then if Troy wants to add some additional commentary. Yeah, that is true. The non-prepaid growth has been stronger. I think one way of potentially kind of looking at the growth for the quarter is to \u2013 if you exclude out the prepaid kind of out of both periods, which we talked about our exiting of that and you also take out kind of EMV impact that we've also talked about having the second half EMV impact, and you look at the revenue growth rate that's kind of reported 2.4%, goes up into the range that Troy talked about in the 5% to 7% range. So that is kind of the, I think, the indicator that you're trying to get out of what the core growth of the business more looks like ex both the prepaid factor and also kind of this EMV rollover.", "M. Troy Woods - Total System Services, Inc.", "Yeah. I think, Darrin, the only thing I would really add to that is I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we added over 10 million accounts in the quarter over the sequential quarter and I'm sure you've seen some of the press releases of some of our large customers and their growth continues in the card area. We're also beginning to see some effects of what Paul mentioned in the C&B world of our chip authorizations. So, as we talked several quarters ago, we do get some incremental fees to enable and to handle a chip authorization and they're beginning to grow and grow and grow each quarter. And so those things are helpful as well.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yeah. Were there any other large wins, not like the BofA size, but other large wins that have been driving the actual AOF growth acceleration or is it just more of the same with large existing accounts?", "M. Troy Woods - Total System Services, Inc.", "No, it's clearly more of the same.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. And then \u2013 that's great, guys. And then just quickly on the international side, I just want to hone in a bit on the comments you made before over the pipeline and some traction. Obviously, it's been a segment that you guys have managed margins well for a while, but the revenue growth has been a little slower. So, can you just give a little more color on what you were indicating earlier with what you're seeing? Thanks, again, guys.", "M. Troy Woods - Total System Services, Inc.", "Well, I'll take the front end of it, Darrin, and Paul can certainly add to it. We made this comment last quarter that our pipeline, our prospect pipeline is as good as it has ever been on the international side. And although there are a few wins and we're just not in a position to announce or discuss on this call, I think they will come relatively soon when we can make them public.", "When you look at the at least 7.4% constant currency growth, it has certainly picked up. We had one quarter, I think, a little bit higher than that this year, but we continually believe and we'll talk about that a little bit later, if you want, about some of the expectations we have for 2017. But we really believe we are on a path now of seeing, on a constant currency basis, the growth profile of international picking up. Paul, do you want to add to that?", "Paul Michael Todd - Total System Services, Inc.", "No, I don't have anything to add. That was exactly the point I was going to make as well is, is that if you think about where we started at the beginning of the year on international of roughly kind of a flat constant currency picture and now we're saying that's at or better than 5%, the picture both on a reported basis is better, but also then we're seeing kind of an additive pipeline basis as well. But, as I said, it's too early to comment on. So, it's more of a forward-looking thing, but it is something that has improved as well from where we started the year.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "That's great to hear, guys. Just very last quick one on management changes, I know John having left the acquiring side, and maybe just a little color, any plans around that or is it basically going to keep going with the TAM? And then, thanks again. Great quarter, guys.", "M. Troy Woods - Total System Services, Inc.", "Thank you, Darrin. I'll be glad to hear. Yeah, certainly, we had some leadership changes as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. And I also mentioned, Darrin, that we have a very dedicated and focused team at TransFirst and our legacy business. Pam has certainly stepped up spending a lot more time in the merchant sector. She has spent a lot of time physically on the ground at TransFirst as well as our legacy businesses.", "There has been some reorganization around the remaining senior leadership team. We're not running around like our hair is on fire to be honest with you. We will take care of quality time and work through this and we'll let you know as soon as we can about our future plans about the leadership of our merchant segment.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Please go ahead.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thanks, guys, for the clarification that you guys provided here. My question is whether the outlook that you provided does that already contemplate the impact of large contract renewals that maybe coming up. And could you also break out the growth potential into volume based both AOF and transaction growth versus value-added services?", "M. Troy Woods - Total System Services, Inc.", "Yeah, I'll take the first part of that, Ashwin. And absolutely, when we talk about our growth profiles, we are baking in all of our segments.", "Paul Michael Todd - Total System Services, Inc.", "Yeah. And as it relates to the volume based versus the value-added piece, on the volume based side, we see roughly in line with what we saw in the second quarter, call it, in that 4% range. On the value-added that we have a several different components go in there. We did see some contraction on a little bit of that there due to some one-time things that didn't recur. So, volume-based is commensurate, but we did have some contraction on a sequential quarter basis on the value-added side due to some kind of non-recurring things that didn't occur in this quarter that we did get in the second quarter.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Right. I guess my question was, as you look forward into next year and the year after, what sorts of impact would you anticipate with regards to volume based versus non-volume based?", "Paul Michael Todd - Total System Services, Inc.", "Ashwin, on a 2017 basis, we wouldn't kind of go there yet in kind of providing that kind of clarity. But I think with the clarity that Troy kind of gives from a 5% to 7% range, and if you kind of looked at where we are at the kind of, call it, 4% range on that volume-based piece and then you separate out kind of this EMV piece, which I just talked about, I think you can probably build up the componentry between the volume-based and the value-added piece that kind of puts you in the range that Troy pointed to with that 5% to 7%.", "We'll comment on that more obviously when we come out with our 2017 guidance because, obviously, that range \u2013 we'll have a lot more clarity as we finish our planning process for 2017 at the kind of componentry level, but that's what I would give you as kind of guidance at this stage on how to put the components together to get to that range.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And my second question, the business expansion strategies that you mentioned that offset the CFPB impact, at least partially, does that include normal growth in NetSpend or is it on top of normal growth?", "M. Troy Woods - Total System Services, Inc.", "It's on top of it. It's incremental, Ashwin. We're primarily talking about the products that I mentioned in my remarks around the small business card and the new DDA demand deposit product.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan Dolev from Nomura. Please go ahead.", "Dan Dolev - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Are you \u2013 I really appreciate you actually quantifying the North America guidance in terms of the exact percent. Are you willing to actually quantify what you mean by high-single digits in the merchant acquiring side and whether or not you're seeing an acceleration or deceleration in that direct business? Thank you.", "Paul Michael Todd - Total System Services, Inc.", "Yeah, Dan. So, when we talk about high-single digit, that's a 7% to 9% kind of range that we use there. And I wouldn't say we're necessarily seeing acceleration, but I certainly would say that we're seeing very substantiation for that revenue growth rate range. And so, as we talked about on our second quarter call around high-single digits for the merchant segment, we had the same type of core organic kind of growth in this quarter and we're not seeing anything that changes that.", "Dan Dolev - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Got it. Thank you very much. That was it.", "Operator", "The next question comes from George Mihalos from Cowen. Please go ahead.", "George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Great. Thanks. And appreciate the transparency you guys have been providing on the call. Nice job.", "Just wanted to start off with a point of clarification on the North America 5% to 7%, I guess, from 2016 to 2018. Just to be clear, does that mean that for 2017, the minimum amount of growth that you're expecting is 5%, or is that an average over the next two years?", "M. Troy Woods - Total System Services, Inc.", "No, that's right, George. That's the range. It's the minimum 5% to 7%, 2017.", "George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. That's great. Thanks for clarifying that. And then, as it relates to the buyback and coming back into the market, it sounds like you would be ready to start buying back shares sort of early in the second half of 2017. Is that roughly what you're thinking right now?", "Paul Michael Todd - Total System Services, Inc.", "Yeah. This is Paul. I wouldn't say there is necessarily a time horizon that we'd point to other than, I think, as Troy indicated in his prepared remarks, we had talked earlier that it was an $800 million over eight quarters and Troy indicated that with the acceleration that we had, it's likely that you reach the $800 million before that period. So, the flexibility that kind of presents itself opens up a sooner than kind of eight-quarter picture there.", "I'd reiterate that deleveraging is still our first and highest priority as it relates to the use of our free cash flow, and so we're going to remain focused around that. Our investment grade rating is still very important to us. And so, I'd stand back from an exact timing, but I do think the point that Troy made is one we wanted to convey, that we are well ahead of our targets on this important metric.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from James Friedman from SIG. Please go ahead.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Hi. I too appreciate the increased precision in the communication. I just had two questions. Want to make sure I'm landing this right in terms of the timing, Paul. So, in terms of the 2017 impact from the CFPB, should we be landing that \u2013 meaning like the $20 million to $25 million in revenue and the earnings of \u2013 get this right, $0.05 to $0.07, is that \u2013 or $0.06 to $0.08 for 2017, is that \u2013 should all that land in the fourth quarter or is it throughout the year?", "Paul Michael Todd - Total System Services, Inc.", "For 2017, it's weighted in the fourth quarter, but there will be \u2013 because of some of the compliance costs that we have that begin to start showing up in the third quarter, it's a second half emphasis of those two metrics there. The revenue certainly weights to the fourth quarter, but the EPS impact would have a third quarter impact with a heavy fourth quarter weight.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Got it. Makes sense. And then my follow-up, I know you called out the severance last quarter already, where are we in that journey? Should we be modeling something in for the remainder of the year? Any help on that would be appreciated.", "Paul Michael Todd - Total System Services, Inc.", "Yes. Well, so I'll start off and Troy may want to add some additional color. We are largely there. So, obviously, we took the approximately $9 million in the quarter. But I will say that we do have this kind of cost focus in our company right now that is ongoing and so it's not going to be near to any kind of the scale that we're talking about. But to say that if we go to zero also probably wouldn't be accurate as well, but it wouldn't be anything that I would call out that you would want to put it in your model as significant enough to register.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi. This is Ashish Sabadra calling on behalf of Bryan. A question around the impact of CFPB; it looks like the $80 million, $85 million translates to more than 12% of current NetSpend revenues. So an overdraft was 10% to 12%. I understand certain other fees are going away as well. But are you assuming like the entire overdraft goes away or is \u2013 and again, just in terms of your assumption, is there any kind of \u2013 is it aggressive or is it more \u2013 is there any conservatism baked in there?", "Paul Michael Todd - Total System Services, Inc.", "So, Ashish, this is Paul. As it relates to the assumption, it is all of the overdraft revenue going away and that makes up that $80 million to $85 million. And as it relates to either conservative or aggressive, it is our understanding based on what we know right now. So, it isn't really conservative or aggressive to it because it is just the universe that's being affected by the rules as we understand them right now.", "Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "No, that helps. And also when we \u2013 the second question would be, when we translate this $85 million, I believe all of that would have hit the net income, but the impact is less to the EPS because of the rev share maybe or commissions that you give to the distributors. I was just wondering if you could elaborate on how we should think about the EPS impact.", "Paul Michael Todd - Total System Services, Inc.", "Well, I think if you do the $0.06 to $0.08 relative to the $20 million to $25 million, it does take almost all of it down to kind of the EPS. And so, we have two components there. We have kind of the margin as it relates to the revenue and then we also have the kind of compliance costs, the kind of some of the one-time costs related to that all in that $0.06 to $0.08 in 2017 or the $0.05 to $0.07 incremental in 2018. So, I think the answer to your question, it includes both, both the margin as well as the cost associated with implementing the rules.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dave Koning from Baird. Please go ahead.", "David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah. Hey, guys. I guess my first question just on the NetSpend, on the core revenue side, is the best way to think of this is an ongoing double-digit grower at the core, and then after that takeout, the $20 million to $25 million in calendar 2017 and then do the same thing in 2018, grow it again by 10% to 15% or so and then takeout the $20 million to $25 million, like, is that probably the best way for us to think about it still?", "Paul Michael Todd - Total System Services, Inc.", "Dave, I think that a couple of things there. One is we've got a lot of moving parts in NetSpend right now. With this rule, obviously, we grew the third quarter at 11%. I said in my prepared remarks that that 11% is going to be less in the fourth quarter due to kind of some lower level investment, was one item, and we have some other things. I think that the overall \u2013 I read a report here that the overall market of prepaid has a slower growth dynamic to it. We've been very targeted in our history of NetSpend to grow at faster than the growth of the industry.", "And so, I think we would hold off as it relates to what we think specifically as it relates to 2017, the process there would certainly be right, where you just take the $20 million or the $20 million to $25 million and then apply whatever growth rate there is to that new base, but as it relates to the actual percentage, we'll get more clarity on that when we come out with our 2017 guidance.", "David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Okay. And then just a couple of kind of short ones; last quarter, you said the low-end of the $2.78 to $2.85 EPS. Are you still kind of saying that? And then the last one, just free cash flow this quarter, like you said, was very good. Was there anything unsustainable in their? Meaning is the conversion process, the free cash flow way above earnings this year kind of sustainable into next year?", "Paul Michael Todd - Total System Services, Inc.", "So, as it relates to the range, we're not, I think I said in my prepared remarks, point to the low-end of the range. We've had good outperformance in this quarter by all of our segments, so we're not pointing to that low-end that we did on the last call. And as it relates to free cash flow, we do have a kind of a little bit of timing there, but I think the biggest thing that's driving our free cash flow for this year is, we're just doing a much a better job of managing CapEx. Our capital expenditure, you see it in the appendix, we've had a very significant kind of reduction in year-over-year CapEx. And so those would be two things that I would call out, and that's what's yielding that higher conversion ratio. There isn't anything else I would call out as being kind unusual or one-time outside of those two.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Kwok from KBW. Please go ahead.", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Most of them have been answered. Just wanted to see \u2013 so the 5% to 7% growth in North America next year, does it contemplate any potential business losses? I believe you still have a piece of the Green Dot business? Thanks.", "Paul Michael Todd - Total System Services, Inc.", "Yes, Steven. As we've indicated before, when we lay out these ranges, we've taken into consideration renewals, we've taken into consideration any known business losses, any known business gains. As it relates to the Green Dot piece of your question, our current modeling suggest that all of Green Dot will be gone by the end of the second quarter of 2017.", "Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Okay, got it. Thanks. And then, lastly, just around the guidance for this year, the number that we should be looking at is that $0.71 from this quarter, right?", "Paul Michael Todd - Total System Services, Inc.", "Yeah. The number that is reported is the $0.71 that's included in the guidance range.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC", "Thanks. Good afternoon. Could you comment on the new business pipeline in the North American business? Particularly, do you see prospects for any large contract wins over the next 12 months or so?", "M. Troy Woods - Total System Services, Inc.", "Well, David, as we've indicated before on the pipeline, we don't really comment on any particular prospect we may have. As we've indicated on many occasions, we are in constant communications and dialog with anybody that does process with TSYS. And also from the standpoint of timing, obviously, these things take a considerable amount of time to get converted. So, you'll have to read into that whether we have anything on the books, if you will, for 2017 conversion. But, again, the dialog continues with really not much else to add to it.", "David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC", "Thanks. Understood. Just a quick follow-up. In your remarks, Troy, you talked about some reorganization around the remaining leadership in the merchant business. Do you anticipate keeping most of the existing management team that's in the merchant business or you speaking more about reassigning roles?", "M. Troy Woods - Total System Services, Inc.", "I'll let \u2013 Pam is here with us and I'll let her address it.", "Pamela A. Joseph - Total System Services, Inc.", "Actually, we're very pleased with the management team at TransFirst. Part of the reorganization is temporary just so that I didn't have quite as many direct reports as John had reporting into him, and we will go back to his original line up once we bring a new individual on board to replace him. But I'm very, very pleased with the caliber of the people that we have. We also have strong management at TSYS as well in our merchant business and we have a combination right now of both groups and our management line up.", "David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC", "Thank you. I appreciate the additional thought process.", "M. Troy Woods - Total System Services, Inc.", "Thank you, David.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC", "Hey. Thanks, guys. So just a follow-up question on the EPS guidance for the year, I understand is unchanged, but it does imply like a $0.07 range for Q4 which just seems kind of wide. Any reason we didn't narrow the range just given one quarter left in the year?", "Paul Michael Todd - Total System Services, Inc.", "No, Jason. That's \u2013 we still have, obviously, several things that are playing through with the one thing, I think, I would kind of highlight to you was this significant currency impact that we had in the third quarter that we said we anticipate kind of similar levels of impact in the fourth quarter, and so that kind of indicates a little bit of the tightening that you not normally see between the third and the fourth quarters having that still sitting out there.", "Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. And can you just elaborate a little bit, I know you talked about some over-performance in the business that's enabling you to reiterate the range but without qualifying the lower-end, which is obviously encouraging, but can you just drill a little bit deeper into that that over-performance? Is that around mix or cost control, because obviously the revenue guidance is coming down a little bit per FX, but you're protecting the bottom line here.", "Paul Michael Todd - Total System Services, Inc.", "Yeah. So I'll start out, Jason, and then maybe Troy might want to add a comment or two. First of all, we are seeing this across all four segments, and so kind of from a sizing standpoint, the biggest impacts relative to our projections have been on our international side, which obviously from a revenue standpoint on a constant currency basis has provided us some upside, once again, on a constant currency basis.", "And then we've also seen a nice pick up on the merchant side and then, as I commented earlier, our NetSpend revenue growth has improved. So, kind of from a revenue standpoint and we already talked about North America being kind of at or just slightly better than what we had expected, the revenue of all four segments is either kind of at or slightly better. But I will say that, from a margin standpoint, not only did we have kind of our one-time cost takeout as it relates to the severance, but there's been downstream improvement as well on the margin that have kind of been ancillary to that, as we've been looking at the cost basis across all of our segments.", "And so we've kind of had kind of an additional lift across the segments that don't necessarily one-for-one tied to the severance, but we've gotten that benefit as we've been looking at everything from people cost to vendor cost, and as we look at kind of how we're delivering and getting the efficiencies in our business. So, those would be kind of the two things I'd point out. Troy, I don't know if you have anything else you want to add there.", "M. Troy Woods - Total System Services, Inc.", "No, I really don't, Paul. I think you've addressed them all. When we talk about the additional severance that Paul mentioned, certainly, has its benefits on the tail-end. We've been very aggressive in our expense management. You heard Paul talk about the CapEx management and the efficiency management. So, I think all of those play into the numbers that we produced in the third quarter and the confidence that I mentioned earlier about the fourth quarter and beyond to keep us back to our original \u2013 well \u2013 and I wouldn't say back, but keep our original guidance but no longer point to the low-end of that guidance.", "Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Glenn Greene from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Thanks. Good afternoon. Just a couple of clarifications. First on the NetSpend and CFPB, if I understood it, so it's $80 million to $85 million was sort of the revenue bogie and you're going to offset that with some new product revenue and it sounds like, just sort of reading between the lines, that maybe $35 million, $40 million of new product revenue over 2017, 2018 will sort of offset that. So I just want to make sure I'm thinking about that right. And the question related to that is, your confidence in and the visibility to get that new product revenue. And then I have another follow-up question.", "Paul Michael Todd - Total System Services, Inc.", "So, maybe I'll start with the first part, Troy, then you may want to add on as it relates to the confidence side. But, yeah, Glenn, you're approaching exactly right, is the $40 million is kind of the new product revenue as it relates to this. Troy, you want to talk about as it relates to our confidence?", "M. Troy Woods - Total System Services, Inc.", "Yeah, I'd be glad to, Glenn. Certainly, we've been contemplating some of this for some time and looking at these two new products. We've actually mentioned the small business product if not last quarter maybe two quarters ago. But, more importantly, we've been looking at, based on some customer demand and in some degrees our distribution partner desires to have a DDA product, been looking at it for some time. We've had these prepaid rules, the proposed rules in front of us for a while.", "So, we're looking at those, we've done a lot of modeling as you might expect. At the end of the day, there is no crystal ball, but we feel quite confident in our management team at NetSpend, the way they've looked at it, the way they've modeled it, that we feel reasonably confident of course, and Paul gave you some caveats that obviously we've got to get out there. We got to see what the adoption rates are. We've got to make sure we understand consumer behavior changes if there are any et cetera, et cetera.", "But if we didn't feel pretty confident, I don't think we'd be giving you these kind of high-level numbers to model with. But I think, as time goes on, we'll be able to put more clarity into it as well over the coming quarters as we move through 2017.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then a different question, somewhat unrelated, but this is really for Paul, and it's kind of the implied fourth quarter guide. I think the revenue works out to $774 million to $789 million or so. And then the parameters you gave for some of the segments, the North American growth of 5%, international kind of 5% constant currency, et cetera, it's difficult to get that low, so I guess what I'm asking is maybe you could sort of walk us through \u2013 I hate to get to this detail, but the segment growth expectations for the fourth quarter that sort of reconcile to that range. Directionally.", "Paul Michael Todd - Total System Services, Inc.", "Yeah, we don't give quarterly guidance by \u2013 we don't give quarterly guidance by the consolidated level and we certainly don't give it kind of at the segment level. I would make a couple of points. Obviously on the North America side to get to kind of the 5% number, you see a deceleration of growth between the third quarter and the fourth quarter, and we're at 2.4% reported and it declines on a sequential quarter basis down from that 2.4%, so that's kind of one test of the componentry that you might want to kind of start with.", "As I said earlier, if you back out those two items as it relates to prepaid, and the EMV piece, that 2.4% looks more like the revenue guidance range that Troy talked about. But as it relates to the fourth quarter, where those items are playing a significant impact, we do have sequential quarter deceleration.", "In the fourth quarter from international, as we said, we would have kind of commensurate expected level of currency on a reported basis to reflect the changes that we've seen in the pound primarily there.", "On the merchant side, there isn't anything I would necessarily call out that's dramatically different between kind of third and fourth quarter, but I did say in my prepared remarks a deceleration sequentially between the third quarter and the fourth quarter for NetSpend due to a variety of factors, but the one I called out was a lower level of increased spending as it relates to marketing. So using those as the kind of tonal guides at the segments, I do think that range that you get back to does kind of put us at the overall revised guidance revenue ranges that we provided on the call here today.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. That's actually very helpful. Thanks, Paul.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Davis from Stifel. Please go ahead.", "John Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Appreciate the color on the direct merchant growth. Maybe if we could drill down a little bit on TransFirst, we're still tracking to the $400 million or so of revenue that I think you outlined when the deal was done. Any kind of commentary there on growth versus your legacy direct business would be helpful.", "Paul Michael Todd - Total System Services, Inc.", "Yeah. So, I'll take it, John. Yeah, our growth on TransFirst is commensurate with what we expected \u2013 and it's very commensurate with what we saw in the second quarter. So, as I said I think earlier to one of the other questions, there is no change to the kind of revenue growth picture between where we were last quarter and where we are this quarter. And as I said also, TransFirst is meeting their profit expectations and our synergy target and the integration targets.", "John Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe on international business, is it fair to assume we probably have the similar headwind in the first and second quarter next year? I appreciate you're not giving 2017 guidance, but I just want to make sure, all else equal, I'm not missing anything there. And then also any impact from Brexit other than the obvious currency impact on the pound?", "M. Troy Woods - Total System Services, Inc.", "I'll take the second part of that, John, and Paul I think can address the financial side. As it relates to Brexit outside the financial impact of the pound and severance, as indicated last quarter, it is just a little bit early to tell. But with that said and talking to Gaylon and Kellie and our leadership team, it does create a lot of uncertainty. And as we've indicated on several occasions, uncertainty can usually mean good things for us, because it creates an opportunity for people to look to outsource, to cut cost, to find efficiencies in their operations. And so, as our team travels around Europe, particularly in that area, again, they're seeing opportunities. So, beyond the financial side of it, it's an uptick for us or a potential upside for us.", "Paul Michael Todd - Total System Services, Inc.", "Yeah. And as it relates to the other question as it relates to the headwind, yeah, we will see, for the first half of next year, this currency headwind. Obviously, with the Brexit vote occurring roughly mid-year, we're going to have a first half currency headwind pressure on the international business for the first half of next year compared to the first half of this year and that's assuming there isn't that much more that we're going to be dealing within the second half, assuming everything kind of holds. But, for sure, we'll be dealing with a first half currency headwind picture on international.", "John Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brett Huff from Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead.", "Blake Anderson - Stephens, Inc.", "Hey. This is Blake Anderson on for Brett today. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, you mentioned within regulations, you're a little disappointed with some of the new rules. How much higher is the $80 million to $85 million versus kind of your original expectations?", "Paul Michael Todd - Total System Services, Inc.", "Well, Blake, I wouldn't say we had a real disconnect there. All along, we knew exactly what our revenues were that have the potential of being negatively impacted by the proposed rules, primarily of course, around overdraft that we've talked about and some additional fees, IVRs (58:41) and those type of fees that we knew would go away if the proposed rules were adopted. So, there was no surprise they're in any shape, form or fashion.", "Blake Anderson - Stephens, Inc.", "Okay.", "Paul Michael Todd - Total System Services, Inc.", "Did that answer that question? I am not...", "Blake Anderson - Stephens, Inc.", "That's helpful.", "Paul Michael Todd - Total System Services, Inc.", "Okay.", "Blake Anderson - Stephens, Inc.", "That's helpful. Appreciate it. And then, you also mentioned accelerating some new product capabilities being important to your growth strategy in North America. Can you talk about what some of those might be and are any of those factored into the incremental about $20 million to $25 million per year in new product revenue expected in 2017 and 2018?", "M. Troy Woods - Total System Services, Inc.", "Well, Blake, I think you might be mixing a couple of things up. Let's see if we can clarify that. I did talk about, during the quarter, primarily focusing on our issuing business. We hired a new executive vice president to be more focused around product delivery and innovation. And that was primarily around the issuing business. I mentioned it during my North America comments and, if you recall, we talked about that on many occasions that we must continue to innovate and deliver new product for the entire company. But we're talking about specifically now about North America to grow new products. And no, we don't have any to talk about here today.", "The $20 million to $25 million you were making reference to, I'm not sure. We talked about $20 million to $25 million of lost revenue in 2017 around the impact of the prepaid rules and an additional $20 million to $25 million of lost revenue associated with those rules in 2018. So, I'm not sure where you got the $20 million to $25 million in new product.", "Blake Anderson - Stephens, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks for that clarification.", "M. Troy Woods - Total System Services, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Shawn Roberts for any closing remarks.", "Shawn Roberts - Total System Services, Inc.", "Thanks, Angie. We certainly hope you could see how much work and time and effort we've put into making a clearer picture and telling our story and helping you all better understand it. Certainly, we'll be around for the rest of the evening. If you want to give me a call, please do. And if not, we hope to see on the road sometime or talk with you on the phone.

[Operator Instructions] after today\u2019s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask a question. Please note this event is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Shawn Roberts, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Shawn Roberts", "Thank you Amy, and welcome everyone. We will begin this evening's call with opening comments by TSYS Chairman and CEO, Troy Woods, followed by TSYS CFO, Paul Todd reviewing the first quarter 2017 highlights and consolidated financials. Troy and Paul will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of this slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental schedules are available on our website at investors.tsys.com. After the prepared remarks, we'll open the call up for Q&A. I\u2019d like to remind those of you participating in the Q&A that each person will have the ability to ask one question and one follow-up before the operator places you back into the queue.", "I'll now call your attention to the fact that we will be making some forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS' actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in TSYS' reports filed with the SEC, including its 2015 annual report on Form 10-K. We will also discuss items that do not conform to GAAP. We reconcile those measures to GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation, and in the supplemental schedules to the press release.", "At this point, I'll turn it over to Troy Woods.", "Troy Woods", "Thank you Shawn, and good evening. We were very pleased with our overall performance for the first quarter and the momentum it provide us for the remainder of the year. Some of the highlights for the quarter that I would like to call out were net revenue of 24%, adjusted EBITDA increased 24.4%, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 25.4%, consolidated operating margin expanded 88 basis points and [indiscernible] was reduced by an additional $100 million. The strong financial performance was the result of an improving economy, a 16-year high consumer confidence index, the financial health of our customers and executing on our strategic plans. I want to congratulated and thank all our team members for their continued commitment and focus and for an outstanding first quarter. One final corporate call out before we move into specific results for our segments.", "In March, we were recognized by the Ethisphere Institute as a 2017 world's most ethical company. TSYS has been recognized five times in the last six years for this prestigious award. We are one of only seven companies in the financial services industry to receive this multi-year distinction. Underscoring that our commitment to ethics is unwavering.", "Now I\u2019d like to provide a few comments on each of our business segments. First on Issuer Solutions. This is the first quarter in which we are reporting consolidated financial results for both our North America and International Issuer segments in a new segment called Issuer Solutions. You will recall that over the past 15 to 18 months, we had already combined our technology, implementation and product groups for the North America and international segments. We do expect that this final organizational consolidation which took effect April 1 will bring us some additional advantages. Some highlight for Issuer Solutions for the quarter were, traditional accounts on file ended at 532 million, a new record. Transactions were up 6.3%. Over 10 million net new accounts were added for the quarter and we executed two renewals.", "On the new business development front, we expanded our presence in Central American with a new processing agreement with Scotia Bank. Although we are not in a position to share details at this time, we were very pleased with a few other new business opportunities coming our way from existing clients. Finally, one of the biggest initiatives in Issuer Solutions is to greatly expand our current value added product offering that we offer to our clients. Our product team is working diligently on innovative new products for fraud and risk management, data and analytics, and digital experiences. Our goal is to consistently deliver remarkable products and services to our customers which differentiate them in the market while making their businesses and financial results stronger.", "We will provide additional details and updates when our product progress at our Investor Day Conference next month. Now I\u2019d like turn our attention to merchant segment. It\u2019s been one year since the closing of the TransFirst acquisition. We remain very confident with our outlook for the segment as we continue to drive strong growth across our distribution channels particularly in our fastest growing integrated channel. We remain pleased at our integration and our synergy goals remain on track. Earlier this month, we completed a major milestone in our integration efforts as we seamlessly migrated approximately 280,000 TransFirst merchants to the [indiscernible] backend platform. Now essentially all of our merchants settle on one core front end and backend platform.", "During the quarter, we also completed the purchase of an additional 10% ownership of the Central Payment Joint Venture brining our ownership level of 85%. Central Payment continues to deliver strong double-digit growth to our direct business. And we are excited about our partnership in this joint venture. On the business development front, we recently signed a number of new banks as partners in our financial institutions channel; Flagstar Bank, Hawaii National Bank and three others will add an additional 171 branches to our financial distribution network. ", "The lead our merchant solution segment going forward, Philip McHugh will be joining TSYS next week as Senior Executive Vice President and President Of The Merchant Solutions segment. Philip has more than 20 years of experience in the payments and banking industry and was most recently serving as Chief Executive Officer of Barclaycard Business Solutions based in London. He is a visionary with outstanding leadership capabilities, who will be a very strong addition to our Senior Executive Leadership team.", "And finally I'd like to make a few comments about Netspend. As you know the Netspend team has been focused on preparation for the tax season, product diversification, new distribution, implementation and implementation of the new CFPB prepaid rules. As with each tax season we face new challenges. This year there were new tax rules, changes of tax repairers and an aggressive competitive environment. In spite of some of these headwinds we were able to generate record gross dollar volume at 9.6 billion and ended the quarter with a record 5.1 million debit active cards. Our prepaid product diversification plans are moving along on schedule. We have expanding the marketing of our small business prepaid product adding direct acquisition and online to our existing retail sales channel.", "We are also still on target to launch the demand deposit account [indiscernible] select group of existing customers this quarter. With respect to distribution, we renewed our agreement with Dollar General for an additional four years. Dollar General has announced the opening of 1,000 new stores in 2017 and we are very pleased to extend our relationship with a fast growing partner. Sometime ago, our largest distribution partner, Ace Cash Express decided a launch a demand deposit account program. We were very pleased to now have ACE under an exclusive agreement for both general purpose reloadable and demand deposit accounts until the first quarter 2020.", "As for the CFPB Prepaid Rule there has been one major development reported since our January earnings call. As you know, the CFPB issued [indiscernible] on March the 9, a proposal to delay the implementation of the prepaid rule by six months to April 1, 2018. This common period ended on April 5. Last Thursday, CFPB officially announced that the implementation dates for the prepaid rule would be delayed by six months to April 1, 2018. We are continuing to analyze all of the implication this six month delay will have on our business plans. However, with our first quarter performance and prepaid rule delay, we are increasing 2017 revenue and EPS guidance. Paul will provide additional details in his comments.", "Finally, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to mention a change with the TSYS board family. ON Thursday, we\u2019ll hold our annual shareholders meeting where we will recognize two founding members of TSYS board Jim Blanchard and Jimmy Yancey who are retiring. Jim and Jimmy have served on our board since TSYS became a public company in 1983. I know I can speak on behalf of the entire executive team as well as the board. When I say these two gentlemen are among are most royal supporters, astute advisers, and our greatest champions. We are indebted to both of them and deeply appreciate their leadership and steadfast forward.", "Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Paul Todd to provide our detailed financial information and outlook for the reminder to 2017. Paul?", "Paul Todd", "Thank you Troy and we are pleased with this quarter's performance and how we\u2019ve started the year. Turning to Slide 6, I will cover our consolidated and segment performance and our revised 2017 outlook. First quarter GAAP total revenues were 1.2 billion, up 60.2% and non-GAAP net revenues were 832.9 million, up 24% from 1Q last year. On a constant currency basis, consolidated net revenues were up 25.5%. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.57 for the quarter, an increase of 16.1% over 1Q of 2016. And non-GAAP quarterly adjusted diluted EPS was $0.82, an increase of 25.4% from last year.", "Our non-GAAP quarterly adjusted EBITDA increased 24.4% to 287.2 million and our adjusted EBITDA margin of 34.5% was slightly ahead of last year. We are now expecting adjusted EBITDA margin to increase approximately 75 basis points for the year, up from the previous 50 basis point expansion. Free cash flow increased 124.5% for the quarter, the fourth straight quarter of double-digit or better free cash flow growth. We now expect our free cash flow for 2017 to be in the 600 to 630 million, range up from the previous 580 to 610 million range.", "Now moving to the issuer segment, starting on Slide 8. First on growth, the segment grew net revenue 5.2% on a constant currency basis for the quarter. In fact, the segment reached a new record level of reported quarterly net revenue of 387.7 million. Also for comparative purposes we did have approximately 6 million of one-time fees in the first quarter of 2016 which if you exclude to look at a more normalized growth rate would move to 5.2% constant currency growth rate to approximately 6.8%. We also saw good growth in both volume and non-volume revenue for the segment on a constant currency basis.", "Next on margin, quarterly reported segment margin of 34.6% is down 116 basis points from last year's first quarter high watermark on margin. But on a constant currency basis, the decline reduces to approximately 75 basis points and reflects some favorable one-time items in the 1Q margin of 2016. Removing those favorable items in the 1Q 2016 margin to get to a more normalized comparative margin shows that we had margin expansion in the first quarter. Finally on outlook, while I mentioned on our last call that our previous North America and international segments were combined as of January 1 and would be reported as one segment. I did provide some commentary to help in modeling the new segment. I said that we expect the previous North America business to grow 1Q revenue in the 3% to 5% range due to some comparative items in 1Q \u201816 and performed in a tighter quarterly band in 2017 and 2016.", "If you look back at the Old North America business more standalone during this quarter, it did grow in the previously expected 3% to 5% growth rate range. We still expect net revenue for the issuer segment to grow in the 5% to 7% constant currency growth rate range for the year and the segment to expand margin by a 100 plus basis points in 2017. Before I leave the segment, I do want to call out the outstanding performance of our CUP Data JV since it is issuing related. While we do not include the financial performance of CUP Data in our segment results, our CUP Data JV continued its fantastic track record of growth and this quarter's impact from our CUP Data joint venture was exceptionally strong. The venture has expanded its market presence and processing capabilities in the Chinese card processing market and this quarter's results reflect a strong finish to 2016 and the new plateau of growth in 2017 from both core processing as well as value added products and services and all of this growth is derived entirely from organic growth. In all, we're pleased with the start of the year for our issuer segment and our CUP Data joint venture.", "Now on Slide 9, and our merchant segment. First on growth, net revenue grew 116% for the quarter and this is the last quarter before we lap the TransFirst acquisition. We grew our direct business organically in the 7% to 9% range for the quarter, driven in part by our integrated channel which grew in the strong double digits in the quarter and represents almost one-third of our direct business. Starting next quarter, we will have a more normalized organic growth look in our reported results for the segment as transfers will have fully lapped. We still expect the segment to grow net revenue organically in the 7% to 9% range all in line with what we mentioned on our last call.", "As previously mentioned, we are no longer reporting on a direct and indirect basis given the way we are now managing the combined businesses. I gave you some color in my remarks about the organic growth of our direct business which as you know is now over 80% of the segment\u2019s revenue. Merchant business drives a very predictable and recurring revenue stream and we could may not be more pleased with the revenue contribution mix we now have. We are now highlighting a revenue per transaction metric on this slide for this business. It is more consistent with pure metrics in the acquiring industry and reflects the step up that we saw with the TransFirst acquisition where we added the acquired revenue but didn't see a similar transactional step up given we processed TransFirst business on our front end systems before the acquisition. We will continue to report this metric as the key revenue volume metric on a go-forward basis.", "On margin, the margin story continues to be a strong one for the segment as we continue to see the benefits from our synergy and integration efforts. Segment margin was 35% for the quarter, up 323 basis points from last year. The 1Q comparison is important as you are able to compare the margin profile of our previous merchant segment with a similar period of our new merchant segment inclusive of transfers and the 35% or 323 basis point improvement clearly reflects the success of our integration efficiency efforts. Our margin expectations for the year are slightly higher than what we mentioned on the last call with expected margin expansion for 2017 to now be between 50 to 100 basis points higher than the 50 basis point expansion I mentioned on our last call.", "Now onto Netspend on Slide 10. First on growth, net revenue grew 6.7% on GDP growth of 4.9% and total debit active card grew 5.4%. During a challenging tax season, Netspend showed positive account growth for the quarter and finished Q1 with total debit active cards of over 5 million, a new record. We saw gross dollar volume growth rate softened some both sequentially and year-over-year, but we still expect GDP growth to be in the 6% to 8% growth rate range for the year. Next on margin, first quarter segment margin increased 182 basis points to 24.6% which was strong, primarily due to some personnel related savings in the first quarter. And finally on outlook for Netspend, the six month delay in the effective date of the CFPB rules on prepaid to April 1, 2018 positively impacts our 2017 revenue expectations for this business by approximately 20 million. Our revised expectation for 2017 net revenue growth for Netspend is in the 6% to 8% growth rate range for the year, up from the previous expectation of 3% to 5%.", "On the margin outlook, we expect the segment margin to be in the 21% to 23% range for the full year of 2017, up from the previous expectation of 19% to 21%. As I detailed on the last few calls, our expectations for this year and next during this transitionary period of Netspend are based on assumptions around many factors that could positively or negatively affect our performance. On an annualized basis, we continue to estimate the total revenues affected by the CFPB rule to be in the 80 to 85 million range with estimated EPS impact to be in the $0.19 to $0.21 range including compliance costs. As it relates to 2018, based on the business expansion strategies that Troy mentioned, our current analysis of the CFPB prepaid rules, the updated April 1, 2018 expected effective day and the customers and product features affected by the rules, we expect 2018 net revenues to be negatively impacted by approximately 30 to 40 million and 2018 EPS to be negatively impacted by $0.09 to $0.11.", "In other words, in 2018, we expect to offset between one-third to one-half of the negative revenue and EPS impact of the rules through our business expansion strategies. As we've discussed on prior calls, the success of our strategies depends on the rate of adoption of our new products both by consumers and our distribution partners, the rate of utilization of the various product features by cardholders, market regulatory dynamics and a host of other factors that will play out over time and our estimated impacted very positively or negatively based on these and other factors. We will comment more on these in our upcoming calls as we move closer to the 2018 April effective date.", "Now I want to comment on our revised guidance on Slide 12. We are increasing our total revenue and net revenue guidance by 20 million and revising our GAAP EPS range upward from the $2.14 to $2.21 range to a $2.25 to $2.32 or essentially $0.11 raise, $0.06 related to the CFPB delay and $0.05 related to Q1 over performance. We are also revising our adjusted diluted EPS from the $3.05 to $3.15 range to a $3.16 to $3.26 range representing a year-over-year growth rate range of 13 to 17% on adjusted diluted EPS growth. We still expect our effective tax rate to remain in the 33% to 34% range.", "Finally I want to wrap up with the three key points from today's call. First is performance, during the quarter, all three of our segments performed in line with the organic revenue growth rate ranges we provided on our last call. Second, our revised guidance reflecting additional revenue and EPS growth is value adding as we now expect to see 13 to 17% adjusted diluted EPS growth from 8 to 13% net revenue growth. This 500 basis point differential between revenue growth and adjusted diluted EPS growth is strong. And finally, our capital position continues to improve allowing for another 100 million to deleveraging during the quarter remaining ahead of schedule and we paid 70 million for an additional 10% ownership in our CPAY joint venture. We look forward to the completion of our deleveraging plan in 2017 and the resumption of stock buyback activity consistent with our previously communicated capital allocation principles. In all, we're very pleased with how we\u2019ve started the year and our first quarter performance positions us well for the rest of the year.", "And with that we will open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Darrin Peller at Barclays.", "Darrin Peller", "First on the issuer processing revenue acceleration, it's nice to see it reaccelerated to 5% from around 2.5% last quarter all-in. I guess extrapolating from what you said North America did in line with three to five, it obviously suggests international is doing pretty well to bring you up to the five plus range overall. So can you give us a little more color on the dynamics there. And then to talk about the whole segments acceleration, can you break it down for us in terms of how much of that is just the comps getting easier as you anniversary the roll off of some of the prepaid businesses as well as any other new business coming on, what's really happening behind in the moving parts.", "Paul Todd", "So Darrin, this is Paul, I\u2019ll start off and then Troy may want to add something, but as it relates to the composition, the business obviously we are managing it as one of business now and so kind of breaking it out because of the way we're handling some of our global customer relationships is not as comparative and as relevant as obviously it used to be. But if you looked at it and said, well yeah, if that international group of customers did perform very well we had really kind of across the board lift from that international group of customers. And like I said in my prepared remarks, we saw it both on the volume based products, but we also saw it on the non-volume side, particularly around value added products, we saw good growth there. Constant currency close to 9% kind of growth on value added products side. I\u2019d say the pressure if there was some was on the output and managed services side and we're going to continue to kind of play through that. But I think the good news was we got good growth across the board in the segment. You could see our transactional growth was very strong, the account on file growth was strong. And so I think just kind of across the board from both the customer perspective and a volume perspective, we were strangely pleased. I think as it relates to customers, Troy talked about in his remarks we are I think seeing a stronger kind of pipeline in general, but it's kind of early to talk about it related to that.", "Darrin Peller", "And just my follow-up, there were definitely some questions we were getting into the print around the Netspend business, timing on tax refunds, you came in pretty strong I guess relative to [indiscernible] were on that segment. I know it's decelerated from what it was before. Can you just revisit that segment again for us in the sense of, number one, was it at all better than you expected or was it in line. And then in terms of the trends you're seeing, it used to be a double-digit grower, just touch on that again. I mean this is a high-single digit or a mid-to-high single digit growth business now, if you back out and put aside the CFPB topic, where that business can go from here and otherwise, I appreciate it guys. Thanks.", "Troy Woods", "I\u2019ll take the front end of that question and maybe Paul can pick up on the backend. I think when you think about Netspend and you asked about expectations really for the quarter or going into the quarter, I don't think there's any doubt that the challenging tax season gave us a curveball. We did not produce the kind of GDP and tax that we had expected and modeled. But the good news is the rest of our non-tax GDP volume made up for it. So when you step back and look at the expectation of the GDP volume for the first quarter, I think $9.6 billion, was exactly what we had expected for the quarter. So a little bit of down on one and up on the other from a volume standpoint. I think it\u2019s related to the future growth and some of the reasons why we brought that revenue range down in our last call to address that.", "Paul Todd", "Yeah Darrin, and I think a lot of it's consistent with what I mentioned on the last call as it relates to the revenue growth of Netspend on a go-forward basis. Clearly when you look at our history and you looked at that surge of those partnerships that we announced, we kind of fully lapped the benefit from those and so that's kind of one factor. The second factor that we have it plays is just kind of an overall slowing market of the prepaid market which I commented on in the last call as well. And I think the final thing as it relates to future growth is, if you look at the industry growth kind of estimates that are out there, I\u2019ll call it you 5% plus, Netspend has a track record of growing this business faster than the industry growth rate. And so, I think those would be kind of my comment of choice exactly right. We did have some tax pressure here in this first quarter, but I think you can see that overall for the year with us being in the 6% to 8% range and we're very pleased with that.", "Operator", "The next question is from Timothy Willi at Wells Fargo.", "Timothy Willi ", "I got a couple of questions, one, [indiscernible]. Could you talk a bit about any kind of this color around the small business product, I think you have obviously seen that a [indiscernible] banks et cetera offering small business credit cards [indiscernible] that can be used by the business owners, who are trying to understand what the value cost might be to better understand the opportunity.", "Troy Woods", "Yeah Tim, I\u2019ll certainly take that. I think there are a couple of things, we talked about them I think on several occasions. One, I think Chuck is -- Chuck going all the way back maybe to our Investor Day last year, looking at our Netspend profile of customers, they found a lot of their customers were utilizing the Netspend GPR account for their macro and small business needs. A lot of our surveys indicating that people won\u2019t have the ability to separate their business and their personal expense. And as Netspend always does, they do it a lot of polishing and a lot of market search and found that this make a lot of sense. And so we think about product, I think we mentioned maybe last quarter or quarter before last, you\u2019ve got a natural distribution channel, we are using 7/11 select office depot stores. Now we rolled at our home line and of course this last quarter, we rolled in their direct channel. So when you think about offering a check, offering sub accounts, offering merchant funded discount programs, using a dongle which many of these small, micro merchants would use for their telephones, and to mention a 130,000 places that you load cash. We think it\u2019s going to be a big opportunity for Netspend.", "Timothy Willi", "My follow-up around part issuing, I apologize if you mentioned it during your discussion, popped on a bit late. But just around commercial card and I know you guys are a big player with commercial cards and supporting the apps seems like a lot of focus and rightly so, is been around the consumer but sort of any update what you see around growth around commercial, there's a lot of focus from the networks on commercial payments and just how that business looks to you and maybe even anything going on within merchants around B2B payment facilitation which also seems to be getting more attention.", "Troy Woods", "Tim, not really on commercial card as you will know, we dominated market share in that space 80% market share. The transaction growth is frankly healthy. We did convert another 1.5 million accounts during the quarter for one of the largest commercial card players in the business, who is going to consolidation of all the player. Commercial card business and we had quite a bit out of it. But we bought in that 8.5 from another third party processor. So nothing really to add to that on the commercial part. I think you asked at the end B2B?", "Timothy Willi", "Yeah B2B within the merchant business, where we are starting to also hear people talk about trying to build out capabilities. I think Vantiv announced, after the market closed acquiring a company called Paymetric which I think is in the B2B ecosystem.", "Pam Joseph", "I would actually say that Tim that we actually picked up through TransFirst a group, a telesales group that specifically focuses on vendors in the B2B space so that they actually sign up vendors on behalf of our commercial and corporate card customers. So we are - we do have a group now that we bought through acquisition that manages and we will start to work with them to determine what additional feature function we can sell through to that vendor side of the equation.", "Operator", "The next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar at Citi.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "So my question is, you talked about the impact of Netspend the push out from CFPB on 2018 EPS, $0.09 to $0.11 affected, but you seem to be bringing up 2017 by $0.06. Did I hear you right first of all and then the related question is what's the impact of renewing ACE to an expanded contract and any color on demand deposit pricing, I thought those factors affecting your Netspend comments.", "Paul Todd", "Sure Ashwin, so you did hear right that the $0.06 raise for 2017 is the pushing out and the delay of the timing around the rule and so that is exactly the case. What was the second part of your question Ashwin.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Well, I was trying to compare that to the $0.09 to $0.11 which I heard on 2018 I think has an impact and trying to relate the whole thing to all of the other initiatives and contract signings that you have going on?", "Troy Woods", "Oh, yeah. On the ACE renewal. Yeah. That\u2019s right. Yeah. Sure. So the ACE renewal actually we talked about that in the last call and so that was factored in our guidance from our last call. So there's no new economics that we're talking about as it relates to any renewal in this context related to that. The numbers that we're giving you here are strictly just related to the delay of the CFPB prepaid rule.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Got it. So though I thought because last time, mean when you talked about ACE, you'd not talked about, I don't think including the demand deposit unless I\u2019m mistaken. It seemed like an expanded contract to me. But the second question \u2013 ", "Troy Woods", "It is an expanded contract, Ashwin. I\u2019m sorry. But I didn\u2019t make it clear in my prepared remarks. What we said last quarter that we were in negotiations with one of our largest distribution partners around moving into the channel of demand deposit accounts. What I reported earlier was obviously that large distribution partner was ACE Cash Express and we have now signed that exclusive agreement that now gives us exclusivity for not only GPR products of ACE Cash Express, but for the new DDA product that they plan to rollout this year. Does that help?", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Yeah. Perfect. Congratulations on that. And then the second question is with regards to, another quarter very good on the equity income from JVs, you seem to be doing quite well with the China opportunity. Is that a way to predict sort of what the outcome from that? I mean you've had very good growth there for a few quarters now. Should we be concerned about lapping of that or I mean, how do you look at that opportunity obviously doesn't affect the segments, but it does affect your bottom line quite well.", "Troy Woods", "Sure, Ashwin. I\u2019ll take that. As it relates to that line, which is predominately the joint venture, I commented in my prepared remarks that we are extremely pleased with the growth that we're seeing there for a variety of different factors. There's economic factors in China, the cash to card conversion that's going on, but specifically the strong account growth that the business is seeing and their more recent success around these value added products and so it\u2019s kind of all those factors that are kind of lifting this as I said in my remarks to kind of this new level of growth. ", "I think clearly this quarter, there is some more timing related things, but I would say this, for that line, if you're kind of looking at it for the full year basis, we would be seeing that increase being in kind of the 40% to 50% range for that line. Now, and it's always been kind of an increase if you look back over the last couple of years at a strong double digit kind of increase, but we would be looking at that kind of range increase for that line this year based on what we see.", "Operator", "The next question is from George Mihalos at Cowen.", "George Mihalos", "Great. Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. Troy, I wanted to go back to your commentary early in the call related to the issuer solutions business and I think you said something in the effect of, you see some opportunities coming from existing clients in the near future and I'm wondering is that a function of better card issuing trends at those clients or are you winning new portfolios that you didn't have before, for example, debit accounts or private label accounts or something like that?", "Troy Woods", "George, it is clearly [indiscernible] as I mentioned, our current customers are growing. They are very healthy. The credit card continues to be a wonderful asset within the bank. I think I mentioned that our customers added over 10 million net new accounts last quarter, which I believe is the third straight quarter of over 10 million accounts per quarter. But my prepared comments were more around opportunities, portfolios, and have a opportunity to be converted to these.", "George Mihalos", "Okay. Thank you. And then just as a quick follow up, as it relates to the Netspend business and obviously it\u2019s sort of a fluid situation with whatever happens with the CFPB overdraft rule, but if we were to assume that that rule does not come to fruition, would that at all change your plans or your strategy around launching other products like a DD&A account and do you think some of your large customers would be less inclined to want that kind of a product if the status quo remains. Thank you.", "Troy Woods", "Thank you, George. Two questions in there. One, you talked about if the overdraft rule came to fruition, when we will get it? George, the CFPB delay of six months in prepaid rule. They did indicate that they were taking two things under additional review around credit cards and so they had resolution issues around non-registered accounts, but other than that, the prepaid rule is scheduled to be implemented in April of 2018, which as you know, doesn\u2019t eliminate the ability to have overdraft on a GPR card. ", "But as we\u2019ve indicated in the past, it is so onerous that we will not do so. Aside of these, just if it doesn\u2019t happen or how would we look at DD&A. No, I think we\u2019ve been very consistent that we are rolling out a DDA\u2019s demand deposit account, we\u2019re rolling it out to ACE as we\u2019ve indicated, and we\u2019re also rolling it out to a few other of our customers this year. Our customer want it, our competitors have it in the marketplace. This is a product that they want and need and so we are going to accommodate that need.", "Operator", "The next question is from Dave Koning at Baird.", "Dave Koning", "Yeah. Hey, guys. Thank you. And I guess a couple of questions. My first one is just a simple math question. Historically, Q1 has been kind of the low EPS quarter. This quarter, it was $0.82. If we just annualize that, it's 328 and I realize a little tax and equity earnings and stuff, but it seems like if we -- I don't know, I just look at that and say 328 seems like, if we just flat line that the rest of the year, maybe you can talk all through how the year looks, each of the quarters.", "Paul Todd", "Sure, Dave. You are right to point out both the tax pickup as well as the equity and earnings pickup that\u2019s outsized for this quarter relative to what we would see in the remaining quarters, specifically related to those two items. And so that\u2019s the biggest kind of thing that\u2019s playing with that quarter -- or annualizing the quarter we math, like you point out. And so we don't give quarterly guidance as it relates to EPS, but those are the two biggest items that I would point to as to why that you can\u2019t multiply the first quarter and get to the annualized number.", "Dave Koning", "Okay. Is there any seasonality though just, do you expect certain, like one quarter to be the low biomarker or anything like that.", "Paul Todd", "No, I wouldn\u2019t expect any kind of dramatic kind of changes that I would speak to on kind of a quarter-to-quarter basis as we typically don\u2019t have that kind of dramatic kind of movement. So there wouldn\u2019t be anything specifically, I\u2019ll call out, related to the high seasonality.", "Operator", "The next question is from James Friedman at Susquehanna.", "James Friedman", "Hi. I want to start with a housekeeping question. Paul, you called out the 6 million from the Q1 of \u201816. Could I just ask it to remind us what that was as you grow over that compare?", "Paul Todd", "Sure. We had two, I\u2019d call, kind of one-time related fee that we got from two customers that were truly kind of unique one-time related items. And so that's what I call. Number two, two pieces of revenue there that I was referring to.", "James Friedman", "Okay. And then as my follow-up, so both Troy and Pam discussed some of the trends in value added services. I know you discussed that more in the 10-Q, but I don't see that that's out yet. I guess we can wait, could you quantify that or at least qualitatively describe how significant was value added service this quarter. Is it accelerating again, any orientation with value-added service would be helpful? Thank you.", "Paul Todd", "Sure, James. I think I commented on it maybe in one of my earlier responses that we are basically on a reported basis that value added, the way we reported externally in the Qs of 5%, by 0.1% on a constant currency basis that looks more like 9%. So to kind of answer the question, yeah, the growth on that value add and line that we report externally is very strong, both reported and constant currency.", "Operator", "The next question is from Brett Huff at Stephens Inc.", "Brett Huff", "Good evening, Troy, Paul and Pam. Thanks for taking the question. In your guidance last year or last quarter when you gave it to us initially, you had talked about accommodating a couple of meaningful renewals, one domestic one in the 4Q. And then I think you also mention one, but maybe not as much detailed maybe an international renewal in the issuing business. Are those still expected sort of as you were thinking before, can you give us any additional thoughts on those in particular some of the questions we've got, it sounds like there might be some more aggressive pricing from some competitors in the domestic issuing business. Does that impact how you think about that 4Q renewal and then any info on the international would be great.", "Troy Woods", "Thank you, Brett. So really not anything to add on what we said before, we do that currently forward a lot of time, [indiscernible] 2017. All of those are scattered in different parts of the year, all of that is baked into our guidance. As it relates to competitive pricing, yes, it\u2019s competitive out there. There is absolutely no doubt about it. Sometimes, you see rational but I don\u2019t really see that as a lot different the way it spends the year. So I think we know how to play with that and deal with that and we will deal with it.", "Brett Huff", "Great. Thanks. And my follow-up is on the buyback, I think Paul you mentioned at the end of your comments that you're still looking to kind of wrap up some of the de-leveraging the end of this year. I think you left the door open the last time on the last call and maybe that could happen, the buybacks could start accelerating maybe at the end of this year versus the beginning of next, given the strong free cash flow and the additional de-leveraging that you mention, any sort of further thoughts m that's a question we get a lot from folks in the market.", "Paul Todd", "Sure, Brett. Yeah. If you kind of look at the range of where I was on the free cash flow of 600 to 630 and you take out basically the 400 million of de-leveraging that we\u2019ve already committed to in calendar year 2017 and to take out that additional 70 million that I talked about from the additional purchase of the 10% of -- since repayments joint venture, then yes, I mean it does lend itself to us being end into stock buyback, both within the calendar year. With that being said, as I talked about earlier, we have laid out previously those capital allocation principles and we're excited to be able to be in a position before the end of the calendar year to start back in executing against those capital allocation principles clearly in 2018.", "Troy Woods", "Brett, the only thing I would really add to that in some of the reports that have come out have thrown numbers out like 200 plus million dollars of free cash flow that might be available towards the end of the year. And I think if you just play the math out, and I know Paul has been through before about debt reduction and dividends, I don\u2019t think you come up with a number like that. So, I wouldn\u2019t want anybody\u2019s expectations to see that kind of zone in the neighborhood.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Paulo Ribeiro of BMO Capital Markets.", "Paulo Ribeiro", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I want to talk a little about the merchant solutions and your revised guidance for margins. Given that we saw also this quarter that you outperformed on expenses, can you talk a little more about the transfers, cost synergies and if you\u2019re saying you kind of -- how is it versus your expectations, it seems to be ahead of what you expected and to stick to the merchant segment, can we talk a little about the competitive landscape in that space? Thanks.", "Paul Todd", "Well, I\u2019ll start it and then maybe I\u2019ll turn it over to Pam or Troy on the competitive landscape, but certainly from a merchant margin standpoint, as I said in my prepared remarks, the 300 basis points of margin expansion we saw, it\u2019s the first quarter you get to see the exact kind of comparative old business of TSYS with the new merchant segment inclusive of transfers and the effect of what those synergies are having on the margin line on a comparative quarter basis. ", "So that 300 basis points, if you just kind of looked at it, you could kind of do the math to say, what has been that effect as well as growth in the business as well. We are ahead of our synergy attainment as evidenced by that simple math, but even on top of that, we're expecting to see, as I said, kind of improving margin picture from what I said on the last call, where I said, roughly 50 basis points, I\u2019m pointing north of that to the 50 to 100 basis point expansion for this year. So we continue to get success along the synergy achievement lines.", "And then I\u2019ll turn it over to Pam or Troy as it relates to the merchant competitive dynamics.", "Pam Joseph", "Yeah. I would just basically say, we had a very good first quarter. As Troy pointed out in his opening remarks, we added six new banks. We actually signed up five renewals that we were looking to complete. The IC channel is competitive, however, we were able to sign some new ISPs to our fastest growing channel and we've had good success there. And so I think in general, we feel like we have a very good offering in the marketplace and we have very strong sales forces right now on the street and so I feel like we're holding our own in what has been a very competitive market.", "Paulo Ribeiro", "Great. A quick follow-up on FX. If you could from this point of view tell us versus when we last talked in the earnings call, what do you think FX would be?", "Paul Todd", "Yes. So from a Forex standpoint, we, as I said on the last call, we expect kind of the second quarter to kind of roughly mirror what we see from a headwind standpoint in the first quarter and then that to abate down in the remaining two quarters. And so our FX expectations now are just almost exactly kind of where they were at the last call.", "Operator", "The next question is from Bryan Keane at Deutsche Bank.", "Bryan Keane", "Hi. Just to get about the upside for the guidance, the $0.11, so $0.06 of it is obviously the push of CFPB, the other $0.05, just thinking about that, how much was the equity in affiliates line versus the tax rate lower plus the margin, the bigger margin expansion, just trying to see if I could break those components out.", "Paul Todd", "Sure, Bryan. If you kind of looked at it at, I think you kind of point to, call it, over performance all-in CUP of about $0.04 of that $0.05 along with some margin expansion and roughly about a penny on the tax side. So if you were trying to reconcile, that would be kind of about the way you try to want to break that down.", "And I would just add with that, the reason on the tax line, you have to also, because it\u2019s not on the equity and income line for CUP, we do have to pick up some additional tax on our tax line, reflective of that CUP piece or you can\u2019t just look at the tax line and the CUP line being -- there\u2019s some inter-dependency there. So that\u2019s, I would add that comment to that.", "Bryan Keane", "Okay. And then just on CUP, what are the equity and affiliate line going forward, does it then step down and then just finally I was thinking about the CFPB pushout, I remember last call, you talked about an $80 million to $85 million impact expected loss. That sounded the same although the net loss of 30 million to 40 million was different than the 20 million to 25 million from last time. So I'm just trying to figure out that nuances that created that a little bit bigger loss, net loss as you can expect for 2018 pushout. Thanks.", "Paul Todd", "So, let me maybe ask -- I'll answer that first one, I mean the last question first and then Bryan if you can kind of go back to that first question. But on the CFPB piece, essentially you\u2019re right, the 80 to 85 is still intact kind of with that on a calendar year basis, that\u2019s still the right range there. The difference there, I think we\u2019re thinking of before is there is a quarter impact in 2018 of kind of the original rule still being at play. And so that\u2019s what\u2019s changing I think that net change number that you\u2019re referencing is, is we\u2019re picking up a quarter in 2018 of the rules where we didn\u2019t have that quarter in the prior commentary around that on the CFPB side. And maybe go back to the first question, the first part of your question.", "Bryan Keane", "Just thinking about that equity and affiliate line going forward, because it spiked, so I wanted \u2013", "Paul Todd", "Bryan, I\u2019m sorry and I referenced that earlier. If you\u2019re looking at that from a full year basis, that line would increase in the 40% to 50% range roughly. So yeah, we did have a first quarter spike which we kind of always do because of the timing related to that, but that would be the range should to be looking at on a full year basis would be in that 40% to 50% increase range.", "Operator", "The next question is from Steven Kwok at KBW.", "Steven Kwok", "Hey. Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. Just when we think about the CFPB rule, given the delay, does that impact your view any of the chances from the rule being repealed?", "Troy Woods", "Steven, just wanted to handicap that, because just I think you know [indiscernible] using the CRA to eliminate the CFPB prepaid rules. I really don\u2019t know how to handicap it. Congress came back in the town yesterday, we\u2019ll see where it goes. They have until May the 9 to act on it if they are going to act on it. So I think we\u2019ll just have to all wait and see.", "Steven Kwok", "Got it. And then just following up around the capital management, are there any other uses of capital aside from share repurchases. Does any tuck-in acquisitions potentially make sense?", "Troy Woods", "Well, maybe, it should on many acquisition, Steven. We do look at tuck-in acquisition. We talked about them in the past, we talked about not only an issuer, but a merchant and even to expand. So really all three of our segments, we have been somewhat constrained as you all know for the past roughly a year as we focused on de-leveraging the balance sheet, but it\u2019s absolutely still on the table that is an opportunity for M&A product tuck ins, expansion tuck ins, yes, we still look at those.", "Operator", "The next question is from Nick Cremo at Evercore ISI.", "David Togut", "Thanks. Hi. It\u2019s David Togut with Evercore ISI. I'm curious Troy and Pam just for some insight behind what strategic changes you think Philip McHugh might make as he takes over as CEO the merchant business?", "Troy Woods", "Well, as I indicated, he hadn\u2019t started yet. So we are really excited about and I\u2019ll let Pam to add to that. We\u2019ve obviously been respectful of Philip. He does start May the 1. He will be in town tomorrow and Thursday with us. So we\u2019re expecting a lot of great things from him, because as I indicated in my prepared remarks and Pam you might want to add to that.", "Pam Joseph", "Yeah. First of all, I\u2019m thrilled to have him join the company. And actually hand off my part time job here. So it would be great to have him on board. He is really a visionary and really focused on product strategy. So I really expect -- we really have some opportunity to enhance our product line to our customers. ", "I also view him as somebody that will be looking out into the marketplace at tuck-ins and possible acquisitions, mainly around kind of technical solutions and things that we can actually package up and resell out to our customer base. So again, I think that he brings the kind of background that right now at this time we need in this business. Again as I mentioned, we have a very strong sales team. They are looking for more products to sell and to offer in the marketplace and I think that for Philip will excel.", "Troy Woods", "David, I might just add that we\u2019re putting him on a slot. Real soon, he\u2019s going to be in new York for Investor Day, May 24. So you will get to hear his philosophy and his strategic thinking around the segment.", "David Togut", "I look forward to meeting him. Just as the follow up, Pam, I'm just curious now, as you have time -- as you hand off your responsibilities in the merchant business, what are your priorities going forward?", "Pam Joseph", "Again, you\u2019ll hear about some of that in May at Investor Day, but I'm really excited about the opportunity that we have ahead of us and issuing products and some other actual progress that we're making there right now. So I feel good about that. We have work to do still on merchant as I just mentioned and frankly I'm very excited about the opportunity in that spend around product as well with some of the new opportunities that we're pushing out into the marketplace. ", "So I would say focus still around across the board on product and then continue to make sure that on the merchant business, we continue to expand on synergies and some of our other opportunities. One of our final initiatives, as you know is as we bring these businesses together, the issuing business as we do have a little bit of work there to make sure that we get everything aligned exactly the way we wanted with the marketplace.", "Operator", "The next question is from Vasundhara Govil at Morgan Stanley.", "Vasundhara Govil", "Okay. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Most of my questions have been answered, but I just had one quick question on that fund. I think you mentioned earlier that you saw an outperformance on the non-tax business and an under performance on the tax related business during the quarter. And I just wanted to understand the shortfall on the tax business. Is that mostly a shift in timing or is there more permanent loss in revenues this year, because if it's only a timing thing, then I guess we should expect better performance in the back half because we were seeing an outperformance on the non-tax business.", "Troy Woods", "You are correct. I did indicate that the tax volume expectations for the first quarter were much lower than we had modeled and anticipated. And the non-tax volume exceeded our expectations and so the $9.6 million of GDP for the quarter was literally right on target when you take the consensus in the negative. As it relates to the timing of last quarter, we really ran into that quarter not really knowing because of the February 15 filing day for certain early tax dollars. And we indicated that we really wouldn\u2019t know anything until toward the end of the first quarter. ", "And even though, tax refunds were now 50% for February, obviously when I opened up, they rebounded, and they were down I don\u2019t know 2% or 3% the last number of years. I think looking at the numbers that we see up through this week, I do not think all of that tax volume that we missed in the first quarter is related to time. And we\u2019re not changing anyway the guidance, the numbers in GDP that Paul gave you earlier. But I do not think that particular tax volume is going to come back this month or next month. So not all of it for sure.", "Operator", "The next question is from Ramsey El-Assal at Jefferies.", "Ramsey El-Assal", "Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask you for a little more commentary on the net spend margin improvement, particularly whether it's a kind of a permanent step-up in margins or whether there was some changes that you indicated I think really to personnel that might have caused a sort of a one-time pop.", "Paul Todd", "Yeah. Ramsey, this is Paul. Yeah, it's more one-time in nature of the pickup that we saw there and that's why I called it out, but we're expecting a much more kind of consistent picture in that range I mentioned before, that 21% to 23% for the year.", "Ramsey El-Assal", "Okay. And then my follow-up, on the demand deposit product that you're developing, is this new capabilities you're needing to build out or is this kind of a repackaging of your existing prepaid product, in other words, what differentiates this from the core reloadable products that you\u2019re fielding.", "Troy Woods", "Well, no Ramsey. It is significant build out and our product team and engineering team have been working on this now for quite some time and in other words, really just adding, obviously product and features to the GPR product. It\u2019s got some very robust savings features. As you recall, it will have opt-in overdraft protection. We are going to have excess [indiscernible] that you will have the ability to write a check on this DDA product. They\u2019re unique type personalized checks. We\u2019ve got a benefit center that the Netspend team is fed up to handle this particular product group. So there are quite a bit of different attributes to the DDA product versus the GPR product.", "Ramsey El-Assal", "The core earnings ore revenue stream off of the product will still be similar to your existing products, just with a lot of other?", "Paul Todd", "What I think we\u2019ve talked about before Ramsey is the revenue and profitability dynamics of DDA are less than the GPR. You have things like lower interchange, free ATM usage, checks, benefit center that I mentioned. And those type things certainly drive the margin down as it relates to a GPR car.", "Operator", "The next question is from John Davis at Stifel.", "John Davis", "Hey, good afternoon, guys. Maybe just want to touch on the consolidated margins for a second. Paul, I think you said guidance is now for up 75 from up 50 previously, but if I just take the 200 basis points from Netspend, that incremental upside because of the CFPB and by my math, that's 30 thirty basis points plus you increased guidance for margin in the merchant segment from 50 to 100. So maybe just trying to square those numbers as the outlook in issuer is still the same and because by my math, it seems a little bit conservative. Your comments would be helpful. Thanks.", "Paul Todd", "Yes. So as it relates to where we were, yeah, I mean I think the -- I would say this that the primary increase is related to the Netspend ad as it relates to margins. We\u2019ve got lot of moving parts around the business, around investments, and some things we\u2019re doing throughout the segment. But clearly, we are seeing a better merchant margin picture and I think I commented even on the last call, there was some potential upside there on the merchant side to be north of that 50 basis point range as we\u2019ve got some more clarity as we\u2019ve seen a quarter here, that has come to fruition. But as it relates to this kind of last move here, it would be more closely tied to the Netspend margin ad than anything else.", "Operator", "The next question is from James Schneider of Goldman Sachs.", "James Schneider", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Troy, I was wondering if you can maybe comment on the kind of build on the previous comments around the regulatory environment, more broadly speaking, if you look, there's been a number of build news in Congress, including the Choice Act, which would roll back the Durbin memo among other things, can we talk about you know if the Choice Act were passed, what the impact would be on the broader business holistically.", "Troy Woods", "Yeah, Jim. Obviously, I think that's going to get some attention perhaps this week with Hensarling and some of his committees on the Choice Act. He\u2019s got a lot of moving parts to it around Durbin and some of the other teams. I think we\u2019ll just have to wait and see. We really haven't come out and say any real official comments around Durbin. But I think there are many other things out there as well, Jim that we are I think, you asked other regulatory things. ", "We hear a lot of rhetoric coming out of Washington about less regulations or deregulations, no one to be happier to hear that than the management of this company, but I think we all just have to wait and see. We pay a lot of attention of course to the CFPB and the CRA. We watch creating interchange changing and make sure it\u2019s left alone. The arbitration rule of the CFPB, so we keep our eye on a lot of things out there and I think the most important thing we\u2019re focusing on at the moment is the CFPB rule. It has an absolute date of May 9 and it even happens or it doesn\u2019t. So that\u2019s our focus at the moment.", "James Schneider", "Helpful color. Thanks. And then just one quick clarification on the previous commentary you made Paul on the kind of the underrun of the personnel expenses. Did any portion of that personnel expense savings kind of extend into the Q2 and Q3, Q4 for this year? Just to try and get a sense of whether any of those synergies are sustained?", "Paul Todd", "Jim, no. They would not extend in to the following quarters. They were specific to Q1.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Shawn Roberts for closing remarks.", "Shawn Roberts", "Thank you, Amy and again, just as we always tell you, we appreciate your interest, your support and I\u2019ll be around tonight if anybody wants to call. Thank you. Have a good evening.", "Operator", "The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Shawn Roberts, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Shawn Roberts", "Thank you, Amy, and welcome, everyone. We will begin this evening\u2019s call with opening comments from TSYS Chairman and CEO, Troy Woods, followed by TSYS CFO, Paul Todd reviewing the second quarter 2017 highlights and consolidated financials. Troy and Paul will both be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of this slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental schedules are available on our website at investors.tsys.com.", "After their prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open the call up for Q&A. And I\u2019d like to remind those that are participating in the Q&A that each person will have the chance to ask two questions before the operator places you back into the queue.", "I\u2019ll now call your attention to the fact that we will be making forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS\u2019 actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in TSYS\u2019 reports filed with the SEC, including its 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. We will also discuss items that do not conform to GAAP. We reconcile those measures to GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation, and in the supplemental schedules to the press release.", "At this point, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Troy Woods.", "Troy Woods", "Thank you, Shawn. Good evening and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. We were very pleased with the results for the second quarter, as we delivered another solid performance across all of our segments. Some of the consolidated highlights for the quarter that I would like to call out are: net revenue was up 6.2%, adjusted diluted EPS increased 16.4%, and consolidated operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 30.7%. These results are all organic, as we have now anniversaried the TransFirst acquisition and reflect execution of our strategic goals.", "Also, during the quarter, TSYS was recognized and honored by several organizations. Forbes recognized TSYS as one of the 25 fastest growing tech companies in the United States and as one of America\u2019s best large employers. In May, we were honored to be excluded in the Military Times EDGE 2017 Best for Vets Employers list that recognizes companies that go above and beyond the call of duty for their military and veteran employees. And in June, we were recognized as one of America\u2019s most community minded companies by the Civic 50, an initiative that identifies companies for their commitment to improving the quality of life in the communities where they do business.", "This is the 4th consecutive year that we have been honored with this award. We\u2019re very proud of these honors, as it is recognition of the dedication, commitment and hard work of our 11,500 team members.", "Now, I would like to make a few comments on several key initiatives across the enterprise and our segments. First, on Issuer Solutions. Traditional accounts on file ended the quarter at $542 million, an increase of 8.2%. This set an all-time high for traditional accounts on file.", "For the fifth straight quarter, our customers added approximately 10 million new traditional accounts on file, and total transactions for the quarter were up 7.1%. Our new business pipeline continues to be solid. As I mentioned last quarter, we have several new business opportunities we are working on with our existing clients.", "During the quarter, we executed several contract extensions, including Walmart Canada, Tesco Bank and Degussa Bank in Germany. We also continue to expand our processing capabilities by signing two new customers in the Philippines and one new customer in Finland. And finally, our company\u2019s joint venture in China continues to reform as expected.", "The joint venture is continuing to diversify as product offering and giving broad-based propositions to their 100 plus highest customer base. We are very pleased with performance of the new combined Issuer Solutions segment and the progress of our integration efforts.", "Now, I would like to address our Merchant Solutions segment. This is the first reported quarter, where we have the transfers acquisition. It is also the first-half we have exceed $100 million and Merchant segment operating income in new milestone. Our integration efforts of synergy goals remain on track. This is reflected in a 220 basis points improvement an operating margin over the second quarter of 2016.", "We\u2019re also confident with our top output. As we continue to address strong growth across our distribution channels, particularly our fast-growing integrated business, which now makes up approximately 30% of our direct merchant revenue business. Over the past few weeks, there have been some questions around our exposure to big box retailers.", "As you know, our primary focus is on the SMB segment of the business. In fact, we have less than a handful of retail merchants that do over $1 billion in annual sales volume and they contribute less than 1% of our Total Merchant segment revenue.", "On the business development front, we signed a bank in the Pacific Northwest with 190 branches added to our financial institutions channel. Coupled with our financial institutions announcement last quarter, this brings over 360 new branches to our financial institution distribution channel this year alone. Also during the quarter, we were named a preferred providers of two new indirect clients, Beyond Inc. and Monetary. Both founders are individuals with deep industry task and reputations for building successful scale operations. We remain very pleased with the performance and outlook for the Merchant segment.", "And finally, a few comments about our NetSpend segment. Gross dollar volume or quarter over spend first quarter was a strong $7.6 billion, a 15% over the second quarter of 2016. We had a slightly softer finish to the back season and we were expecting coming out of the first quarter and we had better than expected performance throughout the second quarter and our other card acquisition chamme;s.", "As I\u2019ve mentioned on several occasions, one of the key initiatives on this segment is product diversification. The product launches for our smaller business and demand deposit account products are both on schedule. We have increased our marketing efforts with our small business products by adding direct acquisition to or existing retail sales efforts.", "Although, they are still quite small, early results are encouraging, as we experienced a 50% increase, as small business gross dollar volume over the first quarter. We were also very pleased that our small business program was recently recognized as I said before that\u2019s a prepaid product of the year. Early results on our demand deposit account product are also encouraging. Initial customer feedback during our DDA pilot has been very positive, and we\u2019re excited to now extend the pilot to a larger group of existing cardholders.", "We know that the product is fulfilling one key customer need, as we are beginning to see customers paying rent with the new check features. In addition to expanding our product offerings, we continue to diversify our distribution relationships adding Walgreens as. the distributor and bringing our total distributing locations and employers to over 110,000.", "Our new affinity card with United Airlines launched last week. This is the first prepaid affinity product in the United States that aren\u2019t United MileagePlus award miles and we\u2019re excited to work with a great partner in the United Airlines. As we mentioned at Investor Day, the affinity market is a core to our growth strategy, as we look for new ways to expand our target offerings.", "Finally, as I\u2019m seeing to do too often I would like to provide a few updates on regulatory matters. First, the CFPB has proposed several new changes to the prepaid rule, which includes yet another comment period. At this time the deadline for compliance with the new prepaid rule remains unchanged. Our teams are continuing their work to meet the April 1, 2018 deadline.", "Second, on July 10, the CFPB issued its final rule concerning the use of arbitration agreements for consumer financial process. The final rule among other things, bans class action waivers and arbitration agreements in certain consumer financial services contracts.", "We are closely monitoring the financial services industry, the business community, other financial services, regulators, and Congress will all respond to the issuance of the rule.", "In the meantime we will continue to remain focused on delivering value to our customers, expanding our product offerings and diversify our distribution.", "I want to thank all of our team members for the second quarter performance. Their commitment, focus and dedication have led to these great results. And as a result of their efforts and our outperformance, we are in a position to raise our revenue and earnings per share guidance for second time this year. And Paul will provide additional color on this new guidance in his presentation.", "In addition to increasing our guidance, the Board has approved a 30% increase on our dividend. We appreciate their vote of confidence in our ability to continue to significantly grow our free cash flow and balancing our capital allocation. All-in-all, our second quarter results were outstanding, driven by solid revenue growth that converted into very strong operating earnings.", "Now I will turn it over to Paul Todd to provide additional financial information and details around our revised guidance. Paul?", "Paul Todd", "Thank you, Troy. And I will start by reiterating how pleased we are with the results for the quarter and the first-half of the year.", "Turning to Slide 6, I will cover our consolidated and segment performance for 2Q and year-to-date and then comment on our revised 2017 outlook.", "For the second quarter GAAP total revenues were $1.2 billion, up 6.1% and non-GAAP net revenues was $844.1 million, up 6.2% from 2Q last year. This revenue growth is all organic as we have fully lapped our TransFirst acquisition.", "On a constant currency basis, consolidated net revenues was up 7.4%. The currency negatively impacting reported revenue growth by approximately 120 basis points. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.62 for the quarter, an increase of 64.3% over 2Q of 2016 and non-GAAP quarterly adjusted diluted EPS was $0.85, an increase of 16.4% from 2Q last year.", "Non-GAAP quarterly adjusted EBITDA increased 12.3% to $307.7 million with adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter at 36.5%, up approximately 200 basis points from 2Q last year. We continue to expect consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin to expand by at least 75 basis points for the year.", "Free cash flow was $107.5 million for the quarter, which increased our year-to-date free cash flow to $335.2 million, up 30.3%. We continue to expect our free cash flow for 2017 to be in the $600 million to $630 million range for the year.", "We also take down an additional $125 million in debt during the quarter bringing our year-to-date deleveraging to $225 million and ahead of schedule. This strong free cash flow and deleveraging progress has provided support for the dividend increase Troy mentioned earlier, as the Board has approved to increase our quarterly dividend payout from $0.10 a share to $0.13 a share an increase of 30%.", "For the first six months our GAAP total revenues were up 27.3% over last year with non-GAAP net revenue up 14.3% GAAP diluted EPS up 37.2% and adjusted diluted EPS up 20.7%, clearly a strong start to the first-half of the year.", "Now I will move to our issuer solution segment starting on Slide 8. First, on growth, segment net revenue grew 6.4% for the quarter on a constant currency basis. In fact the segment reached a new record level of reported quarterly net revenue of $392.8 million following the record set during the first quarter. We saw good growth in both volume and non-volume revenue for the segment.", "Next on margin, for the second quarter adjusted segment operating margin was 37.5%, up 349 basis points over 2Q last year, while we are pleased with this margin performance. We will be making some investments in this business in the second-half of the year that will still allow for year-over-year margin expansion, but we expect this quarter\u2019s margin level to be the quarterly high watermark for the year. An example of such investments is the previously announced output services center that we are opening in Columbus, Ohio.", "And finally on outlook for the segment, we continue to expect net revenue to grow in the 5% to 7% constant currency growth rate range for the year and margin expansion of 100 plus basis points, both in line with our expectations at the beginning of the year. In all, a strong quarterly performance for issuing solutions segment.", "Now on to Slide 9 and our merchant solutions segment. First on growth, net revenue grew 6.5% for the quarter as this is the first quarter since our TransFirst acquisition has lapped. Our direct business grew \u2013 our direct business net revenue grew approximately 8% with roughly flat growth on our indirect side resulting in the segment net revenue growth of 6.5% for the quarter. As has been the case all year, our integrated channel led this performance growing in the strong double-digit range for the quarter.", "Next on margins, the strong margin picture for the segment continues with adjusted segment operating margin of 36.6% a 222 basis point expansion from 2Q of last year and complementing the 323 basis point 1Q improvement we delivered last quarter. This margin expansion is reflective of the benefits from our synergy, integration and efficiency efforts that we have \u2013 that have been underway since our TransFirst acquisition.", "Finally on outlook, we continue to expect this segment to grow organic net revenue in the 7% to 9% range for the year with margin expansion expectations to be in the 75 to a 100 basis points range.", "Now onto an net spend on Slide 10. First on growth, the key highlight for this segment is the better than expected organic net revenue growth of 12.6% for the quarter. This was the result of several factors including growth in gross dollar volume of 15% and growth in total debit active cards of 11.6%.", "We were pleased to exit the second quarter of 2017 just shy of 5 million active cards and including the addition of Walgreens to our distribution partners, adding approximately 9,000 distributing locations and employers to our distribution network bringing the total to over 110,000. We\u2019re delivering strong account growth, while our distribution scale continues to expand.", "Next on margin, 2Q 2017 adjusted segment operating margin of 25.2% is down slightly from the 26.1% in Q2 2016, driven by strategic decisions to invest in marketing and our direct-to-consumer business. We also continue to invest in our distribution relationships and launching our new products, including the small business prepaid product and the demand deposit account process. We will continue to make some margin trade offs for growth as we have done in the past.", "Finally on outlook for net spend, our expectation for 2017 is for net revenue growth to be in the 7% to 9% range, up from the 6% to 8% range we communicated on our last call and continue to expect adjusted segment operating margin to be in the 21% to 23% range for the year.", "Now I want to comment on our revised guidance on Slide 13. We now expect total revenues to be in the range of $4.809 billion to $4.889 billion an increase of 15% to 17% over 2016 with net revenue to be in the range of $3.315 billion to $3.395 billion, up 9% to 12% over 2016.", "And our new GAAP EPS range to be $2.30 to $2.38, an increase 33% to 37% over 2016, and our new adjusted diluted EPS range to be $3.22 to $3.30, an increase of 15% to 18% over 2016. We continue to expect our effective tax rate to remain in the 33% to 34% range.", "Finally, I want to wrap up with three key points from today\u2019s call. First, on performance. Each of our businesses had strong organic net revenue growth with expanding operating margins in issuer and merchant.", "Second, our revised guidance continues to reflect the strong performance so far this year. However, we will be commencing some investments in the last-half of the year to enhance our infrastructure, longer-term product offerings and technological capabilities. While we expect each of our businesses to achieve or exceed the margin goals we have communicated. These investments will impact margins in the second-half of this year.", "And finally, our capital position continues to improve allowing for $125 million of deleveraging during the quarter, $25 million higher than our projection and accelerating or deleveraging even faster than the already accelerated schedule. In all, we\u2019re very pleased with our second quarter and first-half year performance and how it positions us for the remaining half of 2017.", "And with that, we will open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays.", "Darrin Peller", "Thanks, guys. Nice job on the quarter. Just want to start off with the big picture, in the backdrop of what\u2019s been a pretty active M&A environment. Can you just give us your updated thoughts again on where you see your strengths lying in terms of assets you already have versus assets you may want to strengthen further through M&A going forward or where \u2013 what your thoughts are really on the M&A opportunities in the near-term, given we see as a pretty strong and healthy balance sheet, especially after this year you paid out some debt? Thanks, guys.", "Troy Woods", "Yes, Darrin, thank you. This is Troy, I appreciate your comments, and Paul may want to add to it on the back-end. But as we said on many occasions, Darrin, we think we\u2019ve got a wonderful diversified portfolio. The issuer processing business, the merchant business, and of course, the self-banking prepaid business.", "We\u2019ve also been pretty consistent, I think in the past about a couple of things. One, we didn\u2019t feel like we\u2019re playing or we want to play in those three segments. Number two, we are actively looking at opportunities in all three. We see opportunities that literally come through the year weekly. I think, we\u2019ve indicated before that M&A is still a very high priority for the company, it continues to be at all three segments. So, Paul, I don\u2019t know if you want to add to that to the balance sheet or\u2026", "Paul Todd", "Well, yes, Darrin, I think the only thing I would add is, we are entering a period, where we\u2019re going to have more balance sheet flexibility to be able to kind of execute on those strategic goals where M&A plays a role, so we\u2019re excited about being in that position.", "Darrin Peller", "And what kind of capacity do you guys think you could have in terms of deal sizes to get something done?", "Paul Todd", "Well, as I said in the past, our longer-term kind of range from a debt-to-EBITDA standpoint is in that mid-2s. But we obviously flex that up like we did in our transfers acquisition. We also did it in our NetSpend acquisition. And so, we have a track record of flexing up when we need to and then using our free cash flow to delver, and so we\u2019ve got capacity.", "Operator", "The next question is from Timothy Willi at Wells Fargo.", "Timothy Willi", "Thanks and good afternoon. A question on the merchant business then one on issuing. But on merchant, I know that within the integrated, you talked about, I think you said that double-digit growth. Healthcare was one of the, I think, the strengths for the bigger parts of that TransFirst business. I wonder if you could just sort of talk about what you see within healthcare organically, competitively and in sort of the dovetailing that M&A discussion, is there a way to further buildout that competitive position that they have to more M&A, or would you look to establish stronger beachheads in other verticals?", "Troy Woods", "Hey, Tim. This is Troy, and Paul may want to add to that later. You\u2019re right, when we made our acquisition of TransFirst, I guess, closed on the back in April of 2016, it effectively doubled the penetration of our integrated work at TSYS by taking home that acquisition, and you are also correct. As we\u2019ve said, healthcare was a very, very big piece of that integrated work. It continues to be the biggest piece. The biggest customers that we have in the integrated space are healthcare-related.", "I think as it relates to M&A, again, without getting obviously in any kind of specifics, we are looking at many different assets in the merchant sector. As we\u2019ve said before, integrated is extremely important to us. Tuck-in M&A is also important to us as we continue to build scale. I think I addressed all of them.", "Paul Todd", "Yes, I don\u2019t have any.", "Troy Woods", "I think, Tim, did I miss anything, or you have a few questions?", "Timothy Willi", "No, I guess, I was just sort of curious on the competitive side around healthcare. Again, it\u2019s a big vertical, lots of people like to talk about it. It\u2019s defined differently by lots of people with healthcare and payments and, et cetera. So I\u2019m just sort of curious how you guys feel competitively? You perceive yourself and any moves, like I said, to further sort of solidify that that you might feel you need to, or just any thoughts you have around the competitive landscape in that particular vertical?", "Troy Woods", "Well, it\u2019s really very competitive out there. All of our businesses are relatively competitive, Tim, you know that. I think, though, when it comes to \u2013 when we look at the line for some of the healthcare integrated payers that we have, there are some very large players and we\u2019re not afraid to stack up to be competitive with anybody in the healthcare space. So it\u2019s no different than before, very competitive.", "Operator", "The next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar at Citi.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Thanks. Hi, Troy. Hi, Paul.", "Troy Woods", "Hey, Ashwin.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Hey. So my first question is on Issuer Solutions. Is it possible to provide some sort of color with regards to North America versus International as it relates to your comments, Troy, on the pipeline as well as it relates to margins, margin improvement and the sustainability of that? What\u2019s driving that? So kind of two sub questions on the issuer part?", "Troy Woods", "Yes, Ashwin, thank you. Well, as I\u2019ve indicated in the past that our issuer pipeline, both North America and International is still very robust. We have several conversion scheduled for the back-half of the year. We have new wins. We have start-ups. We have portfolio conversions, all in the pipeline.", "And as it relates to the sustainability of the margin, obviously, Paul touched on that and staying in the high watermark for the Issuer Solutions Segment in the second quarter as we made some continued investments. But we\u2019re also continuing to improve the margin in International as well as we\u2019ve indicated in the past, that will be a journey for a long, long time. So I think some of these integration efforts of combining the two previous segments under one are certainly beginning to show some dividends.", "Paul Todd", "Yes. And I think the only thing I will add to that, Ashwin, is we are in a great position in this business. We\u2019re aggressively managing the expense base, but we are also making investments for growth for the longer-term. As I mentioned, the Southwest services facility that we are investing in helps our pipeline on our whole output services business. And so we said at the beginning of the year, we wanted to expand this margin by 100-plus basis points and we are on track to do that with making the investments in the business for the longer-term.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Got it. And with regards to merchant solutions, if you can provide some color on it? Obviously, integrated growth was great, but it also implies that sort of the traditional business is maybe a low to mid single-digit type of growth business. What gets merchant solutions growth accelerating to potentially overall a industry level grower?", "Troy Woods", "So, Ashwin, I\u2019ll take that again. So if you look at our growth for the quarter, in my prepared remarks, you\u2019ve heard me talk about our direct business growing at 8% and our indirect business roughly flat, and so that was the overall 6.5%. We had about 100 basis points of compression from a comparative from a deconversion that was in process when we look 2Q to 2Q is about 100 basis points of kind of compression challenge there that\u2019s kind of more of a 7.5% kind of pro forma look, and I think we have two things that are going to play themselves out.", "One, we have an acceleration of direct growing in the back-half of the year with some product initiatives that are in flight. Our indirect business, which has been a no-growth business in the first-half, we\u2019re actually projecting to see that have a slight single-digit growth in the back-half of the year. So all of those components coming together give us back to the prepared remark, I said a 7% to 9% organic growth for the merchant segment, which is what we said at the beginning of the year and we\u2019re on track to deliver against that.", "Operator", "The next question is from Dan Dolev with Nomura Instinet.", "Dan Dolev", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Can you comment on why we shouldn\u2019t expect the growth in expense that you\u2019ve seen in the second quarter to continue throughout the rest of the year? Thank you.", "Paul Todd", "Sure, Dan. This is Paul, again. What we saw and it was behind the raise that we did with the revenue raised to the 7% to 9% from the 6% to 8%, whereas we saw significant kind of outperformance in our direct-to-consumer channel in the second quarter.", "We have made, as I said earlier, some targeted investments on the marketing side there. And so we\u2019re seeing the fruits of those spend. But we don\u2019t anticipate in the back-half of the year that kind of growth on a year-over-year basis that we saw in the second quarter. We saw some good growth in the other channels as well, but that was one specific that I\u2019d call out that led to the better than expected performance of 12.6% in the quarter.", "So we\u2019re very pleased to be in a position of raising the revenue guidance. We started the year at the 6% to 8% range and be in a position to raise it up to 7% to 9%. We\u2019d like what we\u2019re seeing across the channels. And I think it speaks to why you want to diversify channel offering in your businesses when you can see one area kind of outsized in growth versus the other areas and that led to the over performance.", "Dan Dolev", "Excellent. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "The next question is from George Mihalos at Cowen.", "George Mihalos", "Great. Congrats on a nice quarter, guys. I wanted to ask a sort of M&A capital allocation question, again, but maybe in sort of a different way. Would an acquisition and a large buyback, I think, you guys have talked about historically returning 70% of free cash flow to shareholders. Would M&A and a buyback be sort of mutually exclusive, as you think about going into 2018?", "Troy Woods", "No, George, not at all. It\u2019s mutually exclusive. I think we said that in the past. And when you look back in 2014 and 2015 and vertically some of the available free cash flow that we returned to shareholders exceeded 90%. And of course, as we indicated in New York in Investor Day, we certainly pulled that back in 2016, as we focused on deleveraging.", "So we said on a several occasions that there is no reason why we cannot play in both of those camps, M&A and significant share buyback. I think, obviously, it depends on the size of the M&A transaction, but we certainly can do both.", "George Mihalos", "Okay, great. Really I appreciate that color. And then Paul just to be clear, as we kind of think about processor or issuer or margins, excuse me, in the back-half of the year. It seems you\u2019re sort of implying, they should be kind of flattish based on the upside that we\u2019ve seen over the first-half, is that\u2019s the right way to be thinking about it?", "Troy Woods", "I mean, if you look at the first year \u2013 first-half of the year margin then the back-half is going to be roughly in that similar range to get the 100-plus basis point. So that\u2019s the right way to be thinking about it.", "Operator", "The next question is from Brett Huff of Stephens Inc.", "Brett Huff", "Good afternoon, guys Troy, Paul and Shawn.", "Troy Woods", "Thank you, Brett.", "Brett Huff", "I have two questions for you. Can you give us an update \u2013 it\u2019s really about visibility again in the issuer business, because we get a lot of questions about that. Can you tell us a little bit about the renewals. I think you had four of the top 20 coming this year. I think we\u2019ve done a couple still maybe have a couple. So a little bit about that. And then also in terms of the visibility getting to the 5% to 7%, is it still the value-added? Is it still the organic rev or the same-store sales rep from a key clients? Can you just kind of give us pieces of that, give us some comfort on the 5% to 7%?", "Troy Woods", "Yes, Brett, sure. We have two of our top 15 customers currently being worked on, if you will, from a renewal standpoint for the remainder of this year. So you we\u2019ll see no real issues there. And as it relates to our growth and get to that 5% to 7%, it\u2019s fairly similar to what we said again in the last few quarters and again at Investor Day. It\u2019s looking at what our customers are doing. So I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we had five straight quarters, I believe, of 10 \u2013 I mean, three straight quarters of 10 million accounts added in the last three quarters.", "We continue to have a lot of focus on product expansion that we talked about with an effort to improve that 18%-plus of our revenue and value-added products, and we continue to find ways to expand our addressable market. We talked about different areas of the globe like Central America, I believe last quarter. I mentioned new customer wins, taking away shares, start-ups that I mentioned in my prepared remarks tuck-in M&A. So all of those things are how we plan to grow the Issuer segment 5% to 7%. So Paul, if you want to add to that?", "Paul Todd", "Yes, I\u2019ll just add a couple of points on that. If you look at from a volume base revenue standpoint on a reported basis, we\u2019re at a little over 6%, but on a constant currency basis, we\u2019re a little over 8% in our value-added products specifically, which I commented on our last call reported basis around 5% constant currency at 9%. For this quarter, we reported around 5.7% and constant currency about 9.9%.", "So just two items there. The pressure continues if there\u2019s any, it\u2019s on the output and Managed Services side, which is roughly flat. So just give you some added color there this stands behind that 5% to 7% constant currency growth.", "Brett Huff", "That\u2019s really helpful. And then just one quick follow-up on the DDA product and it\u2019s developing. I know a big portion of why you all think you can offset kind of a third to half of that hit that you take whenever you end up having to take it depending on when the revs come in. You mentioned that early looks and early feedback are good. Can you give us a little bit more color on that? Is there anything quantitative at all that we can kind of sink our teeth into to feel more comfortable with that \u2013 with sort of the rev growth or the rev replacement from that business?", "Paul Todd", "Well, it\u2019s little too early to comment on that. As Troy said in his prepared remarks, we are pleased with what we\u2019ve seen so far, but we\u2019re in the early stages. And so it\u2019s too early to kind of give too much more color, obviously, as we progress throughout the year, we will be providing more color on that. But right now, we are very pleased, but it\u2019s early.", "Operator", "The next question is from John Davis with Stifel.", "John Davis", "Hey, good afternoon, guys. First one, on the margin. So I think, year-to-date the margins are up roughly 150 basis points year-over-year. So full-year guidance of plus 75 would roughly imply flat margins in the back-half of the year Paul, I know you talked about some investments there, still seeing conservative. But maybe just talk about the investments in more detail, and what exactly you\u2019re going to be investing in the back-half of the year?", "Paul Todd", "Sure. And when I talk about the margin expanding to 75, at least, 75 basis points, that\u2019s on the adjusted EBITDA margin there, which I think for the first-half of the year, we were about a little over a 100 basis points for the first-half of the year. But then we got a couple of things that play on the back-half of the year. One, I called out was on the Output Services facility in the Issuer business; two, we have the rollout expenses on NetSpend with the DDA, the small business and Affinity.", "We also have the margin pressure we had talked about in our prior call around DDA one of our large providers and the structure that we have with that it\u2019s playing in the second-half margin.", "And then we obviously have the renewal, the significant renewal on our issuer business that\u2019s also playing in the second half margin. And finally we just have investments across all three segments that we are making as I said in product and some of our capabilities, so when you kind of go through all those and put them together that\u2019s what is behind my commentary there.", "I mean, the key point is this, we are very pleased with where we sit from a margin standpoint and to be at this position to make the kind of investments that we are able to make in these businesses for longer-term growth is exactly the position we wanted to be in at this point right now. So, we are going to meet all those \u2013 we\u2019re on track to meet all of our margin goals that we said at the beginning of the year and we are pleased to be able to make them in a way where we are investing in the business while achieving the margin results.", "John Davis", "Okay, and then one just the quick follow-up. On the FX impact on the issuer business, I think it\u2019s a little bit more than we expected, you know you still have I think now we\u2019ve lapped the drop in the pound, you know will be more kind of a minimal impact of FX in the back half of the year.", "Paul Todd", "Yes, that\u2019s right John. You know I commented in the last call that I expected the second quarter to be roughly in line with the first quarter and it was slightly better. And as I commented before, we don\u2019t expect anything significant in the back half of the year and that\u2019s still our expectation.", "Operator", "The next question is from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs.", "Jim Schneider", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Troy I was wondering if you maybe give us a little bit of color on the issuer business and specifically the pipeline of new customers that you see that might potentially get signed in the next six to nine months or so? And maybe you could also comment Paul on the relative growth rates of North America versus international?", "Troy Woods", "Well, Jim, really there is not a whole lot I can add to what I have already said on the call and in my prepared remarks about our issuer pipeline. It is robust; it includes all pieces of the segment if you will that includes new wins, start ups, portfolio conversions. I did mentioned that we have several conversions scheduled for the back half of 2017 as well, so there is really whole lot more I can really add to that at this time.", "Paul Todd", "And I would just say Jim, on the second part of your question, we are \u2013 as I said on the last call, we\u2019re managing this segment now as one, our customer relationships we\u2019re managing as one, so we don\u2019t provide any breakout between the domestic side or the international side.", "Jim Schneider", "Okay and then maybe a follow-up, going back to the regulatory comments, Troy, you mentioned at the beginning of the script, anything you see now that the house has passed the Choice Act, you know if you look at that particular piece of legislation, if that were to the pass the Senate unchanged, which is big if, you know what would be the impact on your \u2013 the various aspects of your business?", "Troy Woods", "Well, I think you made a very good point there Jim. From our standpoint and all the feedback we get, we do not really see the Financial Choice Act passing the Senate as is. Senator Gregg was holding a lot of hearings and feedback on it. Our feedback is, it\u2019s just really down on the list of priorities. I think the Senate has a few other priorities that they are focusing on at the current time, so we don\u2019t really see that anytime soon becoming law.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll move on to Paulo Ribeiro at BMO Capital Markets.", "Paulo Ribeiro", "Good afternoon. I have a couple of questions here, the first is, piggybacking on what Jim asked about the conversion rate, and you guys talked that you, in the pipeline, that you have a few lined up for the end of the year. How should we think about it in terms of, I don\u2019t know maybe cadence of profitability of new clients, when you bring a new client onboard, how should we expect, so if you convert some in the end of the year, if you already baked the new guidance for the full year because there is not enough time to extract enough profitability margin for them, so I think that\u2019s first question, how should we think when each of the conversions, how they place out in terms of being additive to your profitability yet start seeing results?", "Paul Todd", "Okay Paulo, well, as we said on the few occasions in the past, it really depends, it depends on if it\u2019s a retail conversion, a credit conversion or start-up etcetera. So the profitability as we\u2019ve said, the margins of those can really fluctuate. As we said before, when we converted a big customer a couple of years ago with a very, very large number of accounts, he wouldn\u2019t expect to get the same margins on that business as we do for the entire file. So it really depends.", "And you also made a correct statement, Paulo, that all of the numbers, based on all of these type conversions that are coming our way and startups are baked into our guidance for the year of 5% to 7% constant currency growth.", "Paulo Ribeiro", "Perfect. Changing gears a little bit, in terms of the international market and there you guys talked about margin expansion already. What does it take to increase margin in some of the international markets, it\u2019s time for them to mature, is it getting scale, and in getting scale with M&A international part of your outlook, how do we bring up the international margins in this short run?", "Paul Todd", "Paulo, as it relates to the margin internationally in our issuer business as I said earlier, we don\u2019t break that out separately, we\u2019re not managing that business in that kind of separate fashion in general, but I would say when we did have it that way scale, obviously it\u2019s incredibly important. And so if you looked at our two businesses before between domestic and international, you looked at the two different margin profile, scale was one of the biggest drivers between the two difference. We have a few other things at play with the cost of operating in some of the countries around data requirements and some other things, but the biggest item that I would point to is scale.", "With that being said, we are managing this business as one and so today we look at the margin on kind of a combined basis and certainly the progress that\u2019s being made, both organically but also we are putting the businesses together is incredibly impressive with being able to expand the consolidated margin of those two former businesses by 100 plus basis points this year.", "Operator", "The next question is from Jeff Cantwell with Guggenheim Securities.", "Jeff Cantwell", "Thanks for taking my question. My question is on issuer solutions, I guess at your inventor you spoke about shifting to open API and how that shifting will help drive the growth. I was just hoping you could help us to better understand if open API is driving a structural, more permanent change in your margin profile? The reason why I\u2019m asking is, because operating margin initially were significant better than I think most of us were expecting this quarter, I was trying to unpack that a little but more, thanks.", "Troy Woods", "Yes, Jeff, we certainly did talk about that a lot at our investor day about moving to API not only in the issuing segment of course, but for all of our segments and really opening up the APIs on our product side of issuing is extremely key. With that said, we are still in the very, very early innings, so I didn\u2019t not really put any of our margin expansion for the second quarter on the backs of API, so there is still to some.", "Jeff Cantwell", "Great, thanks very much.", "Troy Woods", "Yes sir.", "Operator", "The next question is from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank", "Bryan Keane", "Hi, guys, congrats on the solid quarter. Just had a couple of quick ones, yes, just a couple of quick ones, most of my questions have been answered, but the investments in the second half, I guess, kind of a two part question to it, are those investments, are those considered one time in nature, like those won\u2019t be reoccurring in 2019 or 2020? And then secondly, are you guys taking advantage of kind of the higher operating performance, maybe than expectations and just investing further or did you always plan to make these investments?", "Paul Todd", "So, Bryan, multipart kind of answer, as it relates to the investments, some are more permanent in nature. The facility, I mentioned, is an example of those that are more permanent in nature. But some are more one-time like the cost on that NetSpend side with some of the launches that are more kind of one-time in nature. So it\u2019s a mix. I would say this. These investments have all been planned. There is some scaling and sizing related to performance that plays into this mix. And so there is no new categories here, but there is kind of a tempo in size element at play.", "Bryan Keane", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then on \u2013 my follow up, I just want to ask on the CUP and the JV equity and income in the JVs. That ticked down, I think sequentially in the quarter, but that was kind of the plan. I just want to understand maybe what was impacting the spike in the first quarter? And then maybe a more normalized number probably going forward in the second and beyond? Thanks.", "Paul Todd", "Yes, that\u2019s right, Bryan. And so, we did, due to some timing have a spike in the first quarter. And we expect the third and fourth quarter to be relatively consistent to what we saw in the second quarter.", "Operator", "The next question is from Steven Kwok at KBW.", "Steven Kwok", "Hi, guys. Just to wanted to follow-up around the M&A question. And just around geographies, are there any particular geographies that you think can be enhanced through an M&A?", "Troy Woods", "Steven, we \u2013 again, as I said on several occasions, when you look at our Issuer Solutions business, as you all know, it is an International business. We talked about developing and continue to expand geographically there, number one. Number two, in the other two segments, as we\u2019ve said before, we do not play internationally. So the primary focus has been USA, but we\u2019ve also said on several occasions that we do have aspirations at the right time, right opportunity to take our self-banking prepaid business perhaps outside the U.S., as well as our Merchant Solutions business outside the U.S. That\u2019s probably the best way to leave it at that one.", "Steven Kwok", "Are there any specific, like would it be Europe or Asia-Pacific, or any particular regions that you are focused on more versus another?", "Troy Woods", "Well, I think the best way to answer that, Steven, will be again looking at our Issuer Solutions business as we said on many occasions, where we play in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe and Brazil, that\u2019s pretty much our playground for the Issuer Solutions business.", "Operator", "The next question is from Ramsey El-Assal at Jefferies.", "Ramsey El-Assal", "Thanks for taking my question. Do you think \u2013 this is on the CFPB rule, do you think that the incremental new comment period knowing how long these things can take might imply that the final implementation date gets pushed back?", "Troy Woods", "Ramsey, I\u2019d be the last guy to speculate on that. I think, we\u2019ll just have to wait and see. I don\u2019t even think that has made the final federal register to start the clock running. If it has, it\u2019s been in the last day or two. So I really would not speculate, Ramsey, I really would not.", "Ramsey El-Assal", "Fair enough, fair enough. If I could just add then a quick follow-up. Any update on \u2013 we\u2019ve seen in the news that the networks are now submitting applications to participate in China. Is there any increased visibility or chatter or uptick in conversations with your Chinese partners about how that might impact your business there?", "Troy Woods", "Not really. Paul, you might want to add to that? Gaylon is here as well and he attended our last board meeting. He is indicating no, so nothing to report there at all.", "Operator", "Next question is from Leonard DeProspo, I\u2019m sorry, DeProspo at Mizuho. Please go ahead with your question, sir. Okay, we\u2019ll move on to Paul Condra at Credit Suisse.", "Paul Condra", "Hi, all, thanks. Good afternoon, and solid results here. I just wanted to ask, Paul, Maybe just to clarify on the margins in the Merchant segment. I know you said issuer is kind of the high watermark in the second quarter and you listed a lot of spending in the second-half. But is that the same in \u2013 on the merchant side where you have margins at a high watermark?", "Paul Todd", "Yes, Paul, it is. I mean, that\u2019s our expectation is that it\u2019s kind of a high watermark for the quarter on the merchant side as well.", "Paul Condra", "Okay, excuse me, great. And then just I guess, more broadly just because the margins look so good in issuer, can that 37.5 be a run rate for that business? I mean, I don\u2019t know just kind of looking out?", "Paul Todd", "Well, Paul, we had a good track record in the issuer business of expanding the margin on a year-over-year basis. If you kind of go back and look at this business over the last two years and you see the margin expansion that we\u2019ve had. This track record cover several years. And we, as I said, plan another 100-plus basis points. So we did a business where scale lends itself to margin expansion.", "With that being said, I think a made a comment at our Investor Day about this. We\u2019re going to be making investments in this business for growth. And so it\u2019s not just all about kind of maximizing the short-term margin, but rather that right mix of revenue growth and investment while getting margin expansion. So we\u2019re, as I said earlier, pleased to be in a position to make investments, but also pleased to be in a position to grow the margin by a 100-plus basis points.", "Operator", "The next question is from David Togut at Evercore ISI.", "David Togut", "Thank you. Good afternoon. Curious for your thoughts around the implementation of PSD2 in Europe consumer ACH payments for e-commerce transactions. Given your strong presence in Europe in issuer solutions, is there an opportunity for you to generate some new business by helping your bank issuers open up their APIs?", "Pamela Joseph", "Hey, this is Pam, and I have Kelly Knutson here from our UK office. PSD2 is kicking off. It\u2019s extremely complex and it will create many challenges for our clients, and that will create opportunities for us. And we have basically put together a high level roadmap that we\u2019ve taken on the road to go actually start working and talking to our clients. Kelly, do you want to touch on anything in particular?", "Kelly Knutson", "Yes, probably three components here. First one, a lot of focus on compliance and our clients are looking at that initially. And then second phase will be very targeted opportunities in their existing client base, and we\u2019re starting to see some new entrants coming to the market as well. So this will play out. I think it is a very complicated and sometimes contradictory situation, but we do see some interesting opportunities over and above that compliance component.", "David Togut", "Will this be an opportunity for you to expand by either becoming or acquiring a payment initiation services provider?", "Kelly Knutson", "We\u2019ll be looking at a number of options and the role we play in PSD2 and we are conferring with our clients to determine how far we can and can\u2019t go or should or shouldn\u2019t go, but we will definitely be looking at those types of options.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session. And I would like to the the conference back over to Mr. Roberts for closing remarks.", "Shawn Roberts", "Thank you, Amy. I just like to tell everybody, we appreciate your participation on the earnings call. And as always, give me a call when you are ready to talk, and we appreciate it.

(NYSE:TSS) Q3 2017 Earnings Conference Call October 25, 2017  5:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Shawn Roberts - Senior Director of Investor", "Troy Woods - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Paul Todd - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Analysts", "James Berkley - Barclays", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi", "Dan Dolev - Instinet", "George Mihalos - Cowen", "Dave Koning - Baird", "James Friedman - Susquehanna", "Brett Huff - Stephens", "Jim Schneider - Goldman Sachs", "Tom McCrohan - Mizuho", "Operator", "Good afternoon, and welcome to TSYS Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Release and Conference call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Shawn Roberts, Senior Director, TSYS Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Shawn Roberts", "Thank you, Anita, and welcome, everyone. We'll begin this evening's call with opening comments by TSYS' Chairman and CEO, Troy Woods; followed by TSYS CFO, Paul Todd, reviewing the third quarter 2017 highlights and consolidated financials. Troy and Paul will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of this slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental schedules are available on our website at investors.tsys.com. After the prepared remarks, we will open the call up for Q&A. I'd like to remind everyone that if you are participating in the Q&A personally you are able to ask two questions before the operator places you back into the queue.", "I'll now call your attention to the fact that we'll be making forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS' actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in TSYS' reports filed with SEC, including our 2016 annual report on Form 10-K. We will also discuss items that do not conform to GAAP, and we reconcile those measures to GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation and in the supplemental schedules to the press release.", "At this point, I'll turn the call over to Troy Woods.", "Troy Woods", "Thank you, Shawn, and good afternoon. We appreciate your support and interest in TSYS and for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. The TSYS team members across our global footprint have delivered another outstanding performance. Our strong organic revenue growth, disciplined expense management and effective investment reflect the consistent execution of our strategic goals as we remain focused on delivering exceptional performance across our company.", "Some of the highlights for the quarter that I would like to call out are total revenues were up 8.8%, and net revenue increased by 8%. Adjusted EBITDA was $309.5 million, an increase of 15%.", "Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 23.7%. Operating margins expanded in all 3 segments. And we reduced our debt another $175 million during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date reduction to $400 million and the total over the past 6 quarters to $800 million.", "The ability to accelerate our deleveraging commitment allowed us to resume our share repurchase activity ahead of schedule, and we purchased 400,000 shares of our stock for $27.6 million during the quarter.", "Our strong free cash flow and stability of earnings have provided us with the confidence and the means to increase our dividend and resume our share repurchases over the past two quarters.", "I will address a few additional items across our enterprise and then ask Paul to provide additional financial highlights.", "First, on issuer solutions. It was another strong quarter for issuer solutions with many records being set. Some highlights include: Traditional accounts on file ended at 562 million, up 10%, and total transactions were up 8.6%. Both of these metrics are new records. Also, net revenue and adjusted operating income set new records, surpassing the record set last quarter.", "On the business development front, we signed contract extensions with Green Dot through June 2019 and M&T Bank through September 2022. We are in the final stages of contract negotiations with a leading UK retailer to add to our strong stable of retail-oriented brands and operating models. This particular portfolio is scheduled to convert around midyear 2018.", "Also during the third quarter, we converted a significant portfolio of co-brand accounts to TSYS on behalf of Capital One bank. TSYS and Capital One agreed to focus during the third quarter on the co-brand conversion and, therefore, have mutually agreed to extend the contract renewal until this quarter.", "Our issuer business development pipeline continues to look solid in both our core processing, as well as our Managed Services business, where we continue to make progress around our digital agenda as we streamline the end customer experience.", "On the product development side of the segment, one of the key initiatives in issuer solutions is to greatly expand the value-added products we offer to our clients. One of our main areas of focus is in fraud and risk management.", "Last quarter, we announced our first implementation of machine learning with Foresight School. Foresight School is a fraud and risk scoring tool that incorporates machine learning and bolsters an issuer's ability to fight transactional fraud, especially in card-not-present situations.", "We have completed successful pilot with 2 clients, and the early results are very encouraging. These clients have experienced a 15% improvement in overall fraud detection and up to a 35% increase in card-not-present fraud detection.", "In addition, the false-positive declines have improved, which allows for a better cardholder experience at the time of the transaction. We currently have a very robust pipeline to extend this new product beyond these 2 pilot clients.", "Beyond transaction fraud scoring, we are looking at application fraud, customer segmentation and digital identity verification as potential areas for the application of machine learning.", "Another point of progress on our product road map is the formulation of our partnership with Argus. Through this partnership, we will be able to quickly introduce our new market-leading data management and analytics solutions to help our clients maximize the value of data by transforming it into insightful information and analysis that assist our clients in managing their business, mitigating risk and capitalizing on their financial objectives.", "As I said before, our goal is to consistently deliver remarkable products and services that our clients want and need and which will differentiate them in the market. Foresight Score and our totally new analytics platform are just two great examples of our issuer product road map being driven under the leadership of Karim Ahmad and his very talented team.", "Now I would like to make a few comments about our merchant solutions segment. This segment also set records for net revenue and adjusted operating income during the third quarter.", "Pro forma revenue growth has improved sequentially in each quarter this year, and we expect that trend to continue in the fourth quarter. We also delivered a margin of 36.6%, 206 basis points over 3Q 2016.", "Our dollar sales volume growth was up a robust 9.8% even with some degradation from 2 hurricanes. This revenue improvement is reflected in both our direct and indirect businesses. And while direct continues to drive most of our growth, we are now seeing our indirect business completed as they expand and gain share from our competition.", "On the business development front, a couple of callouts. First, our integrated business continues to be a strong growth channel for our Merchant segment. Our focus remains on strengthening our relationships in key verticals such as health, dental, wellbeing and direct selling.", "During the quarter, we added several new integrated partners and renewed three of our top 10 partners. Second, in an effort to expand our addressable market and to follow our partners, we are continuously building out our International capabilities.", "To that end, we recently launched a TSYS Australia entity focused on integration partners that have already produced over 400 new merchant relationships in Australia, and we anticipate additional International markets will be launched in 2018.", "We remain confident with our merchant topline outlook and margin as we continue to drive strong growth across our distribution channels, particularly our fast-growing technology led integrated business, which now makes up approximately 30% of our direct merchant revenue.", "Finally, turning to a NetSpend. NetSpend delivered strong results this quarter with double-digit growth in gross dollar volume, active cards, revenue and adjusted operating income. All four of our distribution channels made a solid contribution to our performance in the quarter.", "In particular, I want to call out three new developments in our retail channel for the quarter. First, we signed a new 3-year agreement with the Kroger Company, the largest grocery in the United States with 3,400 locations around the country. Kroger will be an excellent retail distribution partner, and we expect to be totally rolled out in their stores soon.", "Second, we're very excited about expanding our relationship with Walmart. In addition to NetSpend accounts being offered at Walmart stores, we have expanded our distribution to include the 3,400 Walmart money centers across the U.S. We have several renewals under negotiation.", "And during the quarter, we signed a three year renewal with Speedway, the third largest convenience store chain in the United States with 2,700 locations. Speedway has one of the best loyalty programs in the industry known as Speedy Rewards.", "In addition to being able to acquire a NetSpend account at Speedway, we have an integration that enables customers to earn Speedy rewards points with their NetSpend accounts, enhancing the value of the NetSpend product.", "Last quarter, I mentioned that we were piloting our demand deposit account products and we're encouraged by the early results. During the third quarter, we rolled out the DDA product nationwide at ACE Cash Express and continued our pilot in our direct channel.", "Through the end of the third quarter, customers have opened over 100,000 DDA accounts. This includes both customers who are new to NetSpend products as well as those who have chosen to upgrade from their Prepaid card to a DDA account.", "Our small business product continues to gain traction as well, and we exited the quarter with over 5,000 new small business 90 day active cards. Our small business GDV for the third quarter increased 30% over the second quarter.", "And as indicated last quarter, the second quarter saw a 50% increase in GDV over first quarter '17. We are very encouraged by these results for our 2 newest NetSpend products.", "In summary, a very good quarter overall with strong organic revenue growth across the broad margin expansion, accelerated deleveraging commitment, resilient share repurchases and increased 2017 guidance.", "Before closing, I would like to take a moment to recognize the many people who are impacted by the recent series of hurricanes and tropical storms across the United States and in Puerto Rico. Our thoughts and prayers remain with them as they continue the long recovery process from the devastation of these storms.", "Fortunately, we were able to leverage the assets of our businesses to provide assistance in the aftermath of these storms. Those efforts included assisting employers and paying people who could not get to their workplace to receive pay checks; providing disbursement cards so money could be more easily distributed to people in need; and waiving certain fees for NetSpend and merchant customers at affected areas.", "In addition, I would also like to thank the many TSYS team members who contributed both time and money to the recovery process. As always, I am impressed and humbled by the eagerness of our team members to lend a hand to those in need.", "While we are focused every day on delivering strong product and customer service experiences as well as strong operating and financial performance, we are also committed to having a positive impact on the areas we serve around the globe.", "Now I will turn it over to Paul Todd to provide a more detailed financial information for the quarter and to discuss our revised guidance for the remainder of 2017. Paul?", "Paul Todd", "Thank you, Troy, and I want to say again how pleased we are with our third quarter and year-to-date results. As a continuation from our Q2 call, you can see that our organic revenue growth and margin expansion goals are playing out.", "Now to discuss our consolidated and segment performance and our revised 2017 outlook, let's turn to Slide 6. Our third quarter GAAP total revenues were $1.25 billion, up 8.8%; and non-GAAP net revenue was $852.8 million, up 8% from 3Q last year.", "This builds upon the 6.2% net revenue growth we saw last quarter, and both of these quarters are all new organic revenue growth with no acquisition-related impacts. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.66 for the quarter, an increase of 43.3% over 3Q of 2016 and non-GAAP quarterly adjusted diluted EPS was $0.88, an increase of 23.7% from 3Q last year. Our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA grew by 15% for the quarter to $309.5 million.", "On the consolidated margin front, our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was a strong 36.3%, up approximately 220 basis points from 3Q last year. We continue to improve our margin picture for the company and are raising our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin outlook from the previous 75 basis points to approximately 100 basis points of consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin expansion for 2017.", "On free cash flow, we had another strong quarter of free cash flow at $207.4 million, increasing our year-to-date free cash flow to $542.7 million, up 22.3% over last year. We are now raising our full year free cash flow outlook from the $600 million to $630 million range to the $610 million to $640 million range.", "On the capital front, we reached a major milestone in our deleveraging plan by reducing our debt an additional $175 million during the quarter, completing our targeted $800 million of deleveraging over the last six quarters and two quarters ahead of schedule.", "We were also excited to resume our share buyback activity with the repurchase of 400,000 shares for $27.6 million. As we look at our year-to-date results, our GAAP total revenues are up 20.3% over last year with non-GAAP net revenue, up 12.1%.", "GAAP diluted EPS, up 39.2%; and adjusted diluted EPS, up 21.6%. At the consolidated level, the third quarter was pivotal as it relates to organic net revenue growth, margin expansion, deleveraging and resumption of stock buyback activity.", "Now I will move to our segment results starting with the issuer segment on Slide 8. First, on growth. Segment net revenue grew 5.8% for the quarter on a reported and constant currency basis, while adjusted segment operating income grew 14.6%.", "As has been the case each quarter this year, the segment reached a new record level of reported quarterly net revenue at $401.1 million. We saw good growth in both volume and non-volume constant currency net revenue for the segment with volume-based constant currency net revenue up 5.3% for the quarter, non-volume-based constant currency net revenue up 6.4% as value-added product related constant currency net revenue grew 9.4% and constant currency managed in Output Services net revenue grew 1.4%. We continue to be pleased with the strong growth in these key net revenue growth drivers in the issuer segment.", "Next, on margin. 3Q adjusted segment operating margin increased approximately 280 basis points to 36.8%. The continued execution of our margin expansion goals for this segment played out during the quarter much like we saw in 2Q.", "And finally, on outlook for the segment. We continue to expect net revenue to grow in the 5% to 7% constant currency growth rate range for the year and are increasing our outlook on adjusted segment operating margin expansion for the year from 100-plus basis points to 125-plus basis points of expansion.", "As I mentioned on our last call, we will be making additional investments in this segment in 4Q that will help position this segment for the longer term. These investments are primarily in 3 groupings.", "First is related to our Columbus, Ohio Output Services facility going live in the quarter. Second, our employment-related costs, both on the incentive side and severance side.", "And finally, our investments in our technology and product areas, some of which we talked about at our Investor Day in May. It will all be made while still allowing for the 125-plus basis points of adjusted segment operating income margin expansion for the segment this year.", "So for the quarter, our issuing segment hit on all cylinders with constant currency net revenue growth in the 5% to 7% range, a 14.6% increase in adjusted segment operating income, a 280 basis point margin expansion in the quarter and positioning us for a 125-plus basis points of annual margin expansion for the segment, inclusive of investments.", "Now on to Slide 9 and our Merchant segment. First, on growth. Net revenue grew 7.4% for the quarter to $281.8 million with adjusted segment operating income growth of 13.8%. The 7.4% net revenue growth builds upon the 6.5% net revenue growth in the second quarter.", "Our direct business net revenue grew almost 9% with roughly 1% growth on our indirect side yielding the segment net revenue growth of 7.4%. Our integrated channel continues to grow in the strong double-digit range and continues to be our focus for growth in the future, and we were pleased with some positive growth on the indirect side.", "Next, on margin. Our adjusted segment operating margin expansion success continues with an approximate 210 basis point expansion to 36.6% from 3Q of last year. This follows the 222 basis point expansion we saw last quarter.", "And finally, on outlook. We continue to expect this segment to grow organic net revenue in the 7% to 9% growth range for the year, and we are increasing our margin outlook from the 75 to 100 basis points of annual margin expansion for the segment to 125-plus basis points of margin expansion, in line with the margin expansion expectations of issuing.", "Now on the NetSpend on Slide 10. First, on growth. The key highlight for this segment again this quarter is the better-than-expected organic net revenue growth of 15.8%, up from 12.6% in the second quarter.", "Adjusted segment operating income grew 18.9% for the quarter. This growth was the result of several factors, including growth in gross dollar volume of 13.7%, growth in total debit active cards of 12.8% and some onetime items accounting for about 100 basis points of growth.", "The organic net revenue growth picture for this segment has continued to improve throughout the year and the track record of the NetSpend team growing the business and faster than the market growth rates has continued.", "We were pleased to exit the third quarter of 2017 with almost 4.7 million active cards. Although it did not have a meaningful impact on Q3 financial results, as Troy noted, we were very pleased to add Kroger as a distribution partner in the quarter. And our ever-expanding distribution network got even stronger and now expands more than 115,000 distributing locations and employers.", "Next on margin. Q3 2017 adjusted segment operating margin of 27% is up slightly from the 26.3% in Q3 2016. But excluding the onetime items I mentioned earlier, adjusted segment operating margin would've been slightly down from 3Q 2016.", "And finally, on outlook for NetSpend. Based on the strong year-to-date performance and our remain expectations for 2017, we are raising the net revenue growth outlook for this segment by approximately 200 basis points to the 9% to 11% range from the previous 7% to 9% range.", "We are raising the adjusted segment operating margin outlook by approximately 100 basis points to a margin range of 22% to 24% for the year from the previous 21% to 23% range I mentioned on our last call.", "As with our other segments but specifically related to NetSpend, we will increase our investments in 4Q from 3Q and we have a history of increased marketing spend in 4Q in this business.", "We have increased our marketing spend in 2017 as the environment has improved from our original expectations, and we have seen the positive results of this increased spend with our improving revenue growth picture throughout the year.", "We will continue to invest in the business in 4Q with marketing and other product investments, and we'll continue to make some margin trade-offs for growth as we have in the past.", "Based on the transitionary period we are in with NetSpend this year and next, given our new product rollouts at DDA and small business in preparation for the upcoming CFPB rule changes, we are pleased to be in a position to raise our revenue and margin outlook this year while making investments in the business.", "Moving back to the consolidated level on Slide 13, I want to make a few comments on our revised guidance. We are pleased again to be able to revise our guidance upward for 2017.", "We now expect total revenue to be in the range of $4.839 billion to $4.889 billion, an increase of 16% to 17% over 2016 with net revenue to be in the range of $3.345 billion to $3.395 billion, up 10% to 12% over 2016; and our new GAAP EPS range to be $2.37 to $2.43, an increase of 37% to 40% over 2016; and our new adjusted diluted EPS range to be $3.29 to $3.35, an increase of 18% to 20% over 2016. We now expect our effective tax rate to be in the 32% to 33% range.", "Finally, I want to wrap up with 3 key points from today's call. First is on performance and specifically on organic revenue growth and margin expansion. Each of our businesses had strong organic net revenue growth that was consistent with the ranges provided at the beginning of the year and fueled a quarterly consolidated all-organic 8% net revenue growth for the company.", "This growth was achieved while expanding our adjusted segment operating margins in the issuer and merchant over 200 basis points a piece during the quarter and delivering better than expected 3Q margin in NetSpend. The organic revenue growth and margin story was a strong in this quarter and shows the power of the TSYS earnings in you.", "Second is on our outlook. Our better-than-expected performance puts us in a position to once again raise guidance for the year to a net revenue growth range of 10% to 12% with an adjusted diluted EPS growth rate range of 18% to 20%. Also, we are raising the margin outlooks for each of our 3 segment and is the consolidated level.", "This quarter's results and our revised outlook for the year is further support that we are delivering against our strategic and financial goals while also making proactive investments that will benefit us over the longer term.", "Final takeaway is on capital allocation. At the announcement of our TransFirst acquisition, we stated an $800 million deleveraging goal to be executed over 8 quarters and our accelerating free cash flow has allowed us to reach this goal 2 quarters early.", "Equally important is that we were able to resume our buyback activity in the quarter with a repurchase of 400,000 shares. We are now in the best capital position we have been in, in the last 18 months, which will enable us to make strategic acquisitions and continue share repurchases consistent with our capital allocation principles.", "In all, as I said earlier, the third quarter was a crucial one for TSYS with strong performance, a strong balance sheet and, most of all, a strong and winning team executing every day.", "And with that, we will open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from James Berkley with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Darrin Peller", "Hey, guys. This is actually Darrin on.", "Paul Todd", "Hello?", "Darrin Peller", "Hey, could you hear me.", "Paul Todd", "Hey, Darrin. We can hear you Darrin.", "Darrin Peller", "All right. Thanks, guys. It's Darrin Peller. Listen, just want to start off with NetSpend. It obviously was a very strong result, at least versus our model and your guidance. You just added an additional opportunities around distribution with Kroger. I mean, I guess, why would that growth rate outside of the 100 basis points of onetime items you talked about, why would that decelerate in the next, let's say, 6 to 12 months?", "I mean, I think it's fair to say that you're still rolling out some of the incremental distribution synergies you'd added already before, and now, you're adding Kroger, Speedway and others. So just a little more color on what's going on there and if we should really be expecting that kind of growth profile to persist?", "Paul Todd", "Sure, Darrin. This is Paul. I'll start. So you're right, I mean, we have had an improving sequential quarter net revenue growth rate picture in NetSpend this year, and it's primarily been driven by improvement in two of our channels, primarily our retail channel as well as our direct channel, but we have seen improvement in a couple of our other channels.", "The outsized growth there has been one that we obviously planned at a certain level, but it's come in at a much faster pace. And so we pulled back in the fourth quarter to a more normalized level of what we expect that to be.", "And then there is been some other things. You mentioned the onetime item, which pulls out of 3Q and goes into 4Q. I think if you look at our revised revenue guide for the year, you see a much improved 4Q relative to our initial expectation even with that movement in that onetime timing item.", "Darrin Peller", "Okay, all right. So it does sound like the trends are there, and it's just a matter of now turning it over and executing on the new contacts and deal with the distribution. It's great to hear.", "Other than the onetime, I guess, just a quick follow up now on the capital allocation strategy, guys. I mean, like you said, you came to a point where you've obviously delevered faster.", "With - looking ahead, in terms of what types of assets you'd be wanting to really bring in, can you just update us on your thoughts around that in terms of M&A and strategic tuck-ins versus buybacks?", "And then, I guess, why not keep your leverage or do you expect to keep your leverage levels where they are today. You add debt as you grow EBITDA in order to enhance even more liquidity for buybacks at a material rate that's maybe even better than you previously thought, given cash flows coming in better than you thought? And thanks again, guys.", "Paul Todd", "Sure, Darrin. I'll start and then maybe Troy will add to it. Let me take kind of the second part of that. As I said in my prepared remarks, we are glad to be in a position now to kind of get back to the capital allocation principles that we have outlined previously.", "And I think, as it relates to kind of the pacing of that or the sizing of that, those are still in line with how we talked about those in the past. So we're in a position this quarter to accelerate the debt repayment as well as to - just a small bit of share repurchase.", "But as we move forward on the share repurchase side, it would be consistent with the principles that we've outlined before. As it relates to debt and M&A capacity, I'll let Troy speak to kind of the strategic side of the M&A, but we now have the capacity to obviously do something upwards of $1 billion.", "So that's easily done given kind of the capacity that we now have from balance sheet flexibility. So we're still committed to our investment-grade rating. We're still wanting to kind of lever it up to then lever it back down. So all those principles are all still intact, and now we're in a position where we can execute.", "Troy Woods", "I think, the only thing I will add to that, Paul, Darrin, is that - a couple of things. One, as we've said on a few occasions before, we feel like we're playing where we want to play with the assets that we have. Very strong issuer processing solution, a very strong merchant position, and course, our self-banking Prepaid segment, number one.", "Number two, from an M&A perspective, strategically, we still look at all 3 segments to look at strategic M&A and tuck-in product enhancements. As we've said before, our primary focus will be on acquiring a merchant.", "And within that, we clearly want to look at continuing to expand our integrated capabilities, particularly in our main Vertical and Integrated, being healthcare and some of the other things I mentioned in my prepared remarks around dental and well-being and direct selling. So that kind of gives you some sense of what we're trying to do from an M&A perspective.", "The next question comes from Timothy Willi with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Timothy Willi", "Thank you and good afternoon. First question, and then I have a follow up. Troy, just on merchant, it appears, I guess, with the last couple quarters' results that this business seems to be winning, I guess, maybe more than it has in the past. And obviously, there could be comparative issues that come and go.", "But I guess, if you could talk a bit about how you're thinking about the competitive position within the market. There's been a lot of M&A, a lot of people that are trying to figure out what to do.", "If you just feel like you've risen into a position of more competitive strength as others try to figure out what their next step is. Just any color you might have around the momentum there?", "Troy Woods", "Sure, Tim. Thank you. Well, I think a couple of things. One, all of our segments are competitive and each one has their nuances, of course. But the Merchant segment is also very competitive, and each of our channels within Merchant has its own nuances as well. I think when you think about our competitive strengths in Merchant,", "I think you need to look at our FI capabilities and our integrated capabilities as I indicated before. Primarily, we feel like we're very strong in the help side for the integrated.", "We're very good at the payment facilitator model with ProPay. As I mentioned we've now, through ProPay, moved into Australia and had a very good just 30 or 45 days coming out of the shoot there.", "On several occasions in the past few quarters, we've talked about some of our FI growth that we picked up by signing banks and bringing in additional branch distribution.", "I think the other thing to talk about here from winning is Philip's onboard. Philip has built out a wonderful team. And even just prior to that, we've got a very robust product road map in our Merchant segment.", "It's improving our gateway capabilities, enhancing our analytics and insight capabilities for our customers. So all in all, we feel good, as Paul indicated, with our sequential quarter improvement with our Merchant revenue growth.", "Timothy Willi", "Great. And then my follow up was on card issuing. I know you talked about the value-add products, security and things of that nature. I guess, as we move down the path of the mobile wallets and the omnichannel, can you just talk a bit about how you think about the revenue opportunity as we move more into the digital world and the banks get more aggressive around their own, I guess, wallet aspirations as well as maybe the telco-type wallets, et cetera?", "Is it turning out to be the revenue opportunity that may be bigger than you would've thought to help banks with the credit card and the digital experience, or trailing or just any thoughts you might have around there as that evolves.", "Troy Woods", "Well, I'll certainly start that one, and Paul may have something to add back on the card issuing side, Tim. But again, a couple of points. One, I think TSYS has been at the front of the line every time to help our customers enable digital, if you will, mobile payments, from things like Apple Pay and Android Pay and support. All of those have been done since day one.", "Number two, I think when we talk about some of the product innovation that we're focusing on, digital is a very big piece of it. We talked about that quite a bit at the Investor Day in New York, and we talked about our primary focuses in issuing.", "One of those primary focuses is around the digital experience, so we're building out that digital platform. I think with all that said, though, time will only tell, Tim, because we're not seeing a lot of activity coming through the mobile devices for payments at the point of transaction.", "I know that will improve, I'm sure, over time, but here we are 1.5 years in, and we're just not seeing significant activity through mobile devices.", "Paul Todd", "I think the only thing I might add just as it relates to the strategic positioning of the Issuing business would be the - going back to the comments that Troy made in the prepared remarks around the partnerships, and the partnerships that we've talked about here today, 2 of which, both Featurespace and Argos.", "And so you will see us do more of those type partnerships in the innovative areas to enhance kind of the competitive offering that we have in Issuing.", "Timothy Willi", "Great. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Please go ahead.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Thanks. Good quarter, guys. Well, let me start with a question on AOF growth, particularly consumer accounts on file was quite solid. Could you sort of break down the sources of the growth in new clients versus sort of same-store sales type of growth? And is it - do you consider this level of growth sustainable going forward? If you could answer that.", "Troy Woods", "Yes, Ashwin. Thank you. Troy. A couple of points. One, I think we're on the sixth quarter where we've seen in the area of around 10 million accounts added on a sequential basis during the quarter on the consumer side of the business. So that has been extremely healthy now for 1.5 years, number one.", "Number two, I did not provide a number, but I did indicate as a part of that consumer growth during the quarter was a co-brand conversion that we did during the quarter. Number three, about sustainability, it's been 1.5 years. It's been 6 straight quarters of circa 10 million accounts a quarter added organically by our customers.", "Clearly, we've all seen some of the recent uptick in delinquencies, uptick in charge-off rates, uptick by most issuers and their provision for loan losses, and who only knows what some of the recent breach activity may do for new accounts as well. So it's very difficult, as we sit here this early into the fourth quarter to talk about sustainability.", "But so far, in talking to our customers, everything into our guidance, obviously, we'll give more color on '18 and beyond when we give '18 guidance. But right now, it's an extremely healthy growth visibility, and the pipeline of inorganic or portfolio and/or conversion looks healthy as well.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Got it. And for my follow up, I know you're not going to go towards a 2018 guidance. But based on the comments you already made on the call about NetSpend and about the Issuer business, just on a mathematical perspective, if I kind of overlay the trajectory that you have into next year, it would seem to exceed your sort of annual - your typical annual initial guidance, particularly in terms of margin expansion and then a higher EPS growth would follow.", "Could you maybe sort of take that up? Not asking for guidance, but can you take that up and kind of tell me why or under what circumstances that logic might be wrong?", "Troy Woods", "Well, Ashwin, I'll start off, and Troy may want to add, but if you think about what we talked about at Investor Day and you go to those growth rates by segment, and so obviously, we talked about those being longer-term growth targets, not specifically for 2018.", "But if you take those growth targets, 5% to 7% for issuing, 7% to 9% for merchant and 6% to 8% for the NetSpend business, obviously, right at the start, NetSpend kind of comes off because of the CFPB impact. And obviously, we don't know exactly how that plays out, but we're planning as if it plays out the way it's out there right now.", "And as it relates to the other businesses, we really haven't provided any specific 2018 commentary. As it relates to margin, we talked about over that horizon being a 25 to 50 basis points of annual adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. We've built this business kind of net of any kind of onetime items to have annual margin expansion.", "And so certainly from an issuing standpoint, we're expecting to expand the margin in our issuing segment, 2018. We're expecting to expand the margin overall. And so that's the way this engine's built is to have annual margin expansion.", "Certainly, you have things that can kind of play in on that on any one year, but the investments we're making, have all that baked in, the pluses and minuses to be able to have kind of annual margin expansion. So I think those would be my comments. Troy, you may want to add but...", "Troy Woods", "No, I really wouldn't have much to add. Obviously, Ashwin, the wildcard's still in 2018, of course, and our NetSpend segment, we'll be able to see CFPB impact and where all of that goes.", "And we've given a lot of numbers on that as well as the success of these 2 very large products that we've talked about for the last several quarters, DDA and Small Business. And beyond that, I think Paul has hit the center cut of the target, and we'll certainly give you a lot more color on that in January.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Okay. Thank you, guys. Congratulations.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Dan Dolev with Instinet. Please go ahead.", "Dan Dolev", "Hi. Thank you. Great quarter. Congrats.", "Paul Todd", "Hi, Dan.", "Dan Dolev", "Thank you. Can you make a quick comment on the Issuer solutions? I don't know if someone already asked about it, but growth decelerated a little bit. I believe, compares were a little easier last year. Maybe something on - just on the - maybe the de-conversion impact, or any light you can shed on that would be great. And I have a follow up.", "Paul Todd", "Sure, Dan, and you're exactly right. What happened in the third quarter, is we just had some comparative pressure on some of the Prepaid processing that's diminished. So if you've kind of backed that out and put that on a neutralized basis, we actually would've had sequential quarter improvement.", "But the 5.8% constant currency growth rate is a strong one, but that's the big issue between the sequential quarters that you're asking about.", "Dan Dolev", "Got it. And then I kind of have to ask this question because I've been getting a lot of calls. You had a - this is for Troy. You had a pretty big departure in September. We've been getting a lot of calls on this. Can you maybe shed some light on succession and kind of what is going on inside? That would be great. Thank you.", "Troy Woods", "Well, thank you, Dan. I'm not sure there's really a whole lot more I can add to it, Dan. As I indicated previously that the departure you're making reference to, of course, was our President and COO, and those were very amicable and mutual decisions to go our separate ways.", "Sometimes, these things just don't work out and the chemistry doesn't play out, but we're very appreciative of the contributions that were made. I think as far as that position you ask, look, I was President of the company for 10 or 11 years prior to assuming the role of CEO. I kept the role of President for at least another 1.5 years after that and relinquished it maybe for 15 months, and now, I've reassumed that title as well. So that's not an issue for this company in any shape, form or fashion.", "We're really not on a time line or a schedule. The Board has the ultimate call about succession planning, of course, with a lot of inputs from me and management. And we certainly review that a lot with the Board. And so I think we'll make those decisions when we need to and when we're ready. Beyond that, I don't think there's really a lot that I could add to it.", "Dan Dolev", "Thank you very much. Congrats again on a great quarter.", "Troy Woods", "Thank you, Dan.", "Operator", "The next question comes from George Mihalos with Cowen. Please go ahead.", "Georgios Mihalos", "Hey, guys congrats on the quarter as well. Just wanted to circle back to the accounts on file, I guess, the Issuer Solutions Segment broadly. Troy and Paul, should we be thinking that ex the private label conversion that's come on board this sort of $10 million or so sequential rate of growth in cards is sustainable going forward?", "And just given the uptick that you've had, should we not expect to see an acceleration in the organic rate of growth for the segment above 6% over the near term?", "Troy Woods", "Thank you, George. Appreciate your comments. On the traditional accounts on file, a couple of points again. I think I addressed most of that a minute ago, but it was not a private label conversion. It was a co-brand conversion, by the way, number one. As far as sustainability, again, I don't know how much more I can add to it.", "We've seen through our customers 6 straight quarters of approximately 10 million accounts per quarter added to the file. I mentioned obviously some upticks that I mentioned earlier around delinquencies and charge-offs and provision for loan losses that we've seen reported by some of the big issuing banks. And whether that will pull back some on the issuance of new accounts, I think time will only tell.", "Again, as I said a minute ago, our conversations with our largest customers seem to indicate that the trend is still out there. And whether it's in that range of 10 million a quarter, I just think it's too early to handicap.", "We've had six great quarters of doing that, but I think it's just a little bit early to call that one out. I don't know if you've got anything to add to that, Paul, at all. Okay. George, does that answer your question? Or did I miss it? Or...", "Georgios Mihalos", "Yes - no, no, no, that's fine. Just related to that then, given that you have had that AOF growth coming in this quarter, should we expect the overall rate of revenue growth for issuer solutions broadly to maybe accelerate a little bit, fourth quarter going into early '18?", "Paul Todd", "No, George. On that question, I would say no to that. I just commented on the pressure that we have on this prepaid processing piece. It's not necessarily tied to the question you had about account-on-file growth, but it is providing us comparative pressure in our fourth quarter just like it did in our third quarter.", "And so we've got that playing as a headwind. And then we've got some other things in play, both on the positive and negative side as we move forward, so I wouldn't make that step to where you were going there.", "Georgios Mihalos", "Okay, appreciate that. And just a quick follow up as you think of sort of the strategy around the business. Obviously, you've got a strong Issuer business. You've got a strengthening Merchant business.", "But just given the changing nature of merchant acquiring, a lot more of it coming in from the integrated channel, ISVs. You mentioned payment facilitators. Do you think there's still the same sort of halo effect around the 2 businesses, meaning that the Issuer segment or the Merchant segment are contributors to kind of cross-sells between the 2 segments?", "Troy Woods", "Thank you, George. I think we've indicated, even going back to Investor Day, that I would say I would not give ourselves an A+ grade in what we've been able to deliver to the market on cross-selling across these three segments. Certain aspects of what we've been able to do have been better than others.", "We've given examples of that, for instance, in our Small Business product rollout with - at NetSpend that we're coordinating with ProPay for the dongle to allow those small businesses to accept payments and some other things like that.", "We've had some success in working with the issuing side to try to get traction on the FI side for Merchant. I think that was the question. If I missed part of it, let me know.", "Paul Todd", "And I think I can add, too, just as it relates to some of the investments that we're making here, specifically as it relates to data lake and some of the other things that we're doing on the technology side and the product side, specifically, as it relates to fraud products, we're seeing cross-segment utilization of those products on kind of a go-forward basis.", "So kind of layering on top of Troy's comments around the pro-growth aspects, there's also kind of a product/technology aspect that we're executing with on a cross-segment basis as well.", "Georgios Mihalos", "Appreciate the color, guys.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird. Please go ahead.", "Dave Koning", "Yes. Hey, guys. Thanks. I guess, first of all, just on the Issuer segment, progress is good. And I guess, on Capital One, do you expect the 5% to 7% growth to keep going even after that renewal? Like it might have an impact, but you can still be in that range?", "And then I just wanted to call out FX. For the first time in many quarters, it's actually going to be like a 1% tailwind to that segment in Q4, I believe. So just, I guess, those 2 things on that segment first.", "Troy Woods", "Yes, David. I'll take that, and Paul can certainly add to it. One, as I indicated, we do have the renewal that we will get done this quarter that we've talked about, and that will have some impact, number one.", "And number two, we're still saying 5% to 7%, of course, is our range for the Issuing segment for 2017. And beyond that, we just haven't gone there yet.", "Paul Todd", "Yes. No, that's right. And just 2 comments. One, obviously, the Capital One renewal does provide pressure for us in 2018. So until you anniversary that renewal, we certainly will have some pressure related to that big customer.", "As it relates to FX, we will potentially see some benefit there. I think the 1%'s a little bit rich on what that tailwind would look like. But now that we've anniversaried Brexit, the constant currency and reported are much tighter in line just like we saw this quarter, and we're expecting a tight correlation in the fourth quarter as well.", "Dave Koning", "Okay, great. And just my one follow up, so the CPAY, I think you're going to buy that out in Q1. What would be the impact? Is it even material - I just can't remember, to, I guess, the Merchant segment when you buy that out?", "Paul Todd", "Yes. It wouldn't be anything material that I'd call out. It's really, I think, kind of a 2Q expectation around that. We consolidate that today, and so you're just backing out kind of the minority interest piece. So we're picking that up at kind of the consolidated level, so it isn't anything that I would call out as being significant. We - obviously, we'll have the cash outflow in the second quarter related to it, but outside of that, it's nothing I would comment on.", "Dave Koning", "Okay. Great. Well, thanks. Nice job.", "Paul Todd", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from James Friedman with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.", "James Friedman", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. It's Jamie at Susquehanna. I'll just ask two up front. I don't think anyone asked you yet, Paul, about the contribution from CUP Data, which has been a star portfolio for you. So any commentary on the trajectory going forward there? That's the first one.", "And then, Troy, I was just wondering about your comment about value-added services. On the Issuer side, it sounds like - and you had talked about this at the Analyst Day with the pilots. It sounds like you're making good progress there, especially with fraud and risk management that you had called out.", "How meaningful could this be? In past years, I think it was a while ago, it was a very significant portion of Issuer revenue. Are we going to return to that trajectory? So the first on CUP and the second on value-added services. Thank you.", "Paul Todd", "Yes. So I'll take the first one, Jamie, and Troy can take the second one. On CUP, as I've commented before, we're still expecting that CUP line to increase in that 40% to 50% range. You did see it pull down a little bit this quarter on a sequential quarter basis between 1Q, 2Q.", "And now, 3Q and 4Q are expected to be relatively in the same range, so this is just kind of normal kind of seasonality. So 40% to 50% is still the growth rate range for CUP. And as we've said, CUP continues to be just a fantastic growth story in itself, but also then a nice additive piece of growth to our overall TSYS mix.", "Troy Woods", "And I'll add to that, Jamie, on the value-added on the Issuing side, a couple of points, I guess, to make. You're right. We did talk about it at length at Investor Day, and we've indicated and I don't think there's any doubt that expanding our product set in innovation and Issuer solutions is a big piece of our ability to continue to grow that section.", "And we also further said that we're primarily focusing in three areas: fraud and risk and, of course, we talked this quarter about rolling out the TSYS Foresight Score, the new machine learning transaction fraud capability.", "Data and analytics is our second big focus. And we've also, again, went out with a partnership with Argos there to roll out our new best-in-class analytics platform. And the third piece, of course, I mentioned earlier was digital experiences.", "I think what's important when we combined the 2 sections, we now report on value-added revenue as a percent of our overall revenue and value-added products, and that's 19 - a little over 19% for the third quarter.", "So up slightly sequentially over the second quarter. And clearly, our goal is to continue to grow that. We have made significant investment in product for the issuer segment, both in people - Paul mentioned some of the things around data lake and some of the APIs.", "We've built over 200 APIs in the issuing segment, open APIs. So we continue to invest. It's going to continue to be a very big piece of our growth story for issuing.", "James Friedman", "That's fascinating. I appreciate the color. Thank you.", "Troy Woods", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens. Please go ahead.", "Brett Huff", "Good afternoon, Troy, Paul and Shawn. Congrats on a nice quarter.", "Troy Woods", "Hi, Brett.", "Brett Huff", "A couple of quick questions, kind of - a little bit of the nuances on things that have already been asked. Can you just - I want to make sure that I got the contribution from the co-brand cards that you called out. I know we've had kind of 10, 10, 10 organic sequential growth in traditional accounts on file.", "Can you be any more specific on how big that portfolio was? I mean - or can you even just say that the organic was at least 10 sequential here in the 3Q?", "Troy Woods", "Yes, Brett. Really can't add any more to that. I think you can look at the numbers and see for yourself. But no, we can't give you that number.", "Brett Huff", "Okay. That's helpful. And then the second question follow up is on - you talked a little bit about margin expansion thoughts in 2018. I think you said total company, you're kind of standing on the 25 to 50 basis points that you outlined at the Analyst Day for kind of the long term. In terms of the puts and takes that we need to make sure that we're aware of, you've called out Capital One, and we can make guesses ourselves on that.", "The DDA products, I don't know if you can comment on whether or not you think that will be a net add or a net headwind on margin by the time we get to '18. Maybe comps on the Issuer side. Will that cause any difficulty in margin? Anything else, Paul, that we need to know about as we think about '18?", "Paul Todd", "Brett, there wouldn't be anything - the ones you've identified there, the Capital One as well as the CFPB are the 2 biggest ones that I would highlight. There wouldn't be anything else. I mean, there's puts and takes.", "As I've said earlier, we've got investments we're making, but we're also making some spend that's going to save us on the expense base later on. So there wouldn't be anything else that I would comment on this point.", "Obviously, we'll give a lot more color on it as it relates specifically to 2018 consolidated and segment in January with our guidance.", "Brett Huff", "Great. That's all I needed. Thanks, guys.", "Paul Todd", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Jim Schneider", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you can maybe just follow up on the Capital One commentary you made, understanding that any new renewal of that size is going to have some pricing pressure attached to it, but can you give us a sense where you stand in the contract negotiations today? Is that any more or less than what you kind of expected heading into the beginning of this year?", "Troy Woods", "Hey, Jim, Troy. No, not really. Nothing else to add. Our plan all along was to get it done in the third quarter. We mutually agreed that we'd put a lot of our focus on this co-brand conversion that we completed toward the end of the third quarter.", "We see absolutely no issues to getting it done this quarter. And again, it's all baked into our guidance and our numbers, and we see no issues whatsoever.", "Jim Schneider", "That's helpful. And maybe just a bit of a follow up on the NetSpend business. Obviously, very strong performance there kind of across the board. Maybe if you can kind of give us an update, especially on the margin side in that business. You previously talked many times about the CFPB impact and being able to offset about half that impact with new initiatives and new products, et cetera.", "Can you maybe give us any kind of update on that? It seems like the DDA fraud seems to be doing well, and you're doing well kind of on an operational level, too. So maybe, do you think you can do any better than that in terms of the half of the impact offset as we head into '18?", "Paul Todd", "So Jim, this is Paul. I think that it's just too early to comment on anything further as it relates to CFPB, just - and the impact there. As we've always done on that, we've been kind of very transparent once we have finality of what those impacts look like. We are pleased, as Troy said, with the initial DDA success that we're having, but it's too early to comment on anything there until we have some certainty.", "Jim Schneider", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The last question today comes from Tom McCrohan with Mizuho. Please go ahead.", "Tom McCrohan", "Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. It's Tom McCrohan with Mizuho, and two quick questions. On the Issuer segment, what was the growth rate in Value-added Services revenue this quarter?", "Paul Todd", "Yes, on a constant currency basis, it was 9.4%.", "Tom McCrohan", "Great. So a little acceleration from Q2, I guess, from some of these new products, the fraud products. And in terms of investment spending, which you've talked about last quarter. You're kind of reminding us again this quarter.", "And is there any way to kind of quantify the impact on the investment spending this quarter on margins? And then going into Q4, is the absolute dollar of investment spending going up in Q4? Or is it just kind of staying the same as we go into the end of the year?", "Paul Todd", "Sure. So as it relates to the investment spending, yes, it is going up in the fourth quarter overall. And so if you think about it kind of at the segment level, obviously, NetSpend has the kind of biggest lift between 3Q and 4Q.", "If you go back to last year and you look, there's about a 460-basis-point decline in margin between 3Q and 4Q related to the enhanced investments as well as some of the product stuff we were doing.", "So just on kind of a standardized level, there'd be that kind of increased investment on NetSpend between 3Q and 4Q we've added on top of that this year related to some of the marketing spend, the CFPB rollout and the products that we're working on.", "So that would be the comment there. And we do have some added investment on the Issuing side that I've talked about as it relates to our people and some investments there, salary increases, severance, incentives, so kind of the bucket there.", "We have this Columbus, Ohio facility that's coming online, and then we have technology and product. I think the key point to all of that is, is we're managing all of that, where we are - if you kind of look at where we're landing from a guidance standpoint on margin expansion, we would see some margin expansion continued in 4Q related to Issuing with those investments being made.", "And so I also commented that we do expect the Issuing business to have some margin expansion in 2018. So those are the 2 biggest buckets that I would talk about, both on the Issuing side and on the NetSpend side. We do have some additional investments on the Merchant side, but those are the big buckets.", "Tom McCrohan", "Okay, Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Shawn Roberts for any closing remarks.", "Shawn Roberts", "Thank you, Anita. I'd like to thank everybody who participated on the call and listened in, and as always, feel free to give me a call. I'll be here for any questions that you have. Thank you very much and hope to see you at an Investor Conference or [indiscernible] Thank you.", "Operator", "This conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Shawn Roberts, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Shawn Roberts", "Thank you, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. We'll begin this evening\u2019s call with opening comments by TSYS's Chairman, President and CEO, Troy Woods, followed by TSYS\u2019s CFO, Paul Todd, who is going to review the fourth quarter and full year 2017 highlights, as well as the consolidated financials.", "Troy and Paul will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of this presentation as well as our Earnings Release and supplemental schedules are available on our website at investors.tsys.com.", "After their prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open the call up for Q&A. I will remind everyone participating in the Q&A that we will have an opportunity to ask one question and one follow up that Andrea will manage.", "I\u2019ll now call your attention to the fact that we\u2019ll be making some forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS\u2019s actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in TSYS\u2019s reports filed with the SEC including its 2016 annual report on Form 10-K.", "We reconcile those measures to GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation and then the supplemental schedules to the press release.", "At this point, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Troy Woods.", "Troy Woods", "Thank you, Shawn. Good afternoon and Happy New Year.", "TSYS is celebrating its 35th anniversary this month as a public company and we will continue to celebrate this significant milestone event throughout the year. It has been a very exciting and rewarding 35 years in business and our 36th year has already gotten off to a great start.", "Just 12 days ago we closed our acquisition of Cayan, a payment technology company focused on integrated payment solutions and merchant acquiring. We\u2019ll provide additional details about Cayan later when we discuss our Merchant segment.", "I would like to congratulate and thank the TSYS team members across our global footprint for delivering an exceptional performance for the fourth quarter resulting in a very strong finish to 2017. Some highlights across the organization for the fourth quarter included record setting transactions, authorizations and volumes, excellent operational performance during the holiday shopping period, accelerating our share repurchase activity by purchasing 3,450,000 shares of stock. Over the last four years, we have returned over $1 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. And, of course, the announcement on December 18 of our agreement to acquire Cayan.", "For the full year 2017, we increased our adjusted diluted EPS by 20%. We increased our adjusted operating margin by 123 basis points to 29.4%. And this is the third straight year of year-over-year margin expansion.", "We increased the quarterly dividend by 30% from $0.10 to $0.13 per share, lowered our debt leverage ratio from 3.23 times to 2.67 times. And all of this resulted in a total shareholder return of 62% for the year.", "Almost by any measure, 2017 was an exceptional year for our company and provides excellent momentum moving into 2018. I will address some highlights within our three segments. And Paul will provide additional details, and our financial guidance for 2018.", "First, in Issuer Solutions. Our customer base continues to be strong and steady. During 2017, our issuer customers added more than 50 million total accounts to our platforms and our issuer platforms processed more than 21 billion transactions.", "We also set new records for net revenue at $1.595 billion and for traditional accounts on file at $572 million. We were also very pleased to achieve a 6.2% year-over-year net revenue growth rate on a constant currency basis.", "In the fourth quarter, we announced the extension of our long-term relationship with Capital One, for both their Consumer and Commercial portfolios. For all of 2017, we completed a total of 17 contract renewals.", "During the quarter we signed several new contracts including one with a leading U.K. retailer, Sainbury's, which also included an extension of the current portfolio of Argus Financial Services.", "Finally, I want to provide three key updates related to our product development initiatives in our Issuer segment. First, as we all know, open banking is rapidly becoming a reality. One of the first steps in addressing this reality at TSYS is opening up the TSYS ecosystem with the introduction of our new developers portal that will provide access to our Issuing processing platforms and products. Our new portal is called TSYS Developers, which we expect to roll-out to our clients later this quarter.", "This new portal will make it easier and more efficient for our clients to access and integrate to TSYS products and platforms, as well as for them to develop innovative new products and services with unique functionality to address their customer needs. This is a very important step forward in our business strategy, and integral to the execution of our product road maps.", "Second, we have made significant progress toward delivering a new data management and analytic solution with product availability scheduled for early second quarter. This solution delivered with our partner, Argus, will help our clients maximize the value of data by transforming it into insightful information and analysis that will help them manage their business, mitigate risk and capitalize on their financial objectives.", "Finally, we continue to see positive Commercial momentum with our other product offerings. Of particular note in the fourth quarter, we obtained commitments from three additional clients to adopt our TSYS customer service product or TCS.", "TCS is our customer engagement platform that optimizes the interactions between our clients\u2019 team members and their card holders. This product will integrate and work hand-in-hand with our new digital engagement platform now under development. This will allow us to offer a fully integrated end-to-end omni-channel client experience.", "All of these product offerings indicate that our product teams are working diligently on delivering innovative new products for our customers and I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with their progress. All in all, it was an excellent fourth quarter and year for the Issuer segment that provides us with solid momentum as we move into 2018.", "Now let\u2019s turn to our Merchant segment. As I mentioned earlier, we were delighted to complete the acquisition of Cayan on January the 11, just 24 days from our initial announcement. This took a lot of hard work and focus by many, and I\u2019m very proud of their dedication to get this done. We believe the acquisition of Cayan is a game changer for TSYS.", "It strategically complements our Merchant goal, to become a leading technology payments provider to small and medium sized businesses in the United States. It\u2019s also a great opportunity to bring more innovative products to our broad customer base. The more time we spend with Henry and his very talented team, the more impressed we are and we look forward to working with them all year.", "This Friday will mark the second anniversary of the announcement of our acquisition of TransFirst, the largest acquisition in TSYS\u2019s history that doubled the size of our merchant business. We continue to be extremely pleased with our TransFirst integration efforts and what this expanded portfolio has meant to our merchant business. In fact, we recently exceeded our year two synergy targets and have already achieved our year three goal of $25 million in synergies.", "We are wrapping up that integration effort now and moving right into the Cayan integration, focusing first on integrating their team members into the broader TSYS organization.", "In terms of business performance, the merchant segment ended the year with a margin of 35.5% or 124 basis points higher than 2016. During the fourth quarter, the merchant segment set another record for net revenue and strong volume growth of 13%.", "As I referenced last quarter, we expected net revenue growth to improve sequentially in the fourth quarter as it did in each of the prior quarters and it did. Our top line merchant revenue growth came in at 11.3% with direct growing over 13% and indirect over 2%.", "Overall, we could not be more pleased with the progress of the Merchant segment and look forward to a very successful 2018. And finally, turning to NetSpend. The fourth quarter represented a strong finish to a very good year. NetSpend delivered double-digit growth in gross dollar volume, debit active cards, revenue and adjusted segment operating income, not only in the fourth quarter, but also for the full year 2017.", "In the fourth quarter, the NetSpend team signed contract extensions for several significant partnership agreements. A one-year extension with Intuit for QuickBooks who offers NetSpend accounts to users of their accounting software.", "A two-year extension with Liberty Tax, one of our largest tax partners. And two of our larger partners in the alternative financial services space, Advance America and Check `n Go, who signed three and four-year extensions respectively.", "We value the long-standing relationships we have with each of these companies and the trust they have in us to provide an outstanding experience to our customers.", "In our commercial prepay channel, we signed new partnership deals every quarter, some that are relatively small and others that are larger. But all of which are critical to our mission to empower consumers as well as the ongoing growth of our business.", "One of the almost 100 new contracts we signed in the fourth quarter was a large franchisee of Pizza Hut, Denny\u2019s and Burger King who plan to make NetSpend payroll accounts available to employees across the eight states in which they operate.", "I would like to comment briefly on the announcement in December that the CFPB expects to extend the effective date of the prepaid rule to allow additional time for implementation. Our team, along with many others, worked very hard to effect this change and we certainly welcome the announcement, particularly given that changes to certain aspects of the rule were still pending.", "A firm new effective date has not been issued by the CFPB and we expect to get clarification on this soon. For financial projection purposes, we are assuming a six-month delay until October 2018 as the new effective date. As you might expect, this is a sizable undertaking and we will continue to work diligently to implement the new rules when they become effective.", "Before I leave NetSpend, I wanted to acknowledge Chuck Harris who is joining us today for his last TSYS earnings call. Chuck has been very instrumental in growing and expanding NetSpend and delivering double-digit revenue growth every year since he joined the company. He will undoubtedly be missed by all of us but we know he will be a great addition to the LongHorn team. Chuck, we wish you all the best.", "Before I turn it over to Paul, I wanted to make a few comments about the recently enacted tax reform legislation. We were very supportive of this legislation as it will create a more level global playing field, boost the U.S. economy, create jobs and provide TSYS with investment opportunities. One such opportunity was the special one-time bonuses we recently paid to over 10,000 team members around the globe.", "We are very proud of the hard work and dedication of our team members and felt that it was important that they be rewarded. In addition to these bonuses, we will be accelerating thoughtful and sustainable investments as a direct result of tax reform to benefit team members, customers and shareholders over the long term.", "With continued strong execution, rising consumer confidence, economic growth and the health of the financial sector, we see great opportunities to continue to deliver exceptional results in 2018 and beyond. ", "I\u2019ll now ask Paul to share additional detailed financial information about the quarter, the year and review our guidance for 2018. Paul?", "Paul Todd", "Thank you, Troy.", "And I want to build on your comments on how our fourth quarter performance capstones a fantastic year for TSYS and positions us well for a strong 2018. Now to cover our consolidated and segment performance and our 2018 outlook, which includes the adoption of ASC 606, which is referenced in our press release, let\u2019s turn to Slide 6.", "For the fourth quarter, our total revenue was up 12.5% with net revenue up a strong 10.8%. Full year 2017 total revenues increased 18.2% from 2016, with net revenue up 11.8%. The fourth quarter 10.8% net revenue growth accelerated from the 8% net revenue growth we saw in 3Q and to 6.2% net revenue growth we saw in 2Q, clearly showing a sequential quarter, all organic accelerating net revenue growth story. GAAP diluted EPS was $1.31 for the quarter, and non-GAAP quarterly adjusted diluted EPS was $0.82, an increase of 16.5% from 4Q last year.", "As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, TSYS recognized in the fourth quarter a reduction in our 2017 tax expense of approximately $136 million from the estimated impact of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the new foreign tax impacts, as well as other estimated impacts resulting from the new law. This benefit is excluded from our adjusted diluted EPS results for 2017.", "For 2018, TSYS expects the reduction in the corporate tax rate will result in an effective rate for our company in the range of 21% to 23%. The estimated impacts from the tax law may be refined in the future as additional guidance and interpretations are available.", "Our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA grew by 10% for the quarter to $293.3 million. As has been in the press, and Troy mentioned, we did incur approximately $10 million of expenses in 4Q related to special $1,000 bonuses for team members. This reduced our 4Q adjusted diluted EPS growth rate by 513 basis points and our 4Q adjusted EBITDA growth rate by 380 basis points. ", "We were pleased to be in a position to make such an investment in our team members, and in 2018 we plan to expand upon this $10 million reinvestment to allow for acceleration of investments for the benefit of our team members in the form of compensation, for the benefit of our customers in the form of accelerated investments in our product and innovation areas and for the benefit of our shareholders as we allow the cash benefits from the new tax law to enable us to accelerate our deleveraging and share repurchase activity.", "On the consolidated margin front, our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was a strong 33.7%, bringing our full year margin to 35.2%, up 101 basis points and right in line with the 100 basis points of margin expansion that we expected for the year and discussed on our last call. This roughly 100 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion builds on the multiyear track record of substantial annual adjusted EBITDA margin expansion we have previously delivered.", "For 2018, we expect our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin to expand in the 25 to 50 basis point range, consistent with the range we provided in our last Investor Day, and inclusive of the impacts from the accelerated investments we\u2019re making in the business, the ASC 606 adoption and the Cayan acquisition.", "On free cash flow, our 4Q free cash flow was $117.8 million and our full year free cash flow was $660.5 million, slightly above the $610 million to $640 million expectation we discussed on our last call. As we look at 2018, we would expect our free cash flow to be between $770 million to $800 million, inclusive of the cash tax benefit from the tax cuts and Job Act.", "On the capital front, we ramped up or our share repurchase activity in the quarter with the repurchase of 3.45 million shares for $255 million. This brought our total repurchase activity for 2017 to 3.85 million shares for $282.6 million.", "On the capital side for 2018, due to the refinancing of our bonds due in June of 2018, the added debt related to our Cayan acquisition and other capital related activities, we expect our 2018 calendar year interest expense to be approximately $45 million to $50 million higher than in 2017.", "I will note that the previously communicated slightly accretive Cayan acquisition related commentary was inclusive of this additional interest expense. We will continue to evaluate our capital structure in 2018 for optimization and flexibility and remain committed to our investment grade rating.", "I said last quarter that this was a pivotal one for the company in terms of growth, margin and buyback activity, and this quarter provides further evidence that those characteristics strengthening to allow for a fantastic finish to the year for the company.", "Now I will move to our segment results, starting with the Issuer segment on Slide 8. First, on growth. Segment net revenue grew 8.8% for the quarter on a reported basis and 7.3% on a constant currency basis. This was our highest growth quarter for the year and brought our full year reported growth to 5.2%, and our constant currency growth to 6.2%. Squarely in the middle of the 5% to 7% constant currency growth rate expectation that we had at the beginning of the year.", "As has been the case for several quarters, we saw good growth in both volume and non-volume net revenue for the segment, with volume based net revenue up 7.6% for the quarter and non-volume based net revenue up 10%.", "Next on margins. 4Q adjusted segment operating margin increased 37 basis points from prior year to 35.2%, and allowed for us to achieve a full year margin of 36%, up 138 basis points from prior year and consistent with the 125 plus basis points of margin expansion we had communicated on our last call. The margin expansion story for issuing is impressing as this is the third straight year of over 100 basis points of margin expansion for the segment.", "Finally, on outlook for the segment for 2018. We expect net revenue to organically grow in the 5% to 7% constant currency growth rate range for the year. On a reported basis, we also expect net revenue to grow in the 5% to 7% range after factoring in ASC 606 adoption and anticipated currency impacts, but would mention that the headwinds from the approximately 50 basis points impact of ASC 606 adoption, coupled with the Capital One renewal pushes us down in this range.", "On the margin front, we expect to expand margins in this segment slightly in 2018, inclusive of the additional investments we are planning to make that I commented on earlier. Overall for issuing, it was a great quarter for net revenue growth and margin expansion. And this propelled us to an even higher level of yearly performance for this segment, building upon the multiyear track record of revenue growth with margin expansion we have delivered in the past.", "Now onto Slide 9 and our Merchant segment. First, on growth. Net revenue grew a strong 11.3% for the quarter to $282.7 million. Like with our issuing segment, this was the highest organic net revenue growth quarter we had this year with our direct business growing at over 13% rate, while our indirect business grew about 2%, yielding the 11.3% growth for the segment.", "This quarter\u2019s growth propelled our overall reported net revenue growth for the year to 22.8% and our organic growth rate for the last three quarters is right in the middle of the 7% to 9% range we had discussed on our last call.", "As has been the case all year, our integrated channel is the primary driver in our growth, continuing in the strong double-digit growth range. We were also pleased with the positive impact on the indirect side.", "Next, on margin. Our adjusted segment operating margin was at 33.6% for the quarter, and the full-year margin of 35.5% is in line with the margin expectations we discussed on the last call.", "Finally, on outlook. For 2018, this segment has a few moving parts with the impact of the adoption of ASC 606 and the inclusion of the Cayan acquisition. We do expect this segment to grow organic net revenue in the 7% to 9% growth range for the year, with expanding margins before the impacts of ASC 606 and Cayan.", "Including these impacts, we expect reported net revenue to grow in the 20% to 22% range, with margin expansion of approximately 50 basis points. Of the roughly $62 million to $69 million of consolidated net revenue negative impact related to the adoption of ASC 606, we expect that approximately $50 million of it will be attributable to the Merchant segment.", "Now onto NetSpend on Slide 10. First on growth. The key highlight for this segment again this quarter is the better-than-expected organic net revenue growth of 16.1%, which maintains the acceleration we saw in the third quarter. For the year, net revenue grew 12.6%, which represents the 12th year in a row that NetSpend delivered double-digit revenue growth.", "Fourth quarter revenue growth was strong across all four of our sales channels, the result of several factors including growth in Gross Dollar Volume of 15.2% and growth in total debit active cards of 14.2%. ", "We were pleased to exit the fourth quarter of 2017 with almost $5 million debit active cards with almost half of them on direct deposit. Direct deposit by cardholders continues to drive higher usage of NetSpend products, and Gross Dollar Volume for the year was the highest in NetSpend\u2019s history, exceeding $32 billion. Our added investments that we\u2019ve been making in NetSpend are clearly paying off in increased growth.", "Next on margin. 4Q 2017 adjusted segment operating margin of 20.8% is down slightly from the 21.7% in Q4 of 2016, as we increased our 4Q marketing investments, as I mentioned last quarter. Full year margin increased 21 basis points to 24.4%. We are pleased to be able to expand the yearly margin while also reinvesting in the business.", "Finally, on outlook for NetSpend. Given the December statement by the CFPB that the bureau expects to further extend the effective date of the 2016 prepaid rule to allow for addition implementation time, we are assuming in our outlook for 2018 that the effective date of the final rule will extend six months beyond the current April 1, 2018, effective date. While this is not based on any unique knowledge or insight into the final effective date, we do believe making this assumption around the delay is prudent, given the bureau\u2019s statement. ", "Assuming a six-month delay of the CFPB final rule and based on our understanding of the current rule, which is also subject to change, we expect net revenue for the segment to grow in the 1% to 3% range, which includes headwinds from the loss of the TurboTax distribution relationship, as well as year-over-year negative assumed impact from the CFPB rule and also includes over 100 basis points of headwind due to the adoption of ASC 606.", "Adjusting for these items, our organic net revenue growth rate is in line with the 6% to 8% longer term growth rate we highlighted at our last Investor Day. On the margin front, our expectations are for margins to be in the 20% to 22% range, reflecting year-over-year pressure related to our large partner renewal last year, as well as expected CFPB impacts, among other items.", "Now I want to move to our full year consolidated guidance starting on page 13. Before I get into the numbers, I want to briefly discuss the three key elements that sit on top of the organic expectations that we have for 2018. First is the adoption of ASC 606, which as we highlighted in our press release, reduces our total revenues by $1.575 billion to $1.6 billion primarily as the result of gross versus net presentation of interchange and payment network fees. ", "In 2018, these fees collected on behalf of the payment networks and card issuers will be presented net of the amounts paid to them as opposed to the gross presentation for certain of these fees in 2017. We also estimate the adoption of the standard will reduce our net revenue in the $62 million to $69 million range and a $0.03 to $0.04 decline in both diluted and adjusted diluted EPS.", "The second major impact to our guidance is the impact relate to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to our effective tax rate as I mentioned earlier. Based on our current estimations, we estimate that our effective tax rate for 2018 will be in the 21% to 23% range, down from the 32% to 33% effective range we estimated for 2017 that we communicated on our last call.", "Finally, we have the full year impact of the Cayan acquisition included, which as Troy mentioned earlier was closed on January 11. Given this as a backdrop, our 2018 outlook is as follows. We expect total revenue to be in the range of $3.85 billion to $3.95 billion, a decline of 20% to 22% for 2017, given the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. We expect net revenue to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.75 billion, a growth rate range of 7% to 10%.", "We expect GAAP EPS to be in the range of $2.85 to $2.95, a decline of 7% to 10% due to a combination of factors relating to the 4Q 2017 positive tax impacts, as well as 2018 Cayan acquisition-related expenses. And we expect our adjusted diluted EPS to be in the $4.10 to $4.20 range, a growth rate of 22% to 25% based on 184 million diluted shares outstanding.", "I will conclude with what I think are the key takeaways from today\u2019s call. First, is on the outstanding 2017 performance. We had across the board sequential quarter organic net revenue growth acceleration in each of our segments. Each of our segments exceeded their overall net revenue growth goals for the year while expanding margins. We have been talking about the power of the TSYS growth engine that has been built and the fourth quarter and year is just another example of this engine hitting on all cylinders.", "Second is on our 2018 outlook. While there are a lot of moving parts in our 2018 outlook, we are focused on the organic growth for 2018 that is augmented with our Cayan acquisition which builds on the successful year of organic net revenue growth we delivered in 2017. This performance in 2017 gives us a fantastic platform from which to deliver on our 2018 growth goals.", "The final comment I want to make is on capital allocation. Last quarter we highlighted the achievement of our multiyear deleveraging goal and some small buyback activity, but the fourth quarter allowed for us to resume our repurchase activity in a more robust way while still allowing for enough capacity to make our growth-enhancing Cayan acquisition.", "While we will be primarily focused again on deleveraging for the next several quarters, we are continuing to allocate our capital in what we believe are the best growth and value enhancing ways for our shareholders.", "We had a lot of exciting things happen in the fourth quarter and TSYS ended 2017 stronger than ever. We look forward to delivering against our 2018 goals and with that, we will open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Darrin Peller", "Nice job guys. Look, just want to start off on issuer processing side and then a quick follow up on the merchant side as well. I mean, the issuer processing clearly is performing well with regard to the sustainable trends. First of all [indiscernible] growth rate outlook have been, without the Capital One repricing, I guess? And then number two, just a little more backdrop into what you were saying on the TCS and what that means. What\u2019s happening in the business, is this type of mid to maybe even closer to upper single digit growth sustainable longer term?", "Paul Todd", "I\u2019ll take the first part of that question as it relates to the outlook and then Troy on the TCS. I think you were asking about the - maybe some of the signings that we\u2019ve had. We wouldn\u2019t break out the outlook piece just for the CapOne renewal. We wouldn\u2019t kind of get into that level of specificity. You're right, that we\u2019re extremely pleased with what we saw in the fourth quarter on our value-added products area, we saw an uptick in our managed and output services area, our loyalty area. So we did see, really, just kind of across the board positive growth in our issuing business. ", "As it relates to next year, I commented on what the impact, the headwind impacts, are with the roughly 50 basis points on the ASC 606 adoption and the CapOne renewals. So I just, I think, conclude by saying we couldn't be more pleased to kind of end the year and it positions us well for 2018. Troy, do you want to talk about the TCS piece?", "Troy Woods", "Yes. Not a whole lot extra to add, Darrin. As I indicated in my prepared remarks, we do have contracts for three additional customers to come onto the TCS platform. It gives us a great opportunity to expand our Managed Services capabilities when we have the TCS and Managed Services tied in together. And clearly we pick up additional fees. So really excited about the opportunities. We're really beginning to get some payback on all of these product capabilities we\u2019ve been talking about for the last, perhaps, year and a half. They\u2019re really coming to fruition in 2018.", "Darrin Peller", "And then just quickly on the Merchant side. I mean, the indirect side seems to inflect? Is that expected to continue with [indiscernible] I guess overall when you think about Cayan being included here, you're going to have some money to reinvest in the after tax, as you mentioned.", "Can you just give us a sense on [the spend] [ph] for that segment in terms of reinvestment there, given you now have Cayan? Do you have the full suite of what you need? Are there more to come, more kinds of deals like that to come? What do you want Merchant to be, really, adding to the business over the next few years?", "Paul Todd", "So I\u2019ll take the first part of that, and then Philip McHugh, you can take the second part on the future and the Cayan piece. As it relates to the indirect side, no, we had some good comparison with the fourth quarter comp there. So we got some additive growth there.", "We are pleased, and we\u2019ve had this now for a couple of quarters of eking out some growth there but it\u2019s still kind of a flat to a very low single digit growth. I wouldn\u2019t point to that being kind of a sequential quarter acceleration that would continue on the indirect side.", "And Philip can comment a little more on the investment side, but we are pleased to be in a position to be able to invest in this business. Obviously, the acquisition investment, but then also on the product side which we did see some benefit in our direct revenue increase related to some uptick on the product side. So, Philip, do you want to\u2026 ", "Philip McHugh", "Yes, on the product side, there\u2019s obviously been a lot of focus on that. We\u2019re incredibly strong on distribution and servicing. That\u2019s been our strength. And with the purchase of Cayan, we really start to complete the puzzle in having a strong and a full set on the product side.", "So, for our front end, Cayan will absolutely be our lead gateway. It\u2019s one of the best technologies in the market. It comes with a group of people as well that will accelerate our ability to get product out to the market. ", "So, for our front-end solutions or our software integrations, Cayan will be on the lead on that. We have some other great products like Payment Facilitator that are also growing well. That\u2019s where we'll focus our growth on the integrated side. We\u2019ll continue to make sure our boarding and servicing is very competitive and that our backend processing continues to be a market leader.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. Please go ahead.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Congratulations guys, pretty solid results here and happy New Year as well. My first question is the cadence of quarterly results in 2018, and if you could kind of lay that out, particularly since you mentioned the very high number of renewals and new contracts? And we kind of know how that ramps. There are costs in the initial part of the year. Plus, it looks like the tax season is a little bit potentially delayed, more so into 2Q than 1Q, at least the early part of it. So any help on the quarterly cadence would be great.", "Troy Woods", "Ashwin, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call out anything on kind of the cadence relative to the quarters. You are right. We typically have the seasonality in our various businesses that play themselves out, and those would still be at play. Obviously, we\u2019ve got some additional headwind on our NetSpend business this year from the tax season losing the TurboTax relationship.", "So, that would be some headwind I would call out to you this year from a seasonality standpoint that didn\u2019t exist last year. But outside of that, there wouldn\u2019t be anything that I would necessarily point out that\u2019s unique from either a customer standpoint or a business dynamic standpoint, as it relates to specific kind of quarter-to-quarter commentary.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "And, Paul, you had that interesting comment about open banking and, obviously APIs, and we know how strong that particular trend is. Could you perhaps expand on that? And from a competitiveness perspective, particularly as it results to the continued growth of value-add services, if you could help us with how TSYS is positioned into this year.", "Troy Woods", "Maybe a couple extra comments. We all agree that we think open banking is going to continue to get broader and broader. As I think I mentioned perhaps last quarter, we developed over 200 APIs in our Issuing segment. I think that\u2019s going to be critical to continue to open up our platforms to our end customers. I mentioned the TSYS developer portal that\u2019s coming on-board later this quarter that\u2019s going to allow not only us but our customers to get in and to be able to do those kind of things.", "And I think also, and we talked about this some in the past, when you think about PSD2 and what that\u2019s doing to competition and opening banking, opening up the banking side, we think that\u2019s going to create some opportunities for us as well. So, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve got anything else I really could add to it. Paul, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve got anything, but.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan Dolev of Instinet. Please go ahead.", "Dan Dolev", "Great quarter guys, congrats. Quick question on - two questions. First one on NetSpend. So, can you maybe quantify - there were a lot of moving parts. Can you quantify, if we kind of think about the prior way to think about NetSpend in terms of April and the new way, what\u2019s the delta in terms of revenue in EPS contribution for the year? And then I have a follow-up.", "Paul Todd", "Yes. So maybe this would be helpful as relates to kind of the parts I talked about in my prepared remarks of a year-over-year kind of comparison. First, we did have the TurboTax loss, which is roughly $20 million to $25 million that we had called out. We also then have the CFPB, the kind of one quarter impact of not having that in with the six-month assumed delay.", "So even though it\u2019s not necessarily an apples-to-apples comparison, what we talked about before, the $20 million a quarter is still roughly in the ballpark of kind of a headwind there. And so if you kind of have those two, there\u2019s $40 million to $45 million roughly of negative kind of headwinds, and so that puts your revised starting point to a little north of $700 million.", "If you kind of go back to that longer-term growth rate of 6% to 8% on top of that, there\u2019s about 100 basis points of headwinds relate Todd ASC 606 adoption. That kind of puts you in the range that I talked about in my prepared remarks. So those are kind of moving pieces, Dan, that I\u2019ve walked you through to kind of point you to what our 2000 expectation looks like.", "Dan Dolev", "And then going back to Merchant; I mean, you\u2019re clearly now amongst the fastest growers in Merchant acquiring. Can you maybe just give a high-level observation of how much of that is execution versus just better market tailwinds?", "Troy Woods", "I\u2019ll start off, and Philip may want to add. I think I wouldn\u2019t necessarily quantify those two, but I would say obviously both of those things are at play here. In the fourth quarter we saw great volume growth, which was obviously additive to kind of the revenue growth, certainly on a sequential-quarter basis. But even if you look on a year-over-year basis, our attrition performed really well. Our revenue per transactions, our whole yield management and pricing, performed really well.", "And then from a same store sales, we also performed well. So if you kind of look at from a kind of an executional scorecard on the Merchant side, each one of those elements was a positive play. And when we look on a future basis and look at the organic growth expectations and the outline that we talked about for 2018, we\u2019re expecting those execution elements to still be at play.", "Philip McHugh", "Yes, I wouldn\u2019t add much more to that. I think most of it was just really healthy growth. We\u2019re winning more than our fair share of partners, of ISVs, of ISOs, full service providers we\u2019ve been winning out in the market. And as Paul mentioned, the attrition rates have been really, really healthy, so the merchants we have are staying with us and staying with us for longer. And those are the biggest drivers for the number.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from George Mihalos of Cowen. Please go ahead.", "George Mihalos", "Wanted to start off in the Merchant segment, just specifically the growth in RPT. That really sort of stood out. I just want to make sure, is there anything sort of onetime there in nature? Or is it really just more of sort of a mix shift to integrated that\u2019s benefiting you there? And then as it relates to the margin coming down year-over-year in the segment, I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s just all just increased discretionary spend, but not sure if there\u2019s anything to call out there?", "Troy Woods", "Yes, so, George, I\u2019ll take both of those. I\u2019ll maybe take the second one first. We\u2019re actually expanding the margin year-over-year for 2018. I think you may have been talking about maybe the 4Q margin year-over-year declined, which was significantly related to our onetime bonuses. And so for the year, we were right in line with what we\u2019re expecting for the year, and we were pleased to be in that position to be in an expanding margin position for next year. So we\u2019re managing the investments in a pro-growth margin way.", "As it relates to the revenue per transaction on Merchant, there isn\u2019t anything that I would call out. We had some initiatives play in, a little bit of product kick, but it was mostly volume related and lower attrition and obviously good yield management, so nothing that I would call out on top of those items.", "George Mihalos", "And, yes, I was talking specifically about the 4Q margin. Paul, maybe just one quick follow up. If we sort of look at the benefit that you\u2019re getting from tax going into 2018, I\u2019m sort of backing out at a midpoint of somewhere a little better than $0.50 or so. What\u2019s your sense of how much of that benefit, or if you can share with us how much of that benefit you\u2019re looking to reinvest back in the business, whether it be with faster initiatives or more headcount or higher pay? Anything you can share along those lines. Thank you.", "Troy Woods", "And, yes, as I commented in the prepared remarks, obviously we\u2019re going to be building on top of the ten. So there\u2019s more than ten that we\u2019re planning to invest there. I think the way I would characterize it, George, would be, we\u2019re going to be making these additive investments with constant kind of management at the consolidated margin level of making sure that the margin is expanding in that kind of 25 to 50 basis points.", "And so as we said in our prepared remarks, we do have a people component around our compensation and kind of people, team members impact. And then the other is on the product and reinvestment side, and it\u2019s across all three of our segments. But we are doing that all in the framework of this expanding margin picture of the 25 to 50 basis points on the adjusted EBITDA margin.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dave Koning of Baird. Please go ahead.", "Dave Koning", "Yes. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my call, and nice job. I guess my question, what are some of the between the lines impacts? It just seems like so much EBIT growth and so much tax benefit, that there\u2019s a little bit of a headwind. It seems like interest expense is going to go up, and maybe you can just talk to what interest expense should be and what the equity affiliate line should be?", "Troy Woods", "You\u2019re right, the interest expense increase is the single biggest thing I\u2019d pointed to and in my prepared remarks I commented about interest expense increasing between $45 million and $50 million in 2018 calendar year, increase on top of what we saw in 2017. So you\u2019re right, that\u2019s the single biggest point.", "As it relates to equity and income of CUP? I talked about this now on a couple of calls. We did have kind of an outsized impact relative to our historical levels there in 2017, and so we expect that to come back to a more kind of normalized double-digit kind of growth in 2018.", "We also had some timing aspects in 2017 that played in. So you\u2019d want to pull that back to a much more historical norm, and if you kind of make those two adjustments, if you will, I think that will address your question there.", "Dave Koning", "And then on the NetSpend segment, you talked about 6% to 8% is kind of normal growth, but it\u2019s 1% to 3% this year because of Q4 having the CFPB loss. Does that mean each quarter before that - I know you have the 606 too, but each quarter before that is kind of mid-single-digits, and then Q4 is maybe down mid-single-digits. Is that kind of roughly the math?", "Troy Woods", "You're basically thinking about the math right. The only thing you didn\u2019t point out was the TurboTax loss, and so obviously you\u2019ve got to have that in there in 1Q. But you\u2019re thinking about it right.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Kwok of KBW. Please go ahead.", "Steven Kwok", "When we think about the benefits from tax rate, have you guys had any conversations with your customers around like their willingness to invest in their businesses which should in theory help you guys next year and going forward?", "Troy Woods", "No, Steven, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had any conversations along those lines at all.", "Steven Kwok", "But is that something that we should expect given the benefits that corporations are seeing as well, and perhaps if they were to flow some of that benefits down the line, that could help accelerate some parts of your business as well?", "Troy Woods", "What we did say, both Paul and I both made a comment around taking some of those additional savings and investing it as it relates to our team members, our customers through accelerated product, to getting product to the market faster which benefits our customers.", "As far as any direct investment with our customers, no, all indirect. By us investing in product, get product to the market faster, which helps our customer, which helps their end card holders, or merchants, that\u2019s where we are making some of these investments. Additional investments.", "Steven Kwok", "And then when we think about the delay in the CFPB impact, if it were to be delayed further by another three months, like how do we size that, the benefit to you?", "Paul Todd", "Yes, Steven. Earlier I spoke a little bit to this. It\u2019s not an exact apples-to-apples kind of to our prior commentary when we had a three-month kind of extension. But it\u2019s - because we already rolled out some things and - but if you think about what I commented on before around the three months being - call it around $20 million of revenue impact and maybe around $0.06 a share. That is still the right ballpark to be thinking about what a three-month impact would look like for us.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brett Huff of Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead.", "Brett Huff", "Can we dig in a little bit - you\u2019ve talked a little bit around the expenses - or I\u2019m sorry, the investments that you\u2019re going to make, and it sounds like some of them are going to be pretty substantial. I think you\u2019ve outlined some of them, maybe some pay benefits and things like that. But are there a couple, sort of, two or three headliners that we should think about where most of that is going to go from a headline investment point of view?", "Paul Todd", "Yes, Brett, I\u2019ll start off and Troy may want to add. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily characterize these additional investments as substantial. Obviously we have a $10 million kind of starting point. We\u2019re building on top of that. I think I\u2019d point out a couple things.", "One, we have had a pipeline of investments that we\u2019ve talked about now for several quarters around specifically in product, and even more specifically product in issuing and merchant. And so there\u2019s more of an acceleration of that pipeline dynamic to this as opposed to additive kind of new investments. Certainly, the people side, there\u2019s some things that we\u2019re doing there. But once again, those have been planned on for a long period of time. It\u2019s more around pacing of that investment, as opposed to kind of new buckets or anything.", "And, Brett, I\u2019d just kind of reiterate that is all done in kind of this pro-growth margin dynamic. And so we will manage that pacing and that pipeline of these investments in a way to effectively kind of produce the margin results that both our track record is indicative of and is behind the 2018 outlook that I provided.", "Troy Woods", "And I really don\u2019t have much to add to it, Brett. As Paul indicated, mostly around accelerating product and investments, we are going to accelerate by way of example some leadership training for some of our leaders across this organization that we had in the pipeline. But it was going to maybe take 18 to 24 months to get it out to the breadth of the leadership that we have.", "We\u2019re going to accelerate some of that leadership training and pull almost all of it into 2018. Maybe make some other - I wouldn\u2019t say really significant, but certainly not de minimis investments in some of our benefit programs. So it\u2019s all about accelerating some benefits, accelerating some training, accelerating some product delivery, those type of things into 2018.", "Brett Huff", "And just my follow up is you outlined the 25 to 50 basis points, Paul, which was what you had talked about at the Analyst Day kind of shooting long term range. Is the - kind of how should we think about the investments on top of this? Let me put it this way. How do we get above the 25 to 50? Are there specific things that could happen positively that could get us there?", "Paul Todd", "Well, I guess just to start off with, the whole uncertainty around the CFPB would be the thing I would probably point to that\u2019s probably the most concrete in nature. There wouldn\u2019t be anything else that I would highlight but that would be one, that obviously there\u2019s uncertainty around that. We\u2019ve made an assumption. But outside of that, there wouldn\u2019t be anything else I would really point you to.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Jim Schneider", "Maybe just one follow-up on the investment, if we could. To the extent that you\u2019re in a position to overdrive the 25 to 50 basis point a year margin expansion goals you have, relative to the investments, how do you think about that philosophically? If you\u2019re doing better than that - let\u2019s say you\u2019re running, for example, 100 basis points ahead because your better execution, would you look to kind of take half that and put it into even further accelerating that investment? Or anything above that would you look to kind of let it fall through to the bottom line?", "Paul Todd", "I\u2019ll start off and maybe Troy wants to add. I think the best way to frame that, Jim, would be to look at our track record. Look at what we did this year where we had, throughout the year, additive kind of margin in each of our segments from where we started the year.", "And so clearly we made more investments and we talked about it at Investor Day, we talked about them on our last call. We started making more investments but allowed for additive margin expansion to occur in the businesses. So it was a bold end equation. We were going to reinvest some of that benefit, but we were going to let some of that benefit flow.", "That same mind-set is at play as it relates to this year. We, as I said before, these investments are investments that\u2019s have been in the pipeline. It\u2019s a matter of pacing those, and we are pleased to be in a position, with the exception of the NetSpend business, which we knew around the headwinds of the margin there, to be expanding the margins both in our Merchant business as well as in our Issuing business, inclusive of these investments that will accelerate growth for the longer term.", "Troy Woods", "I would just add, Jim. I certainly hope we can find ourselves in that position later on in the year if we\u2019re looking at that kind of EBITDA expansion. And I think Paul is dead right. Obviously, we would be opportunistic, we would look at those on a case-by-case basis.", "But at the end of the day, we can only do so much, and that you can get done. So again, I think it\u2019s just case-by-case, looking at it, see what has the biggest payback and make those decisions on a case- by-case basis.", "Jim Schneider", "I guess that\u2019s a high-class problem to have. Then maybe just as a follow up. Relative to NetSpend, I think you\u2019ve talked consistently about some of the new revenue growth initiatives you\u2019re putting in place, DDA and small business, offsetting about half of the CFPB headwinds. So with the CFPB pushout, can you maybe give us a sense about how much those new revenue initiatives are contributing in 2018? Or whether that\u2019s kind of washing away? Or the net of all that is kind of a wash for this year or not?", "Troy Woods", "Yes, so we don\u2019t give kind of the revenue expectations or what\u2019s embedded as it relates to those two particular products other than to say they\u2019re doing well. We continue to invest. And so I wouldn\u2019t give any more specificity to what that impact is than that. Other than we are pleased to be in a position to grow organically this business again, faster than what we expect the market to grow at.", "And obviously these two headwinds are - and the AFC606 adoption of 100 basis points is kind of clouding that true organic picture. But that\u2019s why I highlighted what those items are so you can get to that organic growth rate. You\u2019ll see that we\u2019re actually doing even kind of better than what we said we were going to do at Investor Day.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from James Friedman of SIG. Please go ahead.", "James Friedman", "It's Jamie at Susquehanna. Let me echo the congratulations on these excellent results. I\u2019ll ask my two upfront if I could. Paul, in your answer to a prior comment, rather a prior question, you had - I think you said, that you anticipated deceleration in the equity income line, largely on China Union pay. I was United States wondering for the context around that. Obviously, it was a great year. That\u2019s the first one.", "The second one is, I think also in something that you answered, you talked about value-added services. I remember at the Investor Day in the spring you had committed to an acceleration, and it sounds like value added services did come back. Do we have to wait for the 10-K to quantify that? Or could you help us contextually how that might have come through for you. So first equity income, and second, value-added. Appreciate it.", "Paul Todd", "So for the first question, as it relates to the deceleration of CUP. As I said at - after I think the first quarter call, we were expecting a 40% to 50% increase in the CUP line item. So the deceleration is a coming from a number that was extremely high. There\u2019s nothing but positive coming out of our China Union pay, nor in venture. The transactional growth in China is fantastic. The sales pipeline is good. It\u2019s just if you go back in our history, and you look at kind of the double-digit kind of more normalized double-digit growth.", "That\u2019s a much more kind of proper way of evaluating it than this kind of step change of growth that we had this year, which was related to kind of some new products as well as some timing aspects. And so that was my comment around the whole CUP piece. It\u2019s still doing fantastic, and we\u2019re pleased with the expectations and certainly the results in 2017. ", "As relates to value-added services, we did see acceleration, Jamie, from 3Q on a constant-currency basis, that kind of line item that you\u2019ve seen in the 10-K or in the Q\u2019s going to be up 17% on a reported basis, or 14.6% roughly on a constant -currency basis. So, yes, we did see good acceleration there. And we\u2019re very pleased with the momentum, as Troy said, of just our whole product solutions area that we had initially.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan Perlin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Dan Perlin", "So a question on Merchant and Integrated in particular. I thought I heard you say - it wasn\u2019t in your prepared remarks, but it was in some sort of commentary around winning ISOs or success in ISO channels. What I\u2019m trying to reconcile there is the significant growth you guys have seen in integrated becoming double digits. You obviously have Cayan now. It takes you into kind of the S&P market. And my question is, how do you reconcile those two statements given that integrated seems to be a big-share gainer against ISOs.", "Troy Woods", "Yes. I think my comment was, we had growth across all of our channels. So clearly, ISV is a higher growth business, and our expectations start off higher as kind of a strong, double-digit growth business.", "And we\u2019ve felt - we\u2019ve been very happy with the new ISV partners that we\u2019ve signed, how fast we\u2019ve been able to activate them. And then clearly with the Cayan acquisition, we now become very competitive in a brand-new vertical, particularly with the retail ISVs, along with our kind of health and wellness in some ISVs where we\u2019ve done very, very well.", "So, that continues on and Cayan will make that even more competitive. And as ProPay grows, it gets more competitive. But on the other side of the coin, we are a very large, broad, payment-acceptance player. And we do bring a large amount of ISOs through as well. They\u2019re a very important part of our business. And we continue to do very, very well on that segment too. Now clearly the growth rate there isn\u2019t at the same level as ISVs. But it\u2019s still a high-value part of our business, and it\u2019s growing well.", "And on the indirect side, we\u2019ve won a lot of large, new clients that we\u2019re very happy with. So it was an across-the-board performance, albeit in different parts of the market, if that makes sense.", "Dan Perlin", "Can you just size how much Integrated is as a percentage of Merchant again? And then, the follow-up question that I really have is, Paul, I thought you said issuer guidance is 5 to 7. And then I thought you said something about it might be near the low end of that range, given a couple of caveats. And I just wanted to confirm that\u2019s the case. Thank you.", "Paul Todd", "So, as it relates to the integrated, we've commented that integrated is a little over 30% of our total direct business. And obviously, it continues to grow at a strong double-digits, so that 30-plus percent number continues to improve. So that answers your integrated question.", "As it relates to issuer, yes, you are right. In my prepared remarks, I talked about organically expectation in the organic 5% to 7% range, but we do have 50 basis points of headwind with ASC 606 adoption. We do have the CapOne renewal, and so it does push us down in that range. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Cantwell of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.", "Jeff Cantwell", "I appreciate all the detail you're giving us regarding the outlook. I just had a big-picture question for you now that Cayan's on board. One of the things you really honed in on at the Investor Day was expanding the addressable market in Merchant. And so it seems like Cayan's going to help with that. So I was hoping to just talk about what you think your potential is in terms of market share in Merchant now that Cayan's on board. You\u2019re number three in integrated. So should we expect to see that going from third to second now? Or maybe to first over time? Love to hear your thoughts. Thanks.", "Troy Woods", "Well, I\u2019ll take a stab at it, and Phillip may want to add to it, Jeff. When you think about that addressable market that we\u2019ve talked about on several occasions, and obviously Paul has given you the range of the acquisition revenue size of Cayan, and you go out there and look at the delta between number three and number two, I think you can go do the math that it\u2019s going to take some pretty serious work to get from number three to number two.", "As we've also said on several occasions, we\u2019re not through. As Philip just mentioned, all cylinders within our Merchant segment are growing nicely, led by the integrated channel. But even when you look at that, we also talked about inorganic revenue growth.", "And obviously, we\u2019re going to be focused on deleveraging the Cayan acquisition over the next several quarters. But we\u2019re still not through in that space as well. So I think you can continue to watch TSYS grow, focus and be a significant serious player in the Merchant space. Philip, you want to add to it?", "Philip McHugh", "No, I think that covers it.", "Troy Woods", "Do you have a follow up, Jeff?", "Jeff Cantwell", "Yes. And then just in terms of your RPT in Merchant, I want to ask about the outlook for 2018 in a different way, which is what do you expect the impact of Cayan will be on the segment RPT. I understand there\u2019s a lot of moving parts, but is it fair to say that overall we should expect stable to slightly improving RPT next year, inclusive of Cayan? And how should we think about it?", "Troy Woods", "Yes. So I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call it out in that framework but I would say if you just look at from a margin standpoint, we talked about what the margin was of Cayan, approaching 30%. So it\u2019s a little shy of what our business is on a standalone basis. But that will improve as we get synergies in and we get that business onto platforms and the full synergy is realized.", "And then the only other thing I\u2019d comment too is just from a base and a scale standpoint, Cayan, relative to the overall base and the movement there. So there wouldn\u2019t be anything I\u2019d necessarily call out there but focus you back more on kind of a margin picture as it relates to the overall roughly expanding 50 basis points, our expectation for 2018.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Shawn Roberts for any closing remarks.", "Shawn Roberts", "Thank you, Andrea, and I\u2019d like to thank everybody who participated in the call.
