At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Spencer Sias, VP, Investor Relations. Thank you, please begin.", "Spencer R. Sias", "Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Varian Medical Systems\u2019 conference call for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. With me are Dow Wilson, President and CEO; Elisha Finney, CFO; Varian Imaging Components President, Sunny Sanyal who will become CEO of Varex Imaging; Varian Controller, Clarence Verhoef, who will become CFO of Varex Imaging; and Magnus Momsen will replace Clarence as our new Corporate Controller and Senior Vice President of Finance. Dow and Elisha will summarize Varian results and Sunny will summarize Varian Imaging operations and we will take your questions following the presentation.", "To simplify our discussion, unless otherwise stated, all references to the quarter or year are fiscal quarters and fiscal years. Quarterly comparisons are for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 versus the first quarter of fiscal 2016. References to financial results for orders are to gross orders, unless otherwise indicated.", "The company is reporting non-GAAP results in order to provide quarter-over-quarter comparisons of operational performance excluding unusual items. Unless otherwise stated all financial results are discussed on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure is included in our earnings release, which can be accessed on our website.", "Please be advised that this presentation and discussion contains forward-looking statements. Our use of words and phrases such as outlook, believe, expect, anticipate, could, should, will, promising and similar expressions are intended to identify those statements, which represents our current judgments on future performance or other future matters. While we believe them to be reasonable based on information currently available to us, these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.", "Some of the important risks relating to our business are described in our first quarter earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this presentation and discussion, because of new information, future events or otherwise. And now, here is Dow.", "Dow R. Wilson", "Good afternoon everyone. Our company began 2017 with strong performance in oncology systems, continuing growth momentum in Imaging Components, and a $76 million GAAP charge related almost exclusively to the California Proton Treatment Center or CPTC in San Diego without which we would have handily beaten the high end of our earnings guidance range for the quarter. ", "To summarize, our first quarter results we are reporting, strong oncology global order growth of 10% together with a four point improvement in its gross margin rate. Imaging Components gains in both orders and revenues, company-wide revenues of $763 million up 1% in both dollars and constant currency. GAAP net earnings of $0.22 per diluted share, after reporting $0.64 per diluted share in charges related almost exclusively to CPTC. Non-GAAP net earnings of $0.75 per diluted share, after recording $0.34 per diluted share in charges related almost exclusively to an accounts receivable reserve for CPTC and Board approval of the spinoff of Imaging Components into a new public company Varex Imaging in the next few days. ", "Focusing first on Oncology Systems, orders totaled $586 million for the first quarter up 10% in both dollars and in constant currency. Broad-based demand for new equipment as well as software and services drove strong order growth across all geographies during the quarter. First quarter orders in the Americas grew by 5% in dollars and constant currency, orders in North America grew by 7% growth in both dollars and constant currency. The trailing 12 month order growth rate in North America is 6%.", "First quarter oncology orders in APAC rose by 29% in dollars and 24% in constant currency while EMEA grew orders by 8% in dollars and 10% in constant currency. In India we booked $18 million for a multi-linac project with a customer that will total $35 million over the next 10 years. This is our first combined hardware and software as a service deal in the region and it demonstrates our ability to meet the growing need from customers for a cloud hosted software solutions.", "Elsewhere in EMEA we continue to perform strongly in Poland. As you will recall we acquired our distributor there last year. During the quarter we won the majority of tenders and booked more than $20 million. The highlight in our APAC region was China, where we achieved 25% order growth during the quarter with sizable gains in both equipment and services. It appears that competitor protests to tender wins in this market are diminishing and are being resolved more rapidly. We grew orders in Japan where we're seeing positive signs of a market recovery. We supported an SBRT focused luncheon seminar at Jastrow [ph] the Japanese radiation oncology show, where TrueBeam and HyperArc created a real buzz. Several hundred people attended our sessions on SBRT and TrueBeam. Emerging markets in Asia were also active with good orders performance in South Korea, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines.", "Turning to North America our order growth was driven mainly by healthy software and service gains as we expected potential changes to the Affordable Care Act did not appear to impact market performance in the quarter. Touching on our service business, global orders and revenues rose by about 7% in dollars in constant currency with gains in all territories.", "On the software side we saw growing interest in our newly introduced 360 oncology software platform particularly from customers in Western Europe. You may recall this offering which was introduced at the ESTRO show in October is a first of a kind software tool that enables clinicians on Tumor Boards to more effectively coordinate patient care among the numerous specialties involved in cancer treatment. We have also continued to have a very positive market response to our RapidPlan and InSightive Analytics software products that help improve the speed, quality, and cost efficiency of treatments. We have now taken more than 700 orders to RapidPlan since its launch and 380 systems are installed at customer sites around the world. Sales of our InSightive product are also ramping up nicely.", "During the quarter we received our 100th order for the VitalBeam treatment system. Half of these orders have come from customers in North America which demonstrates the appeal of this scalable solution even in developed markets. Comparing revenues on a trailing 12 month basis we believe we gained market share. Margins which Elisha will discuss in a few moments also benefited from ongoing efforts to reduce product cost.", "I will now turn to our particle therapy business which recorded first quarter revenues of $30 million. As I mentioned at the outset of the call, Varian took a $76 million GAAP charge in the first quarter in response to certain actions in January by CPTC and its loan agent or its capital markets to address liquidity issues caused by lower than expected patient volumes that are insufficient to support CPTC\u2019s capital structure. This led us to reserve $38 million in accounts receivable and to impair $38 million of our $98 million loans to CPTC of which $29 million was accrued interest. These charges and the associated limited tax deductibility reduced our earnings in the first quarter by $0.64 per diluted share on a GAAP basis and by $0.34 per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis. ", "We are reporting additional information on this matter today in the Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We believe this center can get on a more solid financial footing by serving a broader patient population with additional health care providers both locally and regionally. We remain confident and committed to supporting all of our customers and to building a profitable proton business based on leading technology that is treating many patients and performing at a high level. Of Varian's 15 proton projects we participated in the financing of only three. As of today our outstanding proton loan balance totals $131 million for CPTC and two other large regional centers in the U.S.", "Stepping back from the financing issues, we are generating revenues and are continuing to make good progress on 13 installations. Our sales funnel continues to look promising. Now I'll turn it over to Sunny for his discussion of the Imaging Components business. ", "Sunny Sanyal", "Thanks Dow and good afternoon. Imaging Components Business had a very busy quarter as we prepared for the spinoff of Varex Imaging and announced the planned acquisition of the medical imaging business of PerkinElmer. First quarter revenues for Imaging Components were 152 million up 7% from the year ago period. Orders for our business were 132 million up 4% from a year ago period.", "Going forward as a standalone company Varex will provide a different view than what you've seen in the past. Our public filings will provide a breakdown of revenues and gross margins by two segments, medical and industrial. Each of these segments will include X-ray sources, X-ray detectors, connect and control components, and software suited to their applications.", "Revenues for Imaging Components rose during the quarter with solid gains in both medical and industrial segments. Medical revenues increased by 8% with strong growth in CT tubes and dynamic detectors while industrial revenues grew by 6%. We're pleased to see good performance from global sales of dental detectors as well as sales growth for CT tubes in Asia. We continued to see price erosion in the lower priced radiographic portion of our detector business where we were able to maintain revenues with higher volumes. Connect and control revenues in both medical and industrial segments contributed good growth but our medical segment software product revenues were down for the quarter due to softness in veterinary imaging. ", "At the end of November we participated in the RSNA Trade Show in Chicago, the largest event for radiology. This show is always a great opportunity to see new imaging equipment products powered by our components being introduced at the show by our medical OEM customers. At this show we also introduced several new products and we enjoyed great customer response to our expanded offerings of collimators and next generation low dose, low cost, flat panel detectors.", "In December we announced the signing of a purchase agreement to acquire the medical imaging business of PerkinElmer. We're very excited to add this highly complementary business to our detector portfolio. We're getting a great team that has built a strong brand and product offering in the industrial imaging market in addition to their portfolio of medical imaging products. They also bring us expertise in new detector technologies such as CMOS which will enable us to broaden our offerings with higher resolution solutions for certain applications. We expect to close this acquisition sometime in the summer after the regulatory approval process has been completed.", "The spinoff of Varex Imaging is expected to be completed in a couple of days. The when issued trading started on January 20th and the regular way trading is expected to start on January 30th. The past few months have been filled with many meetings and road trip presentations with the investor and analyst community. I invite you to go to our website vareximaging.com, see more about our company and products.", "It has been an exciting past year and as we prepare for the separation and I want to thank all the people at Varian and Varex who put in so much time and effort to make this a success. In particular thanks to Dow and Elisha for all their support through this process. Now I'll turn it over to Elisha. ", "Elisha W. Finney", "Thanks Sunny and hello everyone. We have already covered orders and operations so let me start with backlog. We ended the quarter at 3.4 billion up 2% from the year ago period including a 7% increase in the oncology backlog to 2.9 billion. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled 23 million bringing net orders for the company to 699 million. ", "Now let me walk you through the P&L. First quarter revenues for the total company were 763 million, up 1% in dollars and in constant currency. Oncology revenues declined 1% in dollars and 2% in constant currency versus a strong year ago quarter. There was a geographic mix shift toward North American revenues which grew 7% in both dollars and constant currency to constitute 48% of oncology revenues in the quarter. ", "Imaging Components posted a first quarter revenue increase of 7% with increases in both its medical and industrial segment. Our Particle Therapy business posted revenues of 30 million up 15% from the year ago quarter driven by progress on installation. The total company gross margin for the quarter was 44.1%, up three points due to strong performance in oncology.", "Oncology Systems gross margins increased by four points to 46.8% due to favorable product and geographic mix as well as product cost reductions. Imaging Components gross margin for the quarter fell by almost two points to 39.1% as a consequence of a product mix shift toward radiographic detectors as well as stepped up investments and increased production capacities to meet expected long-term demand.", "Including the Proton AR reserve first quarter SG&A expenses were 167 million up significantly in dollars and as a percentage of revenue from the year ago quarter. The accounts receivable reserve up 38 million is considered in the ordinary course of business for accounting purposes and therefore is not adjusted out of earnings as a non-GAAP number. Excluding the AR reserve SG&A would have been 129 million or 17% of revenue.", "First quarter R&D expenses were 63 million or 8% of revenues equal to the year ago quarter as a percentage of revenue. First quarter operating earnings totaled 106 million or 14% of revenue down significantly from the year ago period due to the Proton AR reserve. Excluding this 38 million reserve, the operating margin would have increased two points from the year ago quarter to 19% of revenue.", "Depreciation and amortization totaled 22 million for the quarter. The GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate was unusually high because of the proton impairment. The CPTC loan was made by our subsidiary in Switzerland where our tax rate is low so there was very little tax benefit from the loan impairment. Furthermore a large portion of the AR reserve was attributable to our subsidiary in Germany where our tax rate is effectively zero due to large tax loss carry forwards. Had it not been for the CPTC impairment our tax rate would have been about 27% for the quarter. For the balance of the year we believe Varian\u2019s tax rate from continuing operations will be in the range of 25% to 26%.", "Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased 3.6 million from the year ago quarter to 94.2 million shares due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted GAAP EPS was $0.22 for the quarter, non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.75 including a $0.34 impact from the Proton AR reserve.", "Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of 815 million, debt 607 million, and stockholders equity of 1.7 billion. DSO of 100 days was up one day from the year ago period. First quarter cash flow from operations rose by 6% from the year ago quarter to $82 million.", "Primary uses of cash were 17 million for CAPEX and 49 million for the repurchase of half a million shares of stock. As of today we have 8 million shares remaining under our existing repurchase authorization. Varian plans to repurchase 2 million shares in its second fiscal quarter of this year. And now let me turn it back over to Sunny and then Dow for the fiscal 2017 outlook for both Varex Imaging and Varian.", "Sunny Sanyal", "Thanks Elisha for Varex Imaging we expect revenues for fiscal 2017 to grow by 3% to 4%. Over the 620 million total recorded for fiscal 2016 in our Form 10 filing with SEC. Assuming approximately 38 million shares outstanding and a 35% tax rate we anticipate that GAAP net earnings per diluted share for the second through fourth quarters of the fiscal 2017 will be in the range of $1.20 to $1.30. Going forward Varex Imaging will provide annual guidance.", "Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Dow for the Varian outlook.", "Dow R. Wilson", "Thank you. Beginning with our fiscal second quarter Imaging Components will be reflected as a discontinued operation for the first four months of fiscal year 2017. The company is guiding for continuing operations for the second through the fourth quarters of the fiscal year 2017. For the balance of the fiscal year we believe Varian revenues from continuing operations will grow in the range of 4% to 5% bringing revenue growth for the full year to 3% to 4%. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the second through fourth quarters of the fiscal year will be in the range of $2.94 to $3.06. For the second quarter we believe Varian revenues from continuing operations will grow in the range of 4% to 5% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share will be in the range of $0.84 to $0.90.", "To summarize the first quarter, we have demonstrated strength in our oncology business with strong orders that will support future revenue growth. We have successfully set up Imaging Components for continued expansion with an important acquisition in life as a new public company Varex Imaging. And while it was painful, our exposure to particle therapy financing has now been significantly reduced. We are continuing our drive for profitability with over a dozen projects and a healthy sales funnel. Varian is poised now to focus exclusively on providing the world with the technology it needs to beat cancer and our product pipeline has never looked better. We're very much looking forward to the rest of fiscal year 2017. We're now ready for your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session ", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone with Jeffries. Please proceed.", "Dow R. Wilson", "Hi Anthony.", "Anthony Petrone", "Hi Dow, how are you? Thanks and good afternoon everyone. Hi, Sunny, hi Elisha. Congratulations on approaching spin 2 to everyone. Good luck, separate companies going forward. I think, Dow I'm just getting some e-mails on sort of the implied full year guidance overall and maybe even more so the implied non-GAAP operating margin guidance for the remaining company. As I'm working it here I think if we give back the $0.34 take into considerations the $0.75 in the quarter and adjust for share count differences, I am coming up with about 450 to 470 in implied full company consolidated earnings. So A) just wanted to check if that math is correct and then B) what would be the implied non-GAAP operating margin outlook for Remain Co? And then a couple of follow ups for Sunny. ", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yeah, so Anthony let me let me take a stab at it and please bear with this guys as we as we said because of the spin it is just -- it's going to be a little messy and so we're going to try and clear this up to the best we can. In Q1 it really is apples and oranges because we've got both Varian and Varex. We've got some duplicate costs and then of course we've got the complicating factor with the AR reserve that we could not adjust out for non-GAAP purposes. So we decided let's each guide Q2 through Q4 as standalone companies as continuing operations. What I can say though Anthony and this is a very, very rough, back of the envelope rule of thumb, is when I have looked at what continuing operations is for fiscal year 2014, 2015, and 2016 and some of the quarters and these are unaudited so they have not been published anywhere yet, they will be. The continuing operations is anywhere from 75% to 80% of our reported numbers. So if you were to consider, I don't know which number you want to use but assuming you start with the $1.09 that excludes the AR you can take 78% of that, it gets you to $0.85 and you could then add that to Varian's guidance which at $3 on the midpoint would put you at 385 for the fiscal year. Was that as clear as mud.", "Anthony Petrone", "That does help and I think we can run an implied operating margin guidance but I guess some confusion around that would be... ", "Elisha W. Finney", "Of course, sorry I forgot that part of your question. For these -- for Q2 through Q4 it should be in the range of 18% to 19% and then as I mentioned for Q1 without the AR reserve we would have been at 19% but of course that includes some Varex Imaging numbers in there. ", "Anthony Petrone", "Okay, and then the follow-up for Sunny would be the 7% growth number in the first quarter was ahead of what we were expecting and so I guess the question there is are there new contracts that were won in there or was there normalization of Toshiba? And then the follow up question would be on the Varex implied guidance. What does the operating margin profile look like through the remainder of the year? Thank you.", "Sunny Sanyal", "Yeah Anthony, first of all we have had really good growth for the last three to four quarters and it's a very good sign and we have confidence in the recovery path that we're on. For this quarter we had some easy comps so the first half as you recall, our first half of 2016 was soft so for the second half we've got some tough comps and so the 3% to 4% is what we were anticipating for fiscal year 2017.", "Clarence Verhoef", "You know second question on operating margins I'm sorry so I will take that. Anthony, this is Clarence. The operating margins for the balance of the year, the Q2 through Q4 will be in the range of 16% to 17%. There is a little bit of incremental SG&A cost associated with being a standalone company and then I guess as Elisha kind of alluded to there is just a ton of complication in trying to understand exactly what the Q1 number is. So therefore we're just really trying to give a cleaner answer is to just talk about the Q2s and Q4. Along those lines a little bit maybe one additional bit of information where you'll get more visibility to this as we will file a 10-Q for Q1 at the end of February and it's going to have a lot more breakdown of that and we'll be able to give you a little more color on the one time separation costs that are included in there.", "Anthony Petrone", "Thanks. I\u2019ll hop back in queue. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Henry with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. ", "Brandon Henry", "Yes, thanks for taking my question. The first on the Oncology Systems gross margin, looks like they continue to make good progress in the quarter. I think you mentioned last quarter that the gross margins for Oncology Systems would kind of be in the 44% to 45% range. I think you were above that range this quarter. So does that guidance now appear conservative and then maybe you can just talk about your expectations for gross margins for the remainder of the year for Oncology Systems?", "Dow R. Wilson", "You know on the quarter we had good product mix, good geographic mix, and then something we've been talking about last four to five quarters, we've had very good cost performance and variable cost performance on the product cost and installation warranty. Elisha can walk us through some of the guidance impact but those are the big drivers on the quarter.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yeah, so at this point Brandon I am preferring to stick to the 44 to 45. I feel quite confident in those numbers given the performance that oncology has had the last several quarters. They really started to improve gross margin in the second half of last year so the comps get a little more difficult. But clearly I mean the business has done an outstanding job of maintaining stable pricing, product cost reduction, higher software, that would be the upside. If the stock were mixed we are to increase then clearly that could be some upward bias on the margin. But we're sticking to 44 to 45.", "Brandon Henry", "Okay and then separately I think you mentioned that you were seeing some positive signs of a market recovery in Japan and I think that's kind of the first time I've heard that in a while. So can you give us some more details on that commentary and is the government again kind of picking up spending like what we saw in the past or is that something else?", "Dow R. Wilson", "Well we unfortunately have not seen any new incremental government stimulus spending. That's what really drove this market three to four years ago. So, we haven't seen that but we have seen kind of a stabilization of the market with a little bit of growth. So, and that's two quarters in a row now. So we connected the dots. I mean I think it's still early but our funnel looks pretty good and that market has come down pretty substantially from where it was two to three years ago. But we're starting to see some turnaround. Our shares have been good there too.", "Brandon Henry", "Okay and then just last question on China, I think you said there was 25% order growth in the quarter for China. How much of that was attributable to a resolution of the previous protests and then can you just talk about your expectations for China for the remainder of the year? Thanks.", "Dow R. Wilson", "You know the protests piece was anniversary and so in fact what you're really looking at is growth. So we feel good about that. The market is strong and funnel remains good, the team is executing very well. I'd say that we continue to do very well especially at the high end of that market and get orders -- good orders there so, good execution in a good market.", "Brandon Henry", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.", "Dow R. Wilson", "Hi, Jeff.", "Jeff Johnson", "Hi guys, how are you? Good, alright, so let me ask two hopefully quick questions and then I think I'm more confused after we went through the questions with Anthony but I want go through few numbers here if I could but first Dow just on the Proton business, you write down some of the scripts business, you gave a number that you still have $131 million exposure out there, what is the risk to that exposure number one? And number two, what your appetite may be for financing additional field down issue here? ", "Dow R. Wilson", "Great questions. So the total exposure as I said is $130 million. We've got $60 million remaining to CPTC in San Diego. We've got $50 million outstanding sub debt to Maryland and we've got $20 million of sub debt to New York. So those are the three that we have outstanding. I'd say feel very good about New York and Maryland and where they are. Large centers, Maryland is coming up to speed very, very quickly, fastest ramp. We believe in Proton Therapy, they're now doing 60 to 70 patients. They've got one more BeamLine coming on next month which should reduce the patient volume again a little bit more. ", "In terms of appetite for more of these, these are all very large centers. I'd say that we don't have much appetite for large centers but we still look to use the balance sheet where there is a lower breakeven point, a smaller center, where we're a partner with reputable financing partners, where we're not the largest lender and where we're working with clinical partners who are leaders in their markets. So, for example in the case of both New York and Baltimore we are working with local leaders in their markets and that makes a big difference. ", "And then of course we want I think the deal structure on this one was a little bit unique. We did it in 2011. So our first probing, show site, and in any case I think we want to make sure that we've got a local partner with some skin in the game. Elisha you have anything to add there. ", "Elisha W. Finney", "No, I would just say we are encouraged that big banks are continuing to finance Proton Centers. Varian has sold off as indicated a 120 million of loans that we had initially put on these centers. We sold off New York and a portion of San Diego. And the Muni [ph] financing program in Georgia from what we hear is continuing to proceed well. So I do think this is somewhat of a unique situation as Dow mentioned. ", "Jeff Johnson", "Okay, and then Elisha maybe not a technical accounting explanation because I really don't want to hear that but out of the $73 million write off you guys excluded $38 million. But there's another $38 million that we essentially have to take out of your SG&A and to non-GAAP earnings and things like that to get it apples-to-apples? ", "Elisha W. Finney", "That is correct Jeff and it's because and I won't give you any technical accounting but it's because from a SEC guidance standpoint accounts receivable is deemed in the ordinary course of business. It's not deemed unusual and something you can adjust into a non-GAAP number. ", "Jeff Johnson", "Okay and so the question where I want to step through a couple things is just if I look at your disclosures you get 70.3 million in non-GAAP net earnings. I need to add back about 35 million to that so your non-GAAP net earnings X all of the noise of the write off would have been closer to 102 million to 105 million or so, is that correct?", "Elisha W. Finney", "I've got it on EPS Jeff because the tax rate change between the GAAP and the non-GAAP as well because again a lot of the AR was attributable to Germany at a 0% rate. The loan is at Swiss rate so the non-GAAP tax rate is 34.5 I think it was, where as GAAP is 48. Suffice it to say let me do it -- let me give it to you this way, let's just assume you start with$0.75 -- let's assume you start with $1.09. You add the two numbers together, $0.34 is the AR reserve $0.30 is the loan impairment, and then you've got $0.23 of other stuff like the spend and litigation and amortization of intangibles and those sorts of things and that's how you get to the $0.22 GAAP. ", "Jeff Johnson", "Alright that's fine. X all that noise and we could use your $1.09 number for the quarter that equates to a little over $100 million in net earnings X that. So if we start there is a base I don't want to dominate the time here but if we start there is a base. You're guiding over the next three quarters. I think between the two businesses, the net earnings and if we take the EPS out of it just because again the share count changes with Varex and that you're guiding to about 330 million in net earnings between the two companies, if I add that to the 105 million or so you're essentially guiding combined companies all noise out of it at somewhere around 435 million I think. Is that about reasonable because the street was at 442, I think you guys are guiding somewhere around 435 and there are some big numbers floating around here in emails and all that that you guys are cutting $0.20, $0.30, $0.40 out of what where Street has been thinking and I'm just not getting it that big?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Well, let me take a stab at this. Jeff I will answer for Varian and I'll let Clarence answer for Varex. Q2 through Q4 when you run through our guidance you are going to see we are somewhere between call it 280 million and 290 million of net income for Varian. Then you need to take about 78% of Q1 net income assuming that\u2019s what continuing operations will be for Varian and add it to that number and then on top of that you would need to add the Varex net income for Q2 through Q4.", "Clarence Verhoef", "And that number just using the $1.20 to $1.30 range and I remember shares outstanding is somewhere in the range of 45 million to 50 million of net income after tax. One of the challenges there by the way also Jeff is that the Varex tax rate is significantly different than the Varian tax rate. Our tax rates in the range of 35%.", "Jeff Johnson", "Yes, understood. And then just on top of that Clarence just add the 22% or whatever it would be from the Q1 105 million or so?", "Clarence Verhoef", "That\u2019s a fair approximation at this point in time from us. Let's call it a non-GAAP perspective because that would exclude pro forma and look back time separation costs and the like.", "Jeff Johnson", "Alright, oh, I think my numbers are right but I'll follow up with you guys after offline just to make sure but I appreciate the time. Thanks guys. ", "Dow R. Wilson", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Please proceed.", "Tycho Peterson", "Hey thanks, question on the viability of the particle therapy market. You know I know Jeff asked your earlier about your willingness to finance but Indiana did shut down, San Diego is having a liquidity issues, can you maybe just talk about you know the health of some of the other projects underway and why you think there's still a viable market here?", "Dow R. Wilson", "Yeah, I mean I think when we look into the funnel we still have a good funnel. Indiana was a very specific case with some extremely old technology that's been a little blown out of proportion. But that center was 20 to 30 years installed and installed as frankly as kind of a research center with a little bit of clinical lad on. So I think its failure has been a little overstated in the marketplace. There were some procure issues in the market a couple years ago. Now San Diego I think the transition from these really, really large centers to small center, something we've been talking about on our call is very much going on in the marketplace. I mean this center would be very viable as a two or three room center financially and so it's got a tough capital structure. It maybe a little bit over built for the market in the market position. We do think that as it regionalizes and has opportunity to bring some more customers in especially in the San Diego area, that it can be viable. So I think there are some very specific things about San Diego that made it that way. We're still, of our 15 customers, 12 are cash paying. So we've got the three that I talked about and we feel very good about where two of those are. And clearly nobody is proud about this but we feel pretty good about where things are headed.", "Tycho Peterson", "And then maybe can you just touch on what you're hearing from your customers in the U.S. on the CAPEX front. I mean your orders held up okay in North America and as you highlighted a lot of that was software and service but I'm just thinking about the remainder of the year did you see a freeze on CAPEX budgets?", "Dow R. Wilson", "You know everybody is watching what happens in Washington but I'd say at this point in time we're not seeing a change in our funnel shape or size. And as I said in the call our -- in the script our rolling 12 month performance in North America is 6%. I would say that's pretty good for 12 months and from a funnel point of view we're not seeing that change. Clearly who knows what's going to happen in Washington and everybody is watching. But it's not changing behavior in the short-term.", "Tycho Peterson", "Okay and then just two modeling ones. For dyssynergies can you tell us what the -- guidance, I know you talked about 20 million over two years, should we just assume 10 million this year?", "Elisha W. Finney", "We will exit this year with 10 million of dyssynergies out. It has a roughly a 50 basis point impact on the EBIT margin this year that we also our tax rate is going to go down because as Clarence mentioned Varex is at a higher tax rate. So we are helped at the after tax line.", "Tycho Peterson", "Okay and then for Sunny, the Varex guidance doesn't include anything for synergies right, assuming obviously that deal hasn\u2019t closed yet?", "Sunny Sanyal", "No, it is standalone Varex. ", "Tycho Peterson", "Okay, perfect. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kamar with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.", "Vijay Kumar", "Hey Dow, how is it going? Thanks for taking my question. I just maybe go back to the guidance question right. If you just go back simplistically maybe Elisha there's a question for you, on the last call so we thought that the combined rate was with the pre-oncology piece EPS would do high singles. So if we did $4.68 of EPS last year that implies somewhere around $5, call it 5 around that ballpark and I think the new guidance is $4.60 at the midpoint. I guess part of the delta, that $0.40 delta is the dyssynergies right which is maybe $0.20 but it still feels like there's a $0.20 delta between how we were thinking about numbers three months ago versus now, I just want to make sure was there anything else from an accounting perspective that I'm missing the way I'm thinking about numbers? Thank you.", "Elisha W. Finney", "I'm not sure Vijay, let me let me walk through it one more time in terms of our if you take the midpoint of our Q2 through Q4 so let's call it $3 and then you add the 85% for Q1, now there's about four months there where we have some duplicate costs that we're absorbing. It is probably I don't know 4 pennies or so that we're absorbing while Varex has been out hiring duplicate positions. That would compare to the $4.68 from last year and don't hold me to this, it is unaudited but the continuing operations number for Varian is $3.68 and for Varex is about $1. So that -- call it $3.90 compares to the $3.68 if you just look at it that way.", "Vijay Kumar", "I guess we will take this off line because I'm not sure, I get the math completely to be honest Elisha. I guess maybe one on -- in a doubt on the Proton business, a lot of questions here on -- for the other parts of the businesses right, other contracts you have you mentioned 15 projects right?", "Dow R. Wilson", "Yes. ", "Vijay Kumar", "I guess the reason for the financing issue was volumes, can you just talk about why for the other projects volumes wouldn't be an issue, is this a reimbursement issue or I'm just trying to understand was this more regional issue for them in California?", "Dow R. Wilson", "I'd say this is very much an issue in San Diego. So, first of all about 15 orders I have top -- count off top of my head but at least 10 of them are outside of the U.S. So there tends to be, it's not true in every case but it tends to be sovereign government purchases. So those are in pretty good shape. You know one or two of them are not, one or two of them are private but the vast majority of them are sovereign government purchases, backstop that way. So should be very good from a credit point of view. In the U.S., I mean New York the lead customer there is the top cancer center in New York City. They're already sending very significant numbers of patients to other centers. So as they build their own center they'll pull that volume back to this center. So we feel very good about the viability of New York. Baltimore is ramping very nicely. Little bit of a slow start but they've gotten to 60 to 70 patients and now they open in February last year. So just in a year they've ramped up very nicely. Good reimbursement environment there and I think this is really kind of about some of the very specific contractual things and market conditions that were in San Diego.", "Vijay Kumar", "Got you, and maybe up one for Sunny, a lot of questions Sunny on the outlook for Varex. I guess maybe simplistically if I look back margins for your business was in the mid 20's. We're now looking at high teens. Is there, if I just had to look at it from a medium term perspective is there any reason why peak margin shouldn't go back up to 25% or are there any reasons why the new I guess normalized margins would be below sort of a historical peak?", "Sunny Sanyal", "So we've communicated previously that we see as we have we expect margins to climb back up to 20% from where we are today in the 17%ish range and that's how far as we see at this point. We don't see a way to get back to the 25%ish range. Those were at a point in time when low end of the radiographic flat panels range, the pricing impact was less. But also overtime we've added more R&D and big R&D investment so with that as our base costs we see us getting to 20%ish.", "Vijay Kumar", "And maybe just one last and I know I'm taking time here, on I guess if you look at the guidance for Varex and Q1 obviously is off to a strong start, any reason why you have had numbers improving over the last couple of quarters, why rest of the year should be 4% for the business?", "Sunny Sanyal", "So as I said earlier, significant part of the reason is the comps. First half of 2016 versus first half of 2017. We had a tough first half in 2016 so came off a relatively easier comps. We had a very strong second half in 2016 so we got pretty strong comps going into the second half. So that's why we're expecting at this point to net out at 3% to 4% for fiscal year 2017.", "Vijay Kumar", "Got you, that was helpful guys. Thank you.", "Elisha W. Finney", "And Vijay just before you go I just want to remind you guys unfortunately this guidance is complicated because the continuing operations accounting is not yet done. When it is we will be posting this historical numbers on our website and will come out -- we're going to post FY -- the ANNUAL FY 2014, 2015, and 2016 next week or soon thereafter, and then we're going to give you quarterly continuing operations at the pretax level next week as well. So you'll have a lot more information on looking at Varian and Varex as independent companies.", "Vijay Kumar", "That would be helpful Elisha because a lot of questions I'm getting as. Looks like -- the guidance was cut I'm not sure I'm sure you know there's a lot of accounting math here and we'll take it offline but those disclosure think would be helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Hazan with Citi. Please proceed.", "Q - Amit Hazan", "Hey Good afternoon guys. Let me surprise you and stick with the guidance topic maybe I\u2019ll approach it in a little bit of a different way that I'm less interested in the mechanism around that than I am around how to model remaining Varian in a little bit longer term. So if you think about it kind of as fiscal year 2018 or down to 2017 maybe better fiscal 2018 give us a sense of what the operating margin aspiration is going to be for you but is it kind of 18% to 19% in fiscal 2017, what is it going to be in fiscal 2018, and maybe that'll help us to try to understand what kind of earnings growth the model off of what many of us I think are going to come off and I think many of us are going to be around $4.10 for fiscal 2017, so how do we grow above that?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yes, So I mean we did the long-term kind of expectations at the top line will be in the mid single digits. We're not coming off of that. So that remains to be true. From a pretax margin, it's a little harder post then to get to that 22. I'm going to make a lot of this up in the tax rate. So if we can go from 18 to 19 up to 21 in the next two to three years that is what we're going to be aiming for. So it's 18 to 19 as our expectation for this -- for the balance of this fiscal year and then I would hope to get at least 25 to 50 basis points as we go forward into the fiscal year 2018 as well.", "Q - Amit Hazan", "Okay, so let me turn to sales, I don't think this has been covered yet. On the sales volume, especially while you guys actually reiterated your 3% to 4% guidance net reported number despite the fact that currency has gone against you. So, the FX effect on guidance really is what the FX number that you are guiding to is actually you're putting forward a kind of an increase of your FX guidance essentially. So, I want to make sure that that's confirmed with you and then secondly, in the Proton piece and you talked about that being up in fiscal 2017, do you still feel comfortable that that's going to be up this year?", "Elisha W. Finney", "So in terms of FX if I look at where both the Euro and the yen are today versus the year ago period it is roughly neutral. There's a little bit of a help with the yen and a little bit of hurt with the Euro and those tend to net out. So the FX impact on Q1 was very little. I'm expecting if rate stay stable where they are today and the balance of the year then FX was going to be pretty neutral to the balance of the year. Protons we are expecting growth. I am being very cautious just obviously in light of what the impairment that we've announced. We will be recording service revenue on the CPTC proton center on a cash basis because once I impair a receivable and a loan then it doesn't make any sense that I can then start to accrue revenue for that. So I'm a little less -- a little less optimistic on protons today just because of the situation we are in. But I would say that's offset by a little more optimism in our oncology business which is just doing very well.", "Q - Amit Hazan", "Let me just follow up on that just as the last question so, the currency has moved a lot since you gave guidance about three months ago. So the dollar is strengthened a lot against the Euro and against the yen and so maybe I don't if I understand why it would be the same now than it was three months ago for you. And given the proton piece if you're a little bit more cautious on that you're still kind of -- you still feel good though that we should be within that range of 3% to 4% that you gave three months ago?", "Dow R. Wilson", "I mean, it is not even clear how we've built the guidance on the revenue side is when you look at our last two or three quarters in oncology they've all been very good. So we have certainly had the orders. I mean just in this quarter alone the oncology backlog was up 6% or 7%. So we've got a very good backlog there and the margin position in the backlog as we've talked about looks very good.", "Q - Amit Hazan", "But you know -- yeah, go ahead. ", "Elisha W. Finney", "Sorry, the Euro has barely moved from when we gave guidance last. I mean in Q1 our average rate was 108, as of today it is 107. I would -- that's is the level. A little bit of help on the yen, a little bit -- so but they tend to be roughly an offset. The impact was very small in Q1 and we expect that for the balance of the year. ", "Q - Amit Hazan", "Okay, just one final clean up question on the share purchase, you said you would buy 2 million shares, is that incremental to what you usually buy or is that just -- you are just going to because that is pretty close to what you guys usually do in the quarter, how should we model that. ", "Elisha W. Finney", "Well now that's a little higher than what we have typically been doing when we were one Varian it was 1 million to 2 million shares per quarter typically. Obviously with Varian standalone there's going to be cash flow from operations will be lower by about 20%. We are just front loading so, we did 500,000 in Q1 and the plan is under 10b51 that we will do 2 million in Q2.", "Q - Amit Hazan", "Okay, thanks very much guys. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Please proceed.", "Anthony Petrone", "Great for fitting me into the follow-up, just a couple of follow-ups for Sunny and then maybe one for Elisha. I'm just trying to get to a full year earnings number and so we have 120 to 130 for the remaining four quarters and I know Clarence you mentioned you have to sort of tax it under a different tax scheme using 35%. So my implied range for Varex for the year is 166 to 186. I'm not sure if that makes sense, if I'm in the ballpark so any feedback there would be helpful and then just on the consolidated guidance I'm just wondering, what is in there for stock based compensation, I guess more so for Remain Co? Thanks again.", "Sunny Sanyal", "Well let me let me start out by first of all saying that it\u2019s for Q2 to Q4 it's 120 to 130. And I have because of the carve out costs or the spin off costs in Q1, it's going to be lower than the average of those three quarters, okay. So I would just say that Q1 is going to be at a lower rate. I'm not ready to talk through the specifics of it yet because we haven't finished determining what those are, that's part of this discontinued ops discussion that we also were talking about previously. So give us a little bit of patience here to get to that number and so I can't -- I probably can't give you exactly the answer you're looking for, for the full year.", "Anthony Petrone", "That\u2019s helpful.", "Sunny Sanyal", "Then the question about the stock based comp I guess it's fundamentally at the same level of those as historical and so I guess the question is a little bit about are you asking what the mix is between Varex and Varian, is that the question.", "Anthony Petrone", "Maybe just some more simply, what is the level of stock based compensation reflected in the guidance for both Remain Co and Varex?", "Elisha W. Finney", "I don't want to get down to that level of detail. I would tell you in Q1 for total company it was 11 million was what was included. We\u2019re just not going to post the guidance in that detail.", "Anthony Petrone", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from line of [Indiscernible] with CRM. Please proceed.", "Unidentified Analyst ", "Hey guys, on the Varex side for some sort of housekeeping, can you give us a sense or an update of what cash or debt the balance sheet will look like at separation for Varex?", "Clarence Verhoef", "Yeah, so a level of cash is going to be around $25 million to $30 million with a good portion of that being offshore and then the level of debt will be around 200, a little bit north of 200 million.", "Unidentified Analyst ", "Okay great, and then you gave us a slide deck for Varex when you were doing the road show that had 147 million of revenue in the first quarter of 2016. And so if you do the comparison year-over-year it's not 7% it's more like 3% or 4%, is there just some sort of difference there? ", "Clarence Verhoef", "Yeah, it's a little bit of an apples and oranges. That 147 includes the intercompany sales to oncology. So you would actually take the Varian Imaging Components number of 152 and add 5 million to it if you are going to look at Varex as a standalone entity, and then you're back to 7% again.", "Unidentified Analyst ", "I see and then just to clarify what you're saying Clarence about EPS, the GAAP guidance you're giving us includes stock comp and DNA so it is just a pure GAAP number?", "Clarence Verhoef", "That's exactly right.", "Unidentified Analyst ", "Okay and then on the close of the PKI deal I seem to recall you guys originally saying sort of April, May, maybe now you're saying summer, has there been a change there?", "Clarence Verhoef", "No, April is the earliest that it can be done. We've put built out into the actual purchase agreement that April is the earliest. But it's just that the assumption is that the Hart Scott Rodino review process could take longer if it goes through a second review cycle and the like. And so, it's totally a speculation at this point time. I, from a planning perspective we're planning it out as if it\u2019s the first of April but the timing could be delayed just because of that process.", "Unidentified Analyst ", "Okay, and then in terms of orders at Varex, can you sort of talk about your largest customer order patterns there up year-over-year or they just sort of in line stable? And any comments on China versus Japan, I guess Sunny alluded to that in his comments?", "Sunny Sanyal", "Yes, so I\u2019ll take it as two separate questions. In general we see strength in our CT tubes business in China and that continues to be a good solid trend for us we've made a lot of investments in that area and it's a core part of our growth strategy. Orders performance has been consistent with how this business has performed so there's nothing unusual there. Their performance with our largest customer Toshiba continues to be -- it's come back towards normal and the relationship and everything we do with them is solid foundations are very strong there.", "Unidentified Analyst ", "As you alluded to Sunny a little bit of volumes versus price with the volumes being strong and price somewhat we see you still seeing the impact of the renegotiations due to FX in late 2015 maybe a little more color around some of the pricing?", "Sunny Sanyal", "So, first of all the price pressures are predominantly in the low end of the detector space which is a radiographic detectors which is also our smaller part of our detectors business. In there the price -- those price adjustments that happen that were at one point triggered by the FX situation but in general pricing in that segment even after, it was a onetime correction but we saw a pretty significant prior significant price adjustment. But now the price erosion is down to what I would call as historical levels there in the mid single-digits range and that's what we saw in this quarter but we had good volume which offset that.", "Unidentified Analyst ", "Great, thanks for the color and good luck.", "Sunny Sanyal", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. We have no further questions in queue at this time I'd like to hand the floor back over to management for closing remarks.", "Dow R. Wilson", "Thank you and thank you all for participating.

Thank you, Mr. Sias, you may begin.", "Spencer Sias", "Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Varian Medical Systems conference call for the second quarter of fiscal year 20 15. With me are Dow Wilson, President and CEO; Elisha Finney, CFO, and Clarence Verhoef, our Corporate Controller. Dow and Elisha will summarize our results, then we'll take your questions following the presentation. To simplify our discussion unless otherwise stated all references to the quarter or year are fiscal quarters and fiscal years. Quarterly comparisons are for the second quarter of fiscal 2015 versus the second quarter of fiscal 2014, references to financial results for orders are the gross orders unless otherwise indicated.", "Please be advised that this presentation and discussion contains forward-looking statements, our use of words and phrases such as outlook, believe, expect, anticipate, could, should, will, and \u2013 I lost the second page, so I'm just going to say \u2013 I can continue, and similar expressions are intended to identify those statements which represent our current judgment on future performance or other future matters.

We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this presentation and discussion because of new information, future events, or otherwise.", "And now here is Dow.", "Dow Wilson", "Good afternoon and welcome. For the second quarter of fiscal 2015 we generated good earnings that were achieved in the face of significant currency headwinds. In summary, we are reporting net earnings of $1.05 per diluted share, revenues of $759 million, down 2% in dollars but up 2% in constant currency. Excellent cost control efforts that helped our gross and operating margins, double-digit oncology orders growth in the Americas that largely offset declines in EMEA and APAC, challenges in our imaging components business with the clients in orders and revenues and two big wins in our proton business.", "Let's talk about each of the businesses in more detail starting with oncology. Second quarter gross orders for Oncology Systems rose by 15% in North America and by nearly 10% in China, partially offsetting currency related weakness across the bulk of the international markets. Oncology gross orders totaled $581 million for the quarter, down 5% versus the year ago quarter but equal to the year ago quarter on a constant currency basis. Looking at Oncology three geographies, gross orders in the Americas rose 12% in dollars and constant currency. Gross orders in EMEA declined 24% in dollars and 13% in constant currency, principally due to weakness in Africa and India, where we had strong orders in the year ago quarter and business tends to be lumpy. In APAC, gross orders fell by 15% in dollars and 8% in constant currency, principally due to weakness in Japan.", "For the first half, oncology gross orders growth rates were as follows; worldwide, even in dollars and up 4% in constant currency, Americas up 5% in both dollars and constant currency, EMEA down 8% in dollars and up 1% in constant currency, and APAC down 1% in dollars, and up 5% in constant currency. Our strong order growth in North America during the quarter was highlighted by several large long term deals, the largest of which was the project with HCA to equip its Sarah Cannon Cancer Center in Tennessee with seven linear accelerators including six systems. This installation will also have our new rapid plan and analytics [ph] software using data analytics tools for treatment planning and information management. The HCA order is an example of the move towards consolidated networks making purchasing decisions aimed at standardizing clinical operations.", "The need for integrated clinical solutions drove many customer decisions during the quarter to replace competitive hardware and software product from multiple vendors in favor of a single Varian system. Clinical integration of treatment planning and delivery, as well as information management for safe, efficient, and effective workflow is a key Varian advantage. In Latin America, currency headwinds led to some purchasing delays that resulted in modest decline in orders. In EMEA we had sizeable wins in Germany, Bulgaria, Finland, and in the UK; Bayer Healthcare, one of the UK's biggest private hospital chains ordered two true beams together with our full software suite for a planned new radiotherapy and radiosurgery facility in Jumpford FX [ph].", "In APAC, weakness in Japan and Australia overshadowed our growth in China. In Japan, orders were flat in constant currency and down in dollars. The market remained sluggish, however, we gained share there during the quarter. Currency was also a culprit in Australia where a stronger dollar caused some customers to pull back on purchasing decisions. In China we booked an $18 million order following a public tender by the People's Liberation Army. During the quarter we also successfully launched the Edge Radiosurgery System in front of more than 250 customers at the Annual China Med Exhibition in Beijing. China remains a healthy market for us.", "Order activity during the quarter was slow in other emerging markets including Brazil, India, Africa and Russia; Russia in particular remained very quiet. The long term need for cancer treatment products remained high in developing markets with a number of diagnosed cases is rising, and where radiation therapy is among the most cost effective treatment. In past calls we have talked about expanding our product portfolio to offer more to customers in global markets. Over the weekend at the ESTRO show in Barcelona, Varian announced VitalBeam, a significant addiction to our line of linear accelerators.", "VitalBeam leverages Varian\u2019s basic two beam technology to provide clinics with new cost competitive options for delivering image-guided radiotherapy. It can be equipped with accessories including rapid arc, respiratory gating, onboard imaging, and 80 or 120-leaf collimators. VitalBeam is a scalable and upgradeable system that affordably meets the clinical needs of hospitals today and as they grow in the future. It's optimized for advanced radiotherapy. VitalBeam is targeted at the core radiotherapy market where it can serve as a work horse in busy clinics. Customer interest at ESTRO was very high and we plan to make it available to customers in Europe first, while seeking clearances around the rest of the world. CE mark, FDA 510-K and other international regulatory approvals have not yet been obtained. VitalBeam is currently not available for sale in any market. We will continue to invest in R&D to bring more products like VitalBeam to market.", "In March, we held our annual research partner symposium, a two and a half day scientific meeting in Atlanta on the future of cancer care. It attracted 150 leading clinicians and research partners from 71 institutions and 15 countries. They shared ideas and presentations on their work with knowledge based planning, data analytics, stereotactic radiosurgery, and advanced imaging technology. It was an exciting meeting and we can see a clear path to the development of significant new treatment capabilities that will dramatically improve the speed and precision of radiotherapy and radiosurgery. The next steps will be every bit as exciting as IMRT, IVRT, SBRT, Rapid Arc, Rapid Plan and TrueBeam.", "Let me turn now to our imaging components business. Gross orders for imaging components fell by 24% to $156 million for the quarter, and revenues fell by 8% to $155 million. Imaging components had a tough comparison with very high panel orders in the year ago quarter as a result of orders that flipped from the first to the second quarter last year. Additionally, orders in sales for tubes and panels were impacted by pricing pressures related to the devaluations in the yen and the euro. Very strong dollar is causing some customers to reduce inventories, insource or look elsewhere for lower cost alternative to our component. Orders and sales of our security and inspection products also fell sharply in the quarter. And these products [ph] have been delayed and it appears that customers have already ordered most of what they need for the next few quarters as they work through the backlog.", "For the first half, orders for tubes and panels were up 6% and sales were flat. However, orders and sales for our security products were down significantly. While we remain optimistic about the long term growth prospect, we believe that this business will continue to face challenging conditions in the near term. The company's other category comprised of the Varian Particle Therapy business and the Ginzton Technology Center recorded gross orders of $44 million and generated $14 million in revenue.", "It was a big quarter for our proton business, we won a public tender and booked an order for a ProBeam installation at Aarhus in Denmark. In addition, Varian was announced as the preferred bidder for two proton therapy centers that will be constructed in the United Kingdom over the next two years. The contacts for these projects are due to be signed during the summer and we expect to book the equipment portion of these orders at that time. With a strong backlog in the sales pipeline we're starting to see some real momentum in our Particle Therapy business.", "Now I will turn it over to Elisha.", "Elisha Finney ", "Thanks Dow, and hello everyone. Before I walk you through the P&L, let me touch on backlog. The company ended the quarter with $3.1 billion backlog. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $53 million bringing net orders for the company to $729 million. The adjustment includes $12 million related to currency exchange rates.", "Second quarter revenues for the total company decreased 2% in dollars and increased 2% in constant currency. Total company revenues in the Americas were up 11% in dollars and up 12% in constant currency. EMEA revenues were down 1% in dollars but up 10% in constant currency. APAC revenues were down 25% in dollars and down 21% in constant currency. For the first half, total company revenues were flat in dollars and up 4% in constant currency. Oncology Systems posted a 2% decline in revenues during the quarter bringing the revenue growth for the first half to 1%. Imaging components posted a second quarter revenue decline of 8% with small declines in our tubes and flat panel products, and a 45% decline in our security and inspection products.", "For the first half, imaging components revenues were down 3% from the year-ago period with gains in flat panels more than offset by declines in tubes, as well as significant declines in security and inspection products. Revenues for the other category increased significantly from the year ago quarter as we continued production and installation of several proton projects that are in our backlog. Total company gross margin for the quarter rose 30 basis points to 42.5% with increases in all of our businesses. Oncology Systems gross margin increased 18 basis points from the year ago quarter to 43% as favorable product and geographic mix more than offset the negative currency impact on revenue.", "For the first half, oncology's gross margin increased nearly half a point to 44.3%. The imaging components gross margin for the quarter increased by 216 basis points to 43.7% due largely to a higher mix of panel products, product cost reductions, and improved quality costs. For the first half, imaging components' gross margin increased nearly 1.5 points to 42.9%.", "Second quarter SG&A expenses were 117 million, or 15% of revenues, an improvement of 250 basis points as a percent of revenues from the year-ago quarter when we had a large patent litigation settlement. SG&A includes a $3 million charge during the quarter to complete the restructuring that was largely implemented last quarter. I think it's worth mentioning that SG&A expenses were down significantly from last quarter as the cost savings from the restructuring have started to flow through the P&L. Second quarter R&D expenses were $59 million or 8% of revenues, even as a percentage of revenue with the year-ago quarter. And for the first half, R&D expenses were about even as a percentage of revenue at 8%.", "Moving down the income statement, second quarter operating earnings totaled $146 million, or 19% of revenue. Depreciation and amortization totaled $16 million for the quarter and $33 million for the first half. The effective tax rate at 28% was up 35 basis points from the year-ago period when we benefited from a patent litigation settlement. We now believe the tax rate for the full fiscal year will be 27% to 29%. Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased from the year ago quarter to $101 million shares due largely to our ongoing repurchase program.", "Diluted earnings per share was $1.05 for the second quarter including the $0.02 restructuring charge.", "Turning to the balance sheet we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $862 million, debt of $513 million, and stockholders' equity of $1.67 billion. DSO at 88 was improved seven days from the year-ago quarter. Second quarter cash flow from operations was $53 million, less than net income primarily due to working capital increases in inventory and accounts receivable. For the first half, cash flow from operations was $132 million. Primary uses of cash were $76 million for the repurchase of about 825,000 shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 3.9 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2015.", "Now I will turn it back to Dow for the outlook.", "Dow Wilson", "Thanks, Elisha. We believe that for fiscal year 2015 total company earnings will be in the range of $4.02 to $4.14 per diluted share, and that revenues will increase by about 1% to 2% in dollars and by about 5% in constant currency. We now expect that challenges in our imaging components business and currency headwinds will more than offset the earnings momentum of the first half. We estimate that imaging components could negatively impact earnings by about $0.08 to $0.12 per share.", "Additionally, since our guidance last quarter the strength of the dollar has diminished our earnings expectations by another $0.06 to $0.10 per diluted share. For the third quarter of fiscal 2015 we believe total company revenues should be about equal to the prior year period in dollars, and up about 4% in constant currency. Net earnings per diluted share for the third quarter could be in the range of $0.90 to $0.94 per diluted share. The outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2015 excludes any impact of proton orders not yet booked into the backlog. ", "Let me finish with a comment on the significant impact of the strong US dollar. Since last October when we first guided for fiscal year 2015 the strengthening of the dollar has cost us about $0.30 per diluted share not accounting the competitive challenges that this has presented to our imaging component business. The good news is that we've managed to largely offset this in our operations.", "We are now ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.", "Jeffrey Johnson", "Thank you, good evening, guys. Can you hear me okay?", "Dow Wilson", "Hi, Jeff.", "Elisha Finney", "Yes.", "Jeffrey Johnson", "Great. So Let me start \u2013 I don't think I have ever started this way but I'm going to start on the imaging business. So Dow, I hear what you are saying there on some of the dollar impact and all that. Kind of run me through the Hitachi deal I thought kind of helped mitigate some of the volatility and there was some minimum purchase requirements and all. Is it that others on the margin outside of that deal where those variances are coming relative to prior expectations, or how should we think about that?", "Dow Wilson", "Sure, let me walk you through it. First of all from a profit...", "Jeffrey Johnson", "So sorry, my fault, sorry.", "Dow Wilson", "That's okay. Toshiba is our largest customer. We have seen a little bit of weakness from Toshiba, the Japan equipment market is very soft. Equipment is \u2013 most of the business is a service business but the equipment business, Japan equipment business is off for them, and that's been an impact. But you heard us say on the half, you do have to kind of look at the half to see what's really going on. The panel business is still a very strong double-digit business, and the first half, it's going well north of up 10%.", "Elisha Finney", "14%.", "Dow Wilson", "14% on orders in the first half. The tube business is about flat in the first half, and in orders, and SIP, our security and inspection business is where we've taken a big hit. We had some big orders last year and then we think with the inventory that people have they're kind of taken care of for a while. So we see that as kind of the ongoing part here.", "And in tube and panel, you know, we are concerned \u2013 combined panel and tube together, 6% in the first half, that's not kind of 8 to 12 that we've done historically, so we're a little bit worried there. I'd say people are being very careful and holding back purchases. We think it will come back, but it's a little cloudy as to what it's going to be here over the next six months.", "Jeffrey Johnson", "Okay. And then any update at all on Maryland? And Elisha, just want to ask one question on FX.", "Dow Wilson", "I'll start on Maryland, and Elisha can fix it. We have made significant progress towards financing this past quarter, and we know it's been frustrating for everybody but we're feeling good about where it is. It is still not done yet, we won't book until it's complete so it is still not in our guidance for the year. There is some probability that could happen this quarter or next quarter, so that's the good news but we're not going to put it in guidance until everything's signed up. When it does book, just as a reminder for everybody, it will be about $80 million in both orders and revenues and around $0.20 of EPS.", "Jeffrey Johnson", "Got it. And then just on currency, Elisha, I just want to make sure I'm understanding the comments over the last few quarters. I thought last quarter, the currency impact for the year was up to $0.30, then another $0.06 to $0.10 here. And Dow I think you referenced in your prepared remarks you're hurdling $0.30 for the year altogether. So just trying to reconcile, I thought we were at $0.30 already last quarter plus the $0.06 to $0.10 incremental this quarter. Am I missing something there or am I misremembering?", "Elisha Finney", "Jeff, I would have to go back and take a look at that, since we gave guidance in Q1, we had another FX impact of about $0.18. So if you look back at January, we were facing guidance on a euro rate of around $1.14 to $1.15 as we've talked about. Recently up to today it's been closer to the $1.07, $1.08 revenues coming in April are closer to that range. So that's the delta that we're now talking about. If the euro were to come back to the $1.11, $1.12 rate that we saw today and stay there for the balance of the quarter, obviously that would be good news and could help us get back to the higher end of that range. But currencies have just been all over the map and so we're trying to look at it as where it's been trending the past week which was closer to the $1.07 range.", "Jeffrey Johnson", "Okay, that's helpful. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jason Wittes with Brean Capital. Please proceed with your question.", "Jason Wittes", "Hi, thanks for taking the question. If I could just follow up on imaging, it seems like this is more than your temporary destocking issue hitting that business. It sounds like you think this will be a little bit more prolonged than we have seen in the past. Am I characterizing this correctly or how do you think about sort of what's happened in this quarter and the outlook for the rest of the year but that's basically three quarters.", "Dow Wilson", "We think that certainly the security and inspection piece is going to be a big issue for us all year. So on that aspect of it, you're right, we \u2013 as I said, when you look at the panel and \u2013 panel business is doing great going 14% in the first half. The tube business is flat in the first half. Combine it together, 6%. We'd like to see two or three more points on that. So we have seen people be very careful with their purchases. Will that come back? We do know that people are \u2013 it is hard to move because we're designed in. But they are looking at other sourcing options and in-sourcing options in the case of some competitors. The exchange rate has moved a nickel here just this week, maybe that helps us out a little bit as we look at the second half. Anyway, I mean, I think the bottom line is, when you look at the business I think it's fair to say that we've got some challenges here in the near term, two of them panel markets are likely to grow in the mid-single digit range, that 5%, 6%, 7% range is probably about right for panel and two of them comes from market growth.", "Jason Wittes", "Just to push a little further, just to understand, I mean most of your panels and tubes are made, I think, in Utah. So that the US dollar manufacturing, that's obviously gotten more expensive so that's part of why some of especially the lower cost customers are looking other places. Is that the right way to think about?", "Elisha Finney", "Yes, Jason, I mean \u2013 because like we've said many times, we sell in dollars, so the direct FX impact has not affecting us, but what I'm kind of referring to is an indirect impact of the exchange rates. We are just less competitive relative to Japanese or European manufacturers right now. And holding inventory, helping, we suspect customers are going to bleed inventory down to the bare bones and hoping they can bay at a better rate.", "Jeffrey Johnson", "Okay. One other question I wanted to ask about was VitalBeam. I assume, you guys have talked a lot about coming out with products for emerging mark that are both cheaper but also lower cost for you guys to produce as a way of maintaining or even helping your \u2013 or even boosting your gross margin. Is VitalBeam sort of part of that process? Is there a way to think about?", "Dow Wilson", "Absolutely. Your VitalBeam is the force of many, so I think this is an important growing market for us \u2013 as we've said too many times last year we took up R&D pretty significantly last year because we saw a lot of opportunity in the number of markets. One of those being value segments around the world.", "Jeffrey Johnson", "Okay, thanks. I'll jump back in queue.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.", "Tycho Peterson", "Actually I just want to pick up on that last line of questioning. Was there any disruption in the order book from VitalBeam from the sales people knowing about coming for the emerging mark orders? Just trying to figure that.", "Dow Wilson", "I don't think so at all. I think you kind of heard that go around, maybe that's worth hitting for just a second. Just as a reminder, the Americas was great, so gross orders were up 12% in the Americas. North America was up 14%, so that was terrific. EMEA, as I said, was down when you look at year-to-date, year-to-date gross orders are up, constant currency 1% in EMEA, and that feels okay, we would obviously like to do better than that. We've been surprised by the strength in western Europe, we've been weak in eastern Europe, Russia; we had a weak Q2 in India and in Africa. So \u2013 Africa and India tend to be lumpy, I think the Russia, eastern Europe impact is a political one. But I think we'll see India and Africa come back. And then we did have a tough comp for our EMEA organization where last year we had a large Algeria order. In Asia, you have heard the story a little bit, year-to-date gross orders are up 5% in constant currency in Asia. In China we were up 9%. So we still feel very good about where we are in China.", "The Japan market year-over-year, we think it's down pretty substantially, there is some retrenchment going on in Japan, the market feels like it's down 30ish percent. The good news is, as I mentioned, we've had a very strong performance in market share in Japan, and it's nice to see that coming around. Then of course the other impact we have in Japan is the yen\u2019s off pretty substantially and hitting us there as well in Japan. So that's kind of a go around the globe. Elisha, would you add anything there?", "Elisha Finney", "No, sounds good.", "Dow Wilson", "Does that answer your question Tycho?", "Tycho Peterson", "That helps. And then I guess just as we think about the opportunity for VitalBeam, it's unique as a proxy or I'm just trying to understand how you think about these?", "Dow Wilson", "Sure, it's a really good question. As I said, the really great thing about VitalBeam it's built on the TrueBeam platform, so it gives our customers a ton of upgradeability, they can scale up IMRT, IVRT, Rapid Arc, they can put a mega voltage imager on it, or mega voltage and killer voltage imager, they can go down market with an 80 multi-leaf collimator, we haven't done that before. It's got a dose rate that's optimized for radiation therapy at 14000 monitor units. The TrueBeam is still optimized for SRT \u2013 for SRS and SBRT, and TrueBeam still has all the motion management, the six degree of freedom couch, the high definition, collimator flatten and culture free in all of our triggered imaging capabilities.", "The difference between VitalBeam and Unique, Unique is built on our C series platform, it's a single energy system, and it's really the entry-level product. So I don't think these \u2013 we see this as really kind of between Unique and TrueBeam, and fulfilling a space where we can be more competitive. I think it's going to give us better price support, TrueBeam, and it's not going to compete with the Unique at all. And we still have the rest of the product line, the IX and the trilogy that kind of fit in there as well. So we feel very good about the way this product lines up. I guess just kind of reiterate the point, I don't think there was \u2013 I would like to say there was some impact from people waiting in these markets for VitalBeam but I don't think so in this last quarter.", "Tycho Peterson", "Okay. And then just lastly on software, you guys have done a good job there, you called out HCA. I mean is rapid plan coming up in most of your discussions with consolidated networks? And can you maybe just talk to how much share you can pick up? I know you've put out overall goals.", "Dow Wilson", "I mean the response of rapid plan has been huge. I think we're in the top half of the first inning still of that diffusion. I will say at our research symposium, people extremely excited about what rapid plan can do. We've talked about it a lot in the context of quality, in terms of letting everybody in the world do the absolute best care. But I think the other thing that people are getting ready excited about is the efficiency aspect of the product. And we had a paper presented at ESTRO last week where one institution was seeing 90-minute reduction in planning times. So that's per plan, that's huge. And all of a sudden you start to get the same productivity and the symmetry that we had. When we launched Rapid Arc, Rapid Arc was about productivity in the delivery room. Now we're talking about patient productivity in planning 90-minutes, where do you get that kind of productivity, it's huge. And by the way this is a Varian only thing, research can't do this, and Electa can't do this, Pinnacle can't do this. So we're really first to market with a terrific product, great quality and great efficiency.", "Tycho Peterson", "Okay, thank you.", "Dow Wilson", "I'm selling hard there, Tyco, you should buy one.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.", "David Roman", "I wanted just to start with a few detailed follow-ups on the guidance, and hopefully my math is correct here. As I look at the operating margin progression that sort of implied by the guidance for the rest of the year, it does look like you're contemplating a very significant fall-off in profitability in the third quarter and a big bounce back in 4Q. And while I understand revenue volumes have something to do with the overall profitability, you would still be down materially on operating margins year-over-year in the third quarter despite relatively flat revenue. Can you just help us understand the gyrations in profitability over the balance of the year?", "Elisha Finney", "Absolutely, David. And really it's just \u2013 when we look at the shippable backlog and what we expect to deliver in Q3, it is very significantly shifting to international and to emerging marks. So it's really reflected in the gross margin based on geography. We had the opposite effect in Q2 where we had a significant increase in North America deliveries. It's just the way the machines land, I would say in Q4 in the year ago period if you remember we had strong orders in North America. So Q4 will be again more North American focused, and so it's just the way it breaks down. I wouldn't read too much into quarter-to-quarter but really just kind of looking at the year. And interestingly on the year, if you exclude all of the augmenix [ph] and the patent litigation from last year, and you exclude the restructuring from this year, we're actually going up about 10 basis points in margin. So I look at that and say apples-to-apples, we're doing a really good job on controlling costs and that the restructuring is starting to pay off. So I would just caution you to look at the years versus one quarter.", "David Roman", "Okay, understood. And then I guess a follow-up on the restructuring, it looks like a very fast impact for the comments in your prepared remarks, and also in the numbers. Are we getting to a point where the direct costs take out opportunity is reaching a plateau or is there still more opportunity to go on the SG&A line without seeing a pickup in revenue?", "Elisha Finney", "Yes, I mean you saw from immediate impact on the restructuring because the bulk of that was implemented in the first quarter. And so those heads came out of payroll immediately when that was executed. So you will continue to see that flow through the P&L. Now that said, we are continuing to replace some of those retirees and lower cost jurisdictions. So don't hold me to no headcount increases because that won't happen, but we did see a significant improvement in SG&A. It can be lumpy, I will caution that, but I feel very good about how the businesses have controlled headcount, how we've controlled travel expenditures, and all of our costs.", "David Roman", "Okay. And then my last question, it's sort of a longer term one, and understandably this business does have quarter-to-quarter fluctuations and order timing delivery, macroeconomic factors, etcetera, but as I think about what you talked about as a multi-year revenue goal, something like 68%. You just haven't gotten there the past several quarters; I think the trailing four quarter constant currency average revenue growth is below 5% and closer to 4%. So what gives you the confidence in being able to see that type of sharp acceleration and be able to perform at that higher level sustainably?", "Elisha Finney", "So if I look at the full year in dollars, we're expecting 1% to 2% as we talked about, and constant currency is going to be between 5% and 6%. Now a significant part of that is coming from growth in our proton therapy business year-over-year. But \u2013 you get me back to $1.27, $1.30 euro, we can turn in that kind of growth. This is clearly FX related and unprecedented levels on the euro and the yen that we're facing today.", "David Roman", "Understood. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.", "Vijay Kumar", "Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. So Dow, I apologize if I'm repeating my question. I just hopped on the call. Can you give some clarity on the cancellations within the quarter \u2013 it looks like, if I'm looking at may math, oncology was high singles or maybe low doubles; and could you talk about sort of what drove that acceleration? I mean, sequentially it looks like it's worsen.", "Elisha Finney", "Vijay, actually if you were to look at the year ago period, backlog adjustments at $53 million are down. In that $53 million \u2013 I think it was $59 million in the year ago period. In that $53 million, there is $12 million related to FX, and that's because when we put something into backlog, we put it in at that rate and then it is held at that rate in dollars. So when the revenue comes out at a different exchange rate, we have to adjust our backlog to make the math work. So though we put the order in at the exchange rate of today, I know that's a little complicated answer, so there is an FX impact of $12 million in the quarter, as well as we had a $10 million, $11 million outright cancellation of a tender for our security and inspection products business. I believe it was the Saudi Arabia tender that was just delayed indefinitely, so we took that order out of our backlog. So oncology, actually if you look at those two things, they had a very low rate of dormant fee or cancellation in the quarter.", "Vijay Kumar", "Got you, and that was helpful. Maybe on the imaging side, and I understand you have a large customer, sort of \u2013 can you maybe just talk about the longer term sort of trends? Because imaging in past, I mean it's been a fantastic business, probably doesn't get as much attention, but then when you look at the EBIT line the contribution has been pretty significant. So I'm just trying to sort of put this into context and probably some of this was FX or maybe on the longer term outlook for this market.", "Dow Wilson", "No, we still really love the long term prospects to this business, the whole shift from analog to digital products is driving the flat panel business. We actually think that, in fact, as that cost and price comes down, we're opening up more and more markets for that growth. So we think the panel business is going to continue to be a very strong and good market for us. I think we've got some short term perturbations, we're looking at our supply chain, comment was already made relative to the cost of businesses, very good dollar denominated, and do we need to do something to have a little bit more of a natural hedge and make sure we've got the cost position that we need with this kind of global currency market fluctuation that we've seen. But we think the long term of the business is still very, very positive; we love the business model that we have, it's a very low cost distribution and service business. So that's terrific, and frankly, we love to add on to it, and are even looking at some inorganic opportunities to maybe grow the portfolio.", "Vijay Kumar", "Got you. And maybe if I can squeeze out one more in, I'm not sure if your commentary on product versus service growth within the oncology systems in the quarter?", "Elisha Finney", "Yes, service on the revenue side for the quarter was up 4%, 9% year-to-date. Orders were about flat, and that really is just a timing issue related to when contracts get renewed.", "Dow Wilson", "And currency.", "Elisha Finney", "And currency, yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.", "Dow Wilson", "Hi, Steve.", "Steve Beuchaw", "Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Sorry if it was embedded in that last response somewhere, but did you give a software growth number for the quarter?", "Dow Wilson", "We did not.", "Elisha Finney", "No, but it was up $7 million or $8 million quarter-over-quarter versus year ago period and revenue.", "Steve Beuchaw", "Quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year?", "Elisha Finney", "I don't have year-on-year but it should be up in revenues. I believe it was up last quarter as well.", "Steve Beuchaw", "Okay. And then we're here in late April, so I'll ask the obligatory reimbursement question. I guess it's less interesting than some years given that CMS laid out so much in the final rule last year about where they were going, but I wonder if you've heard anything from your DC folks about where you think reimbursement goes this year, whether it's in terms of structure or rates? Thanks.", "Dow Wilson", "I'd say is it's been pretty quiet, we have not heard anything new in the last quarter or so. So it's been pretty quiet on the eastern front.", "Steve Beuchaw", "That's impressive that you know that considering that you're on the west coast. Well, thanks so much, guys. Have a good day.", "Operator", "There are no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Sias for closing comments.", "Spencer Sias", "Thank you.

We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this presentation and discussion because of new information, future events or otherwise. ", "Before we start this call, please mark your calendars for our mid-year review meeting with investors in New York at 11:30 a.m. on Monday, May 7 at the Intercontinental Hotel Times Square. We'll issue more details on this meeting and webcast tomorrow. ", "And now, here's Tim.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Good afternoon, and welcome. Today, we're reporting results for the second quarter of 2012 with healthy growth in revenue, net orders and backlog but with mixed margin results. ", "Earnings were $0.94 including a $0.02 restructuring charge associated with the realignment of resources to support our ongoing growth in emerging markets. I will comment on the operational highlights for the quarter as well as our exciting newly announced global collaboration with Siemens, and Elisha will walk you through the numbers. ", "To summarize our second quarter 2012 results compared to the year-ago quarter, company revenues for the quarter rose by 11% to $720 million. Net orders were up nicely in all of our businesses and our backlog increased by 18% to $2.7 billion. Excluding proton, order backlog was up 12%.", "Our company gross margin dropped by more than 3 points with a record margin in our X-ray Product business that was more than offset by reduced margin in our Oncology business and higher-than-expected proton revenues that were booked on a 0 profit percentage of completion basis. ", "Turning to our Oncology Systems business, second quarter revenues were $565 million, up 11% from the year-ago quarter. However, margins in this business declined to an unusually low level in the quarter due to a significant geographic mix to lower-margin countries, weaker pricing in those markets and slower-than-anticipated progress in product cost reduction programs. These programs should begin to show results during the second half of the year when we expect margins to recover somewhat to more historical levels. ", "Net orders totaled $565 million, up 9% with a 14% increase in North America and a 4% increase in our overall international market, which accounted for 55% of the total orders for this business during the period. Second quarter orders in the North American market, which experienced some push outs in the first quarter of this year, included a major win at Montreal General Hospital which replaced an -- which, excuse me, which placed an order for several TrueBeam systems. Several other sites placed orders for multiple TrueBeam units during the period including the Thomas Jefferson University Hospital system and New York-Presbyterian Hospital. ", "Software orders in North America were also strong, including competitive replacements or treatment planning and information systems at several sites. We are particularly pleased to have achieved double-digit growth in North America on top of double-digit growth in the comparable prior year quarter. ", "In the international market, compared to the second quarter of last year, net orders rose 30% in Asia on an easy comp and increased 1% in Europe on a tough comp. In the rest of the world, net orders declined versus very strong growth in the year-ago quarter. Second quarter orders in China rose by more than 50%, reflecting a successful effort to revitalize and restructure our sales force there. Thailand and Taiwan also drove the strong orders performance in Asia. We booked our first TrueBeam orders in Japan and Taiwan and installed our first TrueBeam systems in Korea. We are hopeful that this platform will become a growth driver in this important region. ", "In Europe, we had mixed results, many countries growing and others, quiet. At this time, it's difficult to draw any conclusions regarding the impact of financial and banking worries on the European market. It appears the market has continued to invest in better clinical capability, albeit, in a sporadic and somewhat lumpy fashion. ", "TrueBeam comprised more than 45% of our high-energy machine orders during the quarter. We booked more than 60 TrueBeam orders during the quarter, and we now have nearly 490 orders for this system since its introduction 2 years ago. It is gratifying to see the total accelerator unit order volume was up versus the year-ago quarter even as TrueBeam becomes a higher percentage of orders compared to our other high-energy models. We now have more than 230 installations complete or in progress around the globe. ", "As you know, our goal is to help save more lives every year by advancing the clinical capability of our technology. So I would like to update you on key studies that have been published in the last quarter. We believe that these types of studies play an important role in driving long-term market growth. The use of IMRT for prostate cancer treatment has been the subject of much debate. I'm pleased to report that a study published last week in the Journal of the American Medical Association supports the use of IMRT for this disease. ", "Another prostate cancer study at Memorial Sloan-Kettering showed that image-guided IMRT is superior to IMRT without image guidance. This data appears in a paper that is in the process of being published by the International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology and Physics, or the Red Journal, as it is known in the industry. ", "Moving on to tumors of the brain and spine. Clinicians at the University of Alabama at Birmingham have published 2 articles on their use of Varian technology for radiosurgery. One group reporting in practical radiation oncology found that it could treat up to 4 brain metastases simultaneously using RapidArc radiosurgery and that it could do it within 15 minutes, an order of magnitude faster than is possible with conventional cobalt and robotic surgery systems without any sacrifice in the position or quality of treatment.", "A second group, which published its results in the Journal of Radiosurgery and SBRT used the fast-dose delivery speed of our TrueBeam STx system to treat tumors of the brain or spine in an average time of 11 minutes. Typically, these demanding procedures can take upwards of an hour at lower dose delivery rates, which is not only hard on the patient but also very expensive. These studies mark the progress that is being made in the fight to control cancer with radiotherapy and radiosurgery and enhance efficiency of these treatments methods. I recommend that you read them to fully appreciate the work that is being done in this field. We expect to see more of these studies as trials for lung and liver treatments get underway. ", "Coincident with issuing our second quarter earnings performance, we announced a major new partnership with Siemens today. This is an exciting development that will enable Varian to enhance and expand its clinical offerings to the benefit of cancer patients around the globe. By developing strong software connectivity and new architecture, linking Siemens and Varian Systems together, we can give clinics an important new options for imaging and treating patients. ", "Another key objective of this partnership is to accelerate innovation and provide more efficient and effective solutions, particularly in emerging markets. Varian will represent Siemens diagnostic imaging products, such as CT, PET-CT, or MRI, to radiation oncology clinics around the world beginning immediately in most international markets and expand it in North America later this year. ", "Siemens Healthcare will similarly represent Varian equipment and software for radiotherapy and radiosurgery within its offerings to its healthcare customers. This will enable the companies to offer comprehensive solutions to support the entire clinical workflow from imaging to treatment. Siemens will continue to service and support its global installed base of approximately 2,000 medical linear accelerators. This agreement will give Siemens customers more choices for therapy equipment as aging accelerators are due for replacement. I believe this partnership will expand the growth opportunities for both of our companies, and we're very pleased to be working with Siemens in this endeavor. ", "Our X-ray Products business appears to be recovering from a weak first quarter when Japanese customers slowed purchasing in order to adjust their inventories. While the second quarter started slowly, it ended on a strong note, signaling that the inventory adjustment in Japan appears to be behind us. The business achieved record margins as the result of product mix, improved quality performance and cost controls. Net orders were $130 million, up 5% from the year-ago period and revenues rose 4% to $123 million. Sales of high-powered CT tubes in Japan were particularly strong. ", "Orders in our somewhat longer-cycle plant panel business were up in double digits with strong demand for our digital radiography products. We have now completed our previously announced acquisition of InfiMed, thereby adding imaging processing workstations, hardware and software to the X-Ray Products portfolio. The addition of InfiMed's products and technical expertise will enable Varian to better serve our X-ray customers as a one-stop shop for X-ray tubes, flat panel image detectors and workstations. We expect that we will be able to offer more fully integrated X-ray component solutions that can be incorporated more easily into our customers' X-ray imaging systems. It should help our customers to achieve improved performance and time-to-market for their equipment. ", "Our Other category had a very good second quarter, both in the Varian Particle Therapy business and in our Security and Inspections Product business. Combined net orders for the category were $168 million with $124 million in 2 orders for our ProBeam Proton Therapy Systems and $44 million in net orders for Security and Inspection Products. As was reported earlier in the quarter, we booked an order for ProBeam system at a center that will be built in Saudi Arabia and another order for a proton clinic that will be built in St. Petersburg, Russia. Since September of last year, the Varian Particle Therapy business has booked $212 million in orders. We're delighted to see a gain momentum. ", "Our ongoing installation at the Scripps Proton Center near San Diego is going well. And I'm pleased to report that we hit a historic milestone last week when we successfully accelerated and extracted a $250 million electron volt proton beam from the superconducting cyclotron that we have installed there. Our installation work is continuing, and our next steps will be to commission the beam transport system and the gantry treatment rooms with a goal of enabling Scripps to commence patient treatments in 2013. The cyclotron is one of the key elements of the system and the realization of this milestone on schedule helps to validate the production, testing, transport and installation processes that were implemented over the past year.", "You also may have seen media coverage last week at the groundbreaking on a new proton therapy facility at the University of Maryland. We expect to book an equipment order from this center when the financing package of the project is complete. Orders in our Security business increased as customers won public tenders for more compact high-speed cargo screening installations with our materials discrimination technology in locations around the world. ", "And so now here is Elisha to cover the financials.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Great. Thanks, Tim, and hello, everyone. Typically, at the outset, I talk about constant currency growth rates. But this quarter, there is no need to discuss that as the U.S. dollar and constant currency growth rates for orders and sales are virtually identical for the quarter and year to date. ", "Second quarter revenues increased 11% to $720 million. Oncology Systems posted an 11% increase with strong revenue growth in Europe and rest of world. Revenues rose sharply in our emerging markets including BRIC countries, Turkey, Ukraine, Saudi and South Korea, while the U.S. revenues were up in single digits. Japanese revenues were down significantly from the year-ago quarter when we benefited from stimulus-generated delivery. ", "X-Ray Products posted a gain of 4% as revenues picked up in March with renewed spending in Japan. Revenues from businesses under the Other category increased by 42% including $14 million of revenue for the Scripps Proton Therapy contract. The Scripps revenue was above our forecast for the quarter as all of the remaining equipment was delivered on site. And for the year, we now believe that our total proton revenue could approximate $60 million. ", "The second quarter gross margin for the company fell by more than 3 points to 41.2%. Oncology Systems' gross margin declined by 3 points to 42.2% due primarily to a significant geographic shift away from our high-margin countries to our lower margin countries. For example, in Japan, where our customers tend to buy our most sophisticated equipment, revenues were down nearly 40% quarter-over-quarter, while the previously mentioned lower margin emerging market revenues were up nearly 30%. Additionally, in certain international markets, we are experiencing some competitive pricing pressure. For the second half, oncology margins should return to a more normal historical level of 44% to 45%.", "X-ray Products' gross margin hit a new record, climbing almost 3 points to 43% due largely to product mix and improved quality cost. The gross margin for the Other business and the total company was negatively impacted by the Scripps contract under which revenue is being recorded using the percentage of completion method. Under this method, revenues are initially recognized equal to cost, with the expectation that profits will be recognized toward the end of the project. ", "The Scripps contract negatively impacted the company's second quarter gross margin by nearly 1 point. For the year, we now expect that gross margin for the total company will decline by about 1 point from last year to between 42% and 43%. Second quarter SG&A expenses were $106 million or 15% of revenues, up slightly as a percentage of revenue from the year-ago quarter. SG&A was impacted by our $2.5 million restructuring charge, which involved a work force reduction in North America in order to support a realignment of resources and put more emphasis on sales and marketing activities in our emerging markets. For the second half, we expect to see higher than previously anticipated SG&A expenses due largely to increased legal expenses as well as start-up costs associated with our Siemens partnership. Second quarter R&D expenses were $47 million or 7% of revenues, down slightly as a percent of revenue with the year ago quarter. ", "Moving down the income statement. Second quarter operating earnings totaled $144 million, down 3 points to 20% of revenues. Excluding the restructuring charge and proton revenues, operating earnings for the quarter were 21% of revenue. Depreciation and amortization totaled $14 million for the quarter. The effective tax rate was 25.3% for the quarter, down about 6 points from the year-ago period due almost exclusively to the geographic shift in earnings toward lower tax jurisdictions. While the geographic shift had a negative effect on our gross margin, much of this effect is offset in a lower overall corporate tax rate. For fiscal year 2012, we now estimate that the tax rate will be approximately 28% for the third quarter and the full fiscal year. ", "Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased significantly from the year-ago quarter to $114.5 million due largely to our ongoing share repurchase programs. Including the $0.02 restructuring charge, diluted earnings per share rose 9% to $0.94. ", "Turning now to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalent of $617 million, debt of $162 million and stockholders equity of 1.4 billion. Subsequent to the close of the quarter, we have continued to pay down short-term debt under our revolving line of credit. And as of today, our total net debt is about $130 million. DSO increased by 4 days from the year ago quarter to 83 including a 5-day impact from the Particle Therapy business. ", "Second quarter cash flow from operations was $105 million, roughly equal with net earnings. Primary uses of cash were 75 million to repurchase 1.1 million shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 6 million shares remaining under a repurchase authorization. ", "Now, I'll turn it back over to Tim for the outlook.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Thanks, Elisha. Overall, in the second quarter, we had a lot of good news including strong growth in company revenue orders and backlog, 2 new proton system orders and a record gross margin in our X-ray Products business. We're now facing some margin challenges in our Oncology business as we invest and move into -- more aggressively into emerging markets and pursue product cost reductions. ", "Including the impact of oncology's gross margin, as well as increased costs for legal proceedings and start-up costs associated with the new Siemens partnership, we're now adjusting our outlook for the remainder of the year. For fiscal 2012, we now expect earnings from continuing operations to increase over fiscal 2011 total by 9% to 12% to a range of $3.76 to $3.84 per diluted share. Annual revenue should increase over the fiscal 2011 total by about 10%. For the third quarter, we expect earnings per share to increase by 10% to 14% over the prior year quarter to a range of $0.91 to $0.95 per diluted share. Revenues for the third quarter should be 9% to 10% over the third quarter of fiscal 2011. ", "Thank you for your attention, and we're now ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Jeremy Feffer with Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "I wanted to ask first on the margin issues from the quarter. What is giving you comfort that it was just a one quarter hiccup in the geographic mix and price reduction, things like that, will rebound in the second half?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Sure. Well -- I mean, we had a -- really, an unprecedented geographic shift in the second quarter where emerging markets up nearly 30% and our highest margin territory, Japan, where they tend to buy very rich feature set machines, being down almost 40%. We have -- historically, we've gone in, and when we look at the backlog, we look at region, and we can apply some averages for Europe, for Asia, for North America. What we have now done is we've gone into the backlog, machine by machine, and we're really looking at it based on the profitability and getting more granular in terms of going into these emerging markets and really looking at the margin impact. So when we look out into Q2 -- into Q3 and Q4, it's not going to be at the margin level that we had first anticipated because of all of the issues that we've talked about. But we do think it's going to get back to a -- closer to the historical range of the 44% to 45% levels for oncology.", "Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "And then staying with oncology, when Elekta reported its January quarter, they noted some particular weakness in Asia. You guys, obviously, saw some strength. Can you comment on the general market share trends there? Are you -- is this affirmation that you are picking up share in Asia?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Well, I think that everybody is seeing the same thing in Japan, which is that Japan is way down from the stimulus a few years ago. And as Elisha mentioned earlier, we were down -- I think, it was 40% from a year ago. So I think everybody was impacted by that, Elekta and Varian. I think we are doing better in China than people expected. I think we're doing better than anybody expected us to do in China, and that's good news. I think our new team is doing well, and that may be probably a majority of the explanation for the way Siemens -- I mean, excuse me, Elekta looks at it and the way Varian looks at it.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yes, and let me just clarify to make sure that Tim and I aren't confusing you, that the 40% decline is in revenues reflecting the prior year ending of the stimulus program. The orders for Japan and the Far East in general were very strong this quarter.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "A quick one on gross margins. Understanding, of course, that the geographic mix is a critical driver. Could you speak to the trends in terms of gross margins in developed markets over the last quarter, let's call it 2 quarters. I mean, has there been any breaking trends there? And then on the COGS programs that you referenced, how much would you expect these to contribute in terms of dollars or a fraction on margin?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Yes. Well, what we're seeing is that some countries are okay; other countries, other territories are not. And what's happening is it depends on the competitive profile of those countries, and it depends on the budgets in those countries. What we're seeing is that some of these locations, they just don't have the budget, but they still have an appetite for our very high-end machines. And so our sales forces are having to accommodate this in order to get this business. And so that's put pressure on certain countries. And so what we've seen in Q2 and what I think we're going to see more in Q3 and Q4 than we thought 3 months ago is we're seeing more of these shipments to these kinds of countries than was expected just even 3 months ago. And so as our backlog is filling up for the year, it helps us to get more and more accurate as the year goes on about what's going to happen. But as we fill out that backlog, it's becoming clear that countries like the United States and Japan, that formerly were a big part of our business and had -- and where people bought favorable mixes of machines are being replaced by locations where the mix is not so favorable. So that's kind of the general picture.", "Elisha W. Finney", "And I don't want to break the cost reductions down to exactly how much we're going to get, Steve, but suffice it to say that we're going to be aggressively going after it. We're going to be chipping it away, chipping away at it little by little, and this is something that we'll continue into next year as the plan is to put some more engineering resources on cost reduction areas, as it's becoming apparent that certain markets just aren't going to pay full price for some of the features that we've come out with.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Great, that's really helpful. And then one on TrueBeam. Could you comment on how the TrueBeam mix has trended in the developed markets, specifically over the last couple of quarters? And then that Montr\u00e9al order that you mentioned, you said it was several systems, I take that to mean 5 or 6. Am I off base there?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "So you're talking about orders and not sales?", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "That's right.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Okay. The Montr\u00e9al system was -- I'm trying to remember, 5, something like that, 5 or 6. Boy, it's embarrassing that I don't know that number. And in the TrueBeams in Europe -- and you got to remember, we just -- only --  it wasn't very long ago, we got permission to sell TrueBeam in some of these countries like Japan and China and places like that. And so now, of course, we're seeing a marked rise in that business. I don't -- I can't calibrate it for you exactly at this moment to give you how many TrueBeams in these developing territories, but all I can tell you is, it's quite a bit more because last year, we were just getting started in these territories.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And then on the U.S. in particular, given that there's more of a data to build the trend on?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "I think our take [ph] rate of TrueBeams in the United States is about what it was before.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla with Citi.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Elisha, a question for you. I mean, if I look at the guidance, you're taking the midpoint from your prior previous guidance down by about $0.15. And if you gross that up, that's about $20 million to $25 million of additional expense between now and the end of the year between the 3 points that you laid out: oncology, legal and Siemens start-up. Can you break that amount between the 3 of those categories and talk to us about how long going forward these added expenses are going to take place?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Sure, well, to give the 50,000-foot answer, Amit, is it's about 50-50 of that $0.15. But let me kind of give you the guidance walk, if you will, from where we are today versus where we were last quarter. The sales number in total is really not changing at about that 10% increase. However, what we're seeing is that the sales shift, we've got a lower, about $10 million sales coming across the board from our businesses, a little bit in oncology, a little bit in X-ray, little bit in Security, offset by $10 million of proton revenue carrying a 0 margin. So that alone has, call it, a $4 million impact. The gross margin, down about a little more than a point from what we had previously thought is largely due to oncology and all of the issues that we've mentioned. And then when I look at the operating expenses, that includes the risk charge, it includes Siemens start-up cost, we have a break-up penalty, we have training we're going to do, we're hiring people to support this agreement. We have some additional legal cost over some of the losses that you're aware of, as well as the acquisition of InfiMed, which is increasing the SG&A cost as well. It's dilutive to the bottom line, but it is increasing SG&A. A lot of that is in offset in the tax rates so that you get to your Delta that you mentioned of the $0.15 to $0.16.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "So let me understand. I mean, you guys have been pursuing an overseas strategy because that really is where a lot of the growth in the market is coming from. Are we entering kind of a new normal for profitability for the company going forward?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Well, I think that there is -- the strategy of the company dictates that more and more of our business over time is going to come from international. If that international mix comes from territories like Japan and certain countries in Europe, especially Northern Europe where the mix tends to be good, that's -- then that's great. If it's going to be coming more and more from BRIC countries, then we're going to see margins affected. So the consequence is what do you do when you know that you're going to go into territories where you're not going to have this favorable a mix as you've had in the past? Well, to some extent, that is going to impact gross margin. The way you deal with that is you do cost reductions, you try to add features that you think you will be appealing in those markets, you try to add new services that you think will be appealing in those markets, you try to build sales forces in those markets that can get proper value for what you're selling. And so it's a combination of new products and services and cost reductions in order to deal with this. Now, will this benefit the bottom line? Yes, over time, I think that this has a good effect on EBIT, and it has a good effect on EPS, but it will make gross margin more challenging in the future. I think we all knew this. I don't think anybody here expected 3 months ago that the effect would be this strong in 2012 for this. But in our long-term strategies we recognize that this was a situation we're going to have to cope with, and we're putting those plans into effect. So you'll see this speed of some of our plans and probably slow down some other things to try to make -- take this into account.", "Elisha W. Finney", "And I just do want to reiterate that if you exclude the proton revenue for the full fiscal year, the total company margin decline that we're talking about is about 1 point. We're still at 43% to 44% and it was small...", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Yes, the proton effect was pretty -- what was it, $50 million -- $60 million of proton sales with 0 margin? That was a real anchor on gross margin percentages. Now, ultimately, I think the Proton business is going to be great for the company. It won't be great at the gross margin level. It will be great at the EBIT and EPS level. So there's businesses like this that we think we have to get into, that it's appropriate for us to get into, that were going to give us a lot of revenue and are going to give us rapid EBIT, but temporarily, they're producing effects like this.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I apologize with the follow-up, but I really just need to understand, at the operating margin level, do you still feel comfortable that the company is in the low 20s, or is there the potential that the operating margin of the business can deteriorate further from where you are at this quarter?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Well, again, if you exclude the proton business, and there is some proton revenue in FY '11 in Q4 that has to come out as well as what we -- what -- the $60 million in FY '12. The RoS, once you pencil this out, is going to be about 21.5%, so it's still, I would say, low 20s. But we have, we've gone back, we've scrubbed. It's the best we can predict at this point based on all of the information that we have. But that's not saying what we're going to do going into next year. I can tell you that the biggest torque we're going to get on it going forward is that we can get this proton therapy business profitable as opposed to being significantly diluted that it is today.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone with Jefferies.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Just a couple of housekeeping and then a little bit more on the margin and the North American trends in the quarter. The service revenue growth, I don't know if that was actually given in the prepared comments, and if it was then I apologize, but do you have that number handy?", "Elisha W. Finney", "It was in line with the overall Oncology growth rate in the quarter.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Yes, it was pretty good.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, okay. And then just on last quarter, Tim, you had mentioned, or Elisha, that a couple of orders in North America were delayed and you're expecting perhaps those to hit in this quarter or some of the following quarters. Did those orders hit this quarter, or are you still expecting that in the second half of the year?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Yes, that's why you saw the nice 14% growth in North American orders for Oncology, because a number of them hit.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "So if we go back, I think it was about 3 deals that slipped, and so all of those were booked this quarter. Or do you still expect...", "Timothy E. Guertin", "No, no, not all were booked. But some of the ones that I really wanted to hit in the first quarter hit in the second quarter, but it's never perfect like that.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Sure. And then I guess one on Siemens, on the collaboration. I don't know if it's clear at this point, but are you going to receive distribution fees on their MR and CT placements? And likewise on, conversely, the Siemens, is there any distribution fee that goes to them when they place a Varian linear accelerator?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Yes and yes.", "Dow R. Wilson", "Yes. Just a little clarity on the former: We'll get a distribution fee when it goes into radiation oncology driver [ph], not in a radiology customer.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Right.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "All right. So is part of that -- is it too early to suggest that part of that is already being reflected in the gross margin, or...", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Oh, no. We just signed this agreement yesterday...", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "But as we look in the guidance that you have for this year...", "Timothy E. Guertin", "No, there's -- the only effect this year is actually -- is preparatory. In the United States, we have a current arrangement that is going to take 6 months to expire. So this will have no effect in the U.S. which is, of course, where the bulk of our sales efforts were -- for -- and so we're -- there'll be no effect in the U.S. and we're just going to be in getting started mode in Europe, so -- and our revenue, it comes when those units are -- I mean, our -- any payments would come when those units are installed, which is not likely to be this year. So I suspect this is going to have a positive effect on 2013, but it has an, I don't know, like a $0.02 effect in -- a negative $0.02 wind in 2012.", "Dow R. Wilson", "Yes, the big win for us in this deal is we get connectivity between the Siemens installed base and our ARIA oncology information system. That's access that we have not had in the market before. Siemens customers have not been able to connect to the ARIA installed base, so we are very encouraged about that connectivity. And that's where the real driver both from a top line and a margin perspective are going to be for us in the long term with this relationship.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "So last one for me and I'll get back in queue. So just to clarify, the entire Siemens base will eventually get ARIA as definitively. Or does the sales force have to go and offer up that option and then they have that option to add in ARIA? And then ultimately, how do you see this deal benefiting Varian as it relates to the newly freed up linear accelerators that are going to be on the market?", "Dow R. Wilson", "We do have to sell it. So it is -- there is -- Siemens customers either have no information system or something called LANTIS, which was a joint venture between Elekta and Siemens. And as they upgrade -- especially in multi-Linac departments, as they upgrade, they want new information systems. LANTIS is quite old. They need new functionality especially for managing imaging and new advanced features, so they have to upgrade. We've really not been able to participate in that market historically. That's what this opens up for customers, and we're very excited about that.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Of course, our global footprint and bundling of orders when it's -- it's bundled with diagnostic imaging.", "Dow R. Wilson", "They have 2,000, around 2,000 machines in their installed base. Most of those customers are -- those customers have years to replace those machines. But generally, when a company exits under these circumstances, a fair number of customers will try to replace those machines faster than they otherwise would. So if they try to replace those machines faster than they otherwise would and we can now interface with Siemens' machines that remain in the department and we have the cooperation of Siemens sales and management team in these situations especially at those hospitals where hospitals that favored Siemens diagnostic equipment, it gives us an edge that we just simply did not have before. So we are very pleased about that.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Sean Lavin with Lazard.", "Sean D. Lavin - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Congratulations on a nice quarter and the Siemens agreement.", "Dow R. Wilson", "Thank you.", "Sean D. Lavin - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "I wanted to ask about Siemens. On one hand now, you're going to be working with them, but at the same time, we know some hospitals may be walking away from their backlog. How do you compete for those machines and also juggle partnership?", "Dow R. Wilson", "I guess my view of it, Sean, is Siemens has just signaled who their preferred partner is, yes. We got to go compete on it. It's not a done deal per se, but...", "Sean D. Lavin - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "So they don't mind you stepping in there with kind of past orders of theirs?", "Dow R. Wilson", "Well, on their backlog, they clearly liked to deliver their backlog. I'm sure, if you were to call them and ask them to deliver their -- what their backlog position is, they'd still love to deliver their backlog. But if they have a customer that wants to get out of their backlog's position, we'd certainly have a shot at it. And this is really -- I think our perspective is, as Tim said before, there's 2,000 units out there. Their backlog is actually not that big and we -- we're -- our interest is competing on those 2,000 machines and making sure that we've got the best alternative for those customers.", "Sean D. Lavin - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "And then as you talk about software for those 2,000 potential machines, what kind of revenue would upgrading a machine kind of entail?", "Dow R. Wilson", "Well, that's, of course -- the biggest piece is the machine trade-out and that would be depending on the configuration sold anywhere between $1.8 million and $3 million for the machine itself. And then the software, you have the software cost depending on the configuration of what's there. It could be anywhere between $75,000 and a couple hundred thousand dollars, depending on the configuration. And then of course, there's treatment planning in play as well as service tail that is very profitable.  So it's -- over time, it's a very interesting opportunity for us.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "There's another element here too, which is that right now the impact piece, the piece that was sold by Siemens, is a software under license to Elekta. If -- and so we want to see that replaced by ARIA because right now whenever we add a new machine, Elekta gets a certain amount of money to that new machine. And this way, revenue comes to us instead of Elekta when Varian gets the machine, and I think that's nice to see.", "Sean D. Lavin - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Is this deal with Siemens exclusive such that they couldn't do something with Elekta?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Well, they have commitments to Elekta that they have to fulfill under their existing agreement, but we are their preferred choice, going forward, for information systems and for linear accelerators.", "Dow R. Wilson", "This really levels, if not tilts the plane, the field in our favor. Before, this is access we did not have. We could not talk to these machines. It was a major weakness in our oncology information system strategy.", "Sean D. Lavin - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "And then my last one is on -- I guess, since Siemens has left the business and you're moving towards a duopoly, have you seen Elekta make any changes in their pricing strategy?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "I would -- I'm going to ask for more time to answer that question because the -- I only have one quarter's worth of information on this. But frankly, I don't think a duopoly has made Elekta any less of a discounter. If anything, it may have made them go the other way. I think Elekta is now seeing the possibility of more business and they want to get that more business, and they see the growth possibilities. So ordinarily, in a situation like this, you would hope for different behavior, but I think we're just going to get more of the same.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I apologize, I'm going to ask you one on Siemens as well. But I'm just trying to understand the thought process here: Was this out of kind of necessity or opportunity? In other words, Siemens has been an ineffective competitor for a long time. You know where their Linacs are. I understand you need the connectivity, but couldn't you do that through a software collaboration and not at the distribution component which is presumably going to be lower margin?", "Dow R. Wilson", "We think this is a huge opportunity. We've talked about the installed base. The other thing is Siemens' presence has been very good in international and emerging markets, so this is a very exciting opportunity for us globally. And it also helps us in that part of the market where there's good growth. And this installed base has some age to it. So we want every opportunity we can get to sell into that installed base.", "Elisha W. Finney", "And on the margin side, I -- just to be clear, in many instances, we're actually just replacing an existing distributor relationship with Siemens, so this is not dilutive to margins in that case, and clearly opens up a big white space for us to go after in terms of just a much bigger global footprint.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "And just dealing -- going back to the comment you made earlier: It was not possible to talk to Siemens machines without the cooperation of Siemens. They have to provide test facilities. They have to provide interface specifications and all of those specifications were kind of co-controlled by Elekta and Siemens and they were closed to us. So a lot of deals in Europe. This was not all that much of a problem in the United States, but it was a big problem for us in Europe because Dow and I would go to meetings in Europe and our salespeople would point out to us: \"Hey, we can't sell ARIA to this customer. We can't sell our RV system.\" And so our most advanced clinical capabilities that we might sell on our machine are not available to this customer, so it effectively enables -- you can sell this great machine and our customers can't fully use it. And so this was a very frustrating situation for us. And it required a partnership with Siemens to do it and that partnership was not possible until we created this arrangement. Also, Siemens is planning on improving these things. We have given Siemens information and feedback on how we'd like to see the new interfaces, designs. And they're very cooperative with us on this, so that's very good. And the last I want to point out, unless we lose track of it: Siemens is an incredibly advanced imaging company. And they would like to build stronger relationships with us in a variety of ways so all of -- we've only talked here about linear accelerators and interfaces and connectivity and selling information systems. The fact is, this is a wonderful imaging company and they have technologies that I think would be very useful to radiation oncology customers and they want to work with us in those areas. So I think that, although specifically we're not talking today about what those things might be, I think that there's great possibility for nice enhancements to product lines in the future.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then on the margins, Elisha, I think you had mentioned in your comments some of that was obviously geographic mix, but then you mentioned, I think, slower progress and some product cost programs. Can you just elaborate on that latter point? I mean, how much can you kind of control in the margins by working down manufacturing and input costs?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Well, again, this is just going to be something, Tycho, that we just constantly are going to start chipping away at. I mean, it's -- I mean, we're looking everything from freight to what can we do in terms of our purchasing and vendor pricing. I mean, we are -- it's an all-out program to just attack this $5,000 at a time until it gets to the point where it's significant. So I can't just point to one thing and say that's the magic bullet. Again, we're going to be increasing engineering resources in this area to specifically focus on how do we cost-reduce this product line.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Yes. To give you an example: On freight alone, because of higher fuel cost, we've seen about a $0.02 -- I mean, excuse, a $0.01 impact to us this year just on fuel costs alone. And I'm not going to make the machines lighter so that we won't solve the problem that way, but it's an example of the kind of thing that's motivating us to look at everything we can. So we're -- we have projects that are underway. I would've liked them to come into play in the second half of the year, but I think we're going to see them come into effect later in this year and in 2013.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then last one, Tim or Dow. Do you want to just talk on dynamics in the freestanding market? I mean, you talked about some of those order delays from last quarter coming through. But just in general, how do we think about the underlying dynamics for freestanding clinics?", "Dow R. Wilson", "I'd say, in the quarter, we did see some life there, so that was a positive event in the quarter. I'm reluctant to point and say that's a trend, but we did see some life in the second quarter freestanding market.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. So is that market back to growth, then, you think, for the year, or...", "Dow R. Wilson", "I -- Tycho, I'd be really reluctant to say in a one quarter a trend mix.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "And we're going to have to come back to you on that next quarter. We did have -- again, it was positive. We're going to just put a dot on the graph and we'll come back to you next quarter and connect the dots and tell you what we see.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And just, how about to elaborate one -- for one second, just the dynamics between freestanding centers and hospitals clinics? I mean, can you just talk on that, where we are in that process of hospitals kind of building out outreach clinics and then competing with the freestanding centers?", "Dow R. Wilson", "I think as we said last quarter, we're seeing that trend continue. Hospitals are strong. The strong are playing aggressively, especially. And we are seeing them do more community outreach than we've seen in the past. So I'd say that trend is maintaining.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Dalton Chandler with Needham & Company.", "Dalton L. Chandler - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "You touched on this a little bit already, but you did cite pricing pressures as one of the issues driving down margins in the quarter. It sounded like it was specific to the emerging markets, but can you just elaborate on what you're seeing there?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "It's certain territories in the world. And yes, emerging markets tend to be those more than other places. I guess I'm not shocked that the BRIC countries and other countries would have this problem. I was just -- I think we continue to be struggling with strong competition with our few remaining competitors in terms of getting business in those countries. And this is a kind of a land grab here, everybody's going to fight it out, and that's what's going on. In addition, these people have more limited budgets than other people do. So part of what we're trying to do is to adapt what we offer and to the situation so that we can improve and get better margins than we're seeing on these deals, going forward. Some of that's going to be product changes and some of it's going to be just doing a better job of selling.", "Dalton L. Chandler - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Would you say you're seeing stable pricing in the established markets?", "Dow R. Wilson", "We're definitely seeing stable pricing in North America. We are -- as Tim said earlier, we are seeing a little bit of richer product mix but stable pricing in North America for sure. And Japan, I'd say stable as well in that market.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Jason Wittes with Caris.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "A couple of follow-ups here. First of, I know you saw signs of life on the freestanding clinics in the U.S. Does that have any relation to slightly better optimism on the reimbursement front, or is that reading too much into it?", "Dow R. Wilson", "It think that's -- we would love to read that into it, but I don't think we can at this point.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Do you have a read, by the way, into that at this point?", "Dow R. Wilson", "No, no. It's still way too early.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then in terms of proton, I think you've increased it to $60 million in revs this year. I guess, first, that assumption is that's all coming from Scripps. That's not an additional project going online. Or how do I think about that?", "Elisha W. Finney", "No, it is -- it's about half is Scripps, roughly speaking, and the rest we're assuming that Saudi and/or Russia. We will get the project started at which point revenue will start. So there's still some big assumptions in there, for Q4 in particular, but we would expect that at least one of those projects will start in this fiscal year.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "But the $10 million increase is basically half due to Scripps being ahead of schedule and half due to Saudi, is that right?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Roughly, roughly.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And just a follow-up to that, and that would be: Are you still thinking about a 2-year installation time? Or are you a little bit more optimistic it might be a little quicker than that, given you're a little ahead of schedule at this point?", "Elisha W. Finney", "About 1.5 years...", "Timothy E. Guertin", "The building is 12 months. And so from groundbreaking, usually the building is about 12 months. And then we're...", "Dow R. Wilson", "[indiscernible] 1.5 years.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "And the machine is about a 1.5 years. And obviously, we're going to be trying everything we can to get that down.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. But that's a slight improvement over, I think, your initial 2-year assumption?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Yes.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's good to hear. Also, obviously you can't speak for Elekta, but you can speak to your own strategy here. You're obviously making a pretty strong push into emerging markets. And it's not that you haven't been there in the past, but I don't think you've been as aggressive as you have this year. And obviously, it looks like early results are good, especially in Asia. So I guess my question is -- one, I know, Asia, you've done -- you've put a lot of focus in. Are there other areas where we should expect an increased focus from you? Number two, I assume you are being more aggressive in pricing than you have in the past, given you do kind of look at this as a land grab situation. And so I'd just be curious to get your thoughts on what's going on over there.", "Dow R. Wilson", "I'd say, in terms of focus, we're really looking at a number of theaters. It's not just Asia. Yes, Japan and China have been a focus for us, continue to be. That will not change, but Southeast Asia is -- we're growing there and adding resources and seeing more of a market. Middle East has been terrific for us the last 18 months, and there's always some lumpiness that goes with that market. These markets tend to be tender-driven large markets and so it's kind of comes and goes. But the overall trend is very positive in the Middle East. Brazil is a major focus for us, Turkey, Eastern Europe. So those are, just kind of going around the board, those are some of the places that we're playing. Northern Africa, actually, there's some action in Northern Africa, which we typically haven't had them on the list but that looks very, very good for us. I'd say that pricing environment in -- it depends in each country. So I mean, Elisha and Tim talked about the geographic mix hitting us pretty hard this quarter as we do have some different pricing largely driven by what feature sets that people want and whether especially they want to pay the premiums for stereotactic radiosurgery and some of the advanced capabilities that we have on the machines. So those tend to be the markets that are a little bit more aggressive where folks maybe don't value those -- they're not doing those capabilities.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Right. But also just based on comments you guys have made in the past, I know in Asia you've set up some training facilities. I don't know, have you done similar -- have you set up similar training facilities in other regions? I mean, it seems as if that was a big success at least very early on, seeing it.", "Dow R. Wilson", "We have training facilities in Japan, China and India, and we are looking at adding incremental training facilities as part of this theater strategy that I briefly mentioned. And Brazil will be a major focus of that where we're very committed to the Brazilian market. We haven't put that training facility in yet, but we're committed to it and see a big education capability growing in Brazil, as well as probably the development of some local manufacturing capability in Brazil.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "We see Brazil and other parts of Latin America as just beginning large -- well, Brazil is well advanced along this growth, but other countries are beginning a big potential growth spurt. And they're going to want more radiation therapy equipment. And so this is a big opportunity. So our -- the things that we're looking at in Brazil are an example of what we're going to have to do a lot of in Latin America over the next few years.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "One last question, then I'll get off -- jump off, For proton, you had 2 orders basically materialize this quarter, which were not expected. I believe you still at this point -- if you -- you have about 3 in the wings. And how do we think about it in terms of the pipeline of potential products? And what's a good expectation for what we should expect to see on an annual basis for proton orders right now in the first couple of years?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Well, I am hoping to get -- I would love to get 3 to 4 deals a year. And what will those deals be? I think that we might be able to see 100 -- less -- somewhat approaching $200 million in business per year in this, not counting services. And of course, once the centers are up, we'll get additional service revenue over that. Long term, I'm aiming for $250 million a year.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, but $200 million seems like a pretty reasonable bogey.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Yes, I think it is.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Tim, just a couple more questions on the pricing comments, the margin outlook  that you've put out there. Is there any change going on in the orders that are in backlog? I mean, typically, your backlog visibility is very high. I'd be surprised 2 quarters in, that you have -- all of a sudden you're hit over the head with this geographic mix issue. You hadn't realized that some of these margin pressures were going to hit. So it's my sense that this might be kind of a book-and-ship order kind of thing, just some of the orders that are coming in right now that you still expect to translate to the P&L later this year are the ones that are coming in at -- with some of the pricing pressure or maybe the less rich feature set.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Yes. I -- our ouija board has been pretty good for 13 years on this stuff, but I will say that forecasting is a complex task around here that takes a lot of effort. Book-and-ship clearly is one aspect of what has happened to us as, in the second quarter as we look at our book-and-ships, certainly that has an effect. Our mix by territory matters, the pricing and competitive behavior, the delivery timing. Every time we go through backlog, I can tell you, when we go through backlog at the beginning of a quarter and then look at what actually shipped in that quarter, 90 days later it's often quite different than what we expected. Product cost and the cost of accessories, depending upon where they came from and we use a lot of expensive materials to build these machines so that can have an effect: the locally supplied vendor parts that we have to get, and those parts can vary by where we are. And then there's turnkey activity in some of these deals and then there's deal packages. There's what all they want, as part of the deal, and then to top it all off, there's currency effects. So when you roll all of these together, I would say that our models have worked well for us, but it is clear that short-term effects, going forward, are having a stronger effect than we've seen them have before. And so we're going to do our very best to analyze things and keep you up to date on that. But the nice thing now is we're halfway through this year, and at least for this year, the backlog picture is clarifying, and that makes us feel better about our forecast for this year, although there's still some variation, which we've shown you in the way we've constructed our guidance, and -- but we're going to have to get into October before we really know what next year looks like.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "All right. Let me ask one follow-up there and then I have one modeling question for Elisha. But you've been a staunch advocate, I think, over the last few years that you're just not going to sell on price, that you're going to sell on features, and if others want to sell on price, so be it. But it sounds like that has changed a little bit. What in your mind has -- I'm assuming some of these discounts filter all the way up to your level. Where -- what has changed in your mind to sign off on some of these discounts?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Well, I think what happens is -- and I will admit that I try not to keep every piece of paper in the company from coming to my office. But I would say that, if you're talking to a customer who has $2 million and he wants to buy $2.5 million worth of stuff, he's not going to get everything he wants. But -- and then competitors are going to come in and so there's going to be -- it's going to be a difficult conversation. And so that's when deals get complicated. It's -- so I would say, a combination of budget limitations and just competitive pressures, especially in these countries where all of us want to take higher share. At least now, we're down to 2 companies or 2.5 companies that want higher share, and so we're going to try and get that any way we can. But you're right: I am going to push for higher prices. Mr. Wilson is going to higher -- push for higher prices. Ms. Finney is going to push for higher prices. And we have ways to do that, that I probably shouldn't go into too much more detail on in this call.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And then, Elisha, just the modeling question. So it looks like you're trimming the guidance range by maybe $0.15 or $0.16 or so, and obviously, $0.02 of that was the restructuring this quarter. I think you explained well that $0.01 or $0.02 may be the lower oncology revenue is offset by the higher proton revenues. I think Tim made a comment that the Siemens relationship is maybe $0.02 or so. The last couple of buckets I just can't fill in is the litigation side.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Litigation is about $0.02.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Litigation is about $0.02. Is there -- in that litigation -- I'm assuming that's the UPMC. Is there any presumed royalties on RPM or Trilogy clinic sales or anything that you're now starting to kind of assume in there?", "Elisha W. Finney", "No. We're assuming we're going to fight this.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "We're assuming ultimate victory in it. And I want to make it clear: it's the University of Pittsburgh, not UPMC. We're not in a battle with UPMC. They're a customer. The University of Pittsburgh is the university.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Right, yes. No, that's fair. So that's $0.08 there, and so the rest of the bucket is just kind of this lower margin and pricing issue.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Yes.", "Spencer R. Sias", "Thank you for -- we need to end the call at this point because we've run overtime. So thank you for participating.", "A replay of the call can be heard on the Varian investor website at www.varian.com/investor where it will be archived for a year.

Well, we are off to a good start for fiscal 2008 with a strong first quarter marked by double-digit growth in net orders, revenues, operating earnings and net earnings, as well as backlog, which hit another record high.", "Compared to the year ago period, the backlog rose 22% to over $1.7 billion, net orders rose 21% to $493 million, revenues increased 18% to $459 million, operating earnings rose 20% and net earnings per diluted share rose 16% to $0.43.", "Oncology Systems, X-Ray Products, and our Security and Inspection business all contributed to our growth in net orders, revenues and earnings.

One of our largest single orders came from Portsmouth hospital in the UK where four Varian accelerators equipped with our OB On-Board Imager were picked to replace competing machines. Orders for image-guided radiotherapy and the radiosurgery products were the prime growth drivers and accelerator unit volume increased nicely.", "More than 80% of the worldwide orders taken during the quarter for a high-energy Clinac and Trilogy linear accelerators included an OB device for image guidance. As of the end of the quarter, we have completed more than 720 installations of OB equipped IGRT systems, more than double the year ago total and we have many, many more in progress. We had a substantial increase in orders for radiosurgery units including the Trilogy and the Novalis Tx machines. As we reported in our press release today, we booked orders for 14 Novalis Tx configurations, including 10 in the US and four in Europe during the quarter. Orders have come from leading surgical institutions as well as community hospitals for enhancing their radiosurgical capabilities.", "We believe that the speed, versatility, precision and advanced capability... imaging capability of Novalis Tx enabled us to achieve strong share and substantial growth in the radiosurgical portion of the market.", "At the end of December, we received regulatory clearance to market our RapidArc capability that improves the precision and dramatically improves the speed of image-guided IMRT and subsequent to the close of the first quarter; we've booked our first RapidArc order. Customer interest in this new capability is tremendous.", "We believe that together, RapidArc and Novalis Tx represent important new long-term growth drives for our oncology business.", "Turning to other oncology products, we also achieved double-digit growth in orders for our Eclipse treatment planning software and for our ARIA information and image management system. Our service business also played an important part in the orders growth for Oncology Systems in the quarter. Today it represents better than $350 million in recurring annual revenue for Oncology Systems. This business is expanded with the help of a bigger installed base of OBs and a larger mix of software service agreements.", "Turning to X-Ray Products, we had another good quarter driven by continued expansion of our business in flat-panel detectors for filmless X-ray imaging. Net orders for X-Ray Products rose 11% to $75 million, driven largely by growth in orders for panels which amounted to nearly 40% of the total orders for the business during the quarter.", "During the quarter, we continued to build our digital fluoroscopy panel business while gearing up for commercial launch of our new radiographic panels. As we reported at the end of the quarter, we also acquired Pan-Pacific Enterprises, the largest independent distributor of medical X-ray tubes in China for the purpose of marketing, sales and distribution of Varian X-Ray Imaging products there. We expect that this acquisition will enhance the Varian sales channel for both tubes and panels in this important market.", "Now I'll talk about the category of our other businesses, which is made up of our SIP, Security and Inspection Products, business, our ACCEL proton therapy business, and our Ginzton Technology Center. Compared to the first quarter of last fiscal year, combined first quarter net orders for these businesses tripled to $33 million. This was largely due to our SIP business which grew orders by $19 million. With the help of our acquisition of BIR lat May, we were able to win a very large order for the installation of four freight inspection systems at the US border.", "Global demand for improved security in ports and border crossing is driving growth in the SIP business and we are expanding our manufacturing capacity in Las Vegas to accommodate this need. We expect to have a cargo screening demonstration unit operating in our new 85,000 square foot plant there before the summer.", "Now I'll turn it back over to Elisha for a review of the numbers and then come back to you with our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2008.", "Elisha W. Finney - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks Tim and hello everyone. As usual, I will walk through the income statement attached to the press release as well as cover a few balance sheet items. As Tim pointed out, the company's first quarter revenues increased 18% to $459 million. Oncology Systems posted an increase of 14%, X-ray Products posted a gain of 12%, and the other category including the ACCEL and SIP businesses mote than tripled revenues to $28 million.", "Gross margin for the quarter was 42%, up almost 0.5 point from the year ago quarter. Oncology Systems gross margin was 43%, up one point from the year ago quarter, primarily due to higher volume and domestic product mix. This improvement in Oncology's margin was achieved despite a significant shift in the quarter to lower margin international revenues. X-ray Products gross margin was near 40% for the quarter, down one point, mostly because of product mix in our X-ray tube line and some material cost increases.", "First quarter SG&A expenses were 17% of revenues, up by about 0.5 point from the year ago quarter, due largely to the ACCEL acquisition. R&D expenses were 6% of revenues, lower by 0.5 point from the year ago quarter.", "Moving down the income statement, first quarter operating earnings increased 20% to $84 million or 18% of revenues, up slightly from the year ago quarter, including the dilutive effects of recent acquisitions.", "Oncology Systems and X-ray Products together contributed $102 million in operating earnings with our other businesses and corporate consuming a net $18 million. Depreciation and amortization of intangibles totaled $9 million in the quarter. Net interest income totaled $1.6 million, down from the year-a-go period due to lower cash levels in the US and higher borrowing associated with our share repurchase program and working capital requirement.", "Our effective tax rate was 35%, up four points from the year ago first quarter which benefited from a retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. The rate was also impacted by our required adoption this quarter of FIN 48 tax accounting. For the year, we now estimate that our tax rate will be between 32% and 33% due largely to geographic shift in profits and the expiration of the R&D tax credit.", "Average fully diluted shares outstanding were 128 million, down by about 5 million shares from the prior year quarter due largely to the ongoing share repurchase program. We reported fully diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.43.", "Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $334 million of cash and cash equivalents, $67 million of combined short and long-term debt, and $863 million of stockholders' equity. DSO or days sales outstanding was 87, an improvement of 6 days from the year ago quarter.", "We achieved record first quarter cash flow from operations of $121 million, about $66 million more than net earnings for the quarter. Other sources of cash included $24 million from stock option proceeds. Primary uses of cash were $41 million for the stock repurchase program, $23 million to pay off short-term borrowings, and $17 million for capital expenditures.", "During the quarter, we repurchased 920,000 shares of stock under our current share repurchase authorization. Since initiating stock repurchases back in fiscal year 2001, the company has retired almost 32 million shares at an average price of about $38 per share. Now I'll turn it back over to Tim for the outlook.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Elisha. Including the results from the first quarter, we believe that fiscal year 2008 revenues can grow by about 14% and that net earnings per diluted share for the fiscal year could grow to between $2.05 and $2.07. Compared to the results for the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we believe second quarter revenues could increase in the range of 14% to 16% and that net earnings per diluted share could be about $0.51.", "We will now take your question.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Amit Hazan with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.", "Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer", "Hey, good afternoon guys.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hello Amit, how are you?", "Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer", "Good. The first question I think I wanted to ask was on guidance. It looks very good and I think I understand, Elisha, what you were saying on the tax rate going up a little bit. But as I plug that into my model, I still can't get to $2.05 to $2.07. I get higher, obviously because of the higher revenue. Can you give us a sense of what else is going on there that we should adjusting to get down to your EPS guidance?", "Elisha W. Finney - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, I mean, basically, Amit, the guidance remains pretty unchanged at the... above the tax line. With 14% or so revenue growth, we still expect that the pre-tax margin should improve by about half a point, with half of that improvement coming from gross margin, about half from leveraging our operating expenses. Clearly you will have to make some assumptions on the share count, but the tax rate, if you... if we went to the prior guidance of the tax rate, which was between 31% and 32%, we have now taken that up about a full point, what you would see is that the guidance would have increased in line with the $0.03 that we gave in the first quarter, but that's been largely offset by the increase in tax rate.", "Now, of course if the R&D tax credit is reinstated or if our geographic profits end up being different than what we anticipate now, or if some of the discrete items that we had in the year ago period should recur thus year, then obviously, we could see an improvement in the tax rate, but it's just too early to tell at this point.", "Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer", "But again, just to follow up on that, if your revenue guidance increased from 11% to 14% and you had $0.03 upside in the quarter and it doesn't sound like anything else has changed other than the tax rate. We are going to get higher than your EPS guidance. So I guess to ask the question directly, is there anything that changed in cost of operations, SG&A, R&D that's different that would drive it down? Otherwise I would have expected that EPS guidance would have gone up accordingly.", "Elisha W. Finney - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, there is nothing different in the operating expense side that we are anticipating. All of the RapidArc introduction as an example has been built into the guidance expectation that we gave.", "Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer", "Okay. And then just a question on RapidArc, it sounds like you are starting to get orders, can you give us a sense of how we should be modeling that in terms of penetration into units, what's your expectation as far as units you sell either US or OUS and how... will most people be ordering this under units or will it be like IGRT or what percent of units will be ordered do you predict or can you give us a sense with the RapidArc in the coming... over the coming year, let's say?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, Amit, this is Tim. We think that this is going to play out sort of the way IMRT and IGRT has played out; that is in the first year. Because of budgets, people don't necessarily include this right away. You got to remember this is a retrofittable option, so people can buy these things. What they may want to do is just have some assurance to us... from us as to what the price is likely to be when they do order it. And then... so I expect that what we will see is orders will start to pick up over the course of the year, but I expect most of the order impact will be in quarter three and quarter four, and most of the sales impact will be next year. Now, that's not to say that we know sales impact this year and we build some level of sales impact this year, and we are hoping to be positively surprised. But at this juncture, we've built in some... a reasonable number of upgrades and a reasonable number of new situations based upon our experience with IGRT and IMRT.", "And as I indicated before, if somebody buys the full option here, we are talking in the vicinity of $400,000, if they buy it with the treatment planning and other things, it could be more or if they need an onboard imager to add to their machine as an upgrade, of course that would add to it, but I think... so what will happen is in future quarters, as we talk about this, and as we see how it plays out in the marketplace, we will be able to give you a better insight into this. But right now, we have some... just our assumptions are based upon patterns of adoption that we have seen in previous generations of new technology.", "Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer", "Okay. And then just a last question I have I think maybe just as kind of a long-term thought, I don't think we have actually in a while about biologically guided radiation therapy or BGRT and I am wondering if you can give us an update on where you are there in terms of... I am sure it's early work, but where you are there in terms of the work that you are doing, how far away we might be from seeing that come to market and maybe what new technologies would actually be needed for that to work, whether it's some integration of pet et cetera?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, there is talk about biologically guided radiation therapy and when we have it... it will be important and we do have it to a limited degree now. And the first manifestation of this is when we do imaging for treatment planning, the idea is to get more information about the cancer that we are looking at. So, for example, whereas we might just see that there is tumor now, we might be able to see more... the full extent of the tumor, we might know whether some of it is hypoxic or might get a sense of what the cell density is of the tumor and the specific percentage of cells that have been... have turned malignant. The malignant potential of the disease, whether it is spread outside of the original tumor, all these kinds of things are information that will be extremely valuable in the planning process. We are a little dependent upon the imaging companies to help us there, which is why we consider our imaging partnerships to be so important because we want to work with those folks to do that.", "Now I will add that if you take a look at hypoxic imaging, hypoxic means that the cells have low... a low amount of oxygen compared to the normal healthy cells, hypoxic cells are radio-resistant. So, we are working with several universities. They have developed... there is an agent that look like it would be very good for imaging hypoxia, works well with pet and we are starting up Phase I clinical trials that we are helping to fund and I am hoping that if hypoxic imaging works out well, this... if these trials work out well, and we have exclusive rights to this particular agent for radiotherapy planning. If this works out well then this could be the example of the kind of thing that helps us in future years. But I think BGRT is kind of a long-term bet for us. It's not anything that's going to give us money in 2008 and 2009. I am making a long-term bet there. And if other agents come along and we have people who do this for a living, who look at these kinds of things and these kind of opportunities for a living then, of course, we'll do it. And it could change the nature of image guidance in the future, but I expect the biggest impact will be on planning.", "Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Please proceed.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Securities", "Hi, good afternoon.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hello Tycho.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Securities", "Hi, wondering if I could dive a little bit more into some of the comments you made around international orders. I know the comp there was a little bit easier, but it sounds like things have picked up in Scandinavia, and I am just wondering in general within Europe, whether this is a reflection of any change in your selling strategy, whether there is any underlying competitive dynamics. And then also, Tim, I think you may have mentioned India, I am just wondering whether you're seeing an up-tick in demand out of the Asia in general?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we're trying to be tougher allover the planet in terms of our competitiveness. I would say if there is a difference, it is that we are seeing these countries adopt more and more high-end technology than they might have adopted in the past. So whereas they might have bought less expensive machines with fewer options, they are now buying more expensive machines with more options. And I think we are doing a better job in places like India. I think we are being more aggressive there, and so I think this is manifested. I think it's manifesting in all our territories. Australia is up, Latin America is up, Europe is up, Asia is up. I think all of our territories are seeing the benefit of this, and the whole team is galvanized around these new products because they realize that they have enormous potential to improve cancer care and to improve their impact.", "Now, we also... there is an FX effects that I want to draw your attention to, which is that although we grew 30%, I think it would have been 20% if it hadn't been for... I think 10% of that was FX. Not that 20% is bad. I think 20% is still a very good number, but you will have to keep that in mind when you take it into account. But I think the teams are just performing quite well.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Securities", "Okay. And has your level of visibility changed dramatically over the past year? I think it was a year ago we were dealing with some of the tenders out of Europe, and are you more comfortable with where you are in terms of visibility?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we have our forecast meetings every year in the first quarter. We take a look at the territories, and we look at deals. We look at deals that we think we have some confidence that are likely to choose Varian, and we look at deals where we are not so confident, and then we work with our sales teams to try to go out and get those. And so, the big mystery... and it's not a mystery, but the big factor that we have to work on over the course of the year, the execution factor is to try to get deals where customers are may be far from certain from choosing us, and we just have to work on those.", "And I will say that we see a lot of tenders. And these tenders, as we have seen in previous years, have timeframes that we predicted, but those timeframes can move. So altogether, I am feeling better, I am feeling pretty good about international. Certainly, we've had a couple of quarters here that show strength and that fills me with enthusiasm.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Securities", "Okay. And then maybe just touching briefly on the new products, I mean, it sounds like Novalis has done well. Can you characterize may be whether these are existing Varian customers or existing even Trilogy customer or whether you're kind of looking at new customers? And then same thing around RapidArc, obviously, you're just taking the first orders now, but if you can kind of characterize where you see the demand that would helpful.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, for Novalis, we are working with BrainLAB, and BrainLAB is approaching neurosurgeons. So some of those are new customers to us. Some of the sites are... we probably almost always know the radiotherapy side of these deals. We will know the radiation therapists, but we may not know the neurosurgeon as well. So, between the Varian team and the BrainLAB team, I think it's expanded the circle of people we are getting to talk to and I think that's probably what's helping us there.", "In terms of RapidArc, we are talking to people who are radiation therapy customer and so they know us and we know them and very often we have good relationship. So what they want to hear from us is they want to learn more about RapidArc, they want to understand what cases RapidArc is appropriate for, and what cases it's not appropriate for. So they can start to make decisions about acquiring it. And so we...I will also say that we are talking to some customer that we might have lost in the last transaction. And now they are back talking to us because they think that Varian is showing a lot of technological aggressiveness and a lot of imagination and that they maybe would have liked to have seen a few years ago, and they are seeing it from us now, and so we are talking to some new folks who like the direction we are going and think we are showing new leadership.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Securities", "And with regard to RapidArc in particular, are you getting a lot more questions around dosages at...I mean, I know it's a competitive advantage for you, but is that being brought to the table more from your customers?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I am sorry, dosages?", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Securities", "Yes, dosage levels relative to some of the competitive platforms.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we are using a lot less dose to deliver the plan. However, the dose of the tumor is the same as it was before. So, we are not changing the way we are treating the patients, we are just... it's a very, very efficient way to deliver dose and exact thing conformal... that's why it's so fast. It's a very efficient method and so that's what they are looking at. They are not assuming that they are going to deliver dramatically more dose to the target, for example. They just want to deliver the same dose to the target and get maybe even better confirmality [ph] than they have had in the past with a lot less work on their part.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Securities", "Okay. And then just finally on BrachyTherapy, you didn't really talk about that in your comment. Any kind of change in the underlying dynamic there versus Nucletron or just a competitive landscape?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it was a good quarter, orders were up more than 30% compared to a year ago. Sales were up in the single-digits, but that's kind of what you would expect after the tough year that they had here last year. We do manufacture this product in Germany, so margins aren't yet what I would hope because of currency effects. But I think BrachyTherapy is on the road to recovery.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Securities", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla with Citi. Please proceed.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup", "Hi. Thanks for taking the question. A couple for Elisha to start off with, Elisha, can you give us your assumptions for currency for the full year and then the currency impact in the quarter, both on the top and bottom line?", "Elisha W. Finney - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Let me give it to you for the quarter. I am not going to go out on a lam and make any predictions for the year, particularly after the day we had in the market today, in general. Oncology versus 17% total growth would have been 13% total orders growth in local currency. As Tim mentioned, the international as opposed to being up 30% would have been up 20% in local currency. And the total company instead of being at 21% on orders would have been 18%. So we did have 3 or 4 point impact on Q1 in the orders. On the sales line, we just do total company, and instead of 18% sales growth would have been 14%. So, if currencies remain stable, which we know they won't, it should benefit based on where we are in the backlog, but of course that's just a pure guess.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We're not predicting any major changes in currencies over the course of the year. So --", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup", "And then Elisha, tell us what your underlying assumption is for operating expense leverage that's implied in the guidance?", "Elisha W. Finney - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Again, for the pre-tax margin for the year to be up about 50 basis points with roughly half of that coming from leveraging our operating expenses.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup", "Okay. Thank you. Couple of other questions, on Novalis Tx 14 new orders in the quarter. How did that breakout between the sales reps from BrainLAB versus Varian? Who is the majority contributor here?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "There is no way to separate those two numbers from each other. I mean, they are involved in every deal, we are involved in every deal. Sometimes we take the lead, sometimes they take the lead. I am not sure how I would ever give you a number that would properly break those two contributions apart.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup", "Okay. And then on RapidArc, just a question on how are you managing centers if they come to you and are asking to potentially defer orders until they see the product on the market, how are you ensuring that they still have that potential to upgrade?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We invite them to California. We run a demonstration for them, and they say thanks very much, and that problem goes away.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup", "I guess let me ask you it a different way. What kind of pushback are you getting since the product is not readily in?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, I mean, our customers are used to new things coming out from us. They just want to talk to us. They want to see the slides. They want to know what we are doing. They want to get an intuitive understanding of what it is we are doing, and after we do that, they are fine, they get it. We have people here who are... have strong degrees and physics background. And so our physicists can sit with the physics people from our customers and they can go through the technology, and when people see what we did, and get their heads around, they realize that this is actually a very reasonable step for us to take. It is... when people first hear about it, it is a little shocking that this could be done. But the more they understand it, the more they realize that this is actually a reasonable technological step forward and that we haven't... there were no laws of nature we invented.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup", "Well, I'd just ask... of course just a last question here on the physicists, kind of learning curve that they need to get up to be fully... do well on RapidArc.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, the biggest issue will be quality assurance and treatment planning. Delivery is I think pretty relatively straight forward for them because that will be conducted by the techs. But they need to know how to run a treatment plan using the new modules and... in Eclipse and they need to know how to verify on their machine that their machine is behaving the way it ordinarily would. This is am IMRT procedure, but it has some differences from the old IMRT procedures. So, there will be some learning that goes on there, and we are going to have to work with... in our profession there are people who specialize in working with customers on this kind of thing, and so we will be working with them. We will also produce documents and white papers that sort of show how this can be done, and we are going to have to work with our... we have our own trainers and our own trainers are going to have to be taught how to go out and show people how to do this. So far I don't... I anticipate that it's work, but nothing that we haven't seen before and we are starting to gear up for it of course now.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup", "Okay, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Mark Richter with Jefferies & Co. Please proceed.", "Mark Richter - Jefferies & Co.", "Good evening guys.", "Elisha W. Finney - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi Mark.", "Mark Richter - Jefferies & Co.", "International oncology orders look reasonably strong, while US missed our estimates on a fairly easy year-over-year comp. I mean, can you talk about specifically what you are seeing in the competitive front in the US and then OUS, has the launch of Elekta's VMAT product in the current quarter affected new orders yet or the competitive market yet or do you think it's still too early to tell?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Mark, let me begin. I think the year ago comp for North America was up 19%. So it wasn't an easy comp.", "Elisha W. Finney - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And the international was --", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "International that had the easy comp, not North America.", "Mark Richter - Jefferies & Co.", "That's what I was referring to, sorry.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, fine. In terms of competition, you are talking about Elekta --", "Elisha W. Finney - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "With their new VMAT.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "with their new VMAT. I'd tell you, I have read the Elekta press releases, I've read what TomoTherapy has said, and I have to say one of my competitors is spending a lot of time saying it's not possible for Varian to do this without hurting treatment's quality and the other competitor is saying, hey, this works great and we've got it too.", "So, we are kind of in that amusing phase. However, we have a 510(k), we are running extensive tests, the things that people are announcing... our competitors are announcing now which is that they have partners who are going to help them run stuff we've doing for months, and in fact in some cases over a year. And so I think we are well down the road, we know a lot of things that they may not know here. And I am going to add we have some intellectual property here that I think is very valuable. So I think we are in a good position.", "Mark Richter - Jefferies & Co.", "The US market, can you just comment on what sort of trends you are seeing maybe versus international on the competitive side?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Let me see how can I answer this. I can only give you some anecdotal evidence because one quarter isn't enough to know, especially since we didn't get RapidArc approval until the very end of the quarter, but I would say I have spoken to a lot of customers, they come here, they sit with us, and they ask a lot of questions and I see incredible enthusiasm on the part of those customers for what we have done. Exactly when that will manifest in an order is always hard to perfectly predict, but I would say people... I have seen a lot of excitement on the part of customers who have come to visit us and that's nice to see. That isn't same old, same old. They are seeing new stuff and they feel... they feel that this is once again radiation therapy is changing and they are glad to see that Varian is doing this kind of thing.", "So it's hard, I can't give you orders guidance for North America. We don't do that, but I will just anecdotally say certainly the conversations that I've had with customers have been quite warm and delightful.", "Mark Richter - Jefferies & Co.", "Right. And based on our conversation with clinicians, it seems like RapidArc is a nice... is a nice advancement to Trilogy. I guess the question is why would any one order Trilogy without RapidArc and are you taking orders for Trilogy without RapidArc?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, RapidArc of course works on both the IX and on the Trilogy. But that's your point, you are saying on the most advanced machine, why wouldn't they order RapidArc. I think you raised a good point, it's certainly a point that we going to make to them, when we talk to them, but they come into this process with budgets and we have to take those into account. So for some of these people, they will add it to the budget, they want it before they deliver for. For all of these people, they will amend their order before delivery, and for other people, they will order, there is an upgrade later on.", "Mark Richter - Jefferies & Co.", "I'm sorry, the last question just is what is the timeline associated with RapidArc international... internationally for launch?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, our release data is the same for North America and for international. So we are going to release that in the spring, and we will release it all over the world at the same time.", "Elisha W. Finney - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And we could apply for a CE mark as soon as we go into production.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Right.", "Mark Richter - Jefferies & Co.", "Okay, perfect. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes form the line of Dalton Chandler with Needham & Company. Please proceed.", "Dalton Chandler - Needham & Co.", "Hi. First just a quick follow-up on the Novalis comments you made about. Now getting into some neuro accounts with the help of BrainLAB, of those 14 orders you took, how many were to neuro versus radiation oncology?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "These are shades of gray, where to some extent the neurosurgeon is involved, and to some extent the radiation therapist is involved. And very often the budget actually exists in the radiation therapy department, although the neurosurgeon maybe the key driver for the decision. And frankly, we don't... so long as we get the order, we are not... we talk to both of them as tough they are equal partners in making this decision, and I... we don't have a measurement that sort of breaks it down between who is who. That being said, anecdotally, I have talked to some neurosurgeons lately, and we were just at sales meeting in Southern California where we met with neurosurgeons who made this decision, and they were very, very enthusiastic. They compared us with other technologies. One of the speakers talked about Trilogy and talked about how we could treat people faster than he has ever been able to do it before, that he had treated some particularly difficult cases that he had never been able to treat before, or he has been able to only treat with older technology. And now he is a year or two out from treating those patients because he says most... if there had been errors or imprecisions in the treatment, they would have manifested their side effects within the first year. And he said the same quality of treatment they had before and so more and more of their patients are being shifted over to the Trilogy, more and more of their neurosurgery patients. So anecdotally, I can tell you that neurosurgeons are getting more excited and that we have more reference sites now than we had even six months ago where neurosurgeons are willing to stand up and say this is really the state-of-the-art for doing this.", "Dalton Chandler - Needham & Co.", "So then is it fair to say in the orders you have seen so far, it's anticipated that at those facilities the system would be shared between neurology and radiation oncology?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "There is a range. Some of them... the Trilogy is almost exclusively used by the neurosurgeon. But the nice thing about Trilogy is that it can be used by a combination of the two, can be scheduled between the two. And so that's why a Trilogy is a great machine for hospitals because they get maximum revenue and they get maximum versatility out of the machine. But if you have a high patient load, there is no reason the Trilogy is less expensive than our competitors for doing radiosurgery. So, if you buy it to do specifically radiosurgery, in terms of capital cost, you are less than our competitors; in terms of quality of treatment you are equal or better than our competitors, in terms of speed you are faster than our competitors. So there is no disadvantage to buying it exclusively for radiosurgery. But if your radiosurgery volume isn't enough to sustain a machine by itself, you have the advantage that you can share it.", "Dalton Chandler - Needham & Co.", "Okay. And then earlier there was a fair amount of discussion about your updated guidance on the bottom line, but you did have a nice increase in the top line. Could you give us a little more granularity on whether that's coming from oncology or it's coming more from X-ray and is it North America versus international?", "Elisha W. Finney - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, a big piece of that is coming from our SIP business, which would be... it's goings to be approaching $100 million this year in the sales line. So based on the very strong first quarter that we had for orders in that business, that impacted the total year as well as pretty significant growth coming out of the X-ray Products segment and then I would say growth that we had that we've talked about for Oncology Systems. So that is not changing, but more of the growth now coming out of cargo screening and flat panel.", "Dalton Chandler - Needham & Co.", "Okay. All right, thanks very much.", "Operator", "Next question comes from line of Jason Wittes with Leerink Swann. Please proceed.", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "Hi, thank you. Can you hear me?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, Hey Jason. We are can hear you fine.", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "Great, hey how are you. I guess first question, a lot of questions about RapidArc and I just wanted to clarify, I've heard the price of RapidArc is somewhere around $200,000, is that is that a fair ballpark in terms of what you are charging physicians for?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Our number is $400,000.", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "400,000.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "Okay. And I guess at least the way I have looked at it is the real advantage to RapiArc is that physicians use better competitively as opposed to increase in ASP [ph], although I might have to revise that if you are charging $400,000, not $200,000 for it. But nonetheless have you seen changes in how... in your competitive positioning against say TomoTherapy which RapidArc definitely seems to address their technology?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I've definitely had people come to me who were considering our competitors who are now decided to go with us and talked to several people like that because they wanted to see this kind of technology on Varian machines. We had a form of volumetric modulated arc on our machines before. So when people talk about VMAT, that's something we have been offering since the mid-1990s on our machines and a certain level of capability and so they have... but they wanted a really advanced form of that in which you do a lot more careful modulation as you rotate the machine.", "So they are seeing that with RapidArc plus, RapidArc is a major speed breakthrough in terms of delivering that kind of treatment. And part of that is because of the clever way that this was planned. I sat down with one of our engineers the other day and had him take me through the whole secret of why so much it's so much more efficient and so much more speedy than what we have seen before and you kind of gave me a better intuitive understanding of that.", "So, I think it helps us against all of our competitors. I think we are ahead of our competitors in terms of doing this. I think that... and we've proven that it can be done with one arc, which is something that not everybody has been able to demonstrate at all and we have proved that it can work on fairly complicated locations, not just simple ones like prostrate, but other sites as well. So, it's anecdotally... all I can tell you is I think it's definitely helping us and I have got individual stories that show me that it helped and I have talked to radiation therapists who just can't wait.", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "Okay, that's fair. I guess just moving on to the guidance you gave for this year. Should we assume that as this year progresses that international release sort of lead the charge or is that going to vary from quarter-to-quarter?", "Elisha W. Finney - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It's going to vary tremendously from quarter-to-quarter. Obviously you saw the orders pattern in the first quarter, most of those international orders will not deliver for at least 12 if not 15 months out, but that bodes well for FY09 in the international market. If I look at backlog today, it's roughly 60% North America, 40% international, but you are going to have huge variations in any given quarter.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I described in order when I was talking earlier that was I think four machines, and you got to remember if you take four machines and multiply it by the average price of machines, these individual orders can be huge. And so, if an individual order happens in North America and one of these large orders happens in North America and doesn't happen internationally or moves two weeks out of a quarter, well then it can have a big effect. So we are... this mix between international and North America is not something you can predict on a quarterly basis, it's a much more long-term factor.", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "Well, I guess, I just used... you implied there was fundamental changed overseas, there are more countries that you are getting more traction with, that's what I was picking up on.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We certainly saw that in the first quarter, absolutely in the first quarter we did, yes.", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "Could any of that be related to RapidArc by the way?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We don't think so. I mean, in the sense that yes, they know we have RapidArc that created enthusiasm, but we weren't selling it anywhere. I would have to say it's actually image guidance starting to pick up internationally. I mentioned that we got to 80%... I think more than 80% on image guidance worldwide. So that's a good number because as you know, we were nearly 100% in North America. So we are starting to pick up internationally. So I would say the effect is probably more image guidance in this quarter than it is RapidArc.", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "Okay. That's good.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So, RapidArc is yet to come.", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "Another RapidArc question here and that is how long does it take to retrofit RapidArc on to a machine at this point?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "The machine itself is pretty fast. I think we are talking about what a day... if they have to change... the biggest impacts are not going to be on the machine. The biggest impacts are on information system and treatment planning because we have to... and probably not even treatment planning that's probably pretty fast. I think it's going to be that if they, if they have to... if they haven't upgraded their information system for a long time, then they could have a major upgrade to support the information system. If they decide to switch from a competitor to us in terms of the information system because they want to implement RapidArc and may be they feel like our support for RapidArc is better, so they decide to switch, well, then... then you have the data migration problem of taking the patient data from the old system and moving it to the new system. So... and that can add time, but if you're just talking about the machine itself, this is a very rapid upgrade.", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "But the software will take more time... more downtime to actually get installed et cetera you are saying?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it means that it more hours and maybe it will add a day, may be it will add...", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "So we are talking two or three days you have... you can get this installed and then from a retrofit basis... okay.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, that's probably right. And that's heck of a lot faster than IGRT. But for example, if they didn't have IGRT and had to buy IGRT, then you would have to add the IGRT time, but we will do them in parallel so that we won't had actual time to the IGRT upgrade, we will get them both done at the same time. But so it's upgraded to go with it that will cause the thing. RapidArc per se is not the problem.", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "Okay. Just curious for Novalis, does that benefit from any robotic codes or there is really, is that -- ?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We use all the same codes that other people use.", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "Okay. Very good, thank you very much.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you Jason.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Julie Hoggatt with Noble Financial. Please proceed.", "Julie Hoggatt - Noble Financial Group", "Hi guys, and congratulation on a good quarter.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Julie.", "Julie Hoggatt - Noble Financial Group", "Elisha... you're welcome. Elisha, I was wondering can you tell me why other long-term liabilities on the balance sheet increased so much from last quarter? I think they about tripled. And can you explain how that's going to affect the income statement going forward?", "Elisha W. Finney - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "If not the income statement, Julie, this is just basically a reclassification of tax reserves under FIN 48 accounting, some short-term to long-term.", "Julie Hoggatt - Noble Financial Group", "Okay. And can you quantify possibly the percentage of upgrades you're expecting from your RapidArc revenue or what you're seeing maybe in the orders that you are receiving?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We don't have... you are trying to... say your question again.", "Julie Hoggatt - Noble Financial Group", "I am sorry. I am trying to figure out if this is going to be... most of your revenue for RapidArc is going to be for upgrades or if it's just going to be for new machines?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Oh, for this year, I... we think it's going to be 90% for new machines, and about 10% for upgrades. Upgrades budgeting requires a long time to get. Now, the 10% we will get will be customers who have a lot of flexibility in their budget cycle.", "Julie Hoggatt - Noble Financial Group", "Okay. And is the $400,000 that you mentioned for the addition to a new machine, or is that the cost for the upgrade?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "They are nearly the same number.", "Julie Hoggatt - Noble Financial Group", "Okay, okay. That's all my questions. Thank you.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you Julie.", "Elisha W. Finney - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Julie.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Junaid Husain with Soleil Securities. Please proceed.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "Hi guys. Good afternoon.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good afternoon.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "Tim, regarding the Novalis Tx machine, I think you guys introduced the Tx with BrainLAB back in October after you got the 510(k) for the new collimator. So in two months time, you got 14 orders, which I guess would be a pretty quick selling cycle in my mind, is that fair to say?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, these are probably people that BrainLAB and Varian have been talking to for a while. So, it's not... it wasn't like we introduced the machine and turned on the fax machine and got the orders. These are people we've been courting for a while, but for a lot of them this was very good news. This is what they were waiting for, for us to do.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "Right.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "And so it probably singed the deal for them in their minds.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "So, say, 15 to 20 instruments per quarter run rate, that's kind of on the high end then for 2008. Would it be less than that?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I am probably reluctant to give guidance on that number.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "Okay, sure. Fair enough. And then guys as we get close to getting RapidArc place to Centers, help me understand what else needs to get done with this product before it's ready to go live with your customers. At the ASTRO meeting you didn't have some of the bells and vessels on the software, things like automated quality assurance. So, as you... as we look to the spring launch, can you give us a feel for the remaining things on your list of things for your ready to go to market?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. What we are doing internally is what we call V&V or verification and validation. So, the software runs, the coding is done. What our guys are doing is running tests on the machine to verify things and calculations and then verifying that there is nothing unexpected going to happen that we can't... that we have to take care of in the next two to three months. So, this is a long process for us. Usually from the time that we finish software until the time we are ready to ship a product it is going to be about three months, longer for some products, but for this product it's probably about three months. Another factor is on the treatment planning, the same thing we have... we are going through the testing process there and what we are doing is we are running through case after case after case. So we are taking cases that we would have treated with IMRT and putting them into our planning system and seeing what happens and then we will run verification tests and we will run them in the factory and so, it's just a great deal of testing, looking for issues that we might want to correct before we are ready to ship. But I think we are on track for spring.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "Okay that sounds fair. And then just given the data driven nature of the medical physics community, I was wondering what your strategy was to get some clinical data and scientific publications on RapidArc out there with the medical community, do your academic collaborators plan on an active publishing schedule for 2008? Could we expect to see stuff at say the AAPM or at ASTRO?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We are not going to have any difficulty getting people to write on this. We are... we have an advisory council now in Europe that is helping us, will be adding more people in the United States who will be working with us on this and they will try to make the paper deadlines for ASTRO and AAPM which are coming up fast, and so we have to give people early additions. The difficulty here is that we... until we release it clinically, we can't put it on somebody's machine, even if they plan to just run test because that effectively replaces the old machine with the new software and we don't want the new software even to be physically present on the machine until we have tested every permutation of its use. So it's going to be difficult for everybody to make... I think to make clinical data papers available by AAPM, but I think you will see physics papers by AAPM.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "Okay fair enough. And then last question maybe for Elisha, or maybe for you Tim. With regards to your X-ray Products business, you had pretty good growth in this business for the last couple of years. Help us understand how you view this business in 2008, especially if some of your CT customers for X-ray tubes are feeling their own businesses pressured and what kind of impact do you think that could have on the S-ray franchise?", "Elisha W. Finney - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, in terms of the tube business, I mean... our expectation is still going to be in the mid single-digits in terms of orders and sales growth. Where we are really differentiating ourselves I think is in the flat panel business. We saw 25% growth in orders and sales in flat panels in Q1. We are gearing up with the new radiographic panels. We are getting very close to signing several contracts with very large customers for those panels. So I feel pretty confident that we can turn in and say mid teen growth for the total X-ray segment in sales for this year. So it will be just about a $300 million business for this year.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "Thanks, that's all I have got for you guys, thanks so much.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan, please proceed.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Securities", "Thanks for taking a follow-up.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Welcome back.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Securities", "Yes, thank you. One question I had was just about the installed Linec [ph] base and the idea that RapidArc may drive an acceleration of the conversion. Can you give us a sense as to what percentage of your installed base is not Clinac iX or upgradable at this stage and do you anticipate driving an upgrade cycle with some of these old [indiscernible] that are out there with RapidArc?", "Elisha W. Finney - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, I think, maybe the best way to think about it, Tycho, is there are 720 installs of IGRT out of our 5800-5900 installed base. So that would be the most sophisticated machines which is just a fraction of the total having IGR capability today.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We have 5,000 machines totally in our background, our installed base and you take those 700 machines, but we're putting in a lot of course every quarter and we're upgrading some old machines. But still it's... since we want IGRT to be on these machines in order to do RapidArc, I would anticipate that by the end of the year, we are probably talking about 1000 machines that are eligible for this.", "For machines that are more than 10 years old, I think I haven't calculated that number recently, but I recall it to be north of 1500 machines that are over 10 years old. So what we really would like to do is get those 1500 machines to start coming out and then of course several hundred machines become 10 years old every year, and so we would like to see those machines come out and if those things happen, it would get enormous boost to the replacement market for us. That's mostly in North America. Internationally as I've indicated in the past, we still don't see the replacement market being that strong. These are mostly new machines because there just aren't enough machines internationally. And so, almost every machine is a new machine rather than an old machine, replacing an old machine.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Securities", "Okay, great, yes that's really helpful. Thank you.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "We have no more audio questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Spencer Sias. Please proceed.", "Spencer R. Sias - Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations", "Thank you, thank you for participating.

Please proceed, sir.", "Spencer R. Sias - Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations", "Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Varian Medical Systems conference call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2008.

We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements because of new information, future events or otherwise.", "And now, here is Tim.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good afternoon and welcome. Today, we are reporting strong results for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 with tremendous demand for our RapidArc technology for fast, precise image-guided IMRT, double-digit order and revenue growth in our Oncology Systems and X-ray Products businesses, and solid progress in our Security business. These results have given us a more bullish outlook for revenue and earnings for the year.", "To summarize the financial results for the quarter compared to the year-ago quarter, net earnings per diluted share rose 22% to $0.56, operating earnings rose 19% to $103 million and revenues rose 19% to $528 million. Net orders for the quarter were $519 million, down 2% from the year-ago quarter when the company acquired ACCEL, which at that time had $68 million of orders including $47 million of backlog. Excluding the impact of ACCEL in both quarters, net orders rose 12% to $515 million. Our quarter-ending backlog including ACCEL rose 15% to $1.7 billion.", "Oncology Systems second quarter net orders rose 11% to $413 million with 15% growth in North America and 6% growth in the international regions. Year-to-date net order growth for Oncology Systems was 14% and for the trailing 12 months, net order growth was 12%. We generated order growth across most product lines but we enjoyed a tremendous response to our RapidArc product for faster delivery of image-guided IMRT, recording more than 60 orders for this capability since we began marketing it in January. This represents the strongest demand for any new Oncology product in our history and it reflects the need for faster, more user friendly and cost-efficient systems that enable clinics to offer advanced radiotherapy to more of their patients.", "From what we have seen so far, RapidArc promises to be another formidable weapon in the fight against cancer. A broad variety of customers are showing interest in RapidArc. We saw customers adding into their existing orders, ordering it on new machines and ordering upgrades for existing machines that are already equipped with our On-Board Imager. As might be expected, most of the RapidArc orders came from the US where early adopters are concentrated but we also received many orders from leading centers in Europe and Asia. Clinicians everywhere are fairly excited about the potential of this new technology. The faster treatment speed is simply amazing and the potential benefits are many. To clinicians, it means that they should be able to treat many more patients in a day while also potentially reducing the cost for treatment at a time when most healthcare costs are continuously rising. For public healthcare systems, it means they should be able to help more patients and reduce the critical waiting time for treatments.", "Shorter treatment times also mean that doctors should be able to improve patient comfort and reduce the chance of unwanted motion during dose delivery. This could make it possible to deliver higher doses to the tumor, which studies have shown can be more effective in eradicating cancer.", "Let me take a moment to address questions that we have received about the safety and treatment quality of this new technology. Preclinical validation worked by clinicians on our RapidArc counts [ph] and others shows that RapidArc treatments are generally... treatment plans are generally equivalent or superior to plans using slower conventional IMRT methods, including helical TomoTherapy. Furthermore, they have shown that treatments can be planned, checked, and delivered safely and routinely.", "We expect to begin our first RapidArc treatments... shipments by the end of the month. After a brief period of installation and commissioning, treatment programs will be ramping up very quickly. As a reminder, RapidArc is not a standalone specialty product that is limited to one type of treatment. It is a powerful complement to the many treatment capabilities that already exist on Varian's Clinac and Trilogy accelerators.", "While RapidArc will be great for sites such as prostate and head and neck, other techniques are necessary for many types of cancer and the ability to offer all of these techniques on a single machine is very important. For example, the gold standard for breast cancer treatment is using the stationery beams rather than arcs to avoid hitting the patient's hearts and lungs. This is not an option on some devices, which are limited exclusively to delivering arc therapy. This is just one of many examples where specialty machines limit the treatment options for the clinic and the patient.", "Clinicians want versatile systems that allow them to choose the method or technique they believe is the optimal treatment for each and every one of their patients. Versatility, like speed, is critical for enhancing the quality and affordability of care. In that vein, we are seeing solid growth in our other oncology products. Unit order volumes for our high-energy accelerators and our OB On-Board Imager were up versus the year-ago period, better than 75% of the high-energy accelerator orders included in OB, and orders for OB upgrades on existing machines also increased over the year-ago quarter\u2019s total, excuse me. The rate of OB installations has increased. As of the end of the quarter, we had completed more than 830 installations of OB units, putting us far ahead of the competition in the deployment of image-guided IMRT. At this rate, I expect we will have more than 1,000 machines equipped with image guidance capability before the end of this fiscal year.", "We continued to achieve wins in the radio surgery portion of the market during the quarter with year-over-year orders growth for the Varian BrainLAB Novalis Tx product suite and our Trilogy units. We also generated 40% order growth in our brachytherapy business, which has now had two consecutive quarters with solid growth in net orders. Our service and software businesses also contributed to the order growth for Oncology Systems.", "Given recent reports from other medical device companies, you undoubtedly want to hear me talk about the economic conditions we are experiencing in our oncology market. We've been repeatedly asked whether hospital capital spending budgets are drying up and whether we will be affected by it. We are not seeing signs of tightened spending in hospitals or freestanding clinics. In fact we believe that the Economic Recovery Act in the US may be helping to stimulate some business. Radiotherapy continues to be a profit center and it's a high priority in capital spending budgets. Credit for new purchases appears to be readily available.", "Also, we are selling treatment machines. No one receives radiotherapy who does not need it. Cancer must be treated and radiotherapy products, particularly new products that enhance the quality and cost effectiveness of care, will always be needed. These factors and our experience during the second quarter give us reason for optimism.", "Focusing now on X-ray Products, we had another good quarter in revenue driven by... excuse me, a good order and revenue quarter driven by continuing expansion in our business in flat-panel detectors for filmless X-ray imaging.", "Net orders for X-ray Products rose a remarkable 23% to $83 million including a 10% increase in X-ray tube orders and a more than 50% increase in flat-panel orders. The quarter included a multi-million dollar order for panels from an X-ray equipment manufacturer in China.", "We are now shipping samples of our new radiographic panel to customers and we hope to initiate volume shipments in this product toward the end of the fiscal year. We expect this to become an important growth driver for the X-ray Product business next fiscal year.", "The second quarter growth in orders and revenues from both tubes and flat panels as well as the ongoing customer interest in the development of filmless X-ray imaging equipment give us a very positive outlook for this market.", "In our other category, the second quarter was impacted by our acquisition of ACCEL in the year-ago quarter. Compared to the second quarter of last fiscal year, combined second quarter net orders for ACCEL and our Security and Inspection Products businesses were down by $66 million or 75%. We are continuing to work on development of our ACCEL proton product line and customer interest remains high. We are optimistic that the long-term prospects for this business are solid.", "Net orders for our Security business were down slightly principally due to order timing. Meanwhile orders totals for the first half were up by more than 60% versus the year-ago period. Our Security business has now moved into its new manufacturing plant in Las Vegas and we are ramping up production there. Customer interest in our broader Security products remains high as nations including the US move to enhance our security.", "Now I'll turn this over to Elisha for a review of the numbers and then come back to you with our outlook for the third quarter and fiscal year 2008.", "Elisha W. Finney - Corporate Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Tim, and hello, everyone. As usual, I will walk you through the income statement as well as cover a few balance sheet items. And as a reminder, we will only be comparing quarter-over-quarter results on a GAAP basis. These comparisons include the impact of option expensing and the acquisition of ACCEL Instruments in the year-ago quarter.", "Second quarter revenues are $528 million, increased 19% in US dollars. Oncology Systems posted an increase of 17%, X-ray Products posted a gain of 14% and revenues from businesses under the Other category increased by $13 million or 69%. In local currency, total company revenues increased 15% from the year-ago quarter. The second quarter gross margin for the company decreased by almost two points to 40%.", "Oncology Systems gross margin fell by 136 basis points to 41.7% due primarily to a significant shift in revenues to lower-margin international regions and losses from currency hedging contracts. X-ray Products gross margin declined by about five points to 36.3%. This was due principally to a decline in flat-panel margins from an unsustainable record level achieved in the year-ago quarter. Rising material cost for our X-ray tubes and panels also contributed to this decline.", "Second quarter SG&A expenses were $76 million or 14% of revenues, an improvement of 1.5 points from the year-ago quarter and R&D expenses were $32 million or 6% of revenues even with the year-ago period as a percentage of revenues. Moving down the income statement, second quarter operating earnings were $103 million or 19.5% of revenues, even with the year-ago quarter as a percentage of revenues.", "Our Oncology Systems and X-ray Products businesses together contributed $118 million in operating earnings, while our Other category and corporate consumed a net $15 million.", "Depreciation and amortization totaled $9 million for the second quarter. Net interest income was $1.5 million for the quarter. The effective tax rate was up by almost one point to 32% and we believe for the full year that the tax rate will be between 32% and 32.5% with a lower rate in Q3 and a higher rate in Q4.", "Compared to the year-ago quarter, diluted shares outstanding dropped by 4 million shares to 128 million due primarily to the share repurchase program. Diluted EPS was $0.56, an increase of 22% above the year-ago quarter.", "Now turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $360 million, $122 million of combined long and short-term debt and stockholders equity of $908 million.", "DSO for the quarter was 90, up five days from the year-ago quarter. Second quarter cash flow from operations was $55 million. The primary source of cash was from net earnings. Primary uses of cash were $73 million for the stock repurchase program and $22 million of capital expenditures, which included the expansion of our SIP facility in Las Vegas. During the quarter, we spent $73 million to repurchase 1.5 million shares under a $12 million share repurchase authorization that extends through the end of this calendar year.", "Now I'll turn it back over to Tim for the outlook.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Elisha. Given the strong results from the second quarter and positive outlook in all of the major markets that we serve, we now believe that revenues for fiscal year 2008 could grow by 15% to 16% over fiscal year 2007 and that net earnings per diluted share for the fiscal year could be $2.09 to $2.11. For the third quarter of this fiscal year, we believe that revenues could grow in the mid-teens versus the year-ago quarter and that net earnings per diluted share could be $0.45 to $0.47. All in all, Varian customers around the globe are moving forward with their plans to protect and save lives using our technology and products.", "We will now take your questions.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from line of Jason Wittes of Leerink Swann. Please proceed.", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "Hi, thank you very much. First, I want to start with the obvious, that is capital equipment expenditures, maybe save the trouble of getting more questions on this, that is... I mean, one of your competitors did say they also did not see any impact from cap expenditure financing but they did not dismiss the fact that maybe later on in the year, they might. What is your outlook on that in terms of the customers you have been talking to and your feeling in terms of whether or not that may just trouble as the year progresses?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We have talked to people and we're just not picking up any evidence that that's happening for us.", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "Okay. Fair enough.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "And maybe in other products... other business lines, it is but we are not picking it up.", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "Okay. And would the same go for X-ray and for Security because the Security business, I guess your order rates were down a little bit this quarter, any thoughts there?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes... no, we are not picking up any problem in those areas either I will say in the Security business, this is a business where orders come in large lumps and we had a large lump in just [inaudible].", "Elisha W. Finney - Corporate Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, for the half, Jason, the Security Products is up over 60% in orders. So, it looks good.", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "Okay. Now looking at the order overseas, you had a tough comp but the order rates came in a little lighter than we expected. Could you give us a little more color in terms of how Asia looked and how Europe looked and if there was any things that we should be looking for there?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, the orders for Europe were up about 4% for Oncology, I assume is what you mean, Jason.", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "Yes, I do. Thank you.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Oncology orders were up about 4% in quarter two versus 13% in the year-ago quarter. Asia\u2026 excuse me, The Far East was up like 97%, it was a huge increase over the year-ago quarter. The Rest of the World was down quite a bit. And that's just because we include Australia in the Rest of the World for us, and Australia had an extremely strong year last year and the year before and we didn't expect that to repeat. We knew sooner or later that it would have an impact and this was the quarter in which it had that impact. So Europe, I think, Europe tends to be a major factor in this and it was up 4% but we don't see any issues in Europe going forward. And so we are not --.", "Elisha W. Finney - Corporate Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Jason, I would also just call your attention to the trailing 12 months, which I think is more reflective of what's really going on in any particular region because, like Tim said, you are going to get extreme lumpiness from quarter-to-quarter. But if you look at the trailing 12 months, US is up 9%; international, up 16%. So we got back into double-digit order growth on the trailing basis.", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "Okay. Fair enough. Just quickly on RapidArc, 60 orders is pretty impressive and it sounds to me like you think that we're still somewhat in the early innings here. Do you\u2026 should we expect sequentially every quarter you see an increase in this number in terms of going from 60 to say 100, 200, etcetera or how should we think about the pickup of RapidArc at this point?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Usually, I mean there was always the opportunity for some kind of a pent-up event in the beginning. We've been talking about this to some extent and not taking orders for six months before we were... before we had 510(k). So I'm not going to... I can\u2019t\u2026 and I can't predict what we're going to see in quarter three and quarter four. Over time I expect this number to rise considerably, but \u2013", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "There was a bolus effect, I guess, you're saying in this quarter?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, there could be a bolus effect. I'm not saying that there is but when the market knows that you're going to do something and they build up interest for it, and you can get an initial bolus and then you get your standard market, but over time, I expect that RapidArc is... people get a look at the results that other people are getting\u2026 looking at RapidArc, they are going to get excited and they are going to want it for themselves. So I expect it will build but I'm not predicting what it will do in quarter three.", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "Okay. And just quickly on that as well, are most of these upgrades or are some of these also de novo orders?", "Elisha W. Finney - Corporate Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It's kind of across the board, Jason. So it's on machines already in backlog, it's on new machine orders as well as upgrades. If I had to take a swag, I would say upgrades were about 20%... 15% to 20% of the total.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Actually I have the number.", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "Okay.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "It\u2019s\u2026 upgrades was 10% of the impact, so --.", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "And the rest was de novo?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "And the rest was either orders that were backlog or new machines.", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "And just one last thing on this and I'll jump back in queue. How long\u2026 if you just did an upgrade, how long would it take you to actually get that delivered? Is that a relatively quick turnaround or is that still a 9 to 12-month waiting period?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "No. How long would it take us to get delivered?", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "For an upgrade.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We probably know almost everybody, we are going to be upgrading for the next three, four months because they probably already ordered, that doesn't mean that we will be flexible. I think when we get through the next couple of months and we get our learning curve down, then the time period will be like three months.", "Elisha W. Finney - Corporate Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. But understand there are some prerequisites that the customer has to have in terms of what imaging device, collimator device, etcetera. So depending on if they already have all of that and if they don\u2019t can really change the amount of time.", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "Great, thank you.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Jason.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Amit Hazan of Oppenheimer. Please proceed.", "Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer", "Thanks. Hi, good afternoon, guys.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Amit, how are you?", "Amit Hazan \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Good. Maybe just starting with your guidance, I\u2019m hoping to get a little bit of clarity. It looks like with the beat that you had this quarter, you raised by\u2026 you raised your earlier EPS guidance by a little bit less than what you beat by and if I'm not mistaken, at least you remind us that it looks like the tax rate that you're guiding to is maybe just slightly less than what it was guided to last quarter. Maybe help us out in understanding if we're losing any margin along the way here or what's going on between the guidance in this quarter?", "Elisha W. Finney - Corporate Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, Amit, you are right that the tax rate is slightly lower than what we had thought it was going to be for the year but understand, some of that was already reflected in the second quarter. So of that call it $0.05, some of that is already reflected in the tax rate. If you look at the full year, you are still going to see a slight increase in the operating margin percentage. What we're seeing is some toggling between gross margin and between the leveraging of the SG&A as the FX impacts are helping us on the top line, but as you know, we have hedged those contracts at the year-ago period, we lost in the gross profit dollars, so the gross margin percentage is coming down. So versus what we had first thought, you're going to see a little bit of variability between how much of this comes from margin versus leverage, I suspect most of it now is going to come from leveraging our operating expenses that you are still going to see a pre-tax margin in the 19% to 19.5% range which is kind of in line with what we had previously talked about.", "Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just a couple sets of questions on RapidArc, following up. First of all, I'm just wondering, first of all, how long it's taking these customers to evaluate the product right now and what do you think if that's the right thing to think about going forward? And then I am most interested in your new orders, your new unit, your new system orders and how many RapidArcs were ordered on those and I'm wondering if you can give us some color on how it is for you from a competitive standpoint now an ability to offer that. I mean, you're feeling like you're gaining share with those. Are you able\u2026 are you winning deals that you may otherwise not have or focusing on the new orders side of it, maybe give us some color on that?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. So, there is a lot of questions in there. If I miss some of them, you will have to remind me. But on deals for new machines, about 60% of the orders we got for RapidArc were on new machine orders. So some people went back and upgraded their backlog, etcetera. In terms of how long it takes people to evaluate it, because we don't... we're just now shipping clinically\u2026 well, we will be shipping clinically by the end of the month, the Clinical Systems, what people have been doing to evaluate is they've either been visiting a member of the RapidArc Council who had seen it and some of whom had actual working prototypes and were able to run it, or they come to Palo Alto and we would run it on our machines here, we demonstrate the system. That was about a one-hour discussion. They see it, they look at the plan. Sometimes they bring their own plans and run the cases and then we take one out and run it on the machine so they could see it run and get a feeling for it. So it's not a long and complicated argument, it's about... it's not an argument at all. It's about a one-hour demonstration of the capabilities and then people are\u2026 people get it, it\u2019s not hard for them to get. What was the third part of your question again?", "Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer", "Well, I don't even remember. I think...", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. You're making me feel better.", "Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer", "I think it's just in terms of the new unit that you had ordered this quarter, and if you can give us some color, if you feel those are deals you would have won anyway, or if this has changed the competitive dynamics on the ground for your at all?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, you kind of have to ask our competitors if it\u2019s affected the dynamic and of course, I'm pretty sure, I know what their answer will be. But, if we take more than 60 orders, it certainly has had an affect. Clearly our competitors are concerned about RapidArc, they are all reacting to it, but I have to say, our mission is to fight cancer and we consider this an important advance in that battle, and so the only people we're... the people who are really interested in their opinion are the investigators and the customers who are going to use this clinically and are going to do the research for us and they're going to be the final judges. But, so far based upon what we've been told, what comments people have made, they regard what we have done here is important, they regard it superior to other choices that they have seen, they think it's a very compelling technology and they think it's going to be formidable.", "Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer", "Okay. And just one follow-up on RapidArc would be just as it starts to the P&L next quarter, I'm wondering if you can give us a sense of what the ASP we should be thinking of is for these upgrades that are going to hit the revenue line first? And then, at least if there is\u2026 I mean, we are imagining that this is going to be mostly gross margin improvement, but give us a sense of how this might flow through or it\u2019s exceedingly going to be really an impact in the early quarters?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think we have indicated that the list price is around 400 which you have to remember includes a lot of elements to enable customers to implement it. We are obviously for competitive reasons love [ph] to reveal what our actual achieved pricing will be, but I will say that we did okay.", "Elisha W. Finney - Corporate Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And Amit, in terms of how it's going to flow through the P&L, it is software, so we recognized on acceptance. And understand most of this is an FY09 revenue of that. So as we talked about, about 90% of these orders came through on either machines already in backlog or on new systems, which implies that many of these will be delivered in fiscal year '09. So we have built in some estimates of what we believe RapidArc will do in terms of sales for this fiscal year, but it\u2019s primarily an '09 revenue story.", "Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer", "Okay. And then just one final one from me, just pushing you a little bit on the OUS orders, we saw Elekta, I guess your biggest competitor, their orders were pretty soft in Europe as well, really soft in their last reported quarter, in fact\u2026 actually in the last six months, I'm just wondering in Europe if you're seeing anything particular, any kind of a lull before people start ordering RapidArc or if there is anything you can point to that might be kind of a broader slowdown that at some point may either pickup or anything you can help us to give an idea what's going on there?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, first, I would remind you that in Europe, year-to-date we\u2019re up 15%. So, we are not year-to-date seeing a softness. Yes, in quarter two, it was 4% but as you know, international territories are lumpy. So I wouldn't draw conclusions based upon quarter two, I would look at the more of the year-to-date numbers. Obviously international territories go up and down and this is why we tend to talk about the US as one territory and we tend to give you the entire international market although we do give you a color on it. The fact is that individual companies move all over the countries, move all over the place from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year and so it's a little hard to predict. But I'm not\u2026 we are not unsatisfied with our prospects in Europe and will... we hope that as we\u2026 as the leaders there adopt RapidArc and other things that it will be a stimulus to additional business.", "Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer", "Okay, fair enough guys, thanks very much.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from... your next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla of Citi. Please proceed.", "Amit Bhalla \u2013 Citigroup", "Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to start first with Elisha. Can you give us what the constant currency growth rate was in orders in Oncology and give us a color, or give us some split, US, OUS of those 60 RapidArc orders?", "Elisha W. Finney - Corporate Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay, I'll give you the first part, we are not going to break out the second part. So it came from, as we talked about in the script, mostly... RapidArc came mostly from the US where you have the concentration of early adaptors but we did see significant orders coming out of Europe and Asia as well, but it was concentrated in the US. In terms of the constant currency, if you look at Q2 orders for just Oncology, instead of 6% international growth in US dollars, it was zero in local currency and then again 15% in North America and if you look at it for the first half, instead of 17% growth in dollars, Oncology achieved 9% in constant currency.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup", "Okay, thanks. And just on RapidArc, is there anything that kind of precludes you from performing second arcs to treat cancer patients, anything maybe on the patent side or on the software side that would keep the technology from doing treatments with two arcs? And I have one other follow-up.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I guess in terms of second arc, I know some people have claimed rights there. We don't think we are prohibited from... the way we are doing it we think we are fine and\u2026 but frankly, we have been able to do what we wanted to do with a single arc and so we are not sure why we want to do that.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup", "Okay and just... I did one other additional question on just capital spending, I guess, if we were to back out the RapidArc orders in the fiscal second quarter for Oncology, where would we be in order growth or if you wanted to answer in different way, could you also talk to us about what\u2019s order growth for just the linear accelerator business?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, we don't... Amit, we don't break them apart that way. As far as we're concerned, advances in technology count and they need to be included, it\u2019s just... if we had a new feature... I mean we're talking about RapidArc because we think it's important but we had new features all the time and we think it's proper to include them in orders and so we don't break it out and once again if I start giving you numbers, you're going to divide by units and you're going to get price and I just don't want to give away pricing information to competitors. So I can't help you.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup", "Okay. Just normally finish off with Novalis and Novalis, 14 orders last quarter, was it directionally up or down this quarter? Thanks for taking the questions.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Novalis plus Trilogy, it\u2019s hard for us to know sometimes because customers order\u2026 some customers order Trilogy and some of them order Novalis, but the sum of the two is up.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup", "What was the sum of the two then last quarter in units?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "In the year-ago number?", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup", "And quarter ago.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Last quarter. Oh, well, I'm talking about year-over-year. I mean quarter one was unusually strong because we just introduced the product. So I don't know that comparison off the top of my head.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup", "And I'll follow up offline. Thanks.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Junaid Husain", "of Soleil Securities. Please proceed.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "Good afternoon, guys.", "Elisha W. Finney - Corporate Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good afternoon.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "Just given a lot of noise in the radiation oncology space relative to one of your competitors with regards to multi-unit orders and the timing of these orders from a revenue recognition perspective, I suspect that you guys over the years have always had to deal with multi-unit orders. Could you tell us what percentage of your backlog represents these multi-unit orders? And then as you look out to 2008, if you have noticed any pushback from hospitals on the receiving end of these multiple systems?", "Elisha W. Finney - Corporate Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Oh, boy! I don't have an exact figure for you, Junaid. I would say that it's more likely to come from either international deals, which tend to be large, bulk government buys and international represents on average about 50% of our total and then probably the freestanding centers in the US would be more likely to come in and order bulk units as they\u2019re filling up multiple sites that they are addressing. In terms of on the revenue side, I mean, yes, we tend to get orders that come in bulk but clearly we know that they are not all going to install at the same time. You have to move these things through elevator shaft and you're only going to do that serially, not at the same time. So it's just a matter of keeping up with the customer\u2019s construction schedules and where they are at on room readiness and planning accordingly.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "What is your\u2026 maybe rephrase your question a little bit, specifically, what is it you\u2019re worried about?", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "Well, I'm just wondering if you're seeing any pushback from the hospitals. And so they use the... will take the first system and then will take the next system a couple of months later as kind of their rationale for spacing out just in the event that they are having any credit issues.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I see [ph] what you're saying. No. No, we haven't seen that.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "Okay. That's helpful. And then with regards to the RapidArc orders that you have booked to date, could you give us a sense for the hospitals that are placing the orders? Is it coming from the large academic medical institutions or is it the for-profit freestanding centers, whatever metrics you can provide to help us understand the caliber of institution that's placing RapidArc would be helpful?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I guess, I'm going to have to say that it's coming from the whole universe of institutions. We are seeing all types of institutions. Certainly, we are seeing academic interest but we're also seeing interest by people who do therapy everyday. There are obviously... there is a certain group of customers who are... who like new technology, who want to be first and who want to do it first. But what you have to remember is that a lot of the people who work at these... and you would think that would be academic institutions. But the fact is that a lot of people who work at these other institutions got their training at academic institutions and they are often academically very talented and skilled people. So even though they operate in a local clinic, they may see this early adoption as something they want to do. So you've seen MIMA come in, I don't know if you've heard presentations by them in Florida, they are an example of an institution that has a lot of capability to take on new technologies and so they are an example of what we are talking about. So we see the mix across the way. I will say that among the non-academic institutions, people who had a heavy patient load were especially interested.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "Okay, that's helpful. And then, Tim, relative to how you see RapidArc growing out over the next few months, are you still of the opinion that the easy money, the low-hanging fruit, if you will, represents instruments that are currently in backlog versus upgrades of the installed base?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, it would be tempting to think that but in fact we've... certainly in the first quarter, most of the interest was new people who were placing orders for new machines. I think in the early stages, that's the way it\u2019s going to be. Upgrades to both backlog and upgrades to installed machines historically happens second because they have to go back and get the budget to do that and that they have to go back to administration and they have to have the conversation, administration once evidenced. So if you are an early adopter type, then you're used to providing that evidence, you have that kind of relationship with your administration. So we tend to see that, but for everybody else, it's... if they are looking at buying 2 million and now they want to buy 2.4 million, that's an easier argument to have with administration, something new has happened and so we want to add this capability and that\u2019s an easier discussion to have with your administration than for people who want to get upgrades.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "Okay. Fair enough. And then Elisha, just a couple of quick numbers if I could. Are you giving out an updated Trilogy number of the installed base and then the number of Trilogies that were ordered in the quarter?", "Elisha W. Finney - Corporate Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, we do not.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, we've... we talked about\u2026 I guess, we've done that in the past, but we have decided that we are... that's a number we want to... for our\u2026 once again for competitive reasons keep to ourselves.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "Could you give us the\u2026 an updated installed base number, total installed base, total [inaudible]?", "Elisha W. Finney - Corporate Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I don't have an exact number, it's around 5,000.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "Okay. That's fine.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "For the total?", "Elisha W. Finney - Corporate Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "For the total.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "And then lastly relative to your competition, the folks that TomoTherapy put out an interesting press release about a month ago, the TomoTherapy Treatment Quality Challenge. I was wondering what your thoughts on this... what are your thoughts on this relative to your confidence level in RapidArc head-to-head with the pilot system?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, clearly, they are concerned about RapidArc. They see it as something that is threatening or else they wouldn\u2019t have done this. But we don't... this is just not the kind of thing that we do and we don't... as I indicated, I think on an earlier questionnaire, our goal here is to fight cancer and we've calculated... we have done enough dose plans to know in our testing that this is an important improvement for our users and so we are going to it field it and a lot of our users have indicated that they think RapidArc is well enough, is good enough and fast enough and easy enough for them to use that this will be a preferred solution for them in the future. As to what impact they will have on competitors or what their thoughts might be, that's an issue for them.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "Great. Thanks so much, guys. That's all we have.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Rodi [ph] of Figal Bryan [ph]. Please proceed.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, guys. Congratulations on a good quarter.", "Elisha W. Finney - Corporate Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, Jeff [ph].", "Unidentified Analyst", "I was curious trying to understand just a little bit more about what the average size of Security order looks like.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Oh, boy! Let me think. They range... you got to remember that the order to the end customer includes a facility. So the... so if it's a government that\u2019s buying it, the order is in the millions. But our piece may be relatively small. It may range from a couple hundred thousand dollars up to $1 million depending upon what level of capability. So I would have to say small systems, small machines are in the couple hundred thousand range. And I should add this thought. This is one of the reasons why we were interested in BIR, because we realized that we were just selling linear accelerators and a lot of our customers wanted really good imaging systems. And so by adding those imaging systems, we were able to increase our share of the overall end unit business. And so, that's why we had some strong orders associated with the IntellX. This is a product that came to us with BIR that actually enables us to scan drugs. And so the IntellX adds a substantial amount of volume. So we will see that play out over time, that's still a relatively new thing for us. But I expect that it will be a source of growth. I think, BIR by itself would have had a certain degree of success. But the combination of BIR with Varian will be much more successful than either company would have been on its own.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hello.", "Elisha W. Finney - Corporate Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Did we lose you, Jeff [ph]?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Are we still connected, Operator?", "Operator", "Yes, he is not.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Please proceed.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Good afternoon.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Tycho.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "I appreciate the color you guys provided on the hospital spending. I am just curious, I know it's an early developing business for you. But does this change your outlook on proton at all given that that's where you are going to need new facility build out to happen? You talked obviously about this being a longer-term contributor. But --?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it's reassuring that we're not seeing this effect. But protons are such a gigantic expenditure compared to a linear accelerator. A linear accelerator, if the room is $0.5 million, $0.75 million and the machine is in the $2 million or more range, well, then that total transaction is in the $2.5 million to $3.5 million range. A proton facility for four rooms including construction of the facility is in the $110 million, $120 million range. So it's an entirely different thing. So what they do is if you have to view it not as normal capital equipment for a hospital, they make it as a strategic decision and it's like laying in huge infrastructure for the future as though they were buying a power plant, for example. And so they view it that way and they get their capital in different... it's not like a normal capital budget. It's a special item that they build up to for years. They usually get special people to help them arrange the financing. It's much more complicated and that's why the transactions last for a long time.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "I guess that was the heart of my question and given that you're getting specked in earlier in the process there, what are you seeing further down the road then?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So far all the people that we're talking to, their projects are still on.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So nobody has come to us and said we can't get the money. Everybody is still active.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay. On the RapidArc, again appreciate the color there, with regards to the retrofits given some of the challenges you had in the past on IGRT, can you give us a sense as to how we should think about downtime? And I appreciate it's kind of the second wave of adoption that will be retrofitting their older systems and then also to what extent you think you can convert some of the older linear accelerators that are out there in the field?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "If they have an OB, as we have indicated, we're right now, we feel that we want to put this on machines that have the latest image guidance for the simple reason that this is an ultra-conformal technique and these outcomes are being compared to other ways of doing outcome, other ways of doing Arc IMRT. All Arc IMRT systems... or other Arc IMRT systems use image guidance and we think image guidance needs to be done on these systems to make sure conformality is maintained. So assuming they have an On-Board Imager on the machine, if I address the question of how long it takes to put in, right now, we've run some experiment jobs, just tell you a story; we recently put one of these things on a machine that had IGRT, we started Friday night, we put it on the machine and because it was not FDA approved, we had to take it off by Monday morning and we got it on and took it off by Monday morning and ran test site. So that's reassuring that it can be done. However, I will admit that when we do this, there's no shortage of talent available on that side to make sure that that happens. So I don't expect that every time I expect that. But I would expect that within six months, we will certainly get the times down. And I will also indicate that, we can put this on machines that are many years old. So I expect that the upgrade opportunities are significant and providing, they have an OB, I think this will be a relatively short upgrade.", "Now, following our physical upgrade, the customer does have to commission. And there, what we have done is we have gone out and found a number of institutions who are willing to help customers go rapidly through their commissioning process and they\u2019re\u2026 we are... they're not going to do that through us, they\u2019re going to offer it directly to customers. It's not going to be in our price book to do that but we're going to introduce them. If customers want help doing commissioning, we're introducing to people because what we want to do is get the largest number of people able to use this clinically as we can over the course of the next six months, that's the way we get maximum impact on cancer outcomes and for patients.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay. That's helpful. And then finally, Elisha, you had talked about higher material cost for the X-ray business. Are you passing those on to your customers or --?", "Elisha W. Finney - Corporate Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We try but as you know our largest customers were actually entering into annual and sometimes multi-year contracts that do have some pricing step-ups in it, but it's hard to match that up exactly. I know that X-ray probably found it a little shocking when we talked about 5 points gross margin in a quarter, but if I bring you back to the year and versus where they were two years ago, X-ray has really brought their margin levels up by virtue of the flat-panel technology. So I looked back for fiscal year '06, they were in the mid-30, they were at about 35%. And for this year, they\u2019re going to be in the 38% to 39% gross margin level. So we really have taken those levels up by virtue of these panel products.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. I'll just add that. And clearly, we buy materials all over the world and the euro has affected the cost of certain materials for us, competition from other nations for scarce materials has gone up and has driven up the price of certain rare metals and all of\u2026 and we use a lot of rare metals in our X-ray tubes. And so that has impacted our cost. So all the... this factory, if I could say that they have one\u2026 they have many core skills. But, one of their core skills is that they systematically work to get to control their cost because they know, they expect that the cost of commodities are going to go up and so they constantly work at improving their processes, improving the way they do things. That\u2019s why we invest in capital equipment for tubes is because we know we have to attack this problem. So some quarters, we get... we'll introduce a change and we get a cost reduction and materials didn't go up that much in that quarter. So we get a big benefit for X-ray tubes. In other quarters, we see the costs go up but the results of our cost reduction efforts in other places didn't hit and so that's why you see this number jump around. But overall, I'm very proud of their ability to keep on top of cost.", "Elisha W. Finney - Corporate Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And I would just add in the year-ago quarter, we shipped some, if my memory serves me correct, some beta panels at extremely high pricing and that was just unsustainable. So most of the impact was just given that we are now in production volumes as opposed to those beta volumes.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Right.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Gill Alexander [ph] of Darfield Associates [ph]. Please proceed.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good afternoon. Nice quarter.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Gill [ph].", "Elisha W. Finney - Corporate Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, Gill [ph].", "Unidentified Analyst", "A question, could you maybe update us on using your machine on treating breast cancer now, and what still has to be done?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we treat breast cancer regularly with our machines. Breast cancer\u2026 since the... if you look at the way breast cancer is done, what you want to try and do is treat the breast itself and you want to try to minimize the amount of dose you give to lung wall and to heart because the lung and the heart are very sensitive to dose. And so generally breast cancer is treated with tangents where you come in tangent to the chest wall and try to minimize dose that way and you also want to minimize dose to the opposite breast because stray dose could cause secondary cancers in 20 to 30 years and we want to avoid that. And the purpose of breast... the ordinary procedure for breast cancer is you remove the lump, you remove the area of tumor and then you treat the breast prophylactically. Now having said that, there is interest in some quarters in taking a certain subset of patients and only treating the area immediately around the [inaudible] wound. There is some thought that certain patients would qualify and that they are going to get the same outcome. Frankly, no one... I mean although there is cosmetic results are known, we need patients that are out 10 to 15 years before we know whether that works. So I regard that as somewhat experimental but there is still this interest. There are some women who for lifestyle reasons don't want to go through the 30 fractions of external beam radiation therapy. They want to have it in a shorter period of time. So they are interested in having a partial, let's call, partial breast irradiation. But as I say, we don't have long-term studies on partial breast. There are reasons when you look at surgical studies that were done at the past, not to be wholly optimistic about that being the right way to go. But for patients who might not have received radiation therapy at all because of lifestyle reasons, that's a better choice than not doing any radiation at all. Have I covered your questions?", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yes. And do you use brachytherapy much or not too much?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Brachytherapy is a common treatment for breast. There was a rise in interest in brachytherapy using the MammoSite device. Once again that's a partial breast irradiation solution and we don't know what the results are going to look like out ten years.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you very much.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "In five years, okay.", "Operator", "That concludes our Q&A session for today. I will now turn the call back over for closing remarks.", "Spencer R. Sias - Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations", "Thank you for participating.

Sir, you may proceed.", "Spencer Sias - Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations", "Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Varian Medical Systems' conference call for the third quarter of fiscal year 2008. With me are Tim Guertin, President and CEO; Elisha Finney, CFO; and Tai Chen, our Corporate Controller. Tim will start this afternoon by summarizing our financial results and operational highlights for the quarter. Elisha will detail the P&L and balance sheet. And Tim will finish with the company's outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2008, and our preliminary outlook for fiscal year 2009. We will take your questions following the presentation.", "To simplify our discussion, unless otherwise stated, all references to the quarter or year or fiscal quarters and fiscal years, quarterly comparisons are for the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 versus the third quarter of fiscal year 2007.

Some of the risks relating to our business are described in our quarterly earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements because of new information, future events or otherwise. And now, here is Tim.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good afternoon and welcome. Today we are reporting terrific performance for the third quarter of fiscal 2008. Net orders rose 15% to $575 million. Revenues rose 21% to $513 million. Operating earnings rose 35% to $89 million. Net earnings rose 47% to $74 million. And our quarter-ending backlog rose 13% to $1.8 billion.", "Our company hit on all cylinders, crossed [ph] all major businesses, as we address lifesaving needs are focused, X-ray energy and cancer therapy, filmless imaging and stronger security measures at ports and borders.", "Starting with cancer therapy. Our Oncology Systems businesses' third quarter rose\u2026 orders rose 12% to $461 million. Net order growth was 12% in North America and 13% in international markets or constant currency growth was 1% with gains in all regions but Europe.", "Year-to-date and trailing 12-month net order growth for this business was 13%. Oncology's net order growth was driven by unit volume for high-energy treatment machines, higher OB On Board Imagers for image-guided radiotherapy, and our new RapidArc products for faster, more conformal image-guided IMRT.", "Service also contributed significantly to Oncology Systems' orders growth during the quarter with the help of increasing customer adoption of software service agreements. RapidArc demand remained quite strong during the quarter. We now have more than 150 orders for RapidArc, including about 70 orders taken with new machines during the third quarter, in addition to the approximately 60 orders on new machines last quarter when we introduced the product.", "As expected, orders for RapidArc upgrades were down sequentially from the bolus [ph] of upgrade orders we experienced in the second quarter. RapidArc installations are underway, and treatments have already commenced at centers in Alabama, California, New York, Illinois, Texas, and Florida, as well as outside the U.S. in Denmark and the Netherlands.", "Clinicians are beginning to use RapidArc to treat prostate, head and neck and brain cancer, as well as soft tissue sarcomas. Doctors are also talking about using it for certain cases of pancreatic and lung cancer. We expect additional RapidArc treatment protocols will be developed as this technology is deployed more broadly in the clinical environment.", "Our RapidArc upgrade opportunity expanded during the quarter with order growth for our OB accessory, which is a prerequisite for RapidArc. The OB was included on nearly 80% of the high-energy treatment machines ordered during the quarter, and OB upgrade orders also rose above totals in the year ago quarter. As of the end of the quarter, we had completed 930 OB installations and we remain on track to complete 1,000 installations by the end of the fiscal year. These are already\u2026 these are ready candidates for RapidArc upgrades.", "Suffice it to say we are pleased with the market response to this new technology and we think it\u2019s going to make a big difference to hundreds of thousands of cancer patients and caregivers around the world.", "Subsequent to the close of the quarter, we announced that our ARIA database and software for managing cancer clinics received the top ranking in a study released by KLAS, an independent research firm that monitors performance of healthcare vendors. Categories where ARIA excelled included ease-of-use, quality of releases and upgrades and compatibility of third-party\u2026 with third-party products. According to KLAS, Varian is considered by many providers to have the most developed and comprehensive oncology solution. This results from our commitment to continuous improvements and to making it easier and easier for all members of the clinical team to plan, deliver, and manage even the most advanced treatment protocols.", "As a result of our most recent improvements, ARIA now enables physicians to review patient images, plans, and records from their offices. There is a big timesaver that only Varian offers.", "We\u2019ve also made it easier for clinicians working in paperless environments to tailor electronic medical records and reports that support their specific work processes. Now with our electronic scheduling tool, changes are reflected throughout the department within a shared database immediately without the need to distribute updates.", "We expect ARIA and all of our products will get better and better all the time. So, one of the key\u2026 which is one of the keys to making radiotherapy accessible to more patients. Touching briefly on reimbursements, CMS has had proposed new rates for calendar year 2009 released and these are in line with our expectations for a modest reduction in the code for daily IMRT delivery with increases in other codes, including basic treatment delivery. This validates our strategy of offering customers more versatile, high-throughput machines capable of treating the broadest possible range of cases with the lowest cost per procedure.", "All-in-all, the radiation oncology market looks very healthy. And our outlook for continued growth in this arena is optimistic. Before ending my remarks about oncology, I just want to say that we are energized by the lifesaving work that we're doing, and sometimes by the patients themselves. To give you a recent example, Raisagar [ph], a 66-year-old expat and prostate cancer patient visited our plant in England where he is now living, so he could see and learn more about the technologies being used to treat his disease.", "To quote him, I lay on that machine during my treatment and thought, this is absolutely incredible, to be able to focus the beam with the in-point\u2026 pinpoint accuracy shows how far this treatment has come. This is the kind of thing that makes Varian employees feel very good about what they do.", "Turning now to X-Ray Products, our flat panel business had a spectacular quarter. Net orders for X-Ray Products rose 45% to $85 million, including a more than $11 million order from a large new customer, who is launching a multi-modality imaging system for medical diagnostics. Year-to-date, X-Ray Products\u2019 net orders have grown 25%.", "We\u2019ve added new products\u2026 customers for our flat-panel products while many existing customers have increased their order volumes. Meanwhile we continue to work on commercializing a new line of radiographic panels that is now starting to contribute to our orders growth rate. It should begin to impact sales growth in this business in fiscal 2009. The market is transitioning from film based imaging to flat panel digital imaging. Our customers in the X-ray imaging manufacturing industry are updating their product portfolios to go filmless, and we are a partner in many of these endeavors.", "As an example, a major Chinese equipment manufacturer is now incorporating our new radiographic panels into digital X-ray machines going to hospitals across China. For patients around the globe, our flat panel technology should enable faster, more cost effective imaging that reduces the time needed to take\u2026 to see a medical problem, make a diagnosis, and begin treatments. There's a lot of potential here.", "As we pointed out, flat panels could become a several hundred million dollar business for Varian, and the X-Ray Products team has made excellent progress on our strategy to realize this potential.", "I\u2019ll finish up my comments by covering our other category, including our SIP, Security and Inspection Products business, the ACCEL proton therapy unit, and our Ginzton Technology Center.", "Total third quarter net orders for this category were $29 million, down 2% from the year-ago quarter when we acquired $3 million of BIR backlog. Excluding this acquired backlog, net orders for this category were up 8% versus the year-ago quarter, and 12% increase in SIP net orders.", "Year-to-date, SIP net orders are up 33% versus the comparable period in 2007. Volume deployments of security systems for ports and borders in Europe, the U.S. and the Far East drove orders for our SIP products.", "We are continuing to invest in our ACCEL proton therapy technology as planned, and we're talking with several institutions that are planning to build proton therapy centers.", "So, now I\u2019ll turn it over to Elisha for a review of the numbers, and then come back to you with our outlook for the balance of the fiscal year.", "Elisha W. Finney - Corporate Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Tim, and hello everyone. As usual, I will walk you through the income statement, as well as cover a few balance sheet items.", "As a reminder, we will only compare quarter-over-quarter results on a GAAP basis. These comparisons include the impact of option expensing, the acquisition of ACCEL in the second quarter of fiscal year '07, and the acquisition of BIR in the year-ago third quarter.", "Third quarter revenues of $513 million increased 21%. Oncology Systems posted an increase of 21% over a weak year-ago quarter. X-Ray Products posted a gain of 22% and revenues from businesses under the Other category increased by 23%. In constant currency, total company revenues increased 17% from the year-ago quarter.", "The third quarter gross margin for the company increased by almost a point to 41%. Even with continued losses from currency hedging, Oncology Systems' gross margin increased by more than a point to 43%, due primarily to product mix and higher volumes. X-Ray Products\u2019 gross margin rose half a point to 40%, due to the higher proportion of flat panel revenues. Year-to-date, total company gross margin is almost even with the year-ago period at 41%.", "Third quarter SG&A expenses were $85 million or 17% of revenues, a full point improvement from the year-ago quarter. Year-to-date, SG&A as a percentage of revenues also improved by almost a point to 16%. R&D expenses were $36 million or 7% of revenues, even with the year-ago period, and year-to-date, R&D expenses are up 15% in absolute dollars, but down slightly as a percentage to 6% of revenues.", "Third quarter operating earnings rose 35% to $89 million or 17% of revenues, up almost two points from the year-ago quarter. Our Oncology Systems and X-Ray Products businesses together contributed $112 million in operating earnings while our Other category and corporate consumed a net $23 million. Year-to-date, operating earnings rose 24% to $277 million or 18% of revenues.", "Depreciation and amortization totaled $9 million for the quarter and $27 million year-to-date. Net interest income was $1 million for the quarter. The effective tax rate was an unusually low 18% due to significant discrete tax benefits stemming primarily from our adoption of FIN 48 earlier in the year, and a positive resolution of a foreign tax audit. We now expect the tax rate for fiscal year 2008 to be about 30%.", "Compared to the year-ago quarter, diluted shares dropped by almost 3 million to 127 million due to the ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted earnings per share rose 49% to $0.58.", "Now turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $406 million, combined short and long-term debt of $107 million, and stockholders\u2019 equity of $952 million.", "DSO for the quarter was 79 days, down 14 days from the year-ago quarter. This improvement was due to the exceptionally strong collections during the quarter. Cash flow from operations was a third quarter record, $114 million. The primary sources of cash were net earnings and a reduction in accounts receivable. Primary uses of cash were $62 million for the stock repurchase program and $21 million for capital expenditures.", "During the quarter, we spent $62 million to repurchase 1.2 million shares under a 12 million-share repurchase authorization that extends through the end of this calendar year. Since fiscal year 2001, we have repurchased 35 million shares at a weighted average price of just over $39 per share.", "Now, I will turn it back over to Tim for the outlook.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Elisha. Given the strong results from the third quarter and a positive outlook in our major businesses, we believe that for 2008 total company revenue should increase by about 17% to 18% above 2007, net earnings per diluted share for 2008 should grow by about 22% over the total for 2007. At this very early stage, we estimate that revenues for fiscal 2009 could grow by about 12%, and earnings per diluted share should grow at a slightly faster rate than revenues.", "We are confident in our growth strategy. We are well positioned to improve cancer therapy treatment around the world, support the transition to digital imaging and strengthen security measures at ports and borders, our outlook for the quarter and the year ahead is optimistic. It\u2019s a great time to be part of Varian Medical Systems.", "And we will now take your questions.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Amit Hazan from Oppenheimer. Please proceed.", "Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Thank you, hi. Good afternoon, guys.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Amit.", "Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer & Co.", "I thought maybe first on, on RapidArc, just for housekeeping, if you can help us out. I think I heard a few numbers, I heard a 150 number for orders, but I heard 70 orders in the quarter. So, can you help us get to that number if there was 60 in March and 70 now? Just to reconcile that and if you can help us by also breaking out those 70 units in the quarter like you did last time between the units that were ordered on\u2026new units ordered during the quarter and those on the units sitting in backlog?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Amit, this is Tim. Well, I will try to help you and then Elisha will fix what I say. The\u2026last quarter, we had about six\u2026I think, we said we had more than 60. About 60 were the orders that came with new machines, we had more than 60 and the rest were\u2026were upgrades and we didn't specify the exact number. We just said more than 60. This quarter we had about 70 that came with machines and the reason why we are saying it that way is, because we are drawing\u2026 we are trying to draw attention to the fact that last quarter, we had this bolus of upgrade orders, and I didn't expect that to continue, and I think, I had been saying that consistently that that was, I felt a one-time event. So the trend that I am paying attention to is the trend of the take grade that goes with new machines and that number has risen from about 60 last quarter to about 70 this quarter. So that's good news. It means it's going in the right direction. Upgrades went the other direction, they went down from quarter-to-quarter. So, if you have the 60 and the 70 and compared to 150, you get an idea about what I am talking about, but remember all of the numbers I am giving you are approximate and we in\u2026for the 150, we got more than that and last time when we said 60, we got more than that. So I am not giving you exact numbers, but I am giving you the trends.", "Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Okay, great. And then, just in terms of RapidArc and how it impacted your P&L, I am wondering if you can tell us how many have been installed in the quarter and whether that was a component of helping gross margin and then likewise, how we should think about that going forward, maybe how many units you expect to install in September and even next year, just general thoughts on how that's going to impact the gross margin line and then operating margin line?", "Elisha W. Finney - Corporate Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, Amit, the good news is that really had only a very insignificant impact on the margin in Q3. So as you know for it's offered product, we are going to take the revenue on installation and acceptance of which by the end of the third there were a handful, there was a\u2026 some revenue taken in the quarter, it was tiny relative to the total on quality. It was less than 1%, one should say that, so we really have yet to see the P&L impact of RapidArc other than coming to on these orders in the backlog line, but it really has not been reflected in the sales and margin line as of yet.", "Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer & Co.", "And going forward?", "Elisha W. Finney - Corporate Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Going forward, clearly as we ramp up and as we get more acceptances of the product, Q4 there will more than Q1, I would still claim, it's going to be pretty insignificant in the scheme of how big Q4 typically is. It's really more than FY '09 and FY '10 story.", "Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Okay, great and then just one more from me. On the unit side in terms of the actual orders for systems, I think, Tim, you mentioned that, you had that was one of the reasons that you had growth in the quarter, I am assuming that means that you had positive volume unit growth in the quarter, if you can just comment on that and also of course as it relates to what we get past about a lot in terms of hospital spending if you've seen any impact at all either in the order side or the installation side?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, there was positive unit growth in the quarter as the U.S. continues to not display the problem for us that some other companies have seen, and we don't see any indications at the end of the third quarter of that problem manifesting in radiation oncology, I think I've said in the past that radiation oncology is part of cancer therapy and cancer therapy along with cardiology and emergency rooms are an important attract... a way to attract patients to hospitals. And so this is one of the areas where hospitals are inventing... investing. We've also seen good growth internationally in Asia, for example, we have had some very nice growth this year, I think and as we mentioned, I think the only area where in constant currency, we're just not seeing the growth that we might hope for this year would be in Europe and that's just because we just have a super competitive environment there.", "Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Okay, great. Thanks very much.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Please proceed.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Hi, good afternoon.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Tycho.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Maybe, just I guess, following up on your last comment there, Tim, on just on the competitive landscape, I mean you have left that out there now, and can you just comment on whether the level of kind of competitive activities picked up and maybe if there is any underlying dynamic with regards to pricing that would be helpful?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. The competitive environment is pretty fierce especially in Europe. We are seeing some really almost desperation discounting on the part of competitors, and I expect that that would be hurting their future margins. They are taking deals that are pretty frightening. And so we are fighting with good products and we are fighting with what we think is reasonable pricing, and so I do think that that will affect the competitive environment. It means that you don't... you can't just walk in and offer better products and hope that customers will always do it, you have to fight. So in the U.S., I think pricing is fine. In the U.S., I think that people have accepted the new products and they have accepted our pricing, and since most of our competitors are manufacturing their machines outside the U.S., I think that helps in terms of what pricing they are willing to offer here.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay. And as I guess, maybe we think about high end to the market, can you just comment in and get a light, if you don't want to talk quantitatively about Novalis and what you are seeing there?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, the Novalis... we have a lot of interest on Novalis. This stereotactic market remains good, and so we are optimistic that that will remain important. I spend some time at a meeting.  I went to a BrainLAB meeting and that's called the Novalis Circle in Santa Barbara a few weeks ago and it was a very... it's a very interesting meeting for me. I talked to some neurosurgeons who, like one neurosurgeon was telling me how she was able to dramatically reduce the pain that people were suffering and not necessarily always from cancer, sometimes there were benign diseases, and she just was incredibly enthusiastic about her ability to do that, and I talked to a lot of other neurosurgeons who were just feeling really good about using radiation surgery... as a method of surgery rather than using knives and drills. And so this is the kind of thing you want to hear. You want to know that surgeons are seeing your technology as appropriate for their patients and are fighting with radiation therapy, but are grateful to have it, and I'll add that the funnel for neurosurgical business looks very good.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay, maybe just then shifting gears quickly to the X-Ray business, you talked a little bit about bringing some costs out of that business at your analyst meeting here in New York, and so, I'm just wondering if you can talk as to where you are in terms of the input costs and end point costs out of flat panel and then also on the Toshiba agreement, how we should think about that ramping?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, in terms to flat panels, of course this has... that's a good gross margin business for us right now, and I think when you see these gross margins improvements, it's really because the mix of this business is changing favorably toward flat panels. On X-Ray tubes themselves, our guys are putting up the good fight there. They are putting in constant design changes when I go to the meetings with them, it is a litany of micro changes to the design to try to take this precious material out and add precious material out, and still have the reliability improve and these kinds of things. It's a very tough challenge that they have. But so far, I think we probably are still seeing some changes... some increases in costs for X-Ray tubes and they are trying to surmount that by having a better mix of high performance tubes at their higher margin. And what was the second part of your question?", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "It is on the Toshiba agreement that you announced at your analyst day?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, we, well, we have a long-term agreement with Toshiba, and it lasts for a couple of years, and so you will be seeing us book orders even as we go along. We will break into pieces as we get close to delivery and that's how we generally handle these kinds of contracts.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay. And then, I guess, just one, last one on cargo screening, are you seeing any activity around air cargo? I know that you talked a little bit about that in the past.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, there is interest in air cargo. We are so far have been focused on containers and trucks going through borders, and there are that the advantage that we would have for air cargo as you get these very large crates and strap-together boxes for air cargo, were are using our machines to X-ray them would be extremely valuable. But I would have to say that process is much slower than the process for ports and borders.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I am not saying it's not going to happen, I am saying it's future growth potential, but I need future growth potential in the next three months.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Fair enough, all right. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Junaid Husain from Soleil Securities. Please proceed.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil - Neponset Equity Research, Inc.", "Hi, guys.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, how are you?", "Junaid Husain - Soleil - Neponset Equity Research, Inc.", "Good. Just a few questions for you on RapidArc, I think you talked about that half of that performing roughly, two to three RapidArc conciliation per week. So easy math conservatively assuming that you are doing two to three insulations per week and assuming the insulation as began as call it May 1, is it fair to assume that you guys have probably have recognized sales on 50 to 50 [inaudible]?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "It would not be fair to make that assumption. Let me explain, we... it is our typical method, when we introduce a new product to the market to ship a certain number to customers and then pause. And the reason why we pause is because we want to get feedback from those customers and make sure that when we start shipping in very large quantities, we are ready and the reason... there is a lot of reasons why that can happen, we can think that the product is ready, but then discover that different people have different network environments or different education needs or that the documentation can be improved or that certain questions ought to be answered or that certain additional training is needed, that sort of thing. So it's our procedure to see a fair number installed in the first month and a half and then a pause and that is what we have done. And so, I would expect us to pick up again here in the fourth quarter, but the real on slot [ph] RapidArc installation is going to happen in Q1.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil - Neponset Equity Research, Inc.", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just shifting gears a little bit, Elisha, on the SG&A front given that the ASTRO meeting is about a month sooner than usual, and you have also got AAPM coming up next week, both of which in your fiscal fourth quarter. How should we be thinking about SG&A spend?", "Elisha W. Finney - Corporate Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, Junaid, I think you just come back to where we are year-to-date, which is down as a percentage of sales almost to full point and clearly those kinds of expenses are built into any guidance that we give you either for this year or next year. I would just say that's going to be in the noise level when you look at the total of Q4 being as large as it is for us.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, and a lot of the spending that we make for these thing starts sooner, way sooner than the meeting starts, three to six some times nine months out from the meetings.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil - Neponset Equity Research, Inc.", "Okay, fair enough, and then just following-up on Tycho's question, I forgot to... Toshiba for X-ray tubes, I guess, I am little surprised by the deal relative to the overall sales in the X-ray franchise. so you can access the deals worth about a $100 million per year over the three-year life of the contract, which would make Toshiba, I guess, one-third of total X-ray products sales, am I reading that correctly?", "Elisha W. Finney - Corporate Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Absolutely yes.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "They have that for a while, yeah.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil - Neponset Equity Research, Inc.", "Is that what has been historically, it's been about a third?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think, a third is probably about right, I'm trying to do the math in my head, but I think that's about right. They are very important customer for us and a very good, very important customer for us and what we like about them is that they have... they see the future and they...so they are very avant-garde in their thinking and they heavily emphasize quality in what they do and they work very closely with us to create good products. So we have a very collaborative relationship with them and we are just very pleased and I think they have a good management team.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil - Neponset Equity Research, Inc.", "Great. And I guess, Tim, last question for you. We got AAPM next week in Houston, anything that we should be on the lookout for. I know it's a tad early to see any RapidArc data points, but anything that your academic guys are doing that should be on our radar screen?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think this is probably going to be another all RapidArc all the time AAPM for us. People are going to be coming and talking about, looking at plans, asking questions. A lot of people still can't quite figure out how we did it. And so there will be a... try and do explain it without explaining too much those kind of conversations. And there will be a users meeting on Saturday and that meeting will probably be a lot on the subject to RapidArc as well, along with other technology that we are having. I wouldn't want to give you the impression that RapidArc is the only thing we are doing.  We are doing lots of other things that are also very important, but I suspect that AAPM will for us, we'll be spending well over half our time dealing with RapidArc-related questions.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil - Neponset Equity Research, Inc.", "Great. Thanks so much guys. That's all I've got.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dalton Chandler from Needham & Company.", "Dalton Chandler - Needham & Company", "Hi, good afternoon.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi Dalton.", "Dalton Chandler - Needham & Company", "I guess, we couldn't have a call with the question about proton?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Elisha that's for you.", "Elisha W. Finney - Corporate Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "[inaudible]", "Dalton Chandler - Needham & Company", "Well it's a last one on my list... so I think we are stuck with it... You announced the letter of intent on your first deal several weeks ago and I guess that deal hasn't closed yet. Is that... you think that's a typical timeframe in these kind of deals and then if you could comment on what you see in the pipeline how that might have changed since last quarter?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, it is a typical timeline. Proton agreements are some of the most exhaustively negotiated, time consuming agreements that occur in all of medicine. It's just a huge amount of money and everything needs to be nailed down and even though you have 95% of the details nailed down, that last 5% can be an enormous amount work. So I 'd say this is typical, I mean, we all understand the importance of getting these orders and doing it, but we also understand the importance of having the order be just right so... and by the way, so does NIU as an example. And we are talking to other people in addition to NIU and so we are confident that is going to happen, but we are not able to give you any accurate predictions as to the day and week in which you'll see an order come down.", "Dalton Chandler - Needham & Company", "When you say, you are talking to others in addition to NIU, you mean you are also had a letter of intent stage with others?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I would say...I am looking at our proton person here and I guess the answer to your question is, yes.", "Dalton Chandler - Needham & Company", "Okay, good. Glad you are not looking at the attorney.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "He is sitting right next to the attorney.", "Dalton Chandler - Needham & Company", "Okay, thanks a lot.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Julie Hoggatt from Noble Financial. Please proceed.", "Julie Hoggatt - Noble Financial Group", "Good quarter. Most of my questions have been answered, but I just want to know a bit... the 1000 OB installations that you said you expected by year-end. How many were in this third quarter?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Oh boy, I only know  the number that we ended with in the third quarter, which was 930...", "Elisha W. Finney - Corporate Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Versus was it 830 in the prior quarter.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So assuming that we haven't forgotten the number looks like it's about a 100.", "Julie Hoggatt - Noble Financial Group", "Okay. And then consolidating catches [ph] earlier, what percentage of the 70 RapidArc quarters this quarter was for upgrade?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "That's 70 years [ph] with new machines.", "Julie Hoggatt - Noble Financial Group", "Okay. And can you give us an idea what the upgrades were like this quarter.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, that's why I gave you the number 150, I said more than a 150 so you can sort of figure that if it was about 60 last quarter and about 70 this quarter and there is more than 150, the difference would be upgrades. But you have to remember all these numbers are about and when I say 150, I said more than a 150. So I am being a little evasive about upgrades. I will say once again that the number of upgrades was down from the first quarter, we had bullish of upgrade business, which is what I expected when you introduce a new product you can get this bullish of upgrade, because of high interest but then you go back to a more normal number. Going forward, I expect that upgrades for a while will be a fairly small piece of RapidArc quarters, just simply because people haven't had time to put together their budgets for RapidArc and so they are adding RapidArc into their budgets for new machines that's more straightforward for them to do, but the budget for upgrades will be a relatively small number probably for another year.", "Julie Hoggatt - Noble Financial Group", "Okay. That's all I've got. Thank so much.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Julie.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla", "from Citigroup. Please proceed.", "Amit Bhalla \u2013 Citigroup", "Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just start with a quick one on RapidArc. Did you already give the geographic mix of orders in the quarter, if you could repeat that'll be helpful?", "Elisha W. Finney - Corporate Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We did on for Q3 North America for Oncology is up 12%. International markets, up 13% in U.S. dollars.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup", "Well I was just taking about RapidArc...?", "Elisha W. Finney - Corporate Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No. sorry. No we did not. It's... suffice it to say that majority in the U.S. as is typical with any new roll out of a new technology.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "But we determine they were in all territories.", "Elisha W. Finney - Corporate Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "All territories.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "All territories contributed but most of the orders were in North America.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup", "Okay, just wanted to go back to a comment you made in your preview, you talked about long-term growth and 11% to 12% range. Can you break out some of the components that you are assuming for the Radiation Oncology market. What are your assumptions for units, pricing, maybe if you get some numbers around that or even ranges, that will be helpful?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, just to give you an idea, we are expecting moderate unit growth in the Oncology business. Most of the growth is going to be not necessarily in this order in services because software is becoming a bigger and bigger piece of what we do and so software service agreements are becoming important to what we do and just software business in general and the more software business.... software business is good gross margin business so it tends to add profit faster. And once again in international territories the number of units is still not... these are the drivers related to units there are not enough units internationally and so we expect international growth well in the long-term would be stronger than it will in North America and that's one of the reasons, of course, why we invested in a plant in Asia was to try to accommodate that. So I think the big growth drivers will be software and software service agreements and product like RapidArc if you think about it have a substantial software element and then there are a number of new products that we see coming in future years that we are not talking about today and can't talk about today, that we think will enlarge the Radiation Oncology marketplace.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup", "Okay. And just pricing, I just have one other follow-up after that?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Pricing, well. Pricing in North America remains good. Pricing internationally remains low and--", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup", "Sorry, Tim, I just meant pricing longer term what are the assumptions you have for pricing in the market?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Oh...pricing longer term. In aggregate, as the mix of pricing moves international that will tend to have a slight reduction effect in pricing internationally, I mean, in pricing. However, we plan to introduce new products and new capabilities in the future that we hope will increase the ASP for deals. ASP has gone up and we hope to continue to have it go up.", "I'm just saying it depends upon how you... what estimates and assumptions you make about the mix of international versus North America. And we hope to get even developing world, see the nice thing about our product line RapidArc is that if you think about the developing world, I think, I have told this story, I went to a hospital in China a few years ago and they were treating 120 patients a day on a machine and it was like a 16-hour day or maybe longer and that was not, and the result was because they had so many patients to treat because they didn't have enough machines, they had to really move patients through those machines, and it wasn't world class state-of-the-art radiation therapy.", "What\u2026and once again, I will say that the best Chinese institutions do practice world-class radiation therapy, but what RapidArc can do is it can enable even small facilities in the developing world to treat patients really fast and get a high volume of patients per hour, and if they can get along patients an hour through those machines and deliver world-class radiation therapy and then they can run eight or... ten to 12-hour days. They should be able to handle a lot of patients and do a really good job for them. So, I think that that holds the potential for the developing world to buy maybe not as an expense of a machine is the trilogy of the neurology experts still buy a fairly high-end machine because the cost for patients becomes so low.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup", "And, Tim, I just had a quick follow-up. In the press release, you did talk about faster-than-expected Oncology product acceptances. Does it mean there was the bigger than normal drawdown out of backlog, and if so can you give us, could you quantify that?", "Elisha W. Finney - Corporate Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No. I mean backlog is up 13% quarter-over-quarter and was up sequentially as well. So positive book-to-bill. I think this is just a reflection of getting back to a more normal cycle of getting products installed and accepted. As you recall last year, we had a tough couple of quarters [inaudible] backlog longer. This is just returning to our more normal pattern and getting the installations done quicker.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "But, yeah I do...we do want to credit to the installation people. The installation people were heroic, and they have really cut down the cycle times for certain processes in a way that, I think surprised the management team a little bit as to how good they were, and so we are very pleased and we are very thankful, but it did create a little surprise for us there.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup", "And thank you.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Philip Legendy of Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Philip Legendy - Thomas Weisel Partners LLC", "Hi, good afternoon.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good afternoon.", "Philip Legendy - Thomas Weisel Partners LLC", "I was wondering if you would comment on the prices you are able to get for RapidArc. I know you would at some point said you were listing at a 300, is it just, I'm wondering how that's playing out.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. This list price for RapidArc is 400,000, but what you have to remember is if people buy two, the price for the second one less than the price for the first one, and so that matters in the calculation. We are not giving out the actual achieved price, but I will tell they were right on what we expected.", "Philip Legendy - Thomas Weisel Partners LLC", "Okay. And is that... are you getting the same pricing for... upgrade orders as you are getting for systems that are sold as a complete package, I mean for the RapidArc component?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. Mathematically you should treat those as the same.", "Philip Legendy - Thomas Weisel Partners LLC", "Okay. And then just to be sorry to come back to this, but the 150 systems, just want to make it sure I understand that is that, that includes all upgrades and all new systems to-date.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "And when I say more than 150 that includes all upgrades and all that are sold with machines.", "Philip Legendy - Thomas Weisel Partners LLC", "Got it. And then last question, I wonder if you would comment just on your read of the health of the market generally in the United States and internationally and what do you think the market is growing at this point?", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We think the market is growing north of 10%, so we think we probably gained a little share year-to-date. So, that gives us some reason for optimism. We think the market is growing well in Asia, in general, in Asia. Not, China itself is having a slow year; although, we have done well in China. China itself is having a slow year and that... that's just affected the way licenses are granted in China. The U.S. is, I think above where we have been saying it was in the north of 10% range.", "Philip Legendy - Thomas Weisel Partners LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Timothy E. Guertin - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "At this time, I am showing we have no further questions, I would like to now turn the call back over to Mr. Spencer Sias for closing remarks.", "Spencer Sias - Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations", "Thank you for participating.

Varian Medical Systems grew in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 with gains in our backlog, net orders, revenues, margins and net earnings. Compared to the year ago period, the backlog rose 14% to $1.9 billion.", "Net orders rose 13% to $551 million and revenues increased 13% to $509 million. Both gross and operating margins improved and net earnings per diluted share rose 22% to $0.56 versus $0.46 in the year ago quarter. All of our major business units contributed to this growth.", "Oncology Systems first quarter net orders rose 11% to $428 million, with 6% growth in North America and 16% growth in international markets. US dollars, the international growth was due exclusively to the Far East, which more than doubled orders versus the year ago quarter.", "Net orders were down slightly in Europe and US dollars but up in the mid-single digit range in local currencies. The growth in the Far East was led by Japan's fiscal year in spending, China, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam also contributed to this growth.", "RapidArc was a star for the oncology business this quarter. As of the end of the quarter, we had more than 425 RapidArc orders as hospitals and clinics continued to access credit and spend on revenue generating capital equipment that enhances the quality, availability, and affordability of cancer care.", "We stepped up RapidArc installations during the quarter and now have customer acceptances on more than 70 systems around the world. After a full year of reporting orders on this new product offering, we will from now on follow our usual practice and report only on installations.", "It is clear that our newest products and game changing technology helped to drive the growth in our oncology business in the midst of an otherwise very tough macroeconomic environment. We continue to promote these products and their capabilities during the quarter, and hospitals and clinics followed suit.", "Since its introduction, RapidArc has been featured in nearly 100 local, regional and national stories around the world. So this is helping to build patient awareness and demand for this treatment capability.", "We added a few sales positions during the quarter to enhance our coverage and support growth in the oncology market. Additionally, we increased our R&D as a percentage of revenues during the quarter.", "In short we are striving to generate continued growth in this business by investing more in sales, marketing, and product development. We believe these challenging economic times have created an opportunity for us as to further strengthen our market leadership.", "Our X-ray products business turned in great results compared to the year ago quarter with net orders growing 21% to $91 million, and revenues rising 23% to $86 million. Orders of flat panel products for filmless X-ray imaging continued to grow solidly. X-ray tube orders were surprisingly strong during the quarter, but we expect tube orders to return to slower more normal single-digit growth rates for the year.", "The growth came from existing customers who added to order volumes for tubes and panels, as well as several new customers who are converting their equipment to filmless imaging capability using our panels. Our new products for radiographic imaging also contributed to the order growth for our flat panel products.", "Our other business category, including our SIP, security and inspection products business, our ACCEL proton therapy business and our Ginzton Technology Center generated combined net orders of $33 million for the quarter, up 15% from the year ago period.", "Net orders for our security and inspection products rose 15%, driven by volume deployment of inspection systems at ports and borders around the world. The order included a bulk order of units that will be installed in the Middle East.", "Higher volume and product mix contributed to the order growth and our newest dual energy scanning products for materials discrimination began to gain traction during the quarter.", "So now I will turn it back to Elisha for a review of the numbers and then I'll back to you with our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2009.", "Elisha Finney", "Thanks Tim and hello everyone. As usual I will walk you through the income statement attached to the press release as well as cover a few balance sheet items. As Tim pointed out the company's first quarter revenues increased 13% to $509 million. Oncology Systems posted an increase of 11%, X-ray products posted a gain of 23%, and the other category gained 17%.", "Gross margin for the quarter was 43%, up more than half a point. Oncology Systems gross margin was 44%, up nearly a point primarily due to a significant shift to US sales and a favorable product mix that included RapidArc.", "X-ray products gross margin was also up nearly a point to just over 40%, primarily because of higher shipment volumes, a favorable X-ray tube product mix, and lower cost of quality.", "First quarter SG&A expenses were 16% of revenues, an improvement of about a quarter of a point due principally to higher revenues. First quarter R&D expenses were 7% of revenues, up by about a point as we stepped up our R&D investments.", "Moving down the income statement, first quarter operating earnings increased 13% to $99 million or 19% of revenues.", "Oncology systems and X-ray products together contributed a $119 million in operating earnings with our other businesses and corporate consuming a net $20 million.", "Depreciation and amortization of intangibles totaled $9 million in the quarter. Net interest income totaled $1.4 million for the quarter, down from the year ago period due to a drop in interest rates as well as higher borrowing in the US.", "Our effective tax rate was 30.5%, down significantly from the year ago quarter, because of favorable discreet items. These items included the retroactive reinstatement of the US R&D tax credit and expiration of statute of limitations on some previously filed tax returns. For the year, we continued to estimate that our tax rate will be between 31% and 32% with a rate of about 35% in the second quarter.", "Average fully diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 125 million, down 2.6 million shares due largely to our share repurchase program. We reported fully diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.56 for the first quarter.", "Now turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $423 million of cash and cash equivalents, $65million of total debt, and $1 billion of stockholders equity. DSO for the quarter was 83 days, an improvement of four days from the year ago period.", "We achieved first quarter cash flow from operations of $85 million. Other sources of cash in the quarter included $25 million in short-term borrowings and $4 million from stock option proceeds.", "Primary uses of cash were $72 million for the stock repurchase program and about $18 million for capital expenditures. During the quarter we repurchased about 1.5 million shares of stock under our share repurchase authorization.", "Now I will turn it back to Tim for the outlook.", "Tim Guertin", "Thanks, Elisha. Well, despite continuing turbulent financial times we believe that fiscal year 2009 revenues could grow by about 10% to 13% and net earnings per diluted share from continued operations for the fiscal year could grow to between $2.59 and $2.64.", "For the second quarter of fiscal year 2009, revenues could grow in the range of 9% to 10% with a slightly faster growth rate in operating earnings.", "Including a higher expected tax rate, net earnings per diluted share from continuing operations in the second quarter should be in the range net $0.59 to $0.62.", "We remain focused on execution and we are committed to continuing investments in growth through stronger sales and marketing programs as well as productive research and development efforts.", "And so I guess we will take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And your first question will come from the line of Dalton Chandler with Needham & Company. Please proceed.", "Dalton Chandler - Needham & Company", "Hi, good afternoon.", "Tim Guertin", "Hi, Dalton.", "Dalton Chandler - Needham & Company", "Elisha I am sorry. If you gave the revenue growth in constant currency, I missed that. Could you tell us what that was?", "Elisha Finney", "Yes, revenue growth for the total company for the quarter was 13% in US dollars, 15% in constant currency.", "Dalton Chandler - Needham & Company", "Okay. On the growth rate in new orders for Oncology Systems, you have from time to time talked about the various components of that, like the software component or radiotherapy component. Could you walk through what you saw in the different components for the quarter?", "Tim Guertin", "I can give you a little color on that. RapidArc and the service businesses I think we're the leaders for us in the first quarter. I think that and they added to -- the RapidArc of course is adding to the average price that we are seeing on deals as a new accessory. New Linac orders were roughly flat with the year ago period.", "Dalton Chandler - Needham & Company", "Okay. That's helpful. You did mention you are adding sales reps. Could you talk about where you are adding those geographically?", "Tim Guertin", "It's all over the place. We were adding some in the United States. We were adding some in Europe. So it's in for a variety of indications. Some of is just because as we sell more products to the average customers as they buy more things. We need to have specialists who can talk to them about those particular products. So more people that talk about treatment planning, more people talk about RapidArc, these kinds of things. So I think all together it's about 13 additional sales people.", "Dalton Chandler - Needham & Company", "Okay. And what does that bring your total sales headcount to now?", "Tim Guertin", "I don't know. I just went to a meeting where there was a ballroom full of them. So, I'm not sure.", "Dalton Chandler - Needham & Company", "Okay. And then you know just last...", "Tim Guertin", "We are north of a 100, but I don\u2019t know what the exact number is.", "Dalton Chandler - Needham & Company", "Okay. And just you know lastly, last quarter you talked about how financing was definitely still available albeit at usually higher interest rates. Have you seen any change in those trends either in rates or in the amount of time it takes to get a loan underwritten?", "Tim Guertin", "No, basically the information that we gave you recently still holds true. We are still seeing people to be able to get loans. We are still able to get leases. The rates are about what they were, so nothing has changed recently on that picture. It's kind of reassuring actually.", "Dalton Chandler - Needham & Company", "Okay. All right, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please proceed.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Hey. Thanks for taking the call.", "Tim Guertin", "Hi, Tycho.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Maybe just a question on the international. Tim you talked a little about the opportunity in the Far East and some the strengths you are seeing there. Can you give us an idea I guess of how you are looking at both Europe and Asia over the coming year? And then maybe also just comment on your own China manufacturing?", "Tim Guertin", "Japan was very strong for us this quarter and I think it was probably the leader around the world in terms of growth rates. So very important and I think Japan is going to be important from here on out.", "China, we continue to see, it just looks good for us. It just looks like China is going to work out well. We are continuing to talk to people in China in the leadership who in government positions who are anxious to see radiation therapy grow in China and we are getting to see people there we didn't used to get to see in the past and that's very reassuring. It means that, I don't think they have been meeting with us, if they didn't believe we were important for their future. So I think for China that's a real opportunity.", "For Europe, I expect it will be flat to up slightly for the year and the Middle East I think will be good.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay. On RapidArc, can you just give a little bit more color about the order trends you are seeing in terms of, are you seeing repeat orders from some of the early adopters? How do we think about install times at this point as well?", "Tim Guertin", "I think we probably are seeing some repeat orders from early adopters; I wouldn't know how to give you a percentage of the total deals. What we are seeing is that the early adopters are telling other people how well it works, and that\u2019s what's good news.", "So we had at the Morgan conference a few weeks ago we -- and you were there as I recall. We brought in Shawn Zimberg, and he talked about 100 RapidArc patients a day and he talks to people. So people notice this, they listen to this, they realize that they can execute RapidArc, and we get nice letters about it.", "So all of these things are the kind of things you want to have happen. And one of the reasons I want to talk about clinical installations now on rather than orders is because I want to reemphasize to everybody that that's where the rubber hits the road. You want to see people install it and you want to see them routinely treat patients because that's what causes it to propagate and what causes orders to grow.", "So, I can't really tell you how much is repeat, but I can tell you a lot of it is because people are talking to each other.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay. That's helpful. Then just two quick ones for Elisha. On the buyback, can you just remind us what you have left? And then also the incremental R&D spend you mentioned, just give us a sense as to what that\u2019s going toward if it's a particular area.", "Elisha Finney", "Well, in terms of the R&D dollars, we\u2019ve historically run about 6% of sales and it was 7% of sales, to put it into context. And in terms of the stock repurchase program, I don't have the exact number; it's several million shares Tycho that are still outstanding under the current authorization.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay. Great. Thank you very much.", "Elisha Finney", "I think it's around 8 million.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line Amit Hazan with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.", "Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer", "Thanks. Hi, good afternoon.", "Tim Guertin", "Amit, how are you?", "Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer", "Very good. Just a few questions from me. Just asking kind of from the economic side maybe now that you had a little bit more time, I'm wondering your guidance looks very robust which exudes confidence. So, that's a good thing. I'm wondering if you have gone back and talked to some of your customers in your backlog and gotten confidence that those orders are indeed going to come through into delivery over the coming few quarters. Is that a fair comment, or can you comment on that?", "Tim Guertin", "Yes. I have failed to become depressed in the last 30 days. We have talked to a number of customers who have come in. I asked them how it looks for their institution. And our sales people are just talking to of course a lot more people than I am talking to individually.", "So far what people are telling us is very reassuring. They are continuing with their plans. We have very good visibility of course for the next 120 days. And everything looks pretty much the way we expected it to look for the next 120 days. I won't say that nobody pushed out anything because that probably wouldn't be true. Some push outs are always normal for us. What I am telling you is we are not seeing anything out of the ordinary for us.", "And nobody has told us that they are changing any of their dates because of macroeconomic conditions. Its other typical kinds of circumstances like construction delays and that sort of stuff. So that's all good news. And of course, for the orders profile, we talked to lots of people. What we are seeing is that we are seeing scrutiny by some institutions on their capital budgets, but radiation therapy is typically remaining in.", "In other words, they are cutting back on their capital spending but radiation therapy appears to be one of the items that they want to keep in because it's a revenue generator for them. So I think they want to make solid decisions. They want to make prudent decisions, they want to be careful of their cash and they want to spend it properly, but they haven't cut their capital budgets to zero. They are just eliminating the things that don't add revenue for them or aren't good investments in the short-term and we remain a good investment for the short term.", "So nothing, nobody has told me anything that says I want to really love your machine but we are not spending money on anything. Thus I'm not getting that message.", "Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer", "Okay. That's very helpful. And then Elisha on the gross margin line, the RapidArc, I think it's really the first time that I\u2019ve heard you talk about RapidArc as a contributor to margins maybe even to some extent material enough contributor that you would mention it. I'm wondering if you can help us out a little bit in terms of how much it helped in the quarter and also how to think about margins for the remainder of the fiscal year now that RapidArc installations are more than likely to be increasing every quarter.", "Elisha Finney", "Right. To put it into context, RapidArc still represented less than 5% of the total oncology sales in the quarter, so it is still very small. With that said, it's a pure software product, so it carries our historical margins in the 80% to 90% range. So it is, in any given quarter it can have an impact, by a much, much bigger degree in the first quarter, was that we had a significant shift to US delivery. It was 60% US sales, 40% international. That was a 14 point swing versus a year ago period, so that was a much-much bigger contributor to the margins.", "So for the year, we will see some gross margin improvement and I think that for oncology that will be driven by RapidArc.", "Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer", "Okay. That's very helpful. And then just on currency, if you can give us the -- in terms of the orders or the international orders, what were they in constant currency and then also, what is the exchange rate that you are now implying in your new guidance?", "Elisha Finney", "Well, it moved all over the board just today as a matter of fact. But you can assume that at any point when we go out and give guidance and meet that we are looking at rates at that point and building a range around that. So I absolutely agree with Tim that the backlog is holding from what we see. The currency is a more difficult thing for us to estimate, because we\u2019ve just seen extreme volatility, and that's why we\u2019ve got a pretty wide range on the top line growth for the year, really if you take into account the currency volatility.", "In terms of orders for the quarter, Q1 oncology orders were 11% in dollars and also 11% in constant currency. And that's because the weak, the yen is very strong and so that helped even as the euro weakened. And then total company orders were up 13% in dollars, and again 13% in constant currency as well.", "Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer", "Okay, good. I will jump back in queue. Thanks Elisha.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Amit Bhalla with Citi. Please proceed.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup", "Good afternoon. Question for you Elisha on the guidance. You beat the quarter by $0.04; you raised the year by a penny. Is there a level of caution that you are taking in the numbers? Maybe you could walk us through what your assumptions are. And the reason I ask is, Tim, you mentioned linacs themselves were flat year-over-year. So is the assumption underlying here is a full year linacs are flat as well?", "Elisha Finney", "Again, Amit, you know from where we sit today backlog and the customer delivery dates are holding. I think we are obviously cautious around FX rates and what impact that\u2019s going to have on the year and again building a little wider range in there to account for that. As Tim mentioned, we are increasing R&D and significantly interest rates have effectively gone to zero which historically we had been earning around $1.5 million a quarter in interest. So we also are adjusting for that as well.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup", "The question I had on the linacs. What's the underlying assumption for linacs, if they were flat this quarter what's the assumption for the rest of the year?", "Tim Guertin", "Well, that was an order thing. Our forecast for the year, I don't break it out by individual products. I will sort of give you that retrospectively, but we're still expecting decent orders growth for the year in for the overall oncology business and it would be hard for me to sit here and break that down into the individual components right now.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup", "Okay. Then a question on just the pricing environment. How much pricing power do you have either maybe you could walk through that overseas as well as in the US?", "Tim Guertin", "Probably have less pricing power than I would like. Our competitors are continuing to drop their prices and which is probably something they feel that they need to do. And so that's a downward pull. And when customers don't have all the money they would like to have, sometimes they order smaller configurations than they would otherwise order. And that means some of our most valuable accessories aren't part of the orders. So, those things would tug us down.", "Obviously in the Far East where currencies are doing well that doesn't affect us as much. And in the US we are not seeing that effect so much. We are seeing people they\u2019ll buy up. I think both stereotactic accessories and RapidArc accessories are pulling us up in terms of pricing and so those two effects are probably working against each other. But this is one of the places if you are going to have a tough economic time, this is one of the places where you would expect it to hit. People maybe little more cautious in terms of what they may still order but they may order less and so we will have to watch that.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup", "And is there any other, any comment you could make on how January has progressed thus far. I think I mean given your guidance I think I know the answer but I'm just curious if you could add any color on how January has done?", "Tim Guertin", "I can\u2019t see it, but Elisha has got a large weapon aimed at me if I answer that question, so I probably will not be able to answer that for you. Sorry.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "And you have a follow-up question coming from the line of Tyco Peterson with JPMorgan. Please proceed.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Hey, thanks. I just wanted to probe on the Linac question a little bit further because I think you said in the past about maybe half your RapidArc orders were tied to new linacs. Can you just give us a sense as to whether that's changed and maybe a little bit more clarity on what you are expecting from linacs and now you don't really want to break it out, but are you assuming that linacs orders will grow this year?", "Tim Guertin", "I don't have the exact ratio of upgrade to orders of RapidArc with new linacs yet I don't have that data at this point. However in the past it has been the vast majority of them with new linacs. So I would expect that overtime the percentage of people who order RapidArc with linacs will rise. But I\u2019d like to get-- I want in the future, I want to get away from talking about RapidArc orders and just talk about RapidArc installs because I think that is the most important thing to focus on. The fact that linacs were flat this quarter is a point on the graph. It's not the graph. ", "Elisha Finney", "And I would just remind you guys that we saw 17% orders growth in the year ago quarter, where most of our orders came in the first half. So tough comp again.", "Tim Guertin", "It was a tough comp. And linacs were up last year. So it is a tough comp and I'm telling you that it happened, so you know, but I wouldn't draw any conclusions from it.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay. Thanks for your clarification.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Jeff Rhode with Segall Bryant. Please proceed.", "Jeff Rhode - Segall Bryant ", "Hi. Thanks for such a good solid quarter. Tim, could you remind us how your customers -- in the past you\u2019ve provided a little bit of breakdown on who uses external financing and things like that.", "Tim Guertin", "There is a small percentage of customers, would you say, Elisha, that use leasing?", "Elisha Finney", "Well, yes. Through our leasing program we were going out and facilitating, it is probably somewhere around 15 deals a quarter. But we don't necessarily know if a customer is getting their own financing because in those cases they are just paying us cash.", "Tim Guertin", "They don't tell us. So we just see the cash. But I'm sure a significant number of them do go out and get financing, especially entrepreneurial sites.", "Jeff Rhode - Segall Bryant ", "And, you want to share that linac graph with us?", "Tim Guertin", "I'm sorry.", "Jeff Rhode - Segall Bryant ", "Thought we could ask.", "Tim Guertin", "Okay. No, this isn't -- I don't think this is something we ordinarily track. All we are indicating to you is, we have seen more customers come to us who said, rather than financing this through their normal hospital mechanism, we want to talk to the leasing companies that you have available Varian. And I think that has gone up considerably in recent times. Although, it's still far from the majority of our business in North America.", "So, that number has gone up and we been able to get all the people the help that they needed, which is very reassuring. What we are seeing is probably a shift in the way some hospitals are getting their money. And I have had people come in who are interested in using -- I think I've talked about these people before intermediaries, who get financing from other sources and who step in and help customers get through this.", "So, these are places where hospitals maybe don't want to spend their own capital budget and would like to see the capital come from some other place and these people step in and help to solve their problem. So we've seen more of that. I wouldn't say that we have seen an astounding amount of that, but we've seen a little bit of it and we expect that number will grow more and more in the future. I have started talking about it qualitatively rather than quantitatively.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Amit Bhalla with Citi", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup", "Thanks for the follow-up. Elisha, I'm not sure if you have answer this, but in terms of gross margin trend for next quarter and the rest of the year, can you just go over that one more time?", "Elisha Finney", "Well, as we said for next quarter that the operating earnings would grow slightly faster than the top line growth. So, you can assume that some of that will come from gross margin, some from leveraging SG&A, offset by most likely an increase in R&D as we talked about.", "Again, for the year the operating earnings growing faster than the top line and a piece of that coming from gross margin. So, we do expect some improvement in margin for the year. Again, currencies are going to drive this. To be honest, we manage the business at the operating earnings level, because people can compute gross margin slightly differently with where you put continuing engineering as an example. So, we are managing all of the business units on their operating margin percentage.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup", "Yeah. Thanks.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Spencer Sias.", "Spencer Sias", "Thank you for participating.

And now here's Tim Guertin.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Good afternoon.  Today we are reporting third quarter results with solid quarter-over-quarter growth and backlog earnings and margins, but weaker than expected revenues and net orders, particularly in our x-ray products and security and inspection businesses.  ", "All of our businesses are feeling the effects of the recession, particularly in the US where proposed healthcare reforms and cuts in reimbursement rates are adding insult to injury.  Nevertheless, the quarter was marked by many positive developments that give us confidence that we'll weather the storm and immerge stronger than ever.  That, in a nutshell, is what we'll talk about in the call.", "Compared to the year ago period, our net orders declined by 4% or down 1% on a constant-currency basis.  Revenues are flat or up 3% on a constant-currency basis, and our backlog grew 11% to $1.9 billion with normal cancellation rates.", "We improved our gross margin by more than half a point and increased our operating margin by two points, and our fully diluted EPS from continuing operations grew by a solid 11% to $0.68.", "Elisha will detail the P&L and balance sheet in a few moments, I'll focus now on market and operational highlights.  Oncology Systems third quarter net orders were flat at $459 million with a 9% decline in North America and an 8% gain in international markets.  On a constant-currency basis, total Oncology Systems net orders rose 3% with 16% growth in international markets.", "The North American radiation oncology market is being hit by three strong headwinds.  First we have an ongoing research that has shrunk capital equipment budgets, slowed decision making, and made financing for big-ticket purchases more expensive and more time consuming.  Second, our customers in freestanding radiotherapy centers are facing proposed reimbursed cuts that are steeper than expected.  And third, proposed healthcare reform is adding to uncertainty among many customers who are taking a wait-and-see approach.  We saw similar behavior in the last time major reforms were proposed in the early days in the Clinton administration.  ", "These current headwinds represent a big challenge to our growth initiatives in North America.  We expect uncertainty in North America radiation therapy capital spending to persist until there is greater clarity on healthcare reform and reimbursement rates.  ", "We are joining the rest of the radiation and oncology community and actively opposing the cuts for freestanding clinics because we all believe it will reduce patient access to cancer care, particularly in rural areas where these clinics fill a lifesaving need.", "According to a survey conducted by ASTRO, the industry group for radiation oncology, some of these groups could be forced to close if the proposed cuts are adopted.  In addition to letters by clinicians and cancer survivors, Varian employees and friends have sent more than 6,200 letters to their congressional representatives in Washington, voicing these concerns.", "We are actively engaged in the debate over healthcare reform.  We realize and agree that reform is needed, and we believe that reducing government spending at the expense of a treatment that is lifesaving for hundreds of thousands of people around the world is wrong.", "As a first step towards change we've been advocating and focusing on more cost-efficient and effective cancer-treatment modalities so that we can ensure that all Americans have access to care for this disease.  That is why we believe that multipurpose high-speed treatment machines are so advantageous for patients and healthcare providers.  With the versatility and speed of our newest clinical products we're making it possible for hospitals and clinics to offer patients the broadest range of cancer treatment options on an outpatient basis in the most cost-efficient manner.", "Our products and people are making a big difference for many cancer patients and their families.  You can see it in the \"Dear Cancer\" letters that patients, family members, and friends, are writing and posting on our website.  For these people we are committed to being a part of the healthcare solution, not just in the US, but around the world.", "Fortunately we are a global company with 50% of oncology orders year to date coming from international markets.  We had excellent orders growth in Asia during the quarter led by China.  European net orders were also exceptionally strong in constant currency.  We received an order for four clinics with RapidArc in St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London.  We're going to be equipping three new cancer centers in Iraq, and filling the tenth order from India for our Novalis Tx unit.", "All in all, oncology's international market is holding up quite well, even with the relatively strong US dollar and increased pricing competition.  We believe we continue to offer the best value proposition for cancer treatment centers around the world.", "RapidArc continues to offer clinicians unprecedented value, and as of the end of the quarter we had more than 180 RapidArc installations.  We set an all-time record for Novalis Tx orders in a single quarter.  The oncology service business also grew solidly in the quarter and year to date approached 30% of total oncology orders which provides us with a nice recurring revenue stream to supplement our software and hardware businesses.", "I want to note here that we acquired the assets of IKOE Medical during the third quarter, to enhance the speed and ease of planning radiotherapy and radiosurgery with our Eclipse treatment planning software.  I expect this new technology to contribute to more advances in cancer care as we incorporate it into our treatment planning platform.", "Before we leave oncology, let me just say that I'm very pleased about the significant margin gains in this business.  Product mix and successful cost-control initiatives helped drive oncology's gross margin up almost three percentage points and its operating earnings up by 24%.  ", "Let me turn now to X-Ray Products.  Third quarter net orders of this business declined by 3% from the year ago quarter.  This was much smaller than the 17% decline that we saw in the second quarter of this year when imaging equipment manufacturers began to lower x-ray tube and flat-panel inventories in response to the recession.", "The relatively modest decline in third-quarter orders suggests that customer-inventory adjustments are abating and that this business could be nearing a return to more normal growth patterns.  ", "While the market for new x-ray imaging equipment appears to be weak, the market for replacement tubes and existing equipment should be stable in this environment.  In fact, orders for x-ray tubes were up in the quarter while the flat-panel business continued to experience the impact of inventory adjustments, particularly in the product lines for dental and veterinary imaging equipment that have been hit hard by the recession.", "Looking beyond X-Ray Products third quarter results we had several wins that position this business for future growth.  We signed several new supply agreements with major equipment manufacturers in North America, Europe, and Asia, that should result in future orders for our film as radiographic imaging panels.  Like oncology, I'm pleased that the X-Ray Products team managed well in a tough climate and with strict attention to cost controls, managed to turn in a 22% return on sales for the quarter.", "Our other business category including our Security and Inspection Products business, our Varian Particle Therapy business, and our Ginzton Technology Center generated combined net orders of $8 million for the quarter, down by 69% or $18 million, almost exclusively from SIP.  The decline in SIP business is largely stemmed from government postponements of several large RFPs until later in calendar year 2009.  In addition, cargo screening systems integrators who incorporate our products continue to act cautiously as governments around the world wrestle with spending priorities.", "I'll finish my comments with the Varian proton therapy business.  We are continuing negotiations and are making good progress with several customers both inside and outside the US who are intent on building centers.  In fact, we're hopeful of getting our first order for proton therapy system very soon.  ", "Now I'll turn it over to Elisha and then come back to you with our outlook for the full fiscal year 2009.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Thanks, Tim, and hello, everyone.  As usual, I will walk you through the income statement attached to the press release, as well as cover a few balance sheet items.  ", "The company's third quarter revenues were flat at $510 million in US dollars and up 3% in constant currency.  Revenues were weaker than expected, especially in X-Ray Products and SIP.  Although Oncology Systems posted an increase of 5%, X-Ray Products posted a 13% decline and the other category declined 36%.  ", "X-Ray Products suffered from steeper than expected inventory adjustments among several customers while SIP was impacted by customer-requested delays and delivery.", "Gross margin for the quarter was 42%, up half a point.  Oncology System gross margin was 45%, up three points due to product mix and cost-control initiative.  X-Ray Products gross margin fell by three points to 37%, due largely to volume.  The gross margin fell in our other category as we booked a $7 million cost based on our revised estimates to complete a proton commissioning project in Europe.", "Third quarter SG&A expenses were 15% of revenues, a one point improvement from the year-ago quarter, and third quarter R&D expenses were 7% of revenues, about even with the year-ago quarter as we continue to invest in new product development.", "Moving down the income statement, third-quarter operating earnings increased 11% to $102 million or 20% of revenues.  Oncology Systems and X-Ray Products together contributed $132 million in operation earnings while our other businesses in corporate consumed a net $30 million.  Depreciation and amortization of intangibles totalled $12 million in the quarter.  Net interest expense for the quarter was $300,000, down from $1.3 million in net-interest income in the year-ago period as interest rates on our invested cash remain at near zero.", "Our effective tax rate was 16.5%, down by one point from the year-ago quarter.  For the year we estimate that our tax rate will be near 30% with a rate of approximately 34% in the fourth quarter.  Average fully diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were $125 million, down by about 2 million shares from the year-ago period, due primarily to stock repurchases earlier in the fiscal year and a lower stock price.", "In the interest of conserving cash, until we build cash reserves in the US we again chose not to repurchase shares of stock during the quarter.  We reported fully diluted EPS of $0.68 for the quarter, including $0.06 for the share-based compensation expense.  ", "Now turning to the balance sheet in cash flow, we ended the quarter with $472 million of cash and cash equivalents, $32 million of total debt, and $1.2 billion of stockholders' equity.  DSO was 83 days, up five days from the year-ago period, but an improvement of four days from the second quarter of this fiscal year.  We achieved $129 million in cash flows from operations in the quarter primarily from net earnings and strong collections of accounts receivable.  Primary uses of cash were $19 million for capital expenditures and $10 million to pay down short-term debt.", "Now I'll turn it back over to Tim for the outlook.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Thanks, Elisha.  For the fiscal year we expected net earnings per diluted share from continuing operations could grow to between $2.60 and $2.65, and that revenue from continuing operations could grow by about 4-5%.  ", "In keeping with our practice in past on certain markets, we are choosing not to give preliminary guidance on the next fiscal year at this point.  We'll talk more about 2010 when we report our results for the fourth quarter.  And we will now take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator's Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Amit Hazan.", "Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer", "", "Hi.  Good afternoon, guys.  I wanted to maybe first focus on some of the new proposed reimbursement rules and just with the comments you made, first ask you if you think that in this specific quarter you already saw any delays in orders that were directly tied to those reimbursement cuts at the freestanding clinic.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Yeah.  Well the changes of course came out on July 1st which was very close to the end of our quarter.  It's possible.  Unfortunately it is the nature of our business that we do get a fair number of orders in the last week and so it is possible that we were impacted by it in North America in the last few days of the quarter, but it would be very difficult for me to calibrate for you to what extent we were impacted.  ", "Some people were expecting reimbursement issues, so there was probably some of that already built into market behavior, but probably not as much as what we saw when the actual numbers came out on July 1st.", "Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer", "Okay.  And just trying to get a sense from where you stand on some of those cuts to the freestanding clinics.  If we look at the big reduction in the IMRT code in the physician fee schedule, do you think at all it was a result of utilization differences between the freestanding clinic and the hospital?  So in other words, if we were to assume that something like 25% of all radiation patients get IMRT, is that the same between freestanding and hospital or were there freestanding clinics treating with a higher utilization rate of IMRT that may have brought on these changes?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Well unfortunately of course CMS has not shared with us how they did the math so I have not seen their calculations.  We do know that they made an assumption of a very high utilization rate and I think that was the principle factor that changed the number.  They used a number that was around 90% and of course freestanding clinics are clinics that are usually in rural areas or distant from population centers, and therefore 90% is a totally unrealistic estimate of utilization.  Furthermore, for example if you're running a clinic and you have one machine and it's at 90 or 95% utilization, your waiting times will become very long and so you'll probably want to buy another machine.  And when you buy that other machine your utilization instantly drops to 45%.  So clearly on its face this is not good.", "Also ASTRO has done some preliminary looks at utilization rates for freestanding clinics and they're around 50%.  So CMS used a number that was recommended for diagnostic radiology, not for radiation therapy.  They used a number that was not realistic for freestanding clinics.  They did it without any data, and the data that we do have says they should not have done it.  So we're hoping that when CMS sees the data from ASTRO and that sort of thing \u2014 and they are required by law to use actual data and not indented data so I suspect that when they get around to actually doing the mathematics for the final releases, we'll see something much less Draconian than what we saw in the initial release.", "Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer", "Okay.  And just one more question for me I guess on fiscal year 10.  I recognize you're not giving guidance now, but if we look at the order pattern for you, it's been let's say roughly flat over the last six months and there's usually a very good correlation between the order growth and then the ensuring revenue growth in the following year.  And I think first call is right now at about 7% growth for fiscal year 10 and I'm wondering just generally, if I'm correct in assuming there will be that correlation and considering your environment if kind of in terms of orders we should expect things to be exactly kind of like they've been here in the last quarter or two.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "I can see the worm dangling in front of my face, but I must decline to take it.  The fact is we just need to know reimbursements, we need to know recession behavior \u2014 there's just a lot of things we need to know before I'm willing to put a fourth quarter and before I'm willing to put a 2010 number in front of you.  ", "If I thought there was any way for me to give you an estimate at this time and be trustworthy on it, I would have done it, but I just am too uncomfortable to make that estimate now.", "Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer", "Okay.  Alright, thanks.  I'll get back in queue.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla of Citi.  Please proceed.", "Amit Bhalla - Citi", "Hi, good afternoon.  I wanted to just continue and ask you a couple more oncology related questions.  Maybe you could give us a little bit more detail \u2014 in North American, clearly linear accelerator units probably decline, service was still strong, but a little bit more color on how software and brachytherapy therapy performed, and then in addition last quarter you talked a lot about book and ship orders.  Clearly it looks like they're probably not coming through, but what's your view there on how you're going to assume book and ship makes up your business going forward?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Okay.  Let me try to handle that question as best I can.  There's a lot of things you have to remember.  First, the freestanding segment for us probably represents about 10% of Oncology Systems orders.  If you remove service, service is about 30% of the business.  If you take the remaining 70% of the business it's about half international and half North America.  A minority of that business is freestanding clinics so let's say it's about 10%.  ", "So if the reimbursement picture does not improve or does not improve enough that 10% of the business is the portion of the business that will be affected.  The rest of the business, the software businesses, the hardware businesses, the service businesses \u2014 I think they will do reasonably well in this environment.  In this particularly quarter, brachytherapy did quite well.  They were strong points for us and the service business did extremely well which is what you would expect.  So the biggest issue for us for oncology in this particular quarter has to do with capital equipment, and I mean this is something that all of you folks have been projecting would happen for about a year and we're finally seeing that effect reflected in people's capital budgets.", "So what we have to do during this period of time is use our brachy-business, a much less expensive item.  Use our service business, our software businesses, our proton opportunities, our international opportunities, our security and business and our x-ray flat-panel businesses to try to compensate for what might happen to us in this 10% piece of our market.", "Amit Bhalla - Citi", "Okay.  And just my followup would be can you comment on cancelations within the oncology business and quantify the constant-currency order growth rates for the international markets.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "I'll speak to the cancellation piece and then I'll let Elisha speak to the currencies.  The cancellations were normal.  The behavior was normal during the quarter so, so far we're not seeing people react by wanting to change business that they've already agreed to.  Elisha?", "Elisha?", "Yeah.  If you look at quarter-over-quarter, Amit, from '08 to '09, the US dollar is 16% stronger today, than it was in the year ago period.  So if you look at the international growth rate reported in dollars, it's up 8% for oncology.  It would have been up 16% in constant currency, with close to 20% growth in both Europe and the Far East in constant currency.  So really strong international market hurt somewhat by the exchange rate.", "Amit Bhalla - Citi", "Okay.  Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JP Morgan.  Please proceed.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan", "", "Thanks for taking the question.  Maybe just one for Elisha to start with, you mentioned a number of items in the release in terms of driving margins, mix, cost controls, and I guess the tax benefits.  Can you just help us gauge the relative contributions of some of those items?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Sure.  Well, the oncology margin up three points in the quarter which was obviously a highlight for us.  It came primarily from mix where we continued to see the software, particularly RapidArc, have a very positive impact on the gross margin, and cost controls, which you saw all the way through the P&L.  The SG&A, we got a point leverage there and it's all the things you might imagine.  We have severely cut back on travel when it's not essential, we've cut back on overtime, we've put a salary freeze in place, we are forcing more vacation \u2014 all the things that you would imagine.  Reduced hiring and closed some open positions, and fortunately it came through very nicely in the P&L in the quarter and I think that should continue as we go forward and keep these cost-control initiatives in place.", "The tax rate was a point lower than the year ago period and it was just due to some discrete items in the quarter.  If you notice, the third quarter historically has always been the lowest in terms of tax rate and that's because we typically have statutes of limitations expire on opened returns and we also had some favorable settlements of some audits in the quarter as well.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan", "Okay.  As we think about some of the cost-control measures, you talked about that as well last quarter, is there any shift in the underlying R&D priority here and maybe just piggybacking off Tim's comments about emphasizing brachium software and some of these other ancillary products a little bit more.  Any kind of shift in strategy as we think about the coming year?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Well I think a lot of the programs that we had in mind, we probably feel more strongly now than ever that the priorities we set were actually the correct ones.  If you looked at us from the outside world, what you'll probably see a year or two from now is that we're making some changes to the products that will make them appealing to more international markets than you might have seen us do three or four years ago, but that is a decision that we made actually before any of this manifested.  So I am actually reassured that the priorities that we've set are right.  ", "Software is certainly one of our priorities.  RapidArc certainly demonstrated to us that, if we didn't know it before, that software is a key ingredient in terms of people doing what they want to do clinically.  RapidArc was a wonderful productivity tool for customers and possibly it's going to turn out to be a great clinical boon to patients.  So we know that software is important.  ", "So I think what Mr. Wilson is doing is investing evermore in the software side of our businesses, but we're keeping our hardware platforms up to date as well and so I think we're doing basically the same things that we ought to do even despite all of these changes in the external market.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan", "Okay.  Two other quick ones, in your comments, Tim, you mentioned the credit issues.  Again, I think if I go back to it last quarter you had talked about creditworthy customers were getting financing.  Has there been a sequential change here or was that just kind of a broader macro comment?", "Elisha W. Finney", "We had a record quarter for our customer financing team in the third quarter, so they are continuing to go out and secure financing for good credit.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan", "Okay.  And then one last one on China, you've mentioned that a couple quarters in a row, how large is that business today?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Oh, can you hold on a second?  I'm going to try and figure that out.  I think it's about a $50 million business.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan", "Okay.  That's helpful.  Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson of Robert Baird.  Please proceed.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Beard & Co.", "", "Thank you, good afternoon.  Wondering if I can just first try to dial in on a few of the moving parts on guidance if possible anyway; it looks like revenue guidance coming down by maybe one to three points and by my math and please correct me if I'm wrong here, my math  currency from the last time you updated guidance would have provided maybe a one to a two point tailwind, so is the 1-3 point reduction kind of a maybe 2-4 point cut in expectations on actual units and sales there, and the rest currency offsets?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Well, Jeff, it's really driven by the x-ray business which is more of a short-cycle business which we have just seen a precipitous fall off compared to what our expectations were in the beginning of the year, and also in our Security and Inspection Products.  So if you look at oncology, they turned in 5% revenue growth in the quarter which was at the low end of our prior guidance and had we gotten a little more help from currencies that would have been good, but at 140 we'll take that.  But it really is the other two businesses where we have just seen bigger than expected falloff.  ", "Oncology had a few shipments that were delayed, a couple of international locations \u2014 about a handful had some construction delay.  That's very meaningful because if you miss an acceptance it's 100% revenue on acceptance in the international locations that can have a big impact in the quarter.  So feel like we'll catch those up in Q4 and it's the other two businesses driving the decline.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Yeah.  And I would just add we're not expecting generous behavior on the part of North American oncology customers in the fourth quarter so we've looked at what's realistic and added it all up and that's how we got to these numbers.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Beard & Co.", "Okay great, and then on the EPS line a similar question I guess.  I'm just looking relative to my model and tell me maybe your expectations were different or maybe I was off in my model, but looks like a lower tax rate this quarter added maybe a nickel in Q4 and a few pennies, so lower tax rate for the year may be $0.07-0.08 of upside relative to what we had been expecting going into the quarter?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Well I mean of the quarter it was closer to $0.025-0.03 was the impact of the original guidance to the tax rate that we had.  So it sounds a little high for the full year, Jeff.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Beard & Co.", "Okay.  I'll check my math, thanks, on that.  And then I know quantitatively you don't discuss it, but you can at all qualitatively talk about RapidArc orders in the quarter?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "RapidArc orders, well I think we've now graduated and so RapidArc orders were down a little bit from the year ago level when we were getting started and it was very exciting.  The take rate is very high so that means that people want the product and are accepting it, but as new orders for clinics in North America, which is the strongest take-rate quarter, weren't as strong this quarter as we would've liked \u2014 that's where the impact was.  We think we still have tremendous room to grow internationally.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Beard & Co.", "Yeah.  And that was going to be my question \u2014 is international over the next few quarters still expected to grow pretty nicely and offset just the tough comps in North America, is that how to think about it on (inaudible) quarters?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Yeah.  We have our fingers crossed and that's what we want to see happen.  But it will take a lot of work on our part and we need international markets to behave the way we want them to behave.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Beard & Co.", "And you do, Tim, come up against a tougher oncology comp in the international markets next quarter, but it sounds like at least at this point a month into that quarter and given the strength of fiscal Q3, still feeling like those markets are holding in pretty well?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "As you know I don't give guidance on orders, but I will say that international in general still looks healthy, but we're only one month into the quarter, we  have two months to go.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Beard & Co.", "Got it.  I just keep trying to dangle that worm that you refer to there (laughter).  Last question from me then just on ASTRO coming up about in a month, month and a half, are we going to see anything on motion management there as far as new product launches or what should we think about seeing at ASTRO and then in a couple months at ASTRO?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Motion management remains extremely important to us in terms of targeting to moving tumors that remains a significant opportunity for improving cancer care.  So we will be showing some of our newest ideas for how that might be done.  I can't give you much more detail than that, but that will be an area that we're going to be focused on for the next few years.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Beard & Co.", "Got it.  Thanks all for the comments.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Junaid Husain of Soleil Securities.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "", "Hi.  Good afternoon, guys.  Tim or Elisha, for the US oncology business, could you give us a sense for the pacing of the orders, was it particularly well spaced out from month to month, was it light in June but front-end loaded?  How did the pacing look?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "I think it followed our normal pattern which was it's slow,well, slow is not the right word.  It's lighter in the first two months of the quarter and heavy in the third month of the quarter and we didn't see it deviate from the normal pattern except for the last week where I think people started to take into account some of the things that have changed in the market.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "Got it.  And could you tell me what percentage of total oncology orders did the freestanding centers represent, and then how does it compare with the last quarter and maybe the year?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "I don't know what it was specifically for the quarter.  If you go back over time, it represents about 10% of total oncology revenue and that's just based upon, as I said, services about 30%, the remaining 70% is split evenly between North America and international, so that's about 35% international. And the ratio is about 10%, 25% for freestanding versus hospital, as a general rule.  ", "Now I do believe if you go back over the last nine months, we have seen lighter business in the freestanding than we would ordinarily see.  I think free standings have been expecting something and they've been trimming their behavior for the last nine months, but I don't have that calibrated versus the normal 10%.  ", "I would say our largest freestanding customers have been very conservative in their order behavior for this year.  So it's probably already affected us year to date because I think they were expecting issues, but whether they were expecting issues of this size is another question.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "When you look at this customer base then, the freestanding guys, if we assume that it represents 10% of the business, I actually thought it represented a lot more of the business of the last quarter \u2014", "Timothy E. Guertin", "For North America it does.  It represents about 30% of the business routinely, but in oncology overall it's about 10%.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "So then how should we be thinking about that 30% base in the US?  Does it completely freeze up or are there still some centers that are (inaudible)?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "What it does is it moves up the breakeven for a center.  So you have to build up your referral base as quickly as possible.  So what generally will happen is some center\u2019s ,depending upon what the final numbers turn out to be, and my personal belief is that CMS will not stick with these numbers so you need to take that into account.  Of course I have no special insight into CMS, but generally based upon what I know, these numbers don't seem to be the numbers that will persists, but lets' say they do.  Let's say they're not good.", "Well then what will happen is the breakeven will move up from, for example, breakeven right now is probably if you have less than 20 patients a day maybe 16 or 17 and it might move up into the mid-twenties.  Under those circumstances you will, if you open a clinic you will only want to open a clinic if you think you can attract that number of patients per day which means you'll want your referral pattern pretty well understood before you begin.  You'll want to know where those patients are going to come from, you'll want to establish your center in a location where that volume is possible \u2014 so your behavior will be predicated on the mathematics coming through.  And you'll want to line up your business with your referring physicians.  You'll want to know that your medical oncologists are aligned.", "So if you look at people like US Oncology where the medical oncologists work for US Oncology and they know their referral patterns, they're likely to put their operations in places where the local market looks very strong.  And you're also likely to see an increase in advertising because they'll try to have state of the art.  ", "I think the market will likely behave in two different ways depending on what part of the market it is.  People who have older machines in freestanding clinics will be more reluctant to buy more machines because they'll want to completely write them off and amortize them.  People who want to put a new center in and want to attract patients are likely to buy the most high-end machine they possibly can because they're going to want to promote that to physicians and they're going to want to steal patients, if you will, from facilities that have less advanced equipment and make that their argument.", "So I think what will happen is it will definitely hurt business in that segment of the market.  It won't drop to zero.  It'll drop to something less than it has traditionally been, and those people who do buy machines will probably market them more aggressively than we've ever seen them do before.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "Got you.  Tim, thanks, that's actually very helpful.  Last couple of questions, just a little bit of housekeeping.  I'm just wondering how I should be thinking about sales and marketing expense for the fiscal fourth quarter, especially with the big trade shows coming up.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yeah.  Well, the ROS margin should go up by about a point, Junaid, so that's maybe one way to look at it, with a significant portion of that coming from gross margin and the rest from SG&A.  R&D, we will not get any leverage on most likely.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "Gotcha.  And then last question for you, you've got a nice trove of cash in the bank.  I think in the past you've talked about using it strategically as you've told me before, cash is clean.  What are your thoughts forecast upon it?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Well, we ended the quarter with a little bit of US cash.  I don't have an exact number.  My memory tells me it was somewhere around 20 million or so and cash has continued to grow in the US.  So we've always said once we started to get a cash reserve in the US and we weren't borrowing to go out and effect a share repurchase that we would reconsider resuming our share-repurchase program.  So that's the plan at this point.  We plan to be opportunistic based on the stock price, but of course prudent relative to cash and debt market and interest rates and other uses of cash.  But with close to $500 million earning virtually 0% at this point, I think it's a good place for us to put some of the cash going forward.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "Got it.  Thanks so much, guys, that's all I've got.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Charley Jones of Barrington Research.  Please proceed.", "Charley R. Jones - Barrington Research", "", "Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions.  I guess the first one is I was curious if freestanding centers have a different book to bill ratio than a typical US hospital, meaning to the clinics tend to order and take possession of the Linac in the same quarter? ", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Oh no.  They tend to order them a long time in advance because there's usually a construction project that goes with it  So I don't think their behavior's that different from a hospital.", "Charley R. Jones - Barrington Research", "And then are you getting a sense at all in your discussion with hospitals that there's pent-up demand for Linacs that the capital freeze is definitely creating a desire to order systems or buy systems as soon as they do start to get a better feel for whether it's reimbursement or their capital budgets.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "We definitely know of people who put off ordering because the capital budget for the hospital, it didn't have to do with anything associated with the apartment.  The department wanted the machine, was eager to have the machine, was pushing the administration to do it, but the administration was moving slowly.  So we saw this pattern in the mid-'90s and I think we'll see it again when the hospital budgets come out.  I think we will see kind of a resurgence of orders.  The funnel from hospitals looks good, the reimbursement looks good.  We just need their general managerial behavior to allow them to start to spend.  We even spoke to a hospital recently that, I mean it was making money, it was profitable, and they were still cutting back because they were trying to build up their reserves against possible hardships going forward so they were trying to improve their return on sales in this environment.", "So we're seeing definite conservative behavior on the part of hospitals when they see the need for that reduced based on the information we're getting from customers.  I think you'll see us have a sudden growth spurt on the behavior of hospitals.", "Also you got to remember that freestanding behavior could change here.  Freestanding centers could try to align themselves with hospitals.  If a freestanding center decides that it doesn't want to function in this environment anymore with this level of reimbursement or it decides it doesn't want to take Medicare patients or it wants to limit the number of Medicare patients it takes, it will shift those patients to hospitals.  And under those environments a lot of these hospitals can't take on the additional patient burden without buying equipment.  So there are so many possible ways this could go, it's very difficult for me to predict for you accurately what will happen, which is why I say we're kind of watching this for the next couple of months, we're talking to people, we're trying to understand the behavior.", "Those hospitals that do have the money and do have nice balance sheets and their P&Ls are in good shape \u2014 I mean we had one come in here recently where \u2014 I mean they were extremely aggressive in their thinking about their radiation therapy program.  They thought it was key to the way they reach out to the community and not just at their main hospital, but at outside facilities as well.", "So I think radiation therapy remains key to their strategic plans, we're just seeing a general note of caution in everybody's behavior.", "Charley R. Jones - Barrington Research", "So wouldn't it make sense, I mean what did you see coming out of the' 90s then?  Wouldn't it make sense to see your book to bill ratio change coming out of the recession that you'll see a lot of hospitals want to take possession of the machines faster so that even though we have lower order rates over the next couple of quarters you'd still see better revenue growth because people want to take possession of the machines faster?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "That is what happened last time.  I mean past events are not a predictor of future whatever \u2014 whatever that phrase is, but that is what happened last time when people came out of the recession.  Now it didn't happen instantaneously.  You have to remember that hospitals have to set budgets, they're on an annual budget cycle, so even if the recession goes away, unemployment drops, and healthcare gets resolved in a way that doesn't make the hospitals feel like they're all going to broke if, if, if \u2014 ", "If all of these things work right, hospitals will still take several months to start to show their buying behavior change, but yes, you're absolutely right.  There will be a sudden increase.", "Charley R. Jones - Barrington Research", "It sounds like maybe you saw an increasing number of RapidArc orders for existing systems from some of your comments about hospitals wanting seeking throughput.  Is that true or are you pretty much just seeing these on new systems still?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "We are seeing them mostly on new systems.  I have to tell you frankly, the upgrade business is one of the businesses that's hurt during the recession.  You would think people would spend more money on upgrades, but they don't.  They do the opposite.  They actually tend to reserve their capital for new things and not for upgrades and I'm not sure I would behave the same way, but that's how they do behave.", "Charley R. Jones - Barrington Research", "It sounds like you've got a European proton therapy deal getting close, is that correct?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Did I say that?", "Elisha W. Finney", "We didn't say where (laughter).", "Charley R. Jones - Barrington Research", "Well that's the other part of the question.  I guess, have groups in the US completely backed off or do you think that there's a chance for some US orders maybe this year or next year?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "US and international interest remains strong and I'm going to have to update you on who goes first when they go first. But these deals, as you might imagine when they're a $60-70 million deal they do take awhile to percolate and sometimes when they happen they happen all of a sudden.  So we just have to \u2014 what I'm telling you is I'm feeling warmer and fuzzier than I felt for awhile, but as soon as I know something definite or have something definite to report, I will do that.", "Charley R. Jones - Barrington Research", "And last question as I may have missed this, can you discuss what your expectations are for x-ray next quarter?  If you already started to see a turnaround?  It sounded like you felt like it was \u2014 are you already seeing that this quarter?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "We are having some cautious optimism about x-ray.  We had what, 17% orders reduction in the second quarter followed by a 3% in this quarter.  That trend is in the right direction.  I'm not saying that that line will stay in the same slope into the fourth quarter, but things are definitely getting better.  And we have seen several customers for flat panels sign up with us.  Now what happens is they agree to go with us, they get some sample flat panels, then they do the R&D to incorporate them in their product and then when their product is ready they place an order on us. ", "So it doesn't turn into orders immediately, but the behavior of certain important customers in key markets gives us reason for optimism.  I would say some optimism in quarter four, but a lot of optimism in 2010.", "Charley R. Jones - Barrington Research", "Yeah.  So it sounded like at the (inaudible) that you had your largest that had really slowed down their orders for inventory purposes.  Are you getting the sense that that customer has worked it down where you're at least seeing orders for the systems that they sell?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Some.  Definitely that is true for most of them.  The dental and veterinary markets I think really were hurt.  I think dentists and veterinarians are being more cautious than other segments of the market, but in the human medical market, definite optimism when I talk to Bob Kloogey about that business, he definitely is feeling better.", "Elisha W. Finney", "We actually had orders increase slightly in the third quarter for the x-ray tube business.  So flat panel is where we saw a decline.  So that was very good for that particular customer having worked through the inventory.", "Charley R. Jones - Barrington Research", "Great.  Thanks for all the questions, appreciate it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Dalton Chandler at Needham & Company.  Please proceed.", "Dalton Chandler - Needham & Company", "", "Hi.  Good evening, or at least it's evening here.  I was just wondering on the expense side, just a followup there, should we look at this quarter's numbers as a new baseline level or could there be some additional savings coming up?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Well obviously we have lots of different alternative things that we could do.  What we have done is we have turned the cost-control knobs that are relatively easy to turn.  We're going to be watching our markets for the next two quarters and make decisions as to whether or not we have to turn knobs that are more unpleasant to turn.  But at this time I'm trying to not do anything I don't have to do because if we see international strength, if we see the flat panel and the proton business and the security business give us some strength \u2014 if we see hospital's behavior in North America improve then I don't want to do anything that would weaken our ability to respond to that.", "So we put a lot of cost controls in place, travel, we reduced our hiring, we've asked people to do what they can in the area of overtime, we've seen people increase their vacation, we've limited salary increases to pretty much flat and we did a very small restructuring in our Salt Lake City because of the 17% order reduction we saw in tubes in the third quarter.", "Our backlog gives us some visibility so we're able to make these plans more in advance than maybe some companies would, so if we need to do more we will.  We certainly haven't done everything that could conceivably be done, but I'm just not a person who wants to behave inappropriately in a time like this.", "Dalton Chandler - Needham & Company", "Okay.  And then a followup on the RapidArc and the RapidArc orders.  How does your install base that is upgradeable break down between the US and OUS?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "I think \u2014 let me see, we said that number of machines that's upgradeable is about 1,000 as I recall.  I would expect that the behavior is about 50-50 for those thousand machines, maybe more.  But it's more likely that they will occur then that they will occur internationally.  So it's probably more like 70-30 in terms of likely buying behavior for upgrades.", "Dalton Chandler - Needham & Company", "Okay.  Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "That is all of the allotted time we have for question and answer.  I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Spencer Sias for closing remarks.  Please proceed, sir.", "Spencer R. Sias", "Thank you.  Thank you for participating.

And now here's Tim.", "", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Today we are reporting our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, with solid growth in revenue and earnings, but comparatively slow growth in our net orders.  Compared to corresponding periods in fiscal year 2008, net orders rose by 4% to $755 million, with the help of our first proton system order and 3% for the fiscal year to $2.4 billion.  Revenues rose a solid 8% for the quarter to $642 million and 7% for the fiscal year to $2.2 billion.  Our year-end backlog grew 9% to a record $2 billion.", "Both gross and operating margins improved for the quarter and the year.  Our operating earnings rose 11% for the quarter and 13% for the year.  Our earnings per diluted share from continuing operations rose a strong 15% for the quarter to $0.78 and an equally strong 15% for the fiscal year to $2.65.  Cash flow from operations for the quarter was a robust $116 million, and we ended the year with a record $554 million in cash and cash equivalents.", "All in all, we\u2019re pleased with our performance which has put us in a good position to deal with the challenging economic environment, particularly in North America.  I\u2019ll focus now on this issue and other aspects of our operations and let Elisha provide you with the details on the P&L and balance sheet before I give you our guidance for fiscal year 2010.", "Oncology systems fourth quarter net orders declined by 7% to $570 million because of a 20% decline in North America that was partially offset by a 12% growth in our international markets.  Oncology\u2019s net orders for the fiscal year rose 1% to $1.9 billion with a 7% decline in North America and an 11% increase in international markets.  On a constant currency basis, Oncology international orders grew 16%, for both the quarter and the year.  ", "As we first reported in our last call with you, the North American market is mired in an uncertainty created by a severe economic recession, expensive capital, pending healthcare reforms, and proposed dramatic cuts in reimbursements for freestanding clinics.  Business across North America slowed considerably for just about every one.  While we benefited from pre-recession capital budgets in the first half of the fiscal year, we\u2019re now feeling the full effects of the smaller capital budgets that have been established by many healthcare providers.", "For many customers, capital spending priorities appear to be focused on completing projects that were already underway rather than adding new capabilities.  Consequently, we\u2019re seeing more customers who are seeking to modernize using creative financing solutions outside their capital budgets.  Our customer finance team which facilitates leasing for hospitals and clinics who are buying our products has never been busier.", "We hope to see a stabilization of capital equipment budgets as the economy recovers and the healthcare reform debate and reimbursement issues are resolved.  Hospitals tell us that advanced capabilities for radiosurgery and radiotherapy remain a high priority for new spending projects.", "Turning to the freestanding clinics, the proposal for a drastic 30-40% cut in reimbursement rates virtually paralyzed this market segment during the fourth quarter.  However, many customers have told us they plan to move ahead with purchases if CMS adopts more modest cuts.  We\u2019ve joined the industry in making the case in Washington DC for a more reasonable rate schedule, and we should know the outcome for 2010 in the matter in a few days.", "Given all of these circumstances, the North American market is likely to remain very challenging at least for the first half of 2010.  Turning to the international markets, we had excellent growth in Europe and Latin America and a decline in Asia which reported tremendous growth in the year ago quarter.  ", "For the year, order growth in all international regions was positive.  In Europe, we had major wins in Russia, Portugal, the UK, France, and Germany during the quarter, and in Asia we landed significant orders at major hospitals in China, Japan, Korea, and Thailand.  We\u2019re seeing increased interest in more advanced treatment capabilities, particularly RapidArc which has universal appear across all markets.  ", "We set an all-time record for RapidArc orders units ordered in the fourth quarter, and we now have more than 270 RapidArc installations around the globe.  This is well on its way to becoming a new standard of care for radiotherapy, and it is being used increasingly in radiosurgical cases where we believe it can be a real game changer.", "Speaking of surgery, we also set an all-time quarterly record in orders for our Novalis TX radiosurgery products.  It appears that the radiotherapy/radiosurgery markets are hybridizing at an accelerating rate.  In Germany, we received our first order for the new low-energy unique accelerator for RapidArc and megavoltage imaging for fast, affordable image-guided IMRT.  We believe this product, which was introduced at the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology during the quarter, will be a real winner in the international market where government cancer treatment centers are looking for small, cost-competitive machines that offer both high throughput and advanced care.  It should make us even more competitive in this market.  ", "The growth of our installed base together with warranty expirations on systems installed last year at a high capture rate for contracts continued to drive double digit growth in our service business during the quarter.  So how will we handle this challenging environment for oncology systems?  Our growth opportunities for this business lie in the international markets, services, expanded applications for RapidArc, radiosurgical products, and a variety of new technologies.  We plan to step up R&D investments in 2010 to capitalize on these opportunities.  In the US, we have a large number of aging units that are not capable of delivering modern therapy.  These customers will benefit from our RapidArc and radiosurgical technologies.", "Internationally, we have many countries that are seeking to do high volume, state of the art radiotherapy.  Together, our new products and technologies should help to drive expansion in replacements in our worldwide installed base, which now stands at more 5700 units.", "Turning to x-ray products, net orders grew 3% to $97 million for the quarter and 1% to $339 million for the year.  Net orders for our flat panel detectors for filmless x-ray imaging rose by nearly 30% during the quarter with the help of our emerging line of panels for digital radiography.  Panel orders were up 9% for the year, and they represented better than 40% of the orders for x-ray products in the fourth quarter.  ", "We have added several customers for our new digital radiography panel, which make it possible to convert film-based x-ray systems to digital radiography.  These panels offer enhanced image quality versus computed radiography, higher patient throughput and lower cost per imaging procedure.  For these reasons, we continue to believe there is a big market opportunity for this product line, not only for conversions of existing equipment but for new equipment as well.  Several customers are now designing these panels into next generation products for radiographic imaging.  ", "In the past, I\u2019ve called attention to our unmatched capability to engineer and pair tubes with panels for optimized filmless imaging.  We sold the first such packages during the fourth quarter and are continuing to work on new tube designs for high throughput filmless imaging.", "Our tube orders declined during the quarter and for the year as a result of the recession which has cut deeply into imaging equipment sales.  Fortunately, demand for replacement tubes in the aftermarket was up, as hospitals and imaging centers look for ways to keep existing equipment operating in the most cost-efficient manner.  Our competitive advantages in the aftermarket are better pricing and the broadest product line in the industry, and we\u2019ve also been helped by the weak dollar.", "In our other business categories including our security and inspection products business, our particle therapy business, and our Ginzton Technology Center, we generated combined net orders of $89 million for the quarter, up $68 million from the year ago quarter, thanks to our previously announced proton therapy system order and strengthened SIP business.  The proton order, which I\u2019ll expand upon in a second, helped our other category to post net orders totaling $151 million for the full fiscal year 2009, up $56 million from the previous year\u2019s total.", "SIP achieved 26% order growth in the fourth quarter following disappointing second and third quarters when government slowed deployment of screening systems at ports and borders.  Orders came in primarily for installations outside the US, and orders for nondestructive testing products also rose in the quarter.", "Turning to proton therapy, we reached a major milestone this quarter when this business a $62 million contract following a public tender to equip Sweden\u2019s Skandionkliniken with a proton therapy system.  As is common in public tenders, this award is being challenged by a competitor in Swedish courts.  We believe, however, that the award was proper, and we booked the order in the fourth quarter.  ", "Despite the recession, the proton therapy\u2019s base appears to be as busy as ever, both in the US and international markets.  The Skandion award demonstrates that Varian is a very strong position when bidding for these products.", "Now I'll turn it over to Elisha for a review of the numbers and then come back to you with our outlook for the first quarter and the full fiscal year 2010.", "", "Elisha W. Finney", "As usual, I will walk you through the income statement as well as cover a few balance sheet items.  Fourth quarter revenues of $642 million increased 8%.  Oncology Systems posted an increase of 9%, X-Ray Products posted a gain of 11%, and revenues from businesses under the other category decreased by 16%.  ", "In constant currency, total company revenues increased 9% from the year ago quarter.  For the full year, revenues increased 7% to $2.2 billion, with 8% growth in oncology systems, 9% growth in x-ray products, and a 9% decline in our other category.  In constant currency, total company revenues increased 9%.  ", "The fourth quarter gross margin for the company was roughly even with the year ago period at 44.4%.  Oncology System gross margin increased nearly 1 point to 46%, due primarily to product mix and cost control.  X-ray products gross margin fell by two points to 38.7%, due to product mix in our panel business, start-up costs for our new radiographic panels, and higher costs of tube quality.  ", "Year to date, total company gross margin is up 1 point to 43.4%, with all of the improvement coming from oncology systems.  Fourth quarter SG&A expenses were $96 million or 15% of revenues, even with the year-ago quarter, and for the year SG&A was also 15% of revenues, down slightly from the prior year.", "Fourth quarter R&D expenses were $38 million or 6% of revenues, down nearly 1 point from the year-ago quarter, and for the year, R&D expenses $147 million, even with the prior year at 7% of revenue.", "Moving down the income statement, fourth quarter operating earnings rose 11% to $151 million or 23.5% of revenues, up more than half a point from the year ago quarter. For the full fiscal year, operating earnings were up 13% to $474 million or 21% of revenues.  ", "Depreciation and amortization totaled $12 million for the quarter and $44 million for the year. Net interest expense for the quarter was $200,000.  The effective tax rate was 35% for the quarter and 30% for the year.  For the first quarter of fiscal year 2010, the estimated tax rate should be about 33%, up from the year-ago quarter when we benefited from the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, and for full fiscal year 2010, we estimate that the tax rate will be between 31% and 32%.", "Fully diluted shares outstanding were approximately $125 million for the quarter and the year, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations rose 15% to $0.78 bringing total EPS for the year to $2.65.  ", "Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $554 million, debt of $37 million, and stockholders' equity of $1.3 billion.  DSO or day sales outstanding for the quarter was 81 days, up 7 days from the year-ago quarter, but down two days from the prior third quarter due to strong collections.", "Fourth quarter cash flows from operations was $116 million with most of it coming from net earnings.  Primary uses of cash were $30 million for stock repurchases and 15 million for capital expenditures.  During the quarter, we spent $30 million to repurchase 700,000 shares under our repurchase program.", "Now I'll turn it back over to Tim for the outlook.", "", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Weak orders in the second half of fiscal year 2009 together with ongoing uncertainty stemming from the recession, healthcare reform, and proposed cuts in reimbursements in North America give us a cautious outlook for fiscal year 2010.  We believe that for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010, total company revenues could increase by 3-4% over the prior year.  Including a higher tax rate and a one-time $0.02 per share charge for our recently completed reduction in force, net earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the first quarter could be in the rate of $0.52 to $0.56.  ", "For the full fiscal year 2010, we estimate that revenues and operating earnings could increase by 4-5% over the fiscal year 2009 total and that the net earnings per diluted share from continuing operations could be in the range of $2.65 to $2.75.  ", "To summarize our thoughts on the quarter and the year, we\u2019re facing challenges in the current economic environment, but we are comparatively well positioned to address them.  We\u2019ve grown our order book with the help of our emerging proton business and strong international presence.  New product lines contributed to solid revenue growth which together with successful cost control initiatives led to improved margins, excellent earnings, strong cash flows, and record cash levels.", "In 2010, we\u2019ll step up our R&D efforts, and we have the technology, products, resources, and talent that we need to become stronger than ever.", "We\u2019re now ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla.", "", "Amit Bhalla - Citi", "I wanted to start with a couple of questions on the North American oncology business.  Given that it was down 20% in orders, I was hoping Tim if you could give us a little bit more color on the moving parts.  Clearly we\u2019re assuming Clinac was down significantly, but give us some more color on software and brachytherapy in the business in North America.", "", "Timothy E. Guertin", "", "Software and brachy were both up in terms of orders.  The problem was in Clinac, and and you might expect the freestanding market was not a good market in the fourth quarter as people are waiting to see what the reimbursement numbers are, and I think more importantly to understand what\u2019s behind whatever decision CMS makes.  They want to not just see the numbers, but they want to understand how those numbers were derived.  The hospital market was also down in North America.  I think that\u2019s continued for Clinacs, and that\u2019s once again related to hospitals trying to control their capital budget.  They are trying to look forward to what healthcare reform impacts will be, and I think capital equipment projects are one of the places where they are trying to show restraint until they know what the story is.  So I think this is going to make 2010 a tougher year than I would otherwise expect it to be.  We\u2019ve shown that that backlog remains real, that people turn those orders into real sales which helped us in 2009, and I think that when those capital budgets return for hospitals, we\u2019ll see a lot of strength, but we\u2019ve to get through 2010 for that to happen.  So although I\u2019m at the beginning of 2010, I suppose I\u2019m really looking forward to latter half of 2010 and 2011, and I\u2019m really looking forward to seeing how healthcare reform and reimbursement decisions are made by the government.", "Amit Bhalla - Citi", "Is there a anyway for you to tease out or even give us a best guess of how much of the North America order book was impacted by the delays due to people waiting on the sidelines for reimbursement, even a guess?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "I think for the freestanding marketplace, that market was probably about one-half of what it would ordinarily be, and that\u2019s a severe problem.", "Amit Bhalla - Citi", "In terms of the overseas markets, could you provide us with just a view on the sustainability of the demand there?  It looks like order growth there was pretty positive, as well as just comment on the Unique platform.  Is that going to put pressure on the operating margin?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Let me start with the international markets, and then I\u2019ll come back to Unique.  For Asia, I think Asia is at the beginning of a long-term sustained rise.  I\u2019m not saying that in any given quarter it\u2019s going to rise, but I\u2019m saying over the long-term it\u2019s going to happen.  When we look at Japan, which was a strong quarter for us, the demographics in Japan, we see an aging population and we see Japan trying to respond to that by increasing the number of units that is has and it\u2019s still way below the capacity that it will need.  When we do a calculation that looks at what they\u2019re going to need to handle patients with radiation therapy, there is a huge need for machines there.  Same thing in China.  There is a huge shortage of machines to serve that market, so I think that Asia-Pacific is going to continue to be strong.", "For Europe, we had a good year in Europe.  I think going forward in Europe, we want to see what the effect is of the recession on capital budgets for governments.  It would be difficult to believe that Europe will grow and grow and grow in the midst of a recessionary environment, but we\u2019re hoping that.  For us, remember that Europe includes the Europe, the Middle East, and some parts of Asia and Africa.  I think that Western Europe is a question mark for next year.  I think Middle East will behave somewhat normally.  I would also remind you that we had a very tough comp for Asia in the fourth quarter, so although it was down, it was way up in the fourth quarter of last year, and it was very difficult for them to achieve that. ", "For Latin America, I think it\u2019s also promising based upon momentum in 2009 and the affordability that the currencies are giving us will help us there, and of course they\u2019ll help us in Europe as well, so we\u2019re hoping that the currencies stay favorable for us going into next year.", "The Unique product line, we have a historically low use of our low energy lines, so what we\u2019ve done is improve that machine so that it\u2019s capable of doing RapidArc.  I think it have a good margin on it and good price positioning, but of course we\u2019re trying to sell it into markets where they are very price sensitive and where capital is difficult.  Nonetheless, this is a machine that for a very reasonable price can treat patients very fast and with the most state of the art radiation therapy.  So I think when customers look at it, when people have a high volume need for machines and they have restricted capital budgets and they only have a small room, this is the kind of machine that will fit perfectly into that category, and I think it\u2019s a killer product.", "Amit Bhalla - Citi", "Elisha, it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re showing any leverage from the topline to the bottomline with that 4-5% revenue growth that you\u2019re putting up for fiscal year 2010.  Can you give us some color on the expenses there, and then secondly also on guidance, what contribution from Proton is in your guidance for next year?", "Elisha W. Finney", "In terms of the leverage, Amit, remember we took the EBIT margin up a full point this year to 21.4%, so being this early and the planning process for a year that has a lot of uncertainty for all the reasons that we talked about, I\u2019m very pleased that we\u2019re able to grow sales and to maintain the ROS percentage even with the year ago period.  The way we\u2019re going to get there is you\u2019ll see some gross margin decline that\u2019s going to come from the fact that more of the growth this year in orders has been in the international market.  There is some pricing pressure as we talked about.  The Proton revenue, and I\u2019ll come back to that, will have a much lower margin, so you\u2019ll see some decline in gross margin, and you\u2019ll see an increase in R&D spending as a percentage of sales to be offset by significant leverage that we\u2019ll see in SG&A expenses.  So that\u2019s at the EBIT line, and frankly that\u2019s how we manage the business.  So not necessarily between gross margin and operating expenses, but we manage it to the ROS level.  Of course, the interest and the tax rate is hurting us next year when you take that down to the EPS level. ", "To come back to your question on Proton, we will not take any Protons for this particular Skandion deal until we actually start work on that project, and then we\u2019re going to record the revenue as what\u2019s called a zero profit model under the percentage completion method, and that\u2019s because given that this is our first project, there\u2019s of course some uncertainty with our ability to estimate the profitability, and therefore when we take revenue at certain milestones, our costs will equal our revenue and we will defer the profit until it becomes assured, and that will most likely be at the end of this project given that it\u2019s our first one.  So obviously there is a small amount of revenue from Protons that I\u2019m assuming in fiscal year 2010, but it\u2019s going to have zero margin attached to it.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "I\u2019ll just add that our issue is not at the EBIT line.  We\u2019re fine at the EBIT line, but between tax and interest, we\u2019re just not able to take as much of that to the EPS line right now as we would hope to.  In a difficult year like this, I think it would be unreasonable to expect considering all the factors that Elisha has talked about that we can increase our return on sales.  So we\u2019re not trying to increase it, but we\u2019re trying to reasonably hold it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Amit Hazan \u2013 Oppenheimer.", "Amit Hazan \u2013 Oppenheimer", " ", "On guidance again, maybe as a followup, on the topline, if we\u2019re looking at the 4-5% growth you\u2019re looking for fiscal year 2010, I\u2019m trying to reconcile it with the order patterns in the last year or especially in the last 9 months now without Proton flat, maybe even a little bit down.  It certainly sounds like you\u2019re describing an environment where orders are going to stay pressured even into December and into March, so that reconciled with revenues, I\u2019m having a little trouble with, and at the same time you guys are really good about guiding revenues, and so I\u2019m wondering what\u2019s implied in there.  How much of that you\u2019re confident and how much of an expectation for a rebound in orders you\u2019re looking for in the coming quarters to get to that sales number?", " ", "Elisha W. Finney", "If you look at the backlog number year over year, we\u2019re up 9%, but of course that includes the Proton order.  If you exclude the Proton order, the backlog is up about 5%, so again that gives us good visibility looking into fiscal year 2010.  A lot of the problems we ran into this fiscal year were really in our short cycle businesses where we had x-ray really struggle for several quarters.  So we\u2019re starting to see a normal rebound in the x-ray product segment.  The flat panel business has a new product that\u2019s starting to turn around.  Our service business is growing quite strongly, and I don\u2019t see why that wouldn\u2019t continue into next year.  So just given customer requested delivery dates and looking at the detail of that backlog, this is our best guestimate as we sit here today.", "", "Timothy E. Guertin", "I\u2019ll just add that I think all of the businesses have the potential to show revenue growth next year, but oncology is obviously going to have the toughest time, and that is 80 something percent of the company.  So even though other businesses might grow a lot more than oncology next year, I think that\u2019s why we\u2019re showing some conservatism.  But if we get good news in reimbursement and things like that and we get some orders that turn into business next year, that would be nice to see, but right now I think this is prudent way for us to go.", "Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer", "So do oncology orders need to grow for you to hit your guidance?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "We need something to happen positively in North America for us to do better than our guidance.  We\u2019ve assumed that reimbursement won\u2019t be as bad as what\u2019s originally predicted, but it\u2019ll still be off, and so if things are worse or things get better, then we\u2019ll come back to you and give you an assessment on that.  Even if the numbers come out next week, which is of course when we\u2019re hoping it will happen, it will take a while for our customers to digest them and make their decisions.  So I think the first half for oncology is going to be based upon the kinds of numbers you saw us taking in orders last year.  For the second half, we\u2019ll have to see what things look like in the first half.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Let me just follow on by saying if you look at 2008 to 2009, we grew sales close to $150 million.  If you look at 2009 to 2010, we\u2019re only assuming a little more than $100 million, so that\u2019s built into the guidance already.", "Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer", "I have a followup then on the freestanding clinic side.  I think a lot of us were expecting some weakness, but that was probably more than most of us expected, and I\u2019m wondering when you talk to these people, we\u2019re also hearing that the codes won\u2019t be down as much, but we\u2019re hearing that they\u2019ll be down, and I\u2019m just wondering what kind of color you are getting from them in terms of what they\u2019re looking for.  If they waited to see the codes, what does that mean?  When they see the codes and they\u2019re down, are they going to still order, or how are they going about their thought process with regard to decline reimbursement levels in the coming years?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "The first thing I\u2019ll say on their behalf is our customers don\u2019t feel that any code for the treatment of cancer should be going down, that it\u2019s crazy to think that costs for treating cancer patients should be lowered.  I\u2019ll say that on their behalf.  Now, being realistic people, they\u2019re expecting that the codes might go down.  If you talk to one of them, you\u2019ve talked to one of them and you certainly don\u2019t know what everybody things, but I think they\u2019re expecting to lose some percentage of their revenue.  Some people are expecting to lose 4-5%; some are expecting to lose more than, but we\u2019ll have to wait and see what actually occurs.  So I think the reason why it\u2019s down so much is because they just don\u2019t know, and if you\u2019re planning a new center, why can\u2019t you wait for three months from July 1st, why wouldn\u2019t you wait for 3 to 4 months to find what the numbers are going to actually be, so you can plan your P&L.  It\u2019s very difficult to go to people and say we should invest this kind of money when you can\u2019t show them what your P&L projections are going forward.  So those people who I think are in centers where they are convinced that no matter what the number is they can do are the kind of people who order during this period of time.  Those people who are hoping to open up locations where the number of patients would be lower and where the consequences to their profitability will be a function of what the reimbursement is, they want to wait and see what the numbers are going to be, and more importantly not just what the numbers are going to be, but what\u2019s CMS\u2019s thought processes are behind those numbers, so that they can get a multi-year view.  So I think we\u2019re going to see strength in the hospital segment first.  The hospitals are looking at favorable reimbursement going into next year.  They\u2019re still buying, although they were down in the fourth quarter.  I think hospitals when they see what healthcare reform is going to cost them, it\u2019s going to put them in a more solid position, so I expect we\u2019ll see hospitals return first, and then freestanding clinics as they come to terms with whatever happened will start to get a better understanding.  So probably by the end of the first quarter, when we\u2019re giving results for the first quarter, we\u2019ll have talked to a lot of people about the actual numbers and their plans are and we\u2019ll have a much better insight into what their acquisition picture will be like for the year.", "Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer", "With regard to Elekta, we can never really tell in terms of their orders or what\u2019s going on over there, but they do report orders that have been better than what you\u2019ve been reporting in the US, and I\u2019m just wondering if you can make a competitive comment as to what might be going on with respect to that and if you\u2019re seeing certain amount of pricing incrementally worse than what they\u2019ve been doing in the past or any color you can give on that.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "First of all, they report orders for the Americas, and they had a very large order for Latin America during the quarter, and I wouldn\u2019t want you to think that that order was in North America.  They had some good orders in North America, but the big order that they had was in Latin America, and they offered very special terms for that order that we were reluctant to do, so I think we\u2019ll have to see how that business turns out for them.  In terms of the year, I think both Varian and Elekta probably gained share overall in the market.  I would expect in the fourth quarter because of certain orders that may Elekta may have benefited one or two points of share relative to us during the quarter, but overall for the year and for the quarter, I think Varian did fine.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan", " ", "Starting off with a question on Proton, your comment about the Proton order in Sweden being contested, can you just help us handicap that?  It sounds like it\u2019s a fairly common event, but how do we think about timelines and does that potentially delay things if it gets dragged down to court a little bit?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "IBA who is a competitor there contests every order, so we were not shocked.  We think that challenges like these are going to be common.  We think there will never be a Proton that doesn\u2019t have a degree of being contested, and Skandion is aggressively defending its bidding process, and we looked at what our competitors had said and we looked at what Skandion had said, and we became convinced that Skandion has sufficient logic to prevail in this matter.  The appeals process for these things is normal as I said.  It usually lasts from 3 to 6 months, and so far the schedule has not been impacted, because we\u2019ve built a certain amount of this into our process.  We think the delivery for this system will be in 2011, and they plan to do the first patient in 2013.  So everybody has built this into their schedules when we put this project together.  ", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan", "In your comments, Tim, you highlighted the installed base of mature Linacs with regard to the RapidArc opportunity.  Can you talk a little bit about how you\u2019re thinking about the sales strategy in the coming year?  It\u2019s a little bit harder to nudge those customers that haven\u2019t upgraded that have older systems.  Do you have to add reps, or how do you just think about the upgrading of mature base of Linacs?", "", "Timothy E. Guertin", "We have about 1000 machines in the US that are over 10 years old, and obviously that represents a real opportunity for improvement.  I will tell you that people actually make the decision on whether to upgrade their oldest machine is by how old their youngest machine is.  If their youngest machine is 4 to 5 years old and is not delivering what they think of as the current state of the art, then they\u2019ll probably want to replace their oldest machine with a new machine, so that they can have the current state of the art on at least one of their machines.  It\u2019s the hardest thing for people to do when they have only one or two machines because then taking one machine out of service is very difficult of them.  So one of the things that we\u2019ve done is we have increased the speed by which we can remove old machines and put in new machines and commission them, and the commissioning process of course is up to the customers, but in terms of what we to do, we\u2019ve been able to demonstrate that we can do this in a couple of weeks now, which I think is as fast as we\u2019ve ever seen.  We\u2019ve done the same thing for our upgrades by the way.  We\u2019ve been able to get that used to take several weeks to take a weekend, so we\u2019re really fast.  I think that will affect the market.  I think RapidArc is rapidly becoming accepted in the US market as the way you should treat a variety of cancers, and so I think that that will encourage people to do more.  Also we\u2019ve stated again and again and I think our customers agree that radiosurgery is going to very important, and a lot of them want to get into radiosurgery, and so what we\u2019ve been trying to do is produce a set of offerings for radiosurgery in conjunction with our partner BrainLAB that are easy for people to do and reliable for people to do and safe for people for to do so that they can get into this business, and BrainLAB has put together some very good training programs for customers.  So there is a lot of work to be done.  I can see ways to improve this process, and if radiotherapy departments don\u2019t have the capital budget to buy equipment, then pretty much anything that we say won\u2019t make any difference, but if they do have the budget to buy radiation therapy equipment, then I think we can give them very good reason to buy ours and to buy very flexible machines.  Remember the more patients you can treat per day, the faster the return is on that machine, and so having a machine that can do stereotactic radiosurgery, a machine that can do IMRT very fast, a machine that can do image guidance fast is the machine that will be most profitable for them.  ", "We\u2019re also able to use our balance sheet.  We have a very strong balance sheet.  Once of the reasons we emphasize to you the amount of cash that we have is that it puts us in a position when people need some help with terms, we can help more than we\u2019ve been able to help in the past, and I think that will boost us in the marketplace, so I think it\u2019s obviously not the market that I\u2019d to see, but I think we\u2019re prepared in ways that other companies are not for attacking this market, and I\u2019ll also say that I think in terms of service and reliability, in terms of lower cost per treatment, and in terms of clinical innovation, we\u2019re number one.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan", "Just to pick up on your point on radiosurgery, can you talk about the competitive dynamic?  Are you pulling some share from some of your competitors, and then also are you starting to really get buy-in from the hospitals for this kind of cross-selling approach that you\u2019ve been talking about for a while\u2014pulling the neurosurgeons and the radiation oncologists?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "We had record orders for our stereotactic machines during the quarter, so that tells me that despite negativism in maybe other segments of the market, in terms of the radiosurgery section, the Novalis TX was very strong during the quarter, and that tells me that that segment is very important to us, and more centers want to add that.  We\u2019re talking to people all the time for whom this is essential, and when they look forward to what they\u2019re going to want clinically to be able to in a couple of years, they see this as very important to them, and right now we can deliver stereotactic treatments that are incredibly accurate with amazing speed and it\u2019s just getting better and better all the time.

You\u2019re going to see fluctuations, but I think we should be able to maintain anywhere between 80 and 85 days.  Collections are back to what would call normal.

So we go through the projects, we rank them, and we made a decision that this is one area.  We talked about the reduction in force, but this is an area that was really not impacted to a large degree at all, so we\u2019re trying to really save on the discretionary spending and on the SG&A costs and on the gross margin level, but we\u2019re not scrimping on R&D because obviously we think we\u2019re going to emerge much stronger when we come out of this on the other side.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dalton Chandler \u2013 Needham & Company.", "Dalton Chandler \u2013 Needham & Company", "I have a followup on the radiosurgery market.  Could you tell us what percentage of radiation therapy patients today are getting radiosurgery and where you think that percentage could go in the future?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Obviously I think the percentage is going up.  I don\u2019t think I have it on my fingertips the number for what percentage it is right now.  It\u2019s probably pretty small because the majority of them neurosurgical cases\u2014brain, cranial cases, spinal cases, and that\u2019s not a very large percentage of total cases.  There are some people who are pushing toward radiosurgery for prostate, but there is not enough published data to know whether or not that\u2019s a wise decision or not, so we\u2019ll have to see.  I think that there is a desire by a lot of people to reduce the number of fractions that are needed for prostate, but pushing it down to 5 may not be a good idea, but we don\u2019t know.  Maybe the correct number of days is 15, so we want to see the clinical trials there.  I think in the long run where we\u2019re going to see stereotactic radiosurgery used in lung and liver, for both mets and primary disease, in non-small cell cancer, when we look at the results from inoperable patients for stereotactic radiosurgery versus operable patients, so these are people who are either too sick or had too many comorbidities to be treated with surgery.  When you look at their survival and their toxicities from radiation therapy, they\u2019re pretty good, so that would suggest that over time we may be able to see more and more patients who are considered by pulmonologists and radiation therapists to be candidates for radiosurgery, and if you look at the kind of treatment that people go through, the kind of consequences to patients who have a big section of their lung removed, they\u2019re struggling with disease and they have a wedge resection or a quadrant resection of their lung, that\u2019s a procedure that\u2019s very painful and takes a long time to recover from and it\u2019s a very serious disease to begin with.  So what you\u2019d like to see is as people have better quality of life if you can make sure that you haven\u2019t diminished their survival.  We have a lot of customers who are doing research in this area.  We\u2019re seeing the radiation therapy oncology group do research in this area, and we\u2019re hopeful that as data comes out over the next few years that we\u2019ll see more and more patients move to this, and I\u2019ll remind you that outside the US, in Japan and in China, as we see an aging population\u2014there\u2019s over 100 million people in China who are over 65 years of age and that number is growing, and we\u2019re seeing a graying of the population in the US as the babyboomers age, and in Japan as well, and a lot of patients would benefit from stereotactic treatments, once again in lung as the incidence of cancer is very high and the death rate is nasty and the toxicities are nasty.  And radiosurgery has relatively low toxicity, so we think this is an area that we need to emphasize going forward, and that\u2019s where I think we will see a lot of growth.  Are we going to see by next week Tuesday?  Maybe, but more than likely it\u2019s going to happen over the next few years.", "Dalton Chandler \u2013 Needham & Company", "", "So it sounds like if I understand you correctly, you think that growth is going to come more from a replacement for a conventional surgery rather than a replacement for an IGRT procedure for example.", "Tim Guertin", "It will be an image-guided procedure, but it will be image-guided stereotactic radiosurgery procedure where patients probably would have had drugs or an intolerable treatment for them, and now they will have a tolerable treatment, so I think it\u2019s good for cancer patients.", "Dalton Chandler \u2013 Needham & Company", "A quick one on reimbursement, when you think about the percentage of cuts, what\u2019s the breakpoint where if it comes in below that, you say that\u2019s not so bad versus if it comes in above that and you say, \u2018uh oh\u2019?", "Tim Guertin", "If my customers are listening to this call, they will all groan because they will all have different answers for this.  I would say if the percentage cut is a few percentage points, it\u2019s fine.  If the percentage cut stays where it was, which is somewhere between 20 and 30%, that would be terrible.  What it does is it moves the breakeven point for new centers in terms of number of patients you have to move.  If it\u2019s just a few percent in terms of cut, then they can probably swallow that, and it will make almost no difference to their buying patterns.  If it\u2019s 20%, then we\u2019re going to see maybe the freestanding market even be worse than we saw in the fourth quarter, so we\u2019re hoping for a number that\u2019s closer to a few percentage closer, but I can\u2019t tell you exactly where we break in between because the fact is the math is done center by center using the referral patterns for any given center.  When we see the number, the first thing we\u2019re going to do is go to our major customers who operate in this segment and ask them to run the mathematics for their centers and tell us what this will do, but in the absence of data I have today, I\u2019m just very loathe to tell you how that math will work out for them.", "", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W.

It sounds to me and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, there\u2019s a $0.02 restructuring charge that\u2019s included in your $2.65 to $2.75.  From a tax rate standpoint, if it\u2019s up 100 to 200 basis points year over year, that\u2019s maybe $0.03 to $0.06, and I don\u2019t know how to quantify your R&D comments, but if I take them up 50 basis points from my model, that may be a nickel or so.  Would those be all the year over year headwinds to EPS that are included in your guidance?  Is that how to think about it?", "Elisha Finney", "", "But remember we do get the leverage on the SG&A number, so net-net I\u2019ll just bring you back to an even ROS percentage, so I wouldn\u2019t focus too much on R&D going up and other things going up or down, so about 21% to 21.5% on the ROS.  We\u2019re on detrimented on interest because today as you know we\u2019re earning effectively zero, and the tax rate is going up from 30% this year to somewhere between 31% to 32%.  We had a lot of favorable discreet items in fiscal year \u201909 that this early and fiscal year \u201910, I\u2019m just not willing to assume that those are going to repeat until we get further into the year.", "", "Tim Guertin", "", "If you take two cents out of the EBIT line which is basically close to flat for ROS, then you can see that most of our problem is below that.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "", "Tim, I think you made a comment on what to use as kind of a proxy for at least the first half of \u201910 order trends.  Is that the \u201908 first half of \u201910 or what did you mention there?", "Tim Guertin", "", "What I was talking about there was just for the second half of \u201910, a lot will depend for oncology on what orders look like in the first half of \u201910.  For the first half of \u201910, their sales, especially in the first quarter is mostly in backlog, but for the second half of 2010, they are going to get some orders that came in late 2009, but some orders that come in first half of 2010, so it is very important that we pay attention to market dynamics especially in North America and Europe, especially in North America, for the first of half 2010 in order to understand better how the second half is going to perform.  Although we made broad assumptions, it\u2019s the reason why we have given you wide range, a wider range than we would ordinarily choose to give you because we simply don\u2019t know enough right now to project that any better.

Would you expect them to be back at the purchasing table?", "", "Tim Guertin", "", "We would obviously be delighted, and it would be a correct decision if we were carved out, but it would be hard for me to predict that was going to happen.  I have to tell you the signals and noise from Washington is not so good.  We hear lots of things, and then the next day, we hear things that aren\u2019t that way, so I don\u2019t know.  We certainly have been in there pitching.  Radiation oncologists have certainly been in there pitching, and there\u2019s a lot of people congress who don\u2019t want to see cancer therapy hurt, and it\u2019s pretty logical that they would take that position.  Their biggest concern is that Medicare patients, more elderly patients, will be extremely angry with the government if the cost of healthcare reform is that the services that they receive as Medicare patients are harmed, and they would be justified in being very angry should that occur, and cancer is rough.  I will also point out that if you look at all the Medicare spending which is a number in the order of $440 billion that cancer therapy is about $40 billion of that, and that radiation therapy is about $4 billion of that in terms of Medicare, so we\u2019re like 1% of Medicare, so carving us out would be a very reasonable and affordable thing for the government to do, and so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised that it happened, but on the other hand, there are a lot of folks in government who want to have very logical reasons for anything that they do carve out.  What was the second part of your question?  I think I just answered the first part.", "", "Junaid Husain \u2013 Soleil Securities", "", "In terms of what does it mean if they do the carve-out, do the freestanding radiation oncology customers come back to the decision table?", "", "Tim Guertin", "", "Yes.  That would certainly help them, but remember physician fee schedule is just one part of the problem.  That\u2019s the professional side.  On the technical side, they have to have favorable numbers in order to make the math work.  These freestanding centers, some of them are in big cities like for us out here in the West Coast, the Palo Alto Clinic is in a big city, but for a lot of them, these centers are being built in locations that aren\u2019t in major population centers, and so they don\u2019t have numbers they need to see, so they need to see both physician reimbursement be good, and they need to see the technical reimbursement be good.", "Junaid Husain \u2013 Soleil Securities", "", "Relative to your x-ray business, it feels like this business is bouncing back from a tough last couple of quarters.  You got a major customer in Toshiba to turn OEM for.  How should we think about this customer going forward?  Should we expect it to be lumpy or do you expect it to be a little less wobbly as we head into 2010? ", "", "Tim Guertin", "", "Remember this business splits into two parts, the flat panel and the x-ray part.  In the x-ray tube part, we\u2019re selling to people who are selling into the diagnostic radiology marketplace, and the CT and MR marketplace in the US has been very unpleasant for the last few years, and those businesses had their reimbursement cut because people say that people are getting scans that they don\u2019t need, and the way they prevent people from getting scans that they don\u2019t need is to harm the people who own those machines.  That obviously is absurd on its base.  If the referring physicians that are making the decisions as to whether people should have scans, so that\u2019s probably not a valid thing, but I think people are a little worried about self-referral in these markets, and so one of the decisions we\u2019re looking forward to going forward is that this issue of self-referral is dealt with more correctly than it currently has, and I think in the latest house bill, there may be some attention paid to this, so rather than just whacking reimbursement in the head for diagnostic radiology, it\u2019s done more intelligently.  ", "The strength that we\u2019re seeing in the x-ray business is largely in flat panels.  That\u2019s a market that\u2019s really taking off, and it\u2019s more than compensating for fluctuations that we see in x-ray tubes.  We\u2019re seeing growth in x-ray tubes in the aftermarket, that is, people who are buying tubes for services.  We\u2019re seeing growth there, but in terms of diagnostic radiology, it\u2019s difficult; it\u2019s difficult for Toshiba.  However, Toshiba is doing really well outside the US, and their CT scanners are very good, and I think they have seen share increases, and they\u2019re a great company to work with.  We work well with their senior management.  They are people who understand us. and we understand them and what they want from us, and we have very open lines of communications, and so they\u2019re great customers.  I wish we had more customers like Toshiba, and so we\u2019re thrilled with them, but we have lots of new customers especially in the area of flat panel, so I think the flat panel business as I have been saying for several years is a business where there is just a lot of growth, so what I would hope for is that if diagnostic radiology sees some stabilization in their reimbursement rates and they start to see some growth again, then that will benefit us on the x-ray tube side, and it will help us on the flat panel side even more.", "", "Junaid Husain \u2013 Soleil Securities", "", "Elisha, you got a lot of cash overseas.

As you heard, we did buy 700,000 shares in the last quarter, and my expectation is that if we have cash in the US, we are going to spend it and put it to good use and move forward with our share repurchase program, so that\u2019s what we plan to do in the oncoming quarter.  We\u2019re in a good position.  It\u2019s an enviable position that we have very strong cash flow, we have a very conservative balance sheet, lots of cash.  We\u2019ve reorganized where our Proton cash needs can be funded out of Europe as opposed to the US, so there\u2019s lots of things going on that give me optimism that we can continue to build some cash in the US and put that money to work.", "", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from the line of Sean Lavin with Lazard.", "", "Sean Lavin \u2013 Lazard", "", "If you look at the freestanding reimbursement and these 65% utilization proposals that are being discussed would go through instead of the 90%, how would the payback period for these centers change?", "Tim Guertin", "", "Yes, the 65% is probably going to go through only for diagnostic radiology.  It probably will not apply to radiation therapy.

Finney", "I\u2019ve asked that same question internally about a dozen times, and it really comes down to the fact that we adopted 1048 a couple of ago.  We\u2019ve had a lot of volatility in the tax rate as a result of that.  Last year, we had a catchup of the R&D tax credit in the first quarter that was a retroactive catch-up, so that had a pretty big impact\u2014I think about half a point or so.  We also had some very favorable audits that were resolved in the year.  It\u2019s something that I can\u2019t necessarily count on year in and year out until we start to clear some open audits, but it\u2019s early in the year and I just simply don\u2019t want to go in and underestimate at this stage.

Guertin", "That\u2019s relative share.  In other words, we think that Varian gained share in the market, but Elekta may have gained two more points in share than we did, so the change is relative share, and that happened in the fourth quarter, and it was mostly related to some large orders in Latin America.", "Nathan Sadeghi \u2013 Highside ", "So that did not relate to the North America market?", "Timothy E. Guertin", " No.  They give their number for the Americas, and we separate out North and South America.  So when we look at their numbers, obviously they didn\u2019t call me up and give me this information, but based upon what we consider to be lost orders, we think that was an effect that largely happened in Latin America.  By the way, we grew in Latin America.  It was just a strong year in Latin America, and Elekta benefited more than we did.  So we\u2019ve lost share relative to Elekta in Latin America.  I don\u2019t have any way of knowing yet for sure exactly how that played out in North America, but we think in worldwide terms, we were fine.", "Nathan Sadeghi \u2013 Highside ", "So the order in Brazil accounts for that 1-2% of relative share, and in North America you think you guys both gained a little bit share, but that was relative; there was no share swing in between you?", "Timothy E.

Guertin", "I would say 1 to 2 points on a worldwide basis, mostly from weakness of other companies, and I think we have reason to believe our share is about as high as it gets.", "", "Nathan Sadeghi \u2013 Highside", "", "Do we still have a lot of what I think as residual other players, non-Elekta, non-variant players?  What do those share numbers look like now?", "", "Tim Guertin", "", "We think those numbers went down for some of those companies.  You can look at their numbers and see that that\u2019s what happened.  A lot of them are public, so you can see their numbers, and it is difficult once again because some of them report service businesses when they report their orders, and some of them report years.  When a take a service contract that lasts 5 years, they book the whole thing as an order, and other companies do not do that at all, so one of the things that we have to do is use a variety of data sources to try and calculate this.  I would love to tell you that we know share to eight significant digits, but we don\u2019t.  All we can use is a variety of methods and information from NEMA and other sources and try to put together the story, and the story gets more accurate the more time has passed from the end of the quarter.", "", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from the line of Charley Jones with Barrington Research Associates.", "", "Charley Jones \u2013 Barrington Research Associates", "", "My first question is a multipart question on lung.  At the analysts\u2019 day, you mentioned that you expected some lung data to be presented from a center, I think, out of Netherlands.  Can you give us a brief synopsis of the data, and then the second part of the question is do you feel that data is good enough to support a couple of thousand additional machines in the US like you had mentioned or do you kind of believe that this can be offset by the extra capacity that RapidArc provides?", "", "Tim Guertin", "", "Did I actually say a couple of thousand extra machines?  I don\u2019t remember saying that.  Maybe somebody else said that.  Anyway, the data from Amsterdam showed that patients who were, I don\u2019t have their information in front of me, but it showed that patients who were treated with radiosurgery did very well, did as well as the surgical candidate patients, and we\u2019ve talked to surgeons about this, and of course they would like the data divided up different ways and analyzed differently, and I\u2019m sure that BU will do that, and but we were favorably impressed, and we\u2019ve also talked to people who have data that isn\u2019t published.  I can\u2019t tell you who those people are because they need to publish it, but when we look at unpublished data in the US, there is reason for optimism as well.  It\u2019s 200,000 patients that are diagnosed per year in the US, and there would probably be more lung cancer patients in China in a few years in a given year than the entire patient load in the US, so between China and the US and Japan, I think there is a huge opportunity, and that could result, yes, in thousands of machines but not in the US.  They will be distributed throughout the world.", "", "Charley Jones \u2013 Barrington Research Associates", "", "Last quarter, you gave us a number of about $50 million, I think, in revenue.

We had a good year in China.", "", "Charley Jones \u2013 Barrington Research Associates", "", "Last quarter you told us that freestanding clinics were about 30% of your US oncology revenue, and I guess that implies somewhere around 10-13% of your total revenue.

I think one of the earlier questions was trying to get at whether or not this was about 5% of a drag on orders or revenue.", "", "Tim Guertin", "", "When I gave the 20%, I said we declined 20% in the US.  About 30% of our business in the US is freestanding, and that business was down by 50%, and then if you take into account that hospitals were also down, you should be able to work it out.  North America was very important to us in this quarter and so that was where we had a big impact on that.  Asia we had a very strong comp a year ago, so although we did fine in Asia on a yearly basis, it affected us.  We weren\u2019t able to use the international to surmount to this effect, and that why we gave you the constant currency number because actually currencies worked against us a little bit during the quarter too because I think the average Euro was $1.54 or something like that in the previous year it was $1.44.  So that affected us too.  So the US turned out to be very important and mathematically with 30% of the North American market off 50% and the rest of the market off less than 50% but still off, it hurt the US order basis enough to where even though software was up and brachy was up and other things were up, we were not able to counteract it.", "Charley Jones \u2013 Barrington Research Associates", "I think your comments about down 50% were referring to orders.

", "We start by focusing on the international markets which accounted for more than 55% of the oncology orders during the period.  Both Asia and Europe had strong growth helped somewhat by a weaker dollar.  Asia's growth was led by the trio of Japan, China, and India. In Japan we benefited from a government stimulus package to enhance cancer treatment capabilities.  In China and India demand was strong for high-performance machines and we saw greater interest in our units for more affordable care as well.", "The star in Europe was Germany where orders more than tripled with activities in private as well as public centers.  In all of these markets we're seeing health care systems expanding their radiotherapy and radiosurgery infrastructure to better serve their growing cancer patient populations.", "In North America we are seeing early signs of renewed interest among freestanding clinics, however hospitals are still constrained by tightened annual spending budgets established last year in response to the recession and concerns about heath care reform.  As hospital balance sheets improve we hope to see higher capital spending budgets and a resumption of more normal purchasing patterns.", "In all of the markets the interest in our products and technology remains very high.  Continued demand for our RapidArc product also contributed to oncology's growth and as of the end of the quarter we had installed more than 340 systems.  RapidArc is far and away the clear market for fast image guided IMRT.", "In the quarter we saw a richer order for higher energy Trilogy and Novalis TX machines capable of delivering stereotactic radiosurgery and traditional radiotherapy centers.  We expect that radiosurgery is on its way to becoming a standard offering in radiation oncology facilities.", "We also received our second order, this one from India, for our new cost competitive unique accelerator for image guided RapidArc treatments and we are obtaining clearances to sell this machine in more international markets.  Customer interest is strong and we expect this to be a very successful product.", "Bracket therapy product orders increased with the help of new much faster treatment planning software which uses an algorithm that we are now incorporating into our Eclipse software for planning radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments.", "Despite very tough counts from the year ago quarter, our service business expanded nicely and it now represents $0.5 billion business annually.  We are focused on achieving a higher contract capture rate among our installed base of accelerators, and as a new data point for UR, install base now stands at 5,800 units with another 500 non-Varian units within our service arena.  These installations are split evenly between the North American and international markets.", "Let me take a moment to address our position relative to competitors.  Looking backward over the fiscal year we believe that both Elekta and Varian gained share at the expense of other competitors.  At the end of the day though this isn't about beating competitors, it's about beating cancer with better and better products that deliver fast affordable lifesaving treatments.  That's our focus.", "Turning to our x-ray products businesses we passed a major milestone during the quarter as orders for our digital imaging detectors exceeded tube orders and helped to grow x-rays total net orders for the quarter by 9% to $99 million.  This product mix shift was a prime contributor to improved margins for this business during the quarter.", "Our move into digital image detectors has resulted in the continued expansion of the x-ray business and has helped to insulate us from a harsh market environment that is hurting imaging equipment manufacturers, particularly in North America.  We talked in the past about being uniquely equipped to offer customers special packages, pairing tubes, and detectors that are optimized for digital x-ray imaging.  We landed another significant deal like this in the quarter, a $7 million order from an equipment manufacturer in China.  It was among more than $15 million in detector orders from several new customers in Asia and Europe that contributed to the gains made by this business during the quarter.", "From a geographic perspective the x-ray products order growth stemmed exclusively from international markets, especially Asia.  As I indicated a moment ago, North America has been tough for everybody including us.  Orders in this region were down particularly for our mammography tubes and detectors for dental and veterinary imaging systems.", "Our focus now is on segments and customers that are doing well in this market and we believe we can continue to benefit from equipment manufacturers ongoing rollout of filmless x-ray imaging systems which feed the imaging process and lower the cost per procedure.", "In our other business category including our SIP security and inspection products business, our particle therapy business and our Ginzton Technology Center \u2014 combined net orders for the quarter declined $73 million to -$40 million primarily because of the reversal of a $62 million proton order from Skandion Kliniken in Sweden. We also had a $10 million decline in orders for our SIP business which had an unusually strong first quarter in the last year. ", "As most of you know from our earlier 8-K filings during the quarter, Skandion Kliniken cancelled its proton order following its successful court challenge to its public tender process.  We are prepared to respond to a new public tender with hopes of being selected again for this project.  We have great confidence in the suitability of our particle therapy and pencil-beam scanning technology for this and other proton center projects around the world.", "As an example we reached a major milestone with this technology in December when we successfully commissioned a second treatment gantry at the RPTC Proton Center in Munich.  More than 80 patients have been treated at the clinic to date and more patients are currently undergoing treatment.  The clinical implantation of a second gantry is enabling RPTC to double its shipment capacity.", "We are excited about the growth prospects for this business and we are in active discussions with several groups who are planning to open proton therapy centers in various sites around the world.  We're continuing to gain two or more proton orders per year.", "Despite a slow first quarter our SIP business continues to have a healthy pipeline and good opportunities for growth.  Our biggest challenge in this business is dealing with its lumpiness as governments around the world move to deploy this technology in fits and starts.  It is clear however that there is a conservative and ongoing effort to improve security at ports and borders and we're confident that our technology will play a key role in this endeavor.", "We are concentrating on providing security customers with superior value in terms of smaller lighter components and systems that deliver higher image quality as well as faster imaging and analysis for automatic threat detection.  For example, the materials discrimination technology that we developed is now included in about 80% of the products we sell for cargo and border security.  We expect that this development work will enable Varian to deploy security products in a broader array of fixed and mobile systems as well as applications including screening air cargo.", "Now I'll turn it over to Elisha for a review of the numbers and then I'll come back to you with our outlook for the second quarter and for the full fiscal 2010.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Thanks, Tim, and hello, everyone.  As usual I will walk you through the income statement as well as cover a few balance sheet items.  First quarter revenues of $541 million increased 6%.  Oncology systems posted an increase of 8%, x-ray products posted a gain of 6%, and revenues from businesses under the other category decreased by $5 million or 20%.  ", "In constant currency total company revenues increased 3% from the year ago quarter as the result of a weaker dollar.  The first quarter gross margin for the company rose 1.5 points to 44.6%.  Strong gains in oncology systems and x-ray products gross margins were partially offset by sharp declines among businesses in the other category.", "Oncology systems gross margin increased nearly three points to 46.5% due primarily to cost control initiatives that improved margins across our product lines and a higher mix of software and service revenue.  X-ray products gross margin rose one point to 41.2% due to the higher mix of digital detectors.", "First quarter SG&A expenses were $84 million or 15% of revenues, a one point improvement from the year ago quarter as a result of tight cost controls.  First quarter R&D expenses were $38 million or 7% of revenues, nearly even with the year ago quarter as a percentage of revenue.", "Moving down the income statement, first quarter operating earnings rose 21% to $119 million or 22% of revenues, up about 2.5 points.  Depreciation and amortization totaled $12 million for the quarter.  Net interest expense for the quarter was $300,000. The effective tax rate was 33.7% for the quarter, up more than three points from the year ago quarter when we benefited from discrete items including a reinstatement of the R&D tax credit.", "For fiscal year 2010 we continue to estimate the tax rate will be 31%-32%.  Fully diluted shares outstanding were approximately $125 million at the end of the quarter.  Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations rose 13% to $0.63.  ", "Turning now to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $625 million, debt of $37 million, and stockholders' equity of $1.4 billion.  DSO or days sales outstanding for the quarter was 84 days, up one day from the year ago quarter and up three days from the prior fourth quarter.", "First quarter cash flows from operations was $131 million with most of it coming from net earnings and strong AR collections.  Primary uses of cash were $55 million to repurchase 1.3 million shares of stock under our repurchase program and $8 million for capital expenditures.  ", "Now I'll turn it back over to Tim for the outlook.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Thanks, Elisha.  Given our revenue growth, improved margins, and the strength of our earnings in the first quarter, we now believe that revenues for fiscal year 2010 can grow by about 6% over the fiscal 2009 total and that annual net earnings per diluted share could be in the range of $2.76-$2.83. We believe that for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 total company revenues could increase by  about 4% over the prior year period and that net earnings per diluted share could be in the range of $0.66-$0.68.", "To summarize our thoughts on the quarter and the rest of the year we're cautiously optimistic.  We're seeing strength in international markets and we hope to see renewed purchasing activity in North America as new budgets are put in place.  Our strategic plans are sound and we're executing well.  We remain confident that we can achieve long-term growth in all of our businesses.  ", "Thank you and we're now ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you.  (Operator's Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla of Citi.", "Amit Bhalla - Citi", "Hi, good afternoon.  Tim, I wanted to start with North America oncology and have you talk a little bit more about freestanding clinics as well as the hospitals.  Last quarter you said that freestanding was down about 50% and hospitals were down 10%-15%, so maybe you could give a little bit more granularity on how the two performed this quarter?", "And secondly, reimbursement rates came in better than expected back on November 1, so how much of a positive impact did that have on orders in the quarter?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Hi, Amit.  Well both hospitals and freestanding of course were not where they were a year ago.  A year ago this process was just beginning, people were operating off of budgets that were established in the previous year so we expected that we would have some difficulty there.  We are seeing renewed signs of interest in freestanding clinics and we're hopeful that that will turn into more and more business for us as the year goes on.", "In hospitals they're still operating off of budgets they set last year. We need to see those budgets graduate into new budgets.  They're going to do that as they look at their balance sheets.  Their balance sheets are looking a lot better now than they were looking when they made these budgets a year ago so I'm hoping that as they look at those balance sheets and as they get pressure from clinicians and their operations to upgrade their equipment and to adopt more modern equipment to replace ageing equipment that they will start to budget more.  ", "We didn't see that in the first quarter, we didn't expect to see it in the first quarter, but we're hoping that we will see it more and more as the year goes on.  And to remind you, we still have an ageing base. That ageing got a lot worse during the year because there wasn't as much buying and so I think that the pressure to replace that ageing equipment maybe as a high now as it will ever be.  ", "And I'll also add that there was concern during the year about what health care reform would be and I think that those concerns are probably not as great now as they might have been for hospitals.  And although that situation is probably not over and certainly could come up again I think that hospitals are paired in 2009 for whatever might be coming in 2010 and that that preparation is now built into their budgets and I think that, as I say, their balance sheets are stronger and I think their behavior will be more normal this year than what we saw in 2009.", "Amit Bhalla - Citi", "Tim, I know you don't give order guidance in oncology or for the rest of the business, but is it safe to assume that you expect that within oncology the trajectory to be improving in subsequent quarters of the year?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Expect might be too strong a word. Certainly I have good reasons for optimism, but my customers need to change their behavior and people don't change their behavior overnight.  So I would say I have good reasons to expect it, I have good reasons to expect it, but I'm going to wait to see them actually change their behavior before I use that word.", "Amit Bhalla - Citi", "And just last for Elisha, Elisha, could you just give us the constant currency quarter growth rates by region for oncology? Thanks.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yeah.  So total oncology was up 2% in dollars down 3% in constant currency.  North America was down 13% and down 14% constant currency due to the Canadian, and then international was up 19% in dollars up 9% in constant currency.", "Amit Bhalla - Citi", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sean Lavin of Lazard Partners.", "Sean Lavin - Lazard Partners", "Hello.  Congratulations on the strong quarter.  My first question has to do with gross margins where you came up in well above our estimate.  I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about the sustainability of these levels?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Sure.  Well without giving a lot of detail by segment, Sean, for fiscal year '10 once you run through the changed guidance through your models you will see that what we're expecting is around 22% ROS of which I'm about 30 to 40 basis points of that I'm suspecting will come from gross margin and the rest will come from leveraging on SG&A.  So about a one point in improvement in ROS and roughly half and half if you will between those two elements.", "Remember in the quarter we had a very good product mix as well as FX helped us.  It helped the oncology margin by somewhere around 50 basis points or so in the quarter.  The currency has since retreated somewhat so again we're not sure if that's going to repeat from now until the end of the year.", "Sean Lavin - Lazard Partners", "Okay.  And then my second question is now that you've had a quarter to kind of look at this, can you talk a little bit about the effect the reimbursement change may have had on your freestanding customers?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "We had a lot of conversations with our freestanding customers during the first quarter that we weren't having within the fourth quarter and they don't react overnight.  They do have to go out and get money, they do have to have to put their budgets together, they do have to worry about cash flow which obviously their forward look on cash flow is more positive now that it might have otherwise been.  So we saw some behavior change in the first quarter, but there wasn't enough time in the first quarter for them to react, but as I say, the conversations that we had were a lot warmer and fuzzier.  And also I would say I guess both big and small customers in the freestanding segment both showed stronger signs of activity and that's good to see.", "Sean Lavin - Lazard Partners", "Great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line Amit Hazan of Oppenheimer.", "Amit Hazan \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Hey.  Good afternoon, guys.  First question I think just top level you touched on it specifically, but if we think about your business model and we think about your orders and where they've been in the last 12 months and I think your trailing 12 month orders are now down about 2% or so and your revenue guidance for the next 12 months is up 6%.  I know there's a fluctuation when units get placed, but can you help us out in terms of what kind of currency benefit you're expecting and what kind of order rebound you're expecting to get to that 6% growth or if there's really that kind of relationship that's important between the orders and the sales?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "The first thing I would remind you of is that our backlog did grow and so the reason we're able to forecast revenue growth is because we've had growth in backlog from that.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yeah.  So Amit, that's exactly what I was going to say.  I mean if you were to strip out the proton order in Q4, backlog is up 7% quarter over quarter which is very much in line with the revenue guidance for the year.", "Orders that we currently are getting have less impact on fiscal year '10 and more impact on fiscal year '11 so as it starts to accelerate throughout fiscal year '10 as Tim talked about that would be reflective in next year's guidance more than this year just given the fact that the average tenant backlog is 12-18 months. Again we had significant currency help in the first quarter.  We averaged about 1.48 on the euro in the first quarter, today we're sitting at about 1.40. So obviously we've tempered our expectations on the dollar a little bit and reflected it in the guidance as well.", "Amit Hazan \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Okay.  And then just secondly following up on the US oncology side if we think about the companies that have reported so far in 4Q that nothing has been great, but that it has shown some improvement and if I think about your numbers from the September quarter it looks just about the same to me if I normalize the comps for September and December and so I'm wondering what you might be seeing that's different.  Is there anything that you're seeing that you could parcel out that would be different then what an MRI or a CT manufacturer might be seeing?", "Elisha W. Finney", "So I would just say that remember we tended to lag into this and lag out and if you look at our year ago quarter we had 11% growth in oncology orders.  So a pretty tough cost \u2014", "Timothy E. Guertin", "For North America.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Now for total oncology in the year ago quarter so a fairly tough comp compared to where we'll be as we move into Q2 through Q4 when things started to moderate for oncology.", "", "Timothy E. Guertin", "It is true.  When you compare us to diagnostic radiology when bad things happen they tend to be affected first.  They have short cycle orders and their business is impacted before ours.  On the other hand, they tend to come out of recessions more quickly than ours.  So we're reading their news reports, it's a little difficult to know everything that's going on, but we're reading the reports like you are.  But frankly, considering the situation I was thrilled to see what did happen.", "Amit Hazan \u2013 Oppenheimer", "All right and then just lastly maybe thinking about in terms of ASP and oncology worldwide really, but separated between the US and the rest of the world, just wondering if they're up or down sequentially.  In the US I'm just thinking about Novalis and RapidArc driving them up and then wondering if hospital spending pressures are driving them down to any extent and so where is that directionally?  And then on the US side I'm thinking of just kind of currency or some mix there and whether that's driving ASPs up or down.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Well, ASPs are being \u2014 clearly some customers are obviously negotiating aggressively during this period of time.  You would expect that.  Overall I think we're pretty stable and I think this is a case where in a market like this you want to have certain technological advances where you can get good pricing that holds you up so that all those certain portions of your product line might be under pricing pressure, other portions of your product line are not. And so by introducing new products and new technologies and having a number of superior offerings, overall I think we've been able to do okay and that's why you see the gross margins be as strong as they are.  I think that our strategy for prevailing in these kinds of situations has been working out for us and so I think we need to continue to invest.  We need to put a lot of money into R&D during this period because R&D is going to yield new products and those new products can give us a wave of stronger results in the future.", "I would also say that we're winning a fair amount of software business, more software business than we've seen in the past and the gross margins on that business is very good.  So between advanced hardware products and advanced software products I think we've been able to hold our pricing in aggregate pretty well.", "Amit Hazan \u2013 Oppenheimer", "And you're not seeing any increased or incremental pressure from the US hospitals as it relates to that?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Well, certain hospitals obviously are trying to use this as an opportunity to negotiate more aggressively with us and we have to negotiate with those people as best we can under these circumstances.  Some hospitals are feeling the economic pressure, but I'm just telling you in aggregate I think that having strong offerings is helping us defend our pricing.", "Amit Hazan \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Great, thanks very much guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dalton Chandler of Needham & Company.", "Dalton Chandler \u2013 Needham & Company", "Good afternoon.  You mentioned your ageing installed base and you're now up to 5,800 units, can you just remind us how many of those are upgradeable to state of the art versus how many just have to be replaced?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Probably anything that was made in the last few years is upgradeable.  People tend not to upgrade anything that's older than about four or five years so if you take five years it's probably about 2,500 units that are probably in the upgradeable category, and obviously things that were made in the last two years, 1,000 of those are much more likely to be upgraded than things that are older.  After they're older than five years people are probably going to think about replacing them.", "Dalton Chandler \u2013 Needham & Company", "Okay.  And just talk about the process you expect now as you go back through the bidding process for the proton deal, when do you expect to start and how long you might take?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "We expect that there will be a retender in February-March.  The customer has to put that together and we'll expect a decision 90-120 days later so you probably won't hear anything from us until the third quarter and we'll update you on that obviously at the end of the second quarter.  And whatever Skandion Kliniken does it will be public so there will be alternate ways to know about it.", "Dalton Chandler \u2013 Needham & Company", "Okay.  So (inaudible) 90 days after the tender is issued?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "We're expecting that they'll make their decision between 90-120 days.  Now, I think they're eager to make their decision because they don't like to put everything on hold.  They have the money, the money is sitting, and I think they're going to want to move quickly. On the other hand, clearly they're going to want to be scrupulous and who can blame them?  So we're going to do everything we can to respond to them as quickly as we can and we have every reason to hope that we'll prevail.", "Dalton Chandler \u2013 Needham & Company", "Okay.  And just a final question on the unique, I know you mentioned you had another order in the quarter, but is that helping you at all in any of the discussions you're having where you're competing with some of the players out there who have been trying to compete on price?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Yes.  In price competitive situations this machine is exactly designed to work in those because it offers a superior set of capabilities in a very inexpensive machine.", "Dalton Chandler \u2013 Needham & Company", "So you're pleased with the way it's performing and the conversations you're having?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Yeah.  I mean we're just getting started, but having RapidArc alone on that machine gives it a real edge.  It's a very sophisticated machine and yet it hits a price point that's very appropriate for certain markets that are highly price sensitive.", "Dalton Chandler \u2013 Needham & Company", "Okay.  Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line Tycho Peterson of JP Morgan.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan", "Hey, good afternoon.  Tim, maybe just taking up on your comments about radiosurgery and more of a movement towards standard of care, can you talk a little bit about how you size that market opportunity and maybe also if you can just kind of touch on whether these are new customers or they're existing customers that are adding capabilities and maybe clinically where you're seeing the fastest growth in radiosurgery?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Yeah.  This market is split into parts and we compete.  There is a hybrid part and then there is a special machine part where people want to have a machine that can only do radiosurgery and that's a much smaller portion of the market.  The hybrid piece is much, much larger and that's the piece where we compete and I think we're doing very well there.  I think we had, as I recall, a very large number of Trilogy and Novalis business this quarter so we're doing well.", "We ultimately believe that every radiation therapy department is going to want to have the ability to do radiosurgery and they're going to want to buy the technology that it takes to do that and it may not be more than one machine, but we think that everybody's going to want to be able to ultimately do this as a part of what they do.", "That being said, there is a market for people who make machines that are specific only to radiosurgery.  Our machines obviously can do radiosurgery very fast and very successfully for people who want to have that and so our machine can be used as a special machine, but by its very nature it's a machine that can do both special and general radiation therapy which gives it an advantage in a lot of those situation.", "In terms of the overall market size I'm not sure that I've sized it recently, but obviously I think if you add all the players together it's probably a $500 million piece of the market, but the difficulty is that when you just look at the hybrid market since those machines are being bought for general radiation therapy as well as specific, I'm not sure how you would separate those two markets from each other and it's probably inappropriate to do so.  But it's a substantial area of interest for our customers.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan", "And can you give us a sense as to when you might think about a replacement cycle for some of those early Trilogy systems that were placed or is more about kind of growing the market at this point?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "It's probably about growing the market more.  It's probably about replacing machines that are a lot older than Trilogy and getting those machine removed.  I think Trilogy is still a young enough machine that it's probably premature of me to think about that, but some of those machines yeah, they could be candidates for a RapidArc upgrade where we shipped them Trilogy before the creation of RapidArc because we now offer software capability where RapidArc could be used for stereotactic radiosurgery and radiotherapy.  So there may be upgrade opportunities there, but I don't think there's a replacement opportunity yet.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan", "Okay, that's helpful. There have been a couple of articles in the Times this week about clinical treatment errors, can you just talk about whether there are any potential sort of changes coming in terms of regulating medical physicists and how you think about some of the blowback from some of the press that's been out there?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Yeah.  It's hard to know where things are going to ultimately go.  I have to say if the goal of the New York Times is to remind us that outcomes depend upon safety and that we should all be scrupulous about safety and that's a message we clearly support.  Our fear is that if patients don't get treatments that they need because they have been frightened, these are already scared people so to scare them further so that they don't go get their treatment obviously is not something we would like to see. ", "I will tell you that we put safety first.  You can't get good outcomes without having good safety.  We put safety first and we always have and we offer extensive training in our Varian facility. In Las Vegas we go out and do seminars in the world and how to use our products right and we bring in world class expects to do that and so we're going to always continue to put safety patient first.", "In terms of what added regulation we might see it's hard to say. I think that all of us are interested \u2014 the societies, Astro, the ACR, the Acro, the ASRT, and the AEPM, are all very interested in seeing safety be a high priority for them and I expect that the first thing we're going to see is that those organizations work with their membership and work with manufacturers to ask what can be done.  I think that we're already heavily regulated.  Anybody who thinks that the FDA isn't incredibly scrupulous has never been visited by the FDA because they are tough and they are very scrupulous in terms of their behavior.", "So hopefully the lesson learned in all of this will be that all of us will work together and the societies and industry to create a better climate for patient safety.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan", "Great.  That's very helpful.  Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Ritchie (ph) of Wells Fargo Securities.", "Vincent Ritchie - Wells Fargo Securities", "Hi, guys.  First question I guess is just a simple housekeeping question.  Right now what is the split of where your cash is located?", "Elisha W. Finney", "As of the end of the calendar year we had about $65 million or so in the US.  The balance is mostly in Europe.", "Vincent Ritchie - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay, great.  And Tim, just based on you what you just gave us some nice detail on the install base, what's your sense of what the average age of the install base is?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Oh I don't have a current number, but it's got to be \u2014 with 5,800 machines in services and the average age has got to be out there at 9-10 years, but I don't know for sure.", "Vincent Ritchie - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay.  Great, thanks.  And I guess a couple of other med tech companies have noted that in the current environment they'd have to increase their R&D spend just due to pressures that they're seeing in changes in the way regulations have been done and the current environment.  What are your guys' thoughts on that because you guys have been a pretty steady 6%-7% of sales spend since your spin and Tim made some comments about R&D being important for future growth so just curious of your perspective on that.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yes.  I expect we're going to be closer to the 7% versus 6%-6.5% for this year so we have made a concerted effort to increase R&D. We think in this environment when it's been tough that this is a way to play offense and so the plan is that it will be somewhere close to 7% of revenues.", "Vincent Ritchie - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay, great.  And just going forward, what are your thoughts just in terms of what's going on with the FDA?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "What's going on with the FDA?  How do you mean?", "Vincent Ritchie - Wells Fargo Securities", "Well it just seem to me that for certain companies they seem to have taken the perspective that it's getting harder to get products approved and whether something besides (inaudible) or PMA and I'm just curious if you guys are seeing anything along those lines?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Well so far so good.  I mean I will tell you that the amount of stuff that we have to submit to the FDA when we go to them for approval is enormous.  I mean, we ship an incredible amount of documentation and they are incredibly rigorous and they come back and ask good questions.  So I know it's very unpopular to be proud of federal agencies, but I think you should be proud of the FDA in terms of the way they behaved in the medical device business, certainly in the area of radiation therapy.  So from my perspective I think they treated us fairly.", "Elisha W. Finney", "I would just say that it's an area that we have really beefed up resources over the last several years so I don't anticipate anything significantly different going forward.  It's been an area that we have beefed up over the last two or three years.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Yeah.  And we don't count that in our R&D, but there's other segments of the company where we've added a lot of people and we're still adding people so we're putting a lot of emphasis on compliance and good manufacturing practices.", "Vincent Ritchie - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay, great.  And then lastly, with the x-ray business you mentioned that the order for the panels were ahead of the tubes at this point in time.  What kind of gross margin effect can we see, if any, on that?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Well, the panel margins are significantly higher than tube margins, somewhere around 45%-50%.  So what happened is by virtue of the mix changing towards more panels in the quarter, it allowed the x-ray margin to go up by about a point to 41%.  To put it in context, if you were to go back five or six years ago the x-ray margins were in the mid-30s so panel has had a significant impact on taking their margins up.", "Vincent Ritchie - Wells Fargo Securities", "Great.  Thanks for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey D. Johnson of Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "", "Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Tim, I'm wondering, obviously a very good quarter here, congratulations on that \u2014 looking at the guidance for the rest of the year it seems to imply maybe 2%-5% EPS growth or low to mid-single digits EPS growth throughout the rest of the year. Is that just tracking kind of your order trend last year that fell off starting kind of in fiscal Q2 last year?  Is it conservatism on your part?  Just how should we think, any color around the rest of your year's EPS guidance?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Yeah.  I'm going to let Elisha take the first stab at that and then I'll think about it while she's answering.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yes (laughter).  Thank you, Tim.  I mean, around 6% on revenue, and again that's mostly just reflecting what is in the backlog and pretty modest expectations for this year in the orders that will be delivered in this year so really it is a reflection of what happened last year on the orders front.  I would draw your attention to the EBIT increase because that's really how we manage the company internally and that's going up 10% or so once you model this out to get a 22% ROS.  So there is going to be some leverage with a 6% revenue.  Of course currency can move that and it is early in the year, I will say that.  We don't come out and say yes we're being conservative, but it is early and there's a long time between now and fiscal year end.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "All right, well that's helpful.  And Elisha I didn't hear an answer earlier when the question was asked on revenue guidance for the year at 6%.  Have your currency assumptions changed within that going from 4%-5% revenue growth to 6%?  Is that kind of a constant currency increase in that revenue guidance or have your assumptions changed?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Well, they have changed somewhat from the last quarter guidance that we gave you. I mean if you look back at the Q1, the euro was at about 1.48, today we're at about 1.40.  So when we get to the point when we give guidance for the quarter or the year we put a range around where the euro is currently sitting so clearly with the dollar strengthening somewhat that did impact the guidance for the year.  So the increase in guidance is really more of a reflection of what we saw in the first quarter where we had a significant help from FX as well as strong orders and sales in service and software.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "And just to clarify, I can be slow on the uptake here sometimes so forgive  me, but essentially what you're saying is your currency assumption is for less of a benefit for the year than maybe last quarter when you first put guidance out you were expecting currency could benefit?", "Elisha W. Finney", "That is a fair way to put it.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Okay.  And then Tim, I guess another question for you just on RapidArc.  We've done some survey work just here over the last week or two and seeing maybe some signs of some increased interest in uptake on that.  Obviously it's been a great product for two years, but on the upgrade side especially maybe some increased interest going into calendar '10 here.  Any color you can provide there?  Have you seen anything change out in the field?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "I think we did see some increased interest in the upgrade business.  I don't think it was so substantial that I would draw particular attention to it, but certainly the majority of that is still on new orders that we get and I would expect upgrades \u2014 but I have to tell you that when a market is troubled like it is in North America, surprisingly the upgrade business doesn't get as much emphasis as you would think.  People tend to preserve their capital for new equipment so upgrades tend to be stronger when markets are stronger.  So if I'm going to expect upgrades I'm going to expect them mostly outside the US and that's probably where we'll continue to put attention for the time being.  And then as the market comes back in the US I think that will create more opportunities for us.", "My indications are that yes there's some strength there, but not enough to be that I would want to particularly draw your attention to it.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "All right, great.  That's helpful.  And then last question just for me, you called out the $7 million and the $15 million in x-ray orders and I guess the $7 million made up part of that $15 million in the new customers orders.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "For the customer, yes.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "And I'm trying to kind of reconcile that, or not reconcile, but look at that and look at the fact that your sequential comps here go from 21% x-ray order comp last year from positive 21 to a -17% in Q2.  So my gut is that we're going to get a real big uptick here in x-ray orders, but you also called out those one offs that I'm wondering if I should kind of take out of the fiscal Q1 as I think about the sequential trend or how should I think about that?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Well that particular deal we drew attention to because it was both a tube and a flat panel order so you have to actually split it up.  It's not just tubes and it's not just flat panels, but definitely tubes in the US are not where we want to see them and neither is it for flat panels.  Our strength is outside of North America and so we draw attention to these because I think that more and more of our business in the future is going to be these combination orders, but I mean that was \u2014 when you get panel orders they're distributed over time of course in terms of how they're delivering, it's just that that one was particular nice to have.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Okay.  And as we go up a negative 30% order comp in North America from last year in the second quarter and understanding you don't give order guidance, but would it surprise you to see negative growth on top of negative comps that sizable?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Bob Kluge isn't here with me so I'm going to speak on his behalf.  Yes, that would surprise me if it was negative on top of negative and that was such a shockingly negative inventory correction last quarter, but I don't want to be too optimistic, but that would surprise me, yeah.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "That's as close as I've heard you give order guidance so I appreciate that.  That's all I've got.  Thanks, guys.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Elisha's going to kick me under the table (laughter).", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Have a good evening, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Junaid Husain of Soleil Securities.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "", "Good afternoon, guys.  Tim, relative to China, broad strokes, can you give us a sense for how your oncology business is fairing here?  Just relative to Chinese health care reform, are you seeing any government tenders go your way for linacs?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "We're getting very good business.  We had very good growth in China. I think we have a lot of opportunities in China.  I think China is going to invest more in radiation oncology over the next few years. We see all kinds of positive signs that the Ministry of Health plans to invest more here and I think we have share opportunities in China as well.  I think we can gain share especially at the higher end of the market.  We're going to have our work cut out for us.  It is a difficult market.  The customers are very demanding and there's a large price sensitive portion to the market.  We have to provide good service.  It's a very large geographic area.  It won't be simple to do and we're going to have to invest, but I think the opportunities in China over the next few years are quite strong.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "And then relative to your manufacturing facility in, I believe it's Beijing, just given the certification received to manufacture the tubes, any thoughts on shifting some of your US-based manufacturing operations from say Salt Lake to Beijing?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "No, that operation there is just for the purpose of supplying the China market.  We have ample need for our facility in Salt Lake City so no, I wouldn't imagine that will shift.  It's just the China market is a very difficult market to serve from Salt Lake City and so we want to have more and more capability to manufacture those tubes in China and we want to be able to reload tubes and we have a reload facility where we can get old tube housing back and put new tubes in them and that has to be close tow here you need the tubes.  So I think China's very important to us, but it's primarily important to us for the China market.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "Fair enough.  And then just relative to the tubes business in general can you give us a sense for how this business is recovering, especially as it relates to one of your largest OEM customers?  Do you get the sense that we're feeling the bottom here and that ordering trends are either leveling or potentially picking up?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Internationally I'm very comfortable.  In North America the problem is reimbursement for diagnostic radiology is still not where it needs to be and in fact there were proposals to cut it further and those proposals were going to be countermanded by Congress when it acted on health care reform and now they have \u2014 that doesn't seem to be happening and so there needs to be other bills raised in Congress and they have not yet happened.  So I don't think I can speak to the US market until I see more action in defense of the industry by Congressional leaders, but I think the international opportunities are great and ", "I know that Bob is putting a lot of attention on those international markets and we are putting attention on the North American market too.  We have some great replacement tubes.  We're a high quality low-priced vendor in North America.  Our sales team is focused on using this opportunity to get us additional business in the North American market, but it's still a definite nasty headwind in that market.", "", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yeah. So to put it in context too, Junaid, I mean the tube orders were down single digits so it's not like it fell off a cliff, it's just that panel orders were up very significantly in the quarter and that's how we got 9% orders growth in x-ray.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "Right, gotcha.  And then Elisha I've got a couple of quick ones for you, did you have any order cancellations in the quarter on oncology?", "Elisha W. Finney", "We always have order cancellations in the quarter, but nothing that was unusual other than obviously the proton order that we took out of backlog, but well within our normal guidelines in the quarter for oncology.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "And then can you remind me how many shares you have outstanding on your share purchase?", "Elisha W. Finney", "In our share repurchase we have a new authorization that started with this calender year '10 of 5 million shares.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "All right, good enough.  That's all I've got for you guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings of Jefferies & Company.", "Josh Jennings - Jefferies & Company", "", "Hi, good afternoon.  I guess just a start on the SRS side or the Novalis TX side.  I mean, can you comment on the percentage?  I think you put that out there last quarter, the percentage of your orders that Novalis TX took on the total oncology number?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "I don't have that number and I don't think we release it every quarter, so I don't have that number for you today I'm sorry.", "Josh Jennings - Jefferies & Company", "Okay.  And can you share what your Novalis TX install base is out there at this point?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "You should have sent me that question in advance so I could prepare it.  I don't have that number.", "Josh Jennings - Jefferies & Company", "No problem.  ", "Timothy E. Guertin", "We think it's about 100.", "Josh Jennings - Jefferies & Company", "About 100, okay great.  And if you're looking at your customer base specifically on the freestanding center side, but maybe also thinking about your hospital customers and their ability to access financing and sort of how that's trending, is that improving as you move out into calendar 2010 and where are you at on that in terms of the trend there?", "Elisha W. Finney", "I am not aware of any significant issues on our customers being able to access money.  And as you guys probably know I have a customer finance team where we go out and facilitate financing for our customers and then we sell that to banks and to leasing companies and they are busier than ever and are getting lots of business off the street that way.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Yeah.  I haven't had any complaints from the sales department that we couldn't get people financing.  I will say we had an awards banquet the other night in which we give out awards to people who get leasing business, sales people who get leasing business, and I think there were nearly twice as many people getting awards this year than last year so that activity is way up, but nobody is complaining that they're having any problem doing it.", "Josh Jennings - Jefferies & Company", "Great.  And so would you say trends are improving or are they remaining steady as they have been in your fiscal Q4?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Well, the trend is improving clearly.", "Josh Jennings - Jefferies & Company", "Okay.  And then just back to gross margins on the oncology division, a nice three point move, can you break out between service and systems whether one was a driver or not and was there sort of an equivalent improvement there?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yeah.  Well, we saw gross margin improvement virtually across all of the product lines within oncology driven a lot by cost control measures that were put in place so over time and cost of quality measures, et cetera.  I will say the service area which has been growing quite nicely has seen a significant improvement in margins resulting from service software agreements where we're seeing those to our service organization and so service was a big contributor to that improvement, FX, as well as product mix on software.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "And I think we're watching our Ps and Qs on cost.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Absolutely.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "And I think that's making a difference for us.  I use the word cautiously optimistic when I gave guidance, we need to be careful during this period of time.  So although we are investing more and we have been in hiring mode for the positions we essentially need, we're going to continue to be careful until we see the situation show the kind of turnaround we want to see.", "Josh Jennings - Jefferies & Company", "Excellent.  Last question just on your RapidArc software and just your views on the competition out there in Arc therapy.  (Inaudible) VMAT offerings still seem to be having trouble getting out of the gates in the US and you have Philips who just introduced their SmartArc offering into the US and do you expect competition to increase?  You guys are the first to market leader and as was mentioned earlier the trends are that there is increasing demand potentially out there, but on the competitive side how are you looking at that?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Well, I think we've been in pretty good shape for the last two years in terms of what we introduced.  We brought our product to market, it was ready to go.  We'd done a lot of work to get ready.  Our competitors are starting to come out with their offerings and we'll get a better look at them over time to make the comparison.  So far our customers are calling me and telling me they still like our offering and they still think it's a superior offering which is good to hear.", "I will also say that we're a moving target.  We're going to introduce new versions of RapidArc and those new versions of RapidArc offer new features.  So we're not sitting still, we're not resting on our laurels, we're going to come out with new stuff that I think moves the bar ever higher.  So we have an edge there, that edge has helped us in gross margin.  I think that edge has helped us be competitive and we'll continue to move forward and stay as far ahead in the race as we can.", "Josh Jennings - Jefferies & Company", "All right, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "This concludes the Q&A portion of today's conference.  I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Spencer Sias.  Please proceed.", "Spencer Sias", "Thank you for you for participating.

My name is Madeska and I would be your operator for today. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) ", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Spencer Sias, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications; please proceed.", "Spencer Sias", "", "Good afternoon and welcome to Varian Medical Systems conference call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010. With me are Tim Guertin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Elisha Finney, CFO; and Tai Chen, our Corporate Controller. Tim and Elisha will summarize our results and we\u2019ll take your questions following the presentation.", "To simplify our discussion, unless otherwise stated, all references to the quarter or year are fiscal quarters and fiscal years. Quarterly comparisons are for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 versus the second quarter of fiscal 2009. All results are for continuing operations, which exclude the sale of the research instruments portion at XL.", "Please be advised that this presentation and discussion contains forward-looking statements.

A lot was happened since we talked about first quarter results, and I am pleased to say that we had a very good second quarter. To quickly summarize results, we reported 6% growth in revenues and 11% gain in operating earnings, and a 14% increase in earnings per share from continuing operations. I am especially pleased to report that net orders for the company grew 13% on the strength of the international business. Our quarter ending backlog grew 6%. ", "I\u2019ll now focus on operational highlights. Oncology system of the second quarter net orders grew by 10% to $476 million, with a 34% increase in international markets, and the 12% decline in North America. International markets accounted for 58% of oncology orders during the quarter, and these markets have now comprised the majority of oncology orders for four consecutive quarters.", "Net orders arose by about 70% in Asia, driven primarily by Japan, where we benefited from a government stimulus package. Net orders arose by 15% in Europe and order activity in Australia drove very strong growth than the rest of the world. ", "North American orders declined as a result of smaller hospital capital equipment budgets that were established in response to uncertainty related to healthcare reform and recession. For the domestic market to recover, we will need to see more hospitals move into new more normal budget cycles. Our outlook for the North American Market remains cautious. We hope to have a more optimistic view about this market in coming quarters. ", "Oncology solid net orders growth was also driven by our service business, as well as demand for our new accelerators. We saw increased demand for unique or new accelerator for fast affordable image guided treatments in international clinics and encouraging early interest in our new True Beam platform for advanced image guided radiotherapy and radiosurgery.", "Many of you participated in our official unveiling of the True Beam in New York two weeks ago. It was a highly successful event, and I am pleased to report that customer interest in this new platform is tremendous. During the quarter we booked revenue on two True Beam systems and recorded more than 15 orders for these systems, including some backlog conversions.", "We believe True Beam will be a real game changer in the fight against cancer, and we expect it to stimulate stronger demand for our surgical products, as well as fast replacement of older systems in our installed base, which now stands at more than 5,900 Varian machines.", "We believe that this is quite simply the most advanced radiotherapy, radiosurgery system in the world. Designed from the ground up, it offers an un-precedent combination of speed, precision, imaging capability, versatility and ease of use. It is a clinical tool that leading centers can use to develop new protocols, which expand the application and effectiveness of non-invasive radiotherapy and radiosurgery in the fight against cancer and other medical conditions.", "To sight just a few of the more significant features, True Beam offers up to a 2,400 monitor unit per minute dose rate, that can more than double treatment speed, and up to five fold reduction in the number of steps needed for imaging positioning and treating patients. Higher quality 3-D cone beam CT images that can be generated in under a minute, with 25% less X-ray dose to the patients. The ability to induce the patient in real time with every breath during the treatment.", "The world\u2019s fast first gated RapidArc capability, where clinicians can compensate for respiratory motion, even while the guarantee is rotating around the patient, 7 millimeter precision through completely inaugurated imaging and delivery components, up to 5 x-ray energy levels and up to eight electron energy levels from more tailored dose delivery, automatic accuracy checks every 10 milliseconds and a new simplified user interface with additional safety enhancements. ", "Reduce capabilities, as we believe True Beam has the potential to make a big difference in lung and liver treatments when speed and better motion management technologies required to improve precision.", "As an example, this platform can delivery an 18 gray gated RapidArc lung treatment that\u2019s nine times higher than a conventional RapidArc treatment in just seven minutes, nothing that we know off comes close to this capability. The True Beam automation we made it possible to deliver conventional five filed non-RapidArc IMRT treatment for the prostate or head and neck in a little over two minutes.", "With RapidArc, True Beam can deliver a prostate IMRT treatment in a little over a minute. As Dow Wilson says, this thing is Ferrari fast. Sufficed to say, we are all very excited to see what new treatments are going to be developed with this platform. Over the next several years we expect that this system could grow to between 30% and 50% of our new machine orders. ", "Initial customers for this platform will include early adopters and clinical pioneers in University, Hospitals, as well as international centers that need higher throughput. They will include centers that want the versatility to offer patients both radiotherapy and radiosurgery. For all of these customers True Beam offers the value of speed, that can enable them to generate higher throughput, lower cost per patient, improve patient comfort and reduce staff overtime, and shorten the patient waiting list.", "It also offers marketing value and health centers attract patients and recruit top clinicians and staff. Preparing this platform tops a broad line of clinical products for radiotherapy and radiosurgery, starting with Unique and going up to Clinac IX, to Trilogy, to Novalis Tx and finally to True Beam, and True Beam STX. ", "I am also pleased to say that the True Beam product development lead to a significant enhancement to our Clinac IX and Trilogy accelerators, which can now be upgraded, for example with RapidArc and other advanced motion management capabilities. This was also announced two weeks ago during the True Beam event. ", "Oncology has significantly refreshed its product line since 2004, with the introduction of Clinac IX, Trilogy, Novalis Tx, Unique and now True Beam. We have added RapidArc, the onboard imager and the new HT 120 and LCB shaper for high-resolution radiosurgery, and we are continually enhancing our software for true complaining and information management. With this line up, oncology has given itself an excellent set of platforms for growth.", "Turning to our X-ray products business, net orders for the second quarter were a record $1.5 million, up a remarkable 52%, versus the 17% decline that we saw in the year ago quarter, with solid gains in both tubes and in flat image detectors. We believe we are seeing signs of recovery in the global imaging industry. ", "Net orders for X-ray tubes increased by about 30%, as imaging equipment manufactures around the globe began returning to more normal ordering patterns. Net orders for our panel products rose by about 80%. We are enjoying very strong demand for our new line of radiographic panels and renewed interest in our dynamic panels. Our customers are commercializing new digital imaging systems and converting existing CR at home based imaging installation to digital radiography. ", "In our other business category, including our SIP, Security and Inspection Products business, our particle therapy business and our Gimson Technology Center, combined net orders for the quarter declined $9 million or 42% to $12 million. ", "In our particle therapy business we have resubmitted a bid in response to a revised public tender to a Skandion Kliniken in Sweden, with our photon therapy systems, and we continue to pursue other photon center projects that are in various stages of development. SIP net orders declined as the business experienced some timing delays in large orders.", "Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Elisha for a review of the numbers, and then come back to you with our outlook for the third quarter and the full fiscal year of 2010. Elisha.", "Elisha Finney", "Thanks Tim, and hello everyone. As usual I will walk you through the income statement, as well as cover a few balance sheet items. ", "Second quarter revenues of $586 million increased 6%. Oncology systems posted an increase of 4%, X-ray products posted a gain of 19%, and revenues from businesses under the other category decreased by $4 million or 19%. As a result of the weaker dollar, on a constant currency basis revenues grew 3% and net orders increased 10%. ", "The second quarter gross margin for the company was even with the year ago quarter at 43.4%, as the gain in oncology systems was offset by decline in our other businesses. Oncology\u2019s gross margin increased one point, to 45.2%, due primarily to higher mix of software and service revenue, and improved quality cost. X-ray products gross margin fell two points to 38.5%, due primarily to product mix in both our tube and panel business, and start up costs for our new radiographic panel. ", "Second quarter SG&A expenses were $80 million or 14% of revenues, a one point improvement from the year ago quarter as a result of ongoing cost controls. Second quarter R&D expenses were $39 million or 7% of revenue, equal to the year ago quarter. ", "Moving down the income statement, second quarter operating earnings rose 11%, to $136 million or 23% of revenues, up one point from the year ago quarter; and for the first half, operating earnings were up 15%. Depreciation and amortization totaled $12 million for the quarter. ", "Net interest expense for the quarter was $300,000. The effective tax rate was 32.6% for the quarter, down about two points from the year ago quarter due largely to a shift in the geographic mix of our earnings. For the first half, the tax rate was 33%, roughly equal to the year ago period. ", "For fiscal year 2010, we continue to estimate that the tax rate will be 31% to 32%. However, due to a timing of discrete tax items, we estimate that our third quarter tax rate will be around 35%. Fully diluted shares outstanding were approximately $124 million at the end of the quarter. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations rose 14% to $0.73. ", "Turning now to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $655 million, debt of $30 million, and stockholders equity of $1.4 billion. DSO or day sales outstanding for the quarter was an unusually low 76 days, an improvement of 11 days from the year ago quarter due to strong collection. ", "Second quarter cash flow from operations was $94 million, with almost all of it coming from net earnings. Primary uses of cash were $72 million to repurchase 1.5 million shares of stock under our repurchase program, and $12 million for capital expenditure. ", "Now, I\u2019m going to turn it back over to Tim for the outlook.", "Timothy Guertin", "Thanks Elisha. We now believe that revenues for fiscal year 2010 can grow by about 6% to 7% over fiscal 2009, and that net earnings per diluted share for the fiscal year could be in the range of $2.82 to $2.88. ", "We believe that for the third quarter fiscal year 2010, revenues could increase by about 13% over the prior year period. Third quarter operating earnings should increase by about 16% to 17%, but including our higher quarterly tax rate, net earnings per diluted share are expected to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.63.", "Thanks for your attention, and we are now ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Amit Bhalla - Citigroup.", "Amit Bhalla \u2013 Citigroup", "I wanted to start, first with a question on the overseas oncology business, and hoping you can give us with some currency growth rates for Europe, Asia, and the rest of the world, and if you go in to a little bit more detail there, because you said that the Japan government stimulus provided a boost. You talked about Australia, but you didn\u2019t mention China, where there are typically some quota limits. So I will really like to get some color there on the sustainability and strength in the quarter. Thanks.", "Elisha Finney", "Yes, let me go through and address the constant currency growth rate first Amit. So in Europe, the growth in dollars was in the mid teens. On a constant currency basis it was in high single digit 8% or 9%. These numbers are for oncology only. ", "In the Far East, we grew approximately 70%, and really very little effects from currency. It was close to almost 70% in constant currency as well. Then in the rest of the world, which is primarily Australia, again it grew about 70%, a little more than 40% in constant currency.", "Timothy Guertin", "So, speaking to what\u2019s happening, yes and Japan has had a very strong business as I said in the past. This happens periodically where a country will start ordering a lot more equipment as it tries to beef up its programs, and then those programs end, and then other countries tend to join in. ", "In the long run, we need more North American growth. We need North America to come back, because we can\u2019t expect Japan to keep this up forever, although I would certainly love it if they did. I think we can do better in China. I think we did fine in China. We certainly grew in China, but I think we can grow share in China, and we are not really doing that. So I think that we have an opportunity in China to do even better. ", "I think we are very strong in most countries. Certainly extremely strong in Australia, which has continued to be a surprisingly good location for many quarters over the last few years, and we had very strong in Belgium, Spain, and India as well. So this is not a one trick pony. We are seeing a lot of strong performance in a lot of locations. ", "I think True Beam is going to help us. Also Korea, we saw some good growth. So I think True Beam will help us going forward. We are going to have to get approval to sell True Beam in all the locations where people are going to want it, and so that will cause strong potential growth, especially I think in next year as we get those approvals. ", "So we have lots of growth potential internationally, but I still want the US market to show some strength. The US market has resisted showing strength, and I\u2019m hoping as those budgets that people set last year graduate this year and we see the new budgets come up for next year, that they are going to show some additional strength. ", "We\u2019ve had tremendous amount of interest from people. We\u2019ve had lots and lots of customer visits, and of course lately since the announcement of True Beam and little bit before that, people have come though to try and understand where we are taking our products, and whenever we show them True Beam they get very, very excited and all of that, whether they are a North American customer or whether they are an international customer, and all of that leads to believe that we are on the right track. ", "Amit Bhalla \u2013 Citigroup", "Tim just my follow up question is on the US market. You did say there was 15 True Beam orders in the quarter. Were most of those US? Then for the US market, is it just simply the fact that shorter cycle products are showing up in orders such as X-ray, but long cycle products like linear accelerators are just going to take a couple more quarters, is it as simple as that? ", "Timothy Guertin", "", "Well, I think we\u2019ve said in the past that imaging products tend to see recession sooner and then tend to come out of recessions sooner, and I think that what\u2019s your seeing from the imaging side. For oncology, because a lot of our imaging business is OEM business, we are selling to manufactures who are including our products in their businesses. So when they see increased growth potential, they pass those orders on to us. So sometimes it\u2019s a little opaque for us to see what their end markets are like, but clearly they are showing some strength, and that\u2019s emboldening them to give us larger orders.", "For oncology, we tend to be slow going in to recessions because capital budgets tend to stick around longer, and so we were slow to go in, and we\u2019ll be slow to come out as it takes a while for people to do that. We now know -- I guess we\u2019ll no longer call it healthcare reform, we\u2019ll call it insurance reform. We know now what insurance reform looks like, and so we are continuing to look at unemployment rates. ", "I think hospitals are doing that. They are calculating how they should manage through this, but I would say that we are seeing lots and lots of customers who are showing lots of interest, and I think pressure is building up in the North American market for people to turn the situation around; at least that\u2019s what we are looking for. ", "Amit Bhalla \u2013 Citigroup", "The True Beam question, just what was the split. ", "Timothy Guertin", "True Beam is mostly North America. I don\u2019t have a split for you, but it's mostly a North American things, and it's mostly new systems, but there is a few backlog conversions. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Vincent Ricci - Wells Fargo Securities.", "Vincent Ricci - Wells Fargo Securities", "First question is on SG&A, it's actually down year-over-year in terms of spend, and you talked about when the recession first hit, about trying to control spending and not wanting to turn the knobs on some unappealing valves. I\u2019m wondering if this is more in that direction or is this still just kind of holding back on spending.", "Elisha Finney ", "What\u2019s happening is that we are stating to anniversary. When we put some pretty stringent cost controls in place about a year ago, until it gets tougher and tougher to keep improving on top of that, I will say for the year as a percentage, you will see that based on our guidance, our EBIT margin should go up by about a point, and a vast majority of that is going to come from leveraging our SG&A expenses. So we are still managing to grow the SG&A expenses slower than the top line. ", "", "Vincent Ricci - Wells Fargo Securities", "And then in terms of also in operating expenses and R&D, we did talk about R&D probably drifting up overtime with care reform and what not. With the True Beam rolling out, how much of that can you see as a leverage point or are there other projects in the pipeline that will kind of fill that hole. ", "Elisha Finney ", "We have got a pipeline that will take us forever, and an unlimited number of dollars if we were to do everything. So I would say in terms of R&D it may go up slightly as a percentage of sales, but should still be somewhere close to 7% annual sale. So that means it's going up in absolute dollars and we have tons of projects to fill that up, but it will stay relatively flat as a percentage of sale, maybe a couple of days that points, 20,30 between top-up. ", " ", "Vincent Ricci - Wells Fargo Securities", "Just on last quick question; in terms of Asia and the Unique system, obviously that\u2019s a lower price point product for you. Can you talk to us qualitatively about volume what you are seeing in Asia, as that wouldn\u2019t be a great apples-to-apples comparison with the higher ASP trilogies and what not. ", "Timothy Guertin", "I don\u2019t have numbers for you today, but we are continuously getting interest in Europe as well as in Asia, and we announced this product and are still getting clearance in a lot of markets. So there are some markets we are not yet able take orders even though we have interest. ", "So I would expect that over the next few months you\u2019ll see those clearances happen, and I think probably I\u2019ll just report on that in future calls and let you know how that\u2019s going, but the funnel looks good for Unique. I think it's a strong product, it's well received and as we get more and more countries to give us permission to import it, we will be able to report more activity there. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Josh Jennings - Jefferies & Company.", "Josh Jennings - Jefferies & Company", "", "Just a follow-up on the Unique question previously, can you sort of quantify how impactful having the Unique system onboard was in order growth international. First four quarters you guys had that product out there.", "Timothy Guertin", "Well its significant for the low energy line. It didn\u2019t dent the high-energy line and that isn\u2019t stealing any business, but almost all of its impact is in Europe. So it's not a big factor yet, but for certain kinds of deals it was crucial. So the way we look at it is it's a product, it's a nitch product. ", "We are not expecting a huge amount of growth from it, because that\u2019s not what we invented it for. We invented it to solve the problem of certain kinds of customers who have limited capital resource, and who are trying to solve a problem for a particular set of patients, and we created it for them. So I don\u2019t think it's ever going to be a huge part of our growth plan, but it is an important part of our growth plan for a certain customer seg. ", "Josh Jennings - Jefferies & Company", "Jut on the North American side, with the pressure you are seeing in the US; how does the spending environment look still. Was there any impact at all with the pending True Beam launch in terms of maybe customers delaying at the end of the quarter. Did you see any of that, was that impactful?", "Timothy Guertin", "No, well we didn\u2019t make our official announcement until after the end of the quarter. Obviously some customers knew what we were up to, because there were lots of articles written by people, speculating on what we were doing, and so we had lots of interest, but I can\u2019t honestly say that we saw anybody delay a decision based upon that. Maybe somebody did, but I don\u2019t know. ", "Josh Jennings - Jefferies & Company", "Can you give us some color on the pricing environment that you are seen out there? Is competitive pricing played overall in this fiscal Q2 more so than in the previous quarters, or has it sort of stabilized. ", "Timothy Guertin", "Well I know my competitors deny it, but I think their pricing is getting more and more aggressive. I think they are cutting their prices in an effort to depend share, and I think that products like True Beam actually increased the pressure on them, and Unique the same way. It increases pressure on competitors, and I\u2019ve indicated this. ", "Our response in the phase of the recession or in the phase of price-cutting is to try to innovate. We innovate and product more options and more technology to try and hold and solve our customers problems. If we can introduce innovations that are clinically valuable, then that helps us defend against just a general trend on the part of people to try to gain share by cutting their prices in the midst of this. ", "True Beam is an example. If we can solve the problems of providing techniques that might improve cancer care, that are fast, that are very versatile and that are very easy used. If we can think hard about what our customers are trying to do to grow their business and provide them with tools that help them grow their business, it can make a difference. ", "If you look at us over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve introduced unique, Unique; we just did an upgrade, a refresh on the Clinac IX and then on the Trilogy; we introduced the True Mean, we\u2019ve introduced the HD120, we\u2019ve interdicted RapidArc and now gated RapidArc, we\u2019ve interdicted onboard inventory, we\u2019ve made multiple series of improvement to it, including now a better image quality and even lower dose and faster imaging than ever before and numerous software enhancements in our aria and eclipse product lines. ", "So all these things I think are making a difference, and it\u2019s why I think our numbers are looking good in many ways compared to other peoples numbers. ", "Josh Jennings - Jefferies & Company", "And just on the pricing environment, just with True Beam coming at a premium price point; are you seeing any pushback at all. I know you spoke about initial enthusiasm and customer responsiveness and interest, but has there been any push back in terms of premium pricing, in terms of the levels that True Beam SDX can come in in the True Beam standard. ", "Timothy Guertin", "No, I mean this is a very expensive machine, but our customers understand why it's an expensive machine. For one thing we\u2019ve added a ton of new capabilities inside this machine that people really like, but were expensive to implement, and I often will joke around here that we build this machine out of unobtanium and expensium, but it's kind of true. We put together a machine that is very able, but it is a machine with a lot of features that it never had before. ", "Overtime what we will try to do, as we always do is figure out how to build the same capability for less moment, but our customers understand that this machine that we just introduced is a very powerful machine. The most powerful machine I think any of then have ever seen or ever expected to see during there carrier, and so I\u2019m not seeing any pushback. I\u2019m sure they would love to see the price build up, but I think they understand why the price is where it is. ", "Josh Jennings - Jefferies & Company", "And just last question, sorry for it. Some through the volume here, but just coming out of the mid pack meeting from last week and in terms external beam treatments for prostate and SRS treatments for prostate. What were your sort of views in terms of the impact of potential changes in reimbursement, your status quo or any risk to any changes, and thanks a lot. ", "Timothy Guertin", "Going into the meeting we were a little confused as to what was going on, since we do know that prostate are well treated with these machines. There seemed to be two points to this meeting, one was to compare early stage treatment for prostates with active surveillance or watchful waiting, and I think that the general consciences was, there was not data there to support one over the other, and so they would like to see more date than that. ", "The mid knowledge is that there is a good evidence that higher dose rates improve prostate treatment, so that\u2019s good, but they want to see more clinical trails conducted and we agree with that absolutely. There needs to be more trials that gather this kind of evidence. ", "I think the second element to this is that there are people who are pushing for special reimbursement for [steriotatic] body radiation therapy for the prostate. I think the decision to this group; once that the evidence was not yet there, I think people are trying to get that evidence, but it was not yet, and so I think it makes it unlikely that there will be new courts added. ", "I think that TMS has indicated that there would not be a national coverage decision, and that means that reimbursement should be normal going on, but I do believe that the radiation therapy community as a whole and especially the research community needs to hear the message, but comparative effectiveness research is going to be the way things are done in the further, and that there needs to be more and more data, and this was short over the valve for radiation therapy and there is going to be one for every other device, and every other form of surgery, and every other drug. People are going to look at CER more and more, and this was the case for us.

From the time an order is placed to the time the box is instable, are you thinking that the cycle time to instillation from backlog is about average for your typical systems, so call it 12 months plus or minus. ", "Timothy Guertin", "Right now it\u2019s normal. It\u2019s what it would be for another linear accelerator. Dow has got his factory ready to deliver these machines. If the glorious event should occur that people will order more that we can deliver, then that answer will change, but right now I think we can handle the load. ", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "The presumption is that we\u2019ll have some groupings installed in the calendar year. ", "Timothy Guertin", "We do now. We have a couple now and more are going in as we speak, and I think that by the end of the year we will have quite a few installed, and I\u2019m hoping to have some great stories for you as to the kinds of things that people are doing. ", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "And then obviously the US market is still having kind of a tough go at it. Would you look at the freestanding customers? Is it your sense that perhaps the freestanding customers are still nervous; perhaps about purchasing oncology systems because of the dark fix, the potential 20% cut reimbursement.", "Timothy Guertin", "I think both hospitals and clinics declined from what we saw a year ago. Freestanding didn\u2019t explode into business when they got their reimbursement numbers. I might have hoped that they would, but I think everybody remains nervous, and even freestandings are using capital budgets that they set during a scarier time, and so we need a new budget cycle. ", "I\u2019m hoping that what\u2019s happened in the X-ray products and flat panel bodes well for OS. As I said, there is always a delay, and I think that the interest in True Beam is indicative that the people are going to go back and ask for capital budgets from their management and that\u2019s good. All of those things bode well, but I don\u2019t think freestanding clinics are going to be a source of strength for the next quarter or two either.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "Then Tim a last question for you. There\u2019s been a lot of noise on the FDA front regarding the 5, 10K process and possibly greater scrutiny by the agency on these types of application. In your conversations with the FDA, what type or what kind of scrutiny do you expect the agency to put into place?", "Timothy Guertin", "Well I think the FDA is trying to figure out what changes that it wants to put in place. Obviously, I\u2019m not speaking with the FDA directly, I\u2019m usually working through our organizations like AdvaMed and MIDA and people like that. So what I\u2019m hearing is that the FDA feels like its under pressure to increase the scrutiny, and they are trying to figure out how to do that without being unreasonable in the kinds of delays that they inject into the process. ", "The hazard here is that if they go too far, they could require evidence for things where the whole purpose of creating the new feature is to go get the evidence, and so if they require evidence before evidence is available, they could inject multiyear delays into the introductions of new technologies into the market place, and that would be bad. ", "But I will just tell you, the prices that people are paying right now are based upon the reimbursements that they get, so if the FDA delays approval of new products such that in order to use those new technologies, customers are going to have to do it under IRB and they are going to have to get patients to sign. I think patients will be willing to sign to use new techniques if they feel like those new techniques give them a better chance of survival or lower toxicity than they currently have. ", "So, I believe there is plenty of potential to harm the American healthcare system, and so we are doing everything we can to encourage the FDA to produce changes that won\u2019t slow the course of innovation. But at the same time I understand that the FDA is under tremendous pressure from newspaper reporters and politicians to take a harder line and with innovation, its all part of concern over healthcare costs in the United States. ", "I personally think its the wrong way to solve the problem of healthcare costs, but certainly that\u2019s something we will see. So, we are going to continue to work with AdvaMed. We have a very strong organization in Washington D.C. that can talk to the FDA and we can work through these organizations to try and influence change. I think we are going to see before the end of May, the first ideas from the FDA on what they are going to do, and I\u2019ll know more then.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeffrey Johnson - Robert W. Baird.", "Jeffrey Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "So, a couple of things here. I\u2019m trying to just look I think at the puts and takes here for North America. I think fiscal Q2 orders on the oncology side is probably softer than most of us expected. Your comments, you seem to suggest maybe the recovery probably isn\u2019t playing out quite as quickly as we thought, but then again, you also have True Beam here launching, which obviously got off to a good start. ", "The comps turned about 13 to 14 points easier on the North American side next quarter. So just trying to kind of get your big picture idea or thought on where North American orders -- do they stay negative over the next couple quarters or against those comps, especially do you think we get back to a little bit of growth before any kind of normalization of the market, maybe six to 12 months out?", "Timothy Guertin", "I think that the North American sales team has got some heavy lifting to do, even in the next two quarters. If not, it is true that we saw the first nasty signs of trouble a year ago, and that gives us a comp to work from but now we are still looking at capital budgets that were set last year. So I think things can improve in the US and I think that True Beam will help, and I think that some capital budgets are going to graduate, but for the rest of the year, I\u2019m not expecting miracles in the North American market and I think our sales team has got heavy lifting to do as I indicated. ", "So, I\u2019m very proud of all of our sales teams, but clearly I think that our international sales team has stepped up to the bar in a very difficult time in the US, and come through with some very strong business. We did what we told you we would do. When North America got into trouble, we turned our attention and we invested heavily in our international sales business, and we are continuing to do that. ", "In the long run, there are six billion people outside the US and 300 million people inside the US, and if they live longer outside the US, the vast majority of our business is going to start to come from outside the US, and that\u2019s what we have to expect. So over the long run, this seems reasonable to me that we are going to continue to see most of our growth in dollar terms. Those are heavily underserved market. The US market is reasonably well served, so whenever there is a recession, you are going to see people here, see that as a time to not move forward. ", "That being said, there is a very large number of people in the US who have old machines and who want to compete for patients, and who want to argue to patients that they are giving the very latest technologically. If you look at adds for hospitals, you will see them a lot of times now, they\u2019ll have a picture of an attractive physician and right next to the physician there would be some sort of fancy machine or other, and we want our fancy machine to be standing right next to them in those pictures. So they brag about what we do. That\u2019s good for us when they do that. So, I think technology is important in the ways hospitals behave. ", "So, there\u2019s lots of reasons for optimism in the North American market, but I wouldn\u2019t just say that because quarter three a year ago, there was a cliff that quarter three this year is going to be great, because I think there\u2019s still a lot of work to do in the North American market.", "Jeffrey Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Just on True Beam; if 15 orders in the quarter as you said, most of those are unused system, so it can mean maybe 10-12 new system orders or something like that. Somewhere in the neighborhood that probably implies approximately a 10% take rate or so which sounds pretty healthy for me for the first month or two out the door here. So is that a take rate that we could use going forward on new system orders.", "Timothy Guertin", "Yes, from your lips to God\u2019s ears. Obviously, we were pleased. I hope that the take rate goes up, but you have to remember there are early adopters and a little bit of this is early adopter behavior and so we will have to see. One point on our chart does not make a trend, I\u2019m going to wait until next quarter to draw that line for you, but I certainly was gratified to see it. I have to say its pretty darn good for not having introduced a product formally until after the end of the quarter.", "Jeffrey Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "I agree; and then Elisha a final question I guess just on foreign currency. In your guidance of 6% to 7% revenue growth for the year, that\u2019s up about a point or so versus prior guidance; how has your currency assumption changed in that guidance?", "Elisha Finney", "Well Jeff, I mean clearly in the first half we were helped by a weaker US dollar. As of today if I look versus the year ago period its kind of reversed itself. So its around a $1.32 today versus I think a $1.36 in the year ago third quarter. So when we look forward and get guidance on the top line, we are looking at the most current FX rates and then putting a band around that, since we don\u2019t know with certainty of course where its going to land, so that\u2019s why the 6% to 7% range that we gave on the top line.", "Jeffrey Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Understood there Elisha. I guess what I\u2019m looking for is last quarter 6% guidance versus this quarter 6% to 7%; you are obviously feeling better from an operational standpoint on revenue, but the currently headwind is probably also going to be a little bit bigger in the second half than maybe quarter ago you were thinking. So I\u2019m just trying to get my hands around; is this somewhere in the neighborhood of 1.5% raised to top line guidance when you neutralize currency, that\u2019s just kind of what I\u2019m looking for there.", "Elisha Finney", "Yes really, I mean because of the beat in the second quarter, you tack it on to the year. We are assuming a little bit of headwind on the FX. We had a tailwind in the first half, and it gets you into that range. So, I don\u2019t have anything more specific for you on that. We are looking at all sorts of things on moving delivery dates, etc., when we set that number.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan.", "Abigail Darby - JP Morgan ", "This is actually Abigail Darby in for Tycho this good afternoon. Just wanted to dig a little bit more into the trends in oncology and X-ray booking. It\u2019s obviously a strong quarter. You made some comments in the prepared remarks about visibility there with OEM customers. Could you talk about the outlook for that business for the remainder of the year? Can we extrapolate the growth trend or is there anything unusual about 2Q, potentially some initial stocking orders that might make that the strongest quarter for the year.", "Timothy Guertin", "Well, last year quarters two and three were kind of hellish for this business, and so I think Bob Kluge probably thinks that anything would be better than what he endured during that period, and certainly quarter two is a strong evidence that he\u2019s something turnaround. ", "I have to say quarter two was stronger for this business than I really would have expected, and based upon the general market conditions and so. I think I\u2019m optimistic. I do believe there will still be some bumpiness. I don\u2019t think the world has come back to normal here, but quarter two is a nice point to have on the graph. ", "We are seeing strong demand for RAD panels. We are seeing newer customers. We are seeing a lot of renewed interest in dynamic panels and tubes. We are seeing some signs of recovery in North America, so all of those things are good news, but nonetheless our customers make their decisions on orders, kind of a little bit in the last minute for many of those customers, and so I\u2019m not making a prediction, but I\u2019m saying certainly all the winds seem favorable, but that being said, I\u2019ve been shocked before, so we\u2019ll have to wait and see.", "Abigail Darby - JP Morgan ", "Thanks and then just kind of a follow-up on the True Beam commentary. You obviously made some comments on orders for the platforms. Could you talk about initial response of customers for interests and upgrades, either for gated RapidArc or the new X-tray tube from your Clinac installed base; any additional color you can provide that would be helpful.", "Timothy Guertin", "Yes, for gated RapidArc we are just rolling that out as an upgrade and so we will have to see where that goes. The initial signs from people who we are talking to are very positive, so that\u2019s good. It didn\u2019t have much of an impact on the second quarter, so this would be third and fourth quarter order impact, that\u2019s where we\u2019ll start to see it, and of course once again people have to have the budget. Even for upgrades they have to have the budget, so they have to go somewhere and get it. ", "So the trick is when you introduce something, for most institutions that just starts their process of going through their administration and asking for the money in order to put these things together, but nonetheless because we are seeing strong interest, I think that\u2019s good. ", "True Beam itself, I expect there will be some small amount of backlog. Certain customers will decide that they want to change, but I think most of that business, the vast majority of that business is going to be new business going forward, and of course we can\u2019t take a trilogy and turn it into a True Beam, that\u2019s not a modification we will ever be able to sell.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Dalton Chandler - Needham & Company.", "Dalton Chandler - Needham & Company", "Hi, just a quick guidance question here. If I\u2019ve done the math right, between the third quarter and full-year guidance, it implies that your fourth quarter revenue growth is actually going to be the slowest quarter of the year and in the low single digits. Could you just comment on the thinking behind that?", "Elisha Finney", "Sure, well Dalton again Q4 last year is really when we had relatively high sales. So the comparable got a little bit tougher. Its somewhat early for Q4. I\u2019m looking at Q3; we have very firm delivery dates on Q3, so we are giving you the best that we know at the moment with the current FX rates, but it really is just based on the fact that oncology and X-ray are tougher comps.", "Timothy Guertin", "We are 12 months out from the order issues in quarters three and quarter, but four for oncology from a year ago, so the units that were ordered a year ago are going to start to deliver, you have a reduction there. We have strong a comp on sales in the fourth quarter, so we are taking that into account, so for all of those reasons, we are being conservative and I think reasonably and rationally so.

My name is Tony, and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. (Operator Instructions) ", "I\u2019ll now like to hand the call over to your host for today Mr. Spencer Sias, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please proceed.", "Spencer Sias", "", "Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Varian Medical Systems\u2019 conference call for the third quarter of fiscal 2010. With me, are Tim Guertin, President and CEO; Elisha Finney, CFO; and Tai Chen, our Corporate Controller. Tim and Elisha will summarize our results and we\u2019ll take your questions following the presentation.", "", "To simplify our discussion, unless otherwise stated, all references to the quarter or years are fiscal quarters and fiscal years. Quarterly comparisons are for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 versus the third quarter of fiscal 2009. All results are for continuing operations only.", "", "Please be advised that this presentation and discussion contains forward-looking statements. Our use of words and phrases such as could, will, may, believe, planning, hope and expect, and similar expressions are intended to identify those statements which represent our current judgment on future performance or other future matters.", "", "While we believe them to be reasonable based on information currently available to us, these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of the important risks relating to our business are described in our third quarter earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this presentation and discussion, because of new information, future events or otherwise.", "And now, here is Tim.", "Timothy Guertin", "", "Good afternoon and welcome. I am please to report a strong third quarter which built on the performance of our first half. North American orders grew strongly after a year of decline and the overall international market including Europe continue to perform well. Net orders for the company grew 14% driven by a double-digit order growth in our oncology systems and x-ray product businesses.", "Our quarter ending backlog grew 7%, revenues rose 13% and operating earnings rose by 28% with the help of a healthy gain in our gross margin. Even with an expected substantial increase in our quarter-over-quarter tax rate, earnings per diluted share increased by 9%. New products played a major role in the success of this quarter and I will focus now on some of our operational highlights.", "Oncology systems third quarter net orders grew by 10% to $507 million with a 12% increase in North America and a 9% increase in international markets. International markets are countered for 52% of oncology orders during this quarter. Our cautiously optimistic view of the North American market was born out this quarter with order growths driven by hospitals. It is gratifying to see a large number of smaller orders demonstrating broad-based spending activity.", "While one quarter does not make a trend, we feel better about the North American market than we have for many quarters. In Europe, net orders increased 11% even with a stronger U.S. dollar versus the Euro as customers across the region continue to invest in new clinical capabilities and services. Growth in this region was led by the Netherland, Switzerland, Spain, Italy and the Middle East.", "And as you may have noticed from our early press release, India also contributed to this growth and our European region with one center placing an order for TrueBeam and five Unique. Far East orders grew by 9% mainly driven by good gains in China, Korea and Thailand while orders in the rest of the world declined by 6% primarily due to Latin America. ", "New products played a major part in our growth. Our TrueBeam platform for advanced image-guided radiotherapy and radiosurgery was a major contributor to order growth this quarter. More than 60 TrueBeam units have ordered since its introduction in April with the bulk of the orders coming from the U.S. We also booked multiple orders in Europe and our first order in the Far East.", "", "A significant number of the TrueBeam orders were upgrades from other machines already in backlog, but more than half were new orders. After years of development, it is very gratifying to see the strong interest and demand for this new platform, which we continue to believe will reach 30% to 50% of our new machine orders over time. ", "We exhibited TrueBeam at the American Association of Physics and Medicine Meeting in Philadelphia last week and customer reaction continues to be extremely positive.", "This response reinforces our commitment to providing clinics with versatile radiotherapy and radiosurgery tools that both advanced the quality of care and lowered the cost of treatment. ", "As you know, installations have been completed at several sites around the world and TrueBeam is already treating patients. For example, at the University of Alabama and Birmingham, doctors took just seven minutes to deliver a complex image-guided IMRT treatment for a sinus cancer patient to shrink his tumor and reduce the extent of surgery needed to treat his condition.", "", "With conventional platforms, this treatment would have taken 40% longer. Doctors there are expecting to complete treatment even more quickly as they gain experience with the platform and use more of its features; they plan to commence long radiosurgery within a matter of weeks.", "", "We hope over time that TrueBeam could also be a gain changer for liver patients as well. During the quarter, we also saw growing interest among international clinics in Unique, our new accelerator for fast, affordable image-guided RapidArc treatments and we continue to believe that this will be a major contributor to oncology\u2019s international growth.", "", "Oncology service business increased 18% in the quarter. As systems become more sophisticated and use more accessories for IMRT, IDRT and surgery, customers are increasingly calling on us to ensure clinical uptime, maintain their investment and keep their software capabilities current.", "", "Service now represents almost a third of oncology business and we see an opportunity to increase it further through geographic expansion as our installed base grows in international territories. To give you some basic facts about it, the oncology service unit employs more than 1700 people around the world; we have the highest density of clinically trained resources for education and clinical support for radiation oncology.", "Our primary education center at Las Vegas is the largest in the industry and we have two additional centers in Beijing and Zug, Switzerland. ", "We are holding a grand opening for another center in Mumbai in August. Our service parts and technicians are within hours of every Varian machine in the world, thanks to an extensive network of strategically placed depots and service centers, this is key to ensuring system performance and giving customers the confidence they need to buy Varian technology. Service is a tremendous asset for our oncology business as a growth driver and as a competitive advantage.", "", "Let me turn now to our x-ray products business, which had one of the best quarters in its history. This business achieved record operating earnings with the help of high shipment volumes, product mix and improved factory efficiencies, a stark contrast to a very challenging year ago. Revenues were up 52% and orders were up 26%, both driven by more than a 50% gain in our flat panel business.", "We are enjoying very strong demand for our new line of radiographic panels. We believe our customers are gaining market share and therefore stepping up production of new and retrofitted radiographic imaging systems using our panels. ", "We were also pleased to see strong growths for the panel business among dental, veterinary and industrial imaging equipment manufactures. X-rays performance together with positive reports from diagnostic imaging manufactures reinforces our belief that the global imaging industry may be recovering.", "In our other business category including our SIP, Security and Inspection Products business, our particle therapy business and our Ginzton Technology Center combined net orders for the quarter were $20 million, an increase of $11 million over a weak year-ago quarter. ", "SIP net orders increased due to demand from international border security market. In the U.S., the business continued to experience lackluster demand caused primarily by ongoing delays and did award challenges among competitors or a large government project.", "We believe that our SIP business will continue to face challenging conditions in the short term. The news was mixed for our particle therapy business in this quarter. On the positive side, Varian has been named as the equipment supplier for a new proton center to be built and operated in San Diego; once our customer completes his financing for this project, we will book the order. On the other side, the [Candy] and proton therapy center project in Sweden was awarded to a competitor and another competitor are now contesting this award.", "So now I\u2019ll turn it over to Elisha for review of the numbers and then I will come back to you with our outlook for the full fiscal year 2010. ", "Elisha Finney ", "Thanks Tim, and hello everyone. As usual I will walk you through the income statement, as well as cover a few balance sheet items. While Tim has already covered net order, I want to briefly talk about the constant currency growth rate. Net orders for the total companies were up 14% in U.S. dollars and up 15% in constant currency. Similarly Oncology net orders were one point higher in constant currency bringing its growth rate to 11%.", "In Europe, Oncology net orders were up 15% in constant currency and 11% on a reported basis as a result of the weaker Euro. However, on a global basis the impact from currency this quarter was fairly minor as a weaker Euro was largely offset by strong on Japanese, Australian, Canadian and Swiz currencies. ", "The company\u2019s third quarter revenue of $578 million increased 13% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Oncology systems posted an increase of 6%; x-ray products posted a gain of 52%, and revenues from businesses under the other category increased by $5 million or 37%.", "Third quarter gross margin for the company increased by 160 basis points to 44%, bringing the year to date gain to about one point, oncology systems third quarter gross margin declined slightly to 45.1%, due primarily to geographic mix ship for lower margin international deliveries. Year-to-date Oncology systems gross margin was up by more than a point to 45.6%, due largely to service volumes and product mix.", "X-ray products third quarter gross margin growth more than three point to $40.3%, due primarily to higher total revenues coupled with a higher mix of panel revenue and improved quality costs. Year-to-date, x-ray has increased its margin by about half a point to 40%, again due largely to a higher panel mix.", "Third quarter SG&A expenses were $85 million or 15% of revenues, and R&D expenses with $39 million or 7% of revenue. On a combined basis, operating expenses at the percentage of revenues improved by about one point for the quarter and for the year to date.", "Moving down the income statement, third quarter operating earnings rose 28%, to $131 million or 22.6% of revenues, up two and half point from the year ago quarter. Year to date operating earnings were up 19% and operating margin was up two points. Depreciation and amortization totaled $12 million for the quarter. Net interest expense for the quarter was $900,000 up from the year ago quarter due to lower rates on our cash balances.", "The effective tax rate was 29% for the quarter, up from the 17% rate in the year ago quarter, but still lower than we expected due largely to the timing of certain tax items. Year to date, the tax rate was 32%, up about four points from the same period last year. And for the full fiscal year2010, we continue to estimate that the tax rate will be 31% to 32%, bringing the fourth quarter tax rate to about 31%.", "Fully diluted shares outstanding were $124.5 million for the quarter. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations rose 9% to $0.74. During the quarter the company recorded a $6.4 million charge related to a discontinued research instruments business.", "Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $588 million, debt of $23 million and stockholders equity of $1.4 billion. (DSO) days outstanding for the quarter was 80 days, an improvement of three days from the year ago quarter. Third quarter cash flow from operations was $68 million bringing the year to date cash flow from operation to just under $300 million.", "Primary uses of cash were $116 million to repurchase 2.3 million shares of stock under our repurchase program and $31 million for capital expenditures, which included the final payment for a building on our campus. ", "Now, I will turn it back over to Tim for the outlook.", "Timothy Guertin", "Thanks Elisha. All together, we feel that quarter three was an excellent quarter and we are feeling better about the overall environment. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2010, the company\u2019s net earnings benefited from a shift and timing of certain tax items, but we continue to believe that tax rate will be 31% to 32% for the year. ", "For the fourth quarter, we are now expecting net earnings from continuing operations to be $0.80 to $0.83 per diluted share bringing the total for the full fiscal year to $2.90 to $2.93 per diluted share. We continue to believe that total revenues for the fiscal year could grow by about 6% to 7% like last year. I will give you guidance for fiscal 2011 next quarter. Thanks for your attention and we are now ready for your questions.", "Question-And-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla of Citi. Please proceed.", "Amit Bhalla - Citi", "Hi, good afternoon everybody.", "Timothy Guertin", "Hi Amit, how are you?", "Amit Bhalla \u2013 Citi", "Good, thanks. I wanted just to know about TrueBeam and want to see Tim if you could expand a little bit about what you talked about, you said some of these are backlog upgrades. Are these Trilogy upgrades and are you getting a significant price list from these upgrades?", "Timothy Guertin", "Well, yes. There will be an increased price when people go from a Trilogy to a TrueBeam. I don\u2019t have the exact, whether they were all Trilogy\u2019s. I would imagine that most of them were, but I don\u2019t actually know that. I just was breaking out the units that got an upgrade, so it\u2019s not a guarantee that all of them were Trilogy\u2019s, but most likely it was Trilogy buyers who were interested in getting the upgrades.", "Amit Bhalla - Citi", "Can you quantify that price list?", "Timothy Guertin", "No, I don\u2019t have a quantification of the price, but it is higher.", "Amit Bhalla - Citi", "Okay and then question on oncology orders overseas. The 9% growth was clearly good against a tough comp, but on a quarter-to-quarter basis it was down in absolute dollar, so was rest of world a little bit weaker than expected, maybe you could talk about that and also give the constant currency order growths for Far East and rest of world?", "Elisha Finney", "Amit, hi. Let me start with the growth rates in dollar versus constant currency. In Europe, it was 11% in dollars and this is for oncology versus 15% in constant currency. Just given the stronger U.S. dollar. In the Far East, it was 9% in dollars and 6% in constant currency, and rest of world was down mid-single digits in dollars and down around 15% to 16% in constant currency. ", "So what happened is obviously the Euro was a higher growth rate in constant currency, but that was largely offset by a much stronger Yen, Swiss Franc and Chinese exchange rates.", "Amit Bhalla - Citi", "But just on a quarter-to-quarter basis, is there any change in demand in these regions, because year-over-year you did grow but quarter-over-quarter, it looked a little bit weaker. So are there any dynamics you can tease out?", "Timothy Guertin", "No, I mean you are comparing quarter three with quarter two.", "Amit Bhalla - Citi", "Right.", "Timothy Guertin", "Yes, no that\u2019s just normal fluctuation in international territories. We did as well as we expected to do in the quarter and I\u2019m feeling good about international territories. The only international territory that I am a little worried about is Latin America where we just seen business get delayed, I think that\u2019s a general economic condition for Latin America, but so far I think the concerns that people have about European and Asian markets haven\u2019t been played out and I think China is looking quite strong.", "Amit Bhalla - Citi", "Okay, thanks.", "Elisha Finney", "Yes, and Amit just let me add, Europe was actually up from Q2, so it was largely other territories that did not grow as fast.", "Amit Bhalla - Citi", "Okay, great.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Joshua Jennings of Jefferies Incorporated; please proceed.", "Joshua Jennings - Jefferies Incorporated", "Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions here.", "Timothy Guertin", "Hi Josh.", "Joshua Jennings - Jefferies Incorporated", "Just a first on North American order building, quite a turnaround. A lot better than I expected or I had modeled. Just curious, you mentioned Tim on the call that it was primarily hospitals, but can you touch on what you are seeing in terms of capital equipment spending? What you are expecting, now that some of the fiscal \u201811 budgets are reset, and then also touch on any expectations for return of the freestanding centers after that reimbursement decision last November and where we are at there?", "Timothy Guertin", "Yeah. Well, just broadly, we are feeling better than we have for many quarters and I sort of made a few remarks about TrueBeam and RapidArc helping that, so we saw lots of small orders and that of course makes us feel good. ", "The funnel is looking healthy. Hospitals are growing a lot, I mean that\u2019s where we saw the strength, but freestandings grew up sequentially, but when you compare to year-over-year they have not recovered, but sequentially they did show strength. So I would have to say sequentially all the segments of this market showed strength, but we have yet to see freestanding come back to where it would. ", "But as I said the funnel is healthier. We\u2019ve looked at diagnostic radiology companies and they are showing better results in the North American market and as I\u2019ve indicated in past meetings, that\u2019s a good harbinger for us. Usually we experience a nine-month to a year delay from diagnostic radiology companies. So this is a little maybe faster than we have seen in the past and we are seeing a lot of activity in the marketplace, but having said that, one quarter is not a trend and I would like to see another quarter or two of this kind. ", "Well, I would like to see this continue for the rest of my life, but before I make any long-term predictions, I want to see at least another quarter to get a good feeling for it and I have to remember that a lot of the orders that we got a year ago where we were experiencing the problems in North America, those will now turn into shipments and so revenues are still going to be challenging for us, for I think a quarter or two, until we get past this. So this is very nice to see and I am hoping we see a lot more of these turn into early shipments. ", "In the past, you get these substantial delays between the time we get an order and the time we get a shipment and I\u2019m hoping that if there is any kind of pent-up demand maybe it will turn into earlier shipments, but we will have to see and that\u2019s one of the reasons why I\u2019m sort of -- I know that a lot of people would like to see me give guidance, but I really want to see another quarter and I want to see those delivery dates before I talk too much about 2011.", "Joshua Jennings - Jefferies Incorporated", "Maybe just touch on TrueBeam. You mentioned 60 total orders now, 15 in the first quarter. I just want to verify that there are 45 orders in the second quarter. Then secondarily, obviously that\u2019s a big number and have you driven any competitive wins where you\u2019ve sort of stolen customers post the launch of TrueBeam for one, and then for two, I\u2019ve been thinking about a run rate for TrueBeam. Is this sort of 45 per quarter something that we should think about or sort of a range of sort of 30 to 45 or how should we be thinking about order rate for TrueBeam?", "Timothy Guertin", "Well, I think that TrueBeam, there is certainly a substantial number of upgrades in the backlog. I don\u2019t think that that will continue at that rate. I think that new orders for TrueBeam will rise and I\u2019m not making any prediction for any particular quarter, but I think that any time you see a large bolus, a backlog upgrade, that\u2019s probably a bolus. So if you just think about the number that we gave you, I think that for new orders I think that I\u2019m optimistic that that kind of thing is sustainable.", "Joshua Jennings - Jefferies Incorporated", "Then maybe just one more for Elisha, just in terms of gross margin expansion here sequentially and year-over-year, was there any impact from currency in that gross margin expansion?", "Elisha. Finney", "There was very little in Q3. Again as the Euro was largely offset by the Yen and the Chinese and the Swiss, so very, very little impact in the third quarter. Again we expect full year to see margins up, gross margin up, close to about 50 basis points year-over-year and that\u2019s driven primarily by the mix of products.", "Joshua Jennings - Jefferies Incorporated", "Great. Thanks a lot guys.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Mark Arnold of Piper Jaffray; please proceed.", "Mark Arnold - Piper Jaffray", "Great quarter guys.", "Timothy Guertin", "Thank you.", "Mark Arnold - Piper Jaffray", "I guess just to follow up on something you just said Tim. It appears from your numbers and also from our channel checks that the early orders you are getting on TrueBeam may be shipping a little bit faster than your usual timeline, is that a fair characterization?", "Timothy Guertin", "I think the backlog conversions are shipping faster. The new machine orders are probably shipping roughly on usual schedule. It\u2019s just that I\u2019ve got my fingers crossed that we\u2019ll see that improve, because I think there is just strong interest and usually when you see strong interest, users will hustle a little bit harder to get those machines installed and so my experience tells me that that will happen, especially among the early doctors, but right now the change that we are seeing, the speed-up that you are seeing is mostly due to people who upgraded orders that they had already placed with us.", "", "Mark Arnold - Piper Jaffray", "Okay and then on the comments earlier about the freestanding centers in the U.S., it appears from our conversations with operators in that space that the acquisition environment there has improved quite dramatically, that the outlook is pretty positive to see some consolidation here in the back half of the year. Has that historically been a driver of technology upgrades and system sales?", "", "Timothy Guertin", "Well, I think there is a couple of free-standings that are the primary buyers for us and of course the largest ones I don\u2019t see as acquisition candidates, but maybe amongst some of the minor ones. I don\u2019t really know the answer to your question. I haven\u2019t really seen that as a factor in the past. Certainly, the reimbursement plays well for these folks and they just got to be doing well.", "So, we are kind of surprised that they haven\u2019t actually strengthened more than they have. We keep expecting them to strengthen more than they have, because they are in every position to strongly invest. So, they seem to be waiting for something and maybe that is related to acquisition behavior, maybe it\u2019s related to just wanting to see this year\u2019s reimbursement numbers, I am not sure but free-standings really ought to come back more bullish than they have based upon the environment that they have.", "", "Mark Arnold - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. Just a couple of other questions, one on TrueBeam, other than the U.S., can you just give us an update on where you have approvals to sell that TrueBeam right now?", "", "Timothy Guertin", "We can sell it in Europe, as well as the United States, it\u2019s going to take us longer for Japan, China and some Latin American Countries and I guess we can sell it in India as well.", "", "Elisha Finney", "Yes, anywhere were either FDA or CE market is recognized.", "", "Timothy Guertin", "", "And Canada will take a little while.", "", "Mark Arnold - Piper Jaffray", "And then just one last question, can you just give us any update on the proton therapy order in San Diego, are you still thinking that might be something that\u2019s booked in the - before the end of the fiscal year here and assuming that goes through the financing is in place, kind of what\u2019s the tentative schedule for booking that revenue?", "", "Timothy Guertin", "Yes. Well, I would love to book that in the fourth quarter, I\u2019ve made the decision based upon what happened to me at [scandium] that I\u2019m going to be cautious and so I\u2019m going to wait until the user has their financing in place, they are making good progress, this is a good customer, this is associated with scripts. I mean, they have every reason to go quickly, but I really wouldn\u2019t want to anticipate what their final schedule would be, we do have a substantial down payment from them.", "We\u2019ve commenced work in terms of our part, so I\u2019m feeling good about it, but exactly for the timing, I have to wait for them to walk in the door and say that everything is signed up before I will be comfortable giving you that estimate.", "", "Mark Arnold - Piper Jaffray", "And just one more question on protons. At our cancer summit earlier this month, we had another operator announce that they are going to use your system when they get the final go-ahead and financing in place to open up another proton center in the Midwest. Can you just talk about how you think over the next few years, is it something where you think we might see one of these a year, two of these a year booked and what\u2019s your thought is about the growth of protons?", "", "Timothy Guertin", "Yes, I am expecting two per year. It\u2019s a number that\u2019s achievable and I am expecting that some years it will be three and some years it will be one, but I am hoping that on the average I am going to get two for the next few years, and then we\u2019ll increase it I think to three and four as we get out of this economic climate that we are in, as its easier for these people to put their capital programs together.", "Elisha Finney", "And importantly with each of these we\u2019ll end up with a multi million-dollar service contract that will be an ongoing revenue as well.", "", "Timothy Guertin", "There is a good tail for these businesses. So, we have lots of partners that are potential partners that are talking to us. They are enthusiastic about what we\u2019ve accomplished. They like the technology and the RPTC is now treated. It has been very successful. Even though we haven\u2019t finished all the work that we plan to do there. In terms of numbers of patients, it\u2019s over 200 at this point. So we are feeling good about the progress in that center.", "We have been named as the preferred supplier at two European sites, Nester in Italy and Delft in the Netherlands and so I am hoping that those will close sometime next year and we can get going on those projects as well.", "", "Mark Arnold - Piper Jaffray", "Great, thank you guys.", "", "Timothy Guertin", "Thank you.", "", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Dalton Chandler of Needham & Company please proceed.", "", "Dalton Chandler \u2013 Needham & Company", "Good afternoon and congratulations on a nice quarter. ", "Timothy Guertin", "Thanks Dalton.", "Dalton Chandler \u2013 Needham & Company", "On a number of the conference calls with other medical technology companies there has been a fair amount of concern expressed about Europe in the second half and the governmental sturdy measures and so forth. Obviously you had a very good result in Europe this quarter, but could you just talk about your outlook there?", "", "Timothy Guertin", "Well, as we indicated it was a strong quarter for us, especially in India, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Spain, Middle East Italy and you notice I mentioned Spain in there. So countries that have economic difficulties are still buying and I think they consider health care priority, governments consider health care priority. So although I do expect some, and we are seeing news reports of posterity programs, I think health care is one place where countries want to make sure that they don\u2019t act in a way that harms public health.", "So I think we have every logical reason to worry about the behavior of certain countries in Europe next year. I don\u2019t think that you should necessarily assume that because certain countries are having a problem that all countries in Europe will behave in this way, but I do believe that the growth in European economies would have been better if they hadn\u2019t have these sturdy programs, but I am not expecting these places to fall off the edge of the world.", "Also, we\u2019ve done a lot in terms of speeding up our machines. These machines are faster and easier for customers to use, so that they can get more patients in a day. So for a lot of reasons I think we\u2019ve lowered the cost for patient on new machines, and a lot of these nations you have to remember have been less eager to replace old machines, than people in the US have been. I think the replacement rate for all the machines in US faster and I think that there are a lot of machines in Europe that are old and if we can get those machines out and replace with these new faster machines, I think it will make a big difference, plus the disruption is not as great as it use to be. ", "We\u2019ve now can shown that we can. The premium installation, that we\u2019ve installed these machines in two weeks, and that is I think a record for us and I think it makes it easier for customers to switch from an older generation machine to a new generation machine. Because they are no longer going down for two months while that happens.", "", "Dalton Chandler \u2013 Needham & Company", "Okay. Thanks a lot and congratulations again.", "", "Timothy Guertin", "Thank you.", "", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson of Robert Baird; please proceed.", "", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Thank you. Good afternoon all.", "", "Timothy Guertin", "Good afternoon Jeff.", "", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Hi, Elisha. Tim let me start with you, just on the True Beam side, not to beat that topic to death I guess, but historically what have you seen with RapidArc and maybe going back to OBI and all that. You asked kind of the driver for several quarters before Europe ramps up or how should we be thinking maybe how the gating of that plays out on a geographic basis?", "", "Timothy Guertin", "Generally in the past, when we introduce a new technology Europe follows about two years later. Now not the leaders the leaders they are not followers, they act immediately, but the early adaptors, but what I am saying is a number of countries act after two years. The reason for that just simply is their budgeting cycles contend to me multi year in character. So they have budgeted for a certain machine and even if we introduced a new machine they can\u2019t necessarily switch over. ", "So I would expect that if we\u2019ve introduced TrueBeam here in 2010 that we\u2019ll start seeing a wave of TrueBeams in Europe 2012-ish. Asia as you know, it various widely country by country, but I would expect in Japan, TrueBeam after we get approval, and where we can start actually taking orders in Japan, I think that you\u2019ll see that strengthen in 2000. Maybe if the winds blow with us and we get our approval at a reasonable time, you may start to see that in 2011 otherwise it will be 2012. ", "I think we\u2019re okay in Korea and I am not sure about Thailand and of course we have to get approval in China as well. So China will probably be mostly a 2012 impact, but the mix will be more towards TrueBeams in Europe, than it will be in China and most of Asia. In most of Asia I think that mix will change more towards 2013.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Alright, and I haven\u2019t thought of this, but what you describe in the two year lagging cycle in Europe, is RapidArc just still a ramping kind of driver of growth in Europe right now?", "Timothy Guertin", "Yeah, I have\u2026", "", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "", "We\u2019ve been about two years into that now right, two and a half?", "Timothy Guertin", "I am trying to remember where we are with RapidArcs in Europe. Yeah, we are two and a half years into it, you are right. I am looking at somebody who\u2019s sitting here with me. We are seeing RapidArc continue to rise, but I don\u2019t have a number for you for Europe. But we are seeing it rise, but I think we still our ways to go and also we are seeing interest in the developing world. China and India we are seeing a lot more interest there, because the speed of this really matters.", "I mentioned those unique orders in India, and this is why I think RapidArc is going to be important for locations like that. So I think RapidArc still has a lot of growth potential, but I should have come prepared with that number, but I don\u2019t have it.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Fair enough, and anecdotally didn\u2019t here anything at all. On the patient demand side I know you wouldn\u2019t typically think about that with cancer, but it sounds like diagnostics even has slowed down a little bit. That might be slowing that funnel down into the system. Anything at all on demand side?", "Timothy Guertin", "Patient demand, in terms of patients asking for RapidArc.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Patients just being treated for cancer. Again, you wouldn\u2019t think that that would be something that changes or slows with the economy, but we heard anecdotally maybe it have a bit?", "Timothy Guertin", "Well, I certainly think radiation therapy is a huge potential to grow. In the United States there is for example, for prostate there is a continued argument between those people who want to have radical prostatectomies and those are will have radiation therapy. But the fact is radiation therapy is the least invasive, least toxic way to cure cancer that there is of all of ones that are available and its extremely affected. So I think we are going to continue see that happened. ", "In terms of patients, what was seeing is and these tell us that they are able to do things with RapidArc, that they wouldn\u2019t be able to do for those patients any other way. I am not sure how that affected patient decisions, because all that clinicians are reporting to us is, that it enabled them to do something they weren\u2019t able to do, that they were able to give that patient a better treatment. ", "In some cases the patient was able to be treated with the radiation and they wouldn\u2019t have otherwise been able to be treated with radiation.", "So those are all good signs, but I don\u2019t have anything other than anecdotes to really flush that out for you.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Alright, fair enough, and then Elisha, two currency questions for you here. Just embedded in your kind of 6% to 7% revenue growth guidance for the year. Has the currency assumption just that you are thinking about within that number changed at all or is there a greater headwind from currency in that 6% to 7% reported growth than you maybe were thinking last quarter or has that stayed about the same?", "Elisha Finney", "Its about the same Jeff, so every time we would give an update on annual guidance, we are kind of looking at where have the euro and the yen been up to that point. So in Q2 \u201910, let\u2019s see we are at about 140 and the third quarter 130. So we are assuming somewhere around the 130 or so as we go into Q4 to get to that six to seven.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Okay and in Q4 EPS guidance, the 80 to 83, relative to my model that gating of the tax rate had about a nickel impact or so about. Is currency or is there anything else in that Q4 maybe acting as a couple of penny head wind or anything at all that we should think about besides getting the tax rate, that gating issue.", "Elisha Finney", "Well, it\u2019s a tougher comparable, as particularly x-ray started to come back in the year ago fourth quarter, oncology saw pretty significant growth as well, but I will bring you back to the year where we expect the gross margin to be up close to half a point. We are expecting about a point leverage on operating expenses, so we should be somewhere around the 23% ROS for the year, which would bring us up by close to one and a half points or so. ", "So again, we feel like we are heading into Q4 and it\u2019s on a strong note, it\u2019s just a tougher comparable and the euro is tougher. It\u2019s 1.30 today. In the year ago period I believe we were at 1.42. So that is having somewhat of an impact.", "Timothy Guertin", "The international mix was decidedly more international in the fourth quarter of this year than it was last year and payment terms internationally also effect the revenue recognition. So we have a number of head wins in the fourth quarter that are causing us to behave the way we are.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Alright, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks El.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JP Morgan; please proceed.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Good afternoon.", "Timothy Guertin", "Hi Tycho.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "I just wanted to dive into some of the other dynamics for the oncology business. I know you commented a minute ago about RapidArc in Europe. Can you just talk a little bit about where we are in the adoption curve here in the US for RapidArc specifically, and then if you can just comment on Trilogy and Novalis and whether those have seen kind of a drop off post the launch of TrueBeam.", "Timothy Guertin", "The RapidArc is heavily being adopted in the US and TrueBeam of course. RapidArc is pretty standard on the True Beam machine. So we are seeing a lot of activity in terms of RapidArc in the US. We aren\u2019t giving you at this call, we are going to reconsider that in a future call. We are not giving you a take rate on this call for RapidArc, but all I can tell you is it\u2019s just that the acceptance of RapidArc is enormous. ", "We get constant and continuing and ongoing feedback from physicians that they love it and that they are embracing it and some of our customers of course that didn\u2019t use our treatment planning system have had to wait for other people\u2019s treatment planning systems to do it and I still think we have a huge lead there in terms of the performance of the cliffs, and RapidArc planning versus volume metric modulated Arc therapy planning for some competitive systems. ", "So I think our system works really well and those people who adopted it on the treatment planning side and on the clinic side are doing extremely well. But as I said, RapidArc will be standard on the TrueBeam and so I expect that as TrueBeam grows it will just increase the acceptance of that. ", "In terms of the impact on trilogy and Novalis, we will have a Novalis version of the TrueBeam product and so I don\u2019t think we have hurt that, and I think that the trilogy, I would expect that some people who wanted the trilogy will now -- you could say that hurts the trilogy, it doesn\u2019t hurt us if they go from a trilogy to a TrueBeam, but in terms of the absolute numbers of trilogy, I would expect that number to go down and the numbers of TrueBeams to go up.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay, and then can you talk a little bit about the mix of application area, your clinical treatment area for the early adopters of TrueBeam. I think you mentioned liver in your comments, but how do you think about prostate versus potential lung longer term and where are you seeing the early utilization of this system.", "Timothy Guertin", "Well, you know I think that people are going to use TrueBeam for lung more often, because of the capability on it. It\u2019s called IMR, which is the ability to take images while the patient is on the table and see whether or not we are staying on target and the way that we plan. So I think for both liver and for lung, that capability would be useful and we\u2019ll start to see more and more applications for that. ", "I also believe it will be useful for prostate. Whether or not it will be clinically valuable remains to be seen I think it will prove to be clinically valuable for us. In prostate we will have to wait to see what the studies have to say, because we are already pretty good at positioning the prostate, and the results for radiation therapy for the prostate are really very good. So it\u2019s quite hard to believe that we\u2019ll see a huge improvement there in terms of survival. ", "In terms of toxicity however I am kind of interested, because one of the things that our customers would like to do is be able to conformably avoid the rectum. Recto toxicity is one of the things that physicians would like to avoid and I think that a number of clinicians that we talked to are interested in seeing if they can use the capability of TrueBeam to attack that problem, so I think that would be interesting. ", "Then we will have to see, the TrueBeam is so fast that for hypo-fractionated treatment that enables you to treat those relatively quickly. The papers really that we would like to see for hypo fractionated prostate haven\u2019t happened yet, and when those papers start to come out we\u2019ll know whether or not there will be a large shift there. ", "If there is, that\u2019s good, because I was talking to somebody just yesterday, who was talking about a relative who chose to have a radical prostatectomy rather than radiation therapy, because they lived an hour away from a major city and they didn\u2019t want to have to go in for 30 or 40 times to be treated, so they chose surgery instead even though surgeries will keep them from driving and will have numerous other side effects that were nastier, but that was the decision that they made. ", "So if we can discover that hypo fractionated radiation therapy for the prostate treatment is five days, six days, ten days, something like that turns out to work really well, then we may see a lot of those patients, especially early stage patients chose radiation therapy, because the other toxicities are just so low compared to surgery.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "And then one of the things you noted at the launch was the developer mode function. I guess how do we think about new application from users as part of the developer role?", "Timothy Guertin", "We have a huge amount of interest and this is a constant topic of conversation around here. People, they want to go as quickly as possible from developing something and doing physics test on it in the clinical mode and so they are putting tremendous pressure on us, that take the things that they learn in developer mode and put them in the clinical side of the machine. So it\u2019s painful for us to have to delay the clinical availability of any feature, but that\u2019s what we have to do. We have to be prudent when we introduce new things. ", "So we have unlocked the imagination of our customers with the developer mode and I expect them to put a lot of pressure on us, to speed up the way in which we move those features into clinical modes of the machine.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay, two other quick ones, maybe one for Elisha, on margins as we think about mix of upgrades and new placements on TrueBeam, are you able to comment on margins on the relative contributions from both upgrades and new systems for TrueBeam. How should we think about it contributing to margin in the next year or so?", "Elisha Finney", "Yeah, well looking into Q4, looking for the fiscal year Tycho again about half a point, we are going to see improvement in both oncology, that\u2019s going to come primarily from product mix. Improvement offset somewhat because the geographic mix is actually hurting us a little bit in oncology, as they international has been growing on the revenue side much stronger than the US. ", "X-ray margins will be up about half a point as well. We are going to see some margin decline in our SIP business. So going forward I mean True Beam and software and service are all enhancer to our growth margins. So it will be heavily dependent on mix as we move into FY11.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay and then just lastly, anything coming out of DC from kind of the regulatory prospective, you know going back to some of the quality issues that were raised earlier in the year. Are you seeing any pressure from our oversight just for medical physicist and how do we think about where you\u2019re headed in to DC.", "Timothy Guertin", "Well, there were a number of meetings that were held this quarter to discuss this problem and what might be done to improve quality the assurance and the safety and design, and I think the field is still in the phase of trying to figure out what all of the approaches they should take. What we have recommended is that over time we need to make the process of quality assurance just before a patient is treated to be more complete. That is, we propose some sort of time out that occurs. ", "Time out is a term that\u2019s used by surgeons. What it means is that everybody sits down with the patient and just before the surgery begins, and we would do the same thing for radiation and look and make sure that everything is consistent with what they thought and the question is what software tools, can we in hardware capabilities can we put on the machine that will make that process easier for them to do. ", "So, we are in discussion with APM and other organizations to see how that might be done. Radiation therapy is I think if you look at the medical field overall you will see that our customers have done a very good job, but nonetheless incidents continue to happen, and none of us are ever going to happy until that incident read as zero, and to do that, I think we have to recognize that radiation therapy planning and treating is a very complicated process and that by putting more QA at certain points in the process, especially just before patients are treated with a new plan, I think we can make a lot of progress towards improving safety. ", "So, that\u2019s what we focused on, we talked to the FDA about it and they are very receptive to this idea and they are encouraging us to proceed with it and we have talked to users about it and they are encouraging. I think that as our customers are not monolithic there is obviously going to be lot of opinions about this and some of them are going to want more from us and others feel that we have already done enough, but we will never be satisfied as long as there is even a single injury reported to us.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Fair enough. Alright, thank you very much.", "Timothy Guertin", "Thank you ", "", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Amit Hazan of Gleacher & Company. Please proceed.", "Amit Hazan - Gleacher & Company", "Good afternoon guys. Maybe, I\u2019ll just start with guidance in the fourth quarter, just looking at the revenue guidance kind of the imputes implied revenue guidance if you will. It doesn\u2019t look like there is much improvement there year-over-year even though you have a new comp, for say it doesn\u2019t look too thought for you from last year. Is there anything going on there that we should be thinking about?", "Elisha Finney", "Amit I apologize, I missed a little bit about our volume, didn\u2019t seem to be up. Let me take a stab at it and come back if I don\u2019t answer your question. On the revenue side, it\u2019s really just a function of the orders decline in the year ago period. Again it\u2019s still 6 to 7 for the full year, but it\u2019s going to be in the low single digits in Q4 once you pencil out the guidance there. ", "We saw a recovery in the year ago fourth quarter, x-ray started to grow; oncology had a strong quarter as well. So, a little bit of it has to do with the comparable, the dollar and the Euro exchange rate plays into that, but it\u2019s really just looking at customer requested delivery dates and I think more of a reflection of orders decline in a year ago period. ", "So it\u2019s going to take us a quarter or two to work through that, because as you know the average timing backlog is about 12 to 15 months or so.", "Amit Hazan - Gleacher & Company", "Then just to push a little bit on the operating margin side, it\u2019s been very good all year. I recognized the comp issue from the prior year, but even if I am looking at the quarter that you reported this fiscal year, it doesn\u2019t look like you are looking for much of an improvement in operating margin, even though obviously in the September quarter your revenues are going to be significantly higher than they were anytime during the year. ", "So, I am wondering the higher revenues are not turning in terms of guidance, they are not looking like they are turning into better operating margins for the fourth quarter than it\u2019s been in any quarter this fiscal year and why that might be.", "Elisha Finney", "Amit, it\u2019s a very fair question. Again it\u2019s just looking at the particular backlog and the geographic mix, the product mix, the mid on payment terms, the currency rate, just taking all of those things into account. I think if you were to look back over last year we went from 19% to 22%, 24% ROS in Q4. So we\u2019ve got a tremendous improvement in Q4, so it just makes the comparable pretty tough as we compare it to the year ago fourth quarter. ", "So, again it should pencil out to right around 23%. For the full year it\u2019s getting close to a one and half point improvement. So, I would just encourage you to focus on the year and not to draw too many conclusions from a single quarter.", "Timothy Guertin", "It\u2019s just a single quarter, there is just a lot of things effecting the single quarter in terms of international mix and in terms of the way people are going to pay us internationally, the particular structure of those deals and how we are going to get paid, and when we looked at the detail from the bottom up, this is how it came out. So, don\u2019t draw any conclusions about 2011, we still think the year came out great, but quarter four is going to be tougher for us than we would have liked it to have been.", "I think we have a little timing benefited in quarter three that may have hurt us a little bit in quarter four as well.", "", "Amit Hazan - Gleacher & Company", "", "And Tim, may be I can just follow up with you on one question on guidance, which is fiscal year \u201911. This has been traditionally the quarter that you give guidance every year, and we recognize last year obviously had a lot of issues, and you chose to wait, but it sounds like the way you are describing your business is a lot better than it\u2019s been in a while. But you chose to delay fiscal \u201911 guidance and I think what you said was that you want to see another quarter of delivery date to figure out basically. Can you just expand on that?", "", "Timothy Guertin", "Right, I want to see what North America does in the fourth quarter, I want to see what the dates are in those orders. I want to see what the European and Asian numbers look like in the fourth quarter. I think Europe and Asia have held us up this year and so now we are starting to see a disproportionate amount of our business go international versus the U.S. ", "So, the mix in 2011 right now is very hard for me to predict, and if I have another quarter of U.S. orders I\u2019ll understand the mix between U.S. and international. Much, better also I\u2019ll know a lot more about TrueBeam, and TrueBeam pricing going forward and what the rate is and then I want to get some predictions on that we\u2019ll get TrueBeam acceptance and so that we can sell in certain countries that we can\u2019t sell in right now. ", "So, there\u2019s just a lot of things that I\u2019ll know three months from now, but I don\u2019t know today. Let\u2019s face it the world is not all that great yet, and I want to see that how things economically look. But that being said all the indications that I have for us are good, but it\u2019s just better for me to have that backlog to look at.", "", "Amit Hazan - Gleacher & Company", "Okay, that\u2019s great. That\u2019s very fair. And I just want to, I guess add my TrueBeam question I suppose, but before I do that, I just want to may be just set it up by first understanding in the U.S. market, if you actually saw unit orders up in North American, if its systems orders were up, you usually give us a sense not a number, but just a sense if there up low single digit or something like that?", "", "Timothy Guertin", "Yes, we are looking it up now. ", "Elisha. Finney", "", "Its up.", "", "Amit Hazan - Gleacher & Company", "", "So, for TrueBeam, I am more interested in the new orders side of that for you, and wondering who the buyers are if they are replacing older SRS systems or actually regular [Linux] number one, and then may be number two, are they buying TrueBeam in lieu of may be having plans by Novalis or Trilogy if you add some color on that or if you actually able to convert folks that we\u2019re going to buy a traditional Linux and are now with TrueBeam really stepping up to buy that new product. I how that makes sense?", "", "Timothy Guertin", "We are seeing customers across the board being interested in TrueBeam. We are seeing a mix of early adaptors and clinical pioneers, and clinical pioneers aren\u2019t all at university hospitals. We are also seeing university hospital showing interest, we are seeing international centers that need higher true-put, and what to do clinical research. ", "People, who want to do both traditional radiation therapy and stereotactic radiosurgery, are interested in TrueBeam, and a number of customers who want a market advanced clinical capabilities, see the TrueBeam has something that they can have that will help them competitively, and we are also talking to surgeons who want to offer a lot of more non-invasive options for the patients. ", "As I said, I think that eventually TrueBeam will constitute 30% to 50% of our sales, which means that in units that will go up and the other machines will go down, but in overall terms, I think it\u2019s the best for the company.", "Did I come close to answering your question or did I mess it? ", "", "Amit Hazan - Gleacher & Company", "", "You did. It was good, it was kind of going after something that I always thought it was your biggest opportunity with TrueBeam which is are you getting folks that are perhaps looking at traditional equipment, your regular [Inaudible] equipment in making the leap to buy a TrueBeam which is obviously a bigger ASP benefits. That\u2019s what happening with your new unit sales or if its mostly folks that have been focused on the Novalis or Trilogy in the past.", "Timothy Guertin", "No, we are seeing people who would have bought maybe a more bread and butter machine go for TrueBeam as well and we have seen some competitive conversions as well. So that\u2019s just very nice to see. I think at the high end of the market this is helping us.", "Amit Hazan - Gleacher & Company", "Okay great. Thanks very much.", "Timothy Guertin", "Thank you.", "", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Michael Matson of Wells Fargo Securities; please proceed.", "", "Michael Matson \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Hi. Obviously I am a little bit new to the story here, so I apologize if this is a question that you\u2019ve gotten and addressed before, but I am just wondering, with TrueBeam having greater capacity to treat more patients in a shorter amount of time, how do we really think about that sort of affecting your installed base overtime, and is it priced at a level from a revenue standpoint, that if you saw few of the systems than you would have some of your other systems that you\u2019ll still make as much or more revenue from that.", "Timothy Guertin", "Yeah. The answer to that Michael and by the way welcome, is different for different areas of the world. I will begin by starting outside the US and pointing out that outside the US the world is still grossly underserved in terms of the number of machines that are required to treat cancer patients today, let alone where we are going. ", "I think I\u2019ve used these numbers before, but in the United States there\u2019s about 13 machines for a million people, in Europe its about 4 to 7 machines per million people and in China its less than half a machine per million people. So China literally needs thousands of machines to be where they need to be and furthermore if we turn out to be effective against more and more types of lung cancer which is of course what we are trying to do and getting them treated with radiation rather than surgery, I think that radiation will be very important for world health outside the US.", "So I don\u2019t see any other things that we are doing in terms of throughput hurting us internationally. Instead it will encourage people to look at radiation therapy as a cost effective way of treating these patients. The actual cost per patient internationally is quite low. ", "In the US there are multiple things, some winds are blowing north and some are blowing south. In the north, generally yes there are a lot more machines in the US, but a lot of those machine are old, are 10 years old, they have very low throughput, they don\u2019t have a lot of the modern features that we like to see, and of course, we are constantly adding new features that enable patients not just to be treated more quickly, but to make sure that they are treated in exactly accordance with the physicians intent. So I think there is a lot of reasons for people in the US to want to replace those older units. ", "Also, we have done some math that shows, as we see an increase because of the aging of bloomers over the next few years, we might expect this number of machines per million people to raise to 14 or 15 in the US. ", "Now working against that is hyper fractionation and the fact that we can treat people, but what you have to remember a lot about a lot of radiation therapy departments right now is that they run long days. They don\u2019t run eight-hour days, they run ten-hour days or twelve-hour days. ", "People are having to come in at night in some cases to be treated. If we can just get those machines down to where most people can be treated during the day and minimize the overtime for staff, that\u2019s a real cost savings for staff. So don\u2019t think of it in terms of the machine was in use for eight hours and now its going to be use for four. It\u2019s more like these machines were in use for ten hours and now they are going to be in use for eight and so, all of these technologies will I think help there. ", "Also I think that there will be pressure on cost, on hospitals and hospitals are going to be motivated to try and treat people for less cost per patient. So I think that\u2019s very important in terms of people being willing to upgrade these to new technologies.", "So although the number of machines in the United States is higher than it is anywhere else, and hyper fractionation would encourage you to believe that a certain per certain, not majority, but probably may be 10% of patient could benefit from hyper fractionation, those affects will happen, but I think the other effects will out weigh it.", "Michael Matson \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Alright, that was very helpful. I guess a question on your guidance. It looks like if my math is correct, on your EPS guidance you beat consensus by about $0.10. It looks like you beat the high hand of your guidance by about $0.11, but your only raising guidance at the midpoint by about $0.05 or $0.06. So is that just, are you just being conservative or do you expect something to sort of change there, that maybe the fourth quarter is going to be a little weaker from a margin standpoint or something.", "Elisha Finney", "Michael most of that; $0.6 of the beat in Q3 was tax related and it just had to do purely timing of discreet tax items and that will now move into Q4. So Q4 tax rate is going to be lower than we have first anticipated, Q3 was a little higher than we thought, so that\u2019s the main reason.", "Michael Matson \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Alright, and then just one final question on the non-oncology businesses. Just given that we\u2019ve kind of seen sort of an economic cycle have an impact here, things kind of slowed down last year and they are picking up again. I mean how do we really think about these cycles in the x-ray and other business.", "Timothy Guertin", "Yeah, it is interesting if you look how the economic cycle affected oncology versus everybody else. Oncology, the economic cycle mostly effected North America, it didn\u2019t affect us internationally really at all, which is one of the reasons why I said we are feeling better this quarter than we have in the past, because as North America comes back we are not seeing the effects in Europe that other people are predicting, at least not so far. ", "X-ray was definitely hurt, because diagnostic radiology was hurt and also people I think reduced their inventories. So as orders were hurt for diagnostic radiology and as people reduced their inventory requirements that we have kind of a doubled whammy for that business. ", "Now as diagnostic radiology comes back, I think we are seeing Bob get more business, which is why you saw this revenue up 52%, orders up to a 26% number. That panel sales themselves are up 80% and tube sales were up 30, so this business is really firing and that would give me a lot of optimism for the behavior of the diagnostic business. ", "Security and inspection I think is going to have a tougher time, especially in the US. I think this is the kind of place where economies are going to pull back. Its on infrastructure development, and weirdly I know this seems counter intuitive, but people are pulling back on security. You would think this is a very dangerous world and they should spend on security. ", "So I think the largest negative wind we are experiencing in this company is going to be in the security business. I am hoping to get past that within the few quarters. I certainly think it\u2019s making it more trying for this business, and then also we often joke with Lester Boeh who runs this business, that he is the Vice-President of business that gets protests. Because every order that we see lately, all of these large orders have huge amounts of protests and so I think it\u2019s been tough for them. ", "So x-ray I think we are seeing a return, I think oncology we are starting to see a return. We\u2019ll see how that goes in the next quarter, but we are starting to see a return. I think security is going to have a harder time, and I think probably protons, this was a head wind in terms of getting financing for proton centers. I think it slowed down the process from what it was in previous years, but it is injected a delay and I think we are starting to see these projects now start to come to a fruition, so that\u2019s good. But in security we have had no incidents. ", "Basically our borders have been pretty safe and there has been nothing in the headlines that has pushed this issue, and if there are more issues in the headline then maybe we\u2019ll be seeing this thing turn around.", "Michael Matson \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "", "Alright, that was helpful.

You want to know where they are or just the number?", "Sean Lavin - Lazard", "Numbers are good enough for me.", "Timothy Guertin", "Okay.", "Sean Lavin - Lazard", "You\u2019ve hit most of my questions, so my only other one is I guess looking at your guidance it looks like earnings are going to grow about 10% this year and I have assume most of that revenue this year has come from orders that are placed during a very difficult economic. Is it reasonable for us to think that earnings in a normal economy is long term going to be a team grower.", "Timothy Guertin", "Well, for years and years I felt that this business should grow and can grow north of 10% and can grow as high as 15%. So I would have to say in a normal economy, you will have to tell me when we are going to see normal, but I think it should be possible for us to grow in the 10% to 15% range and when things are stronger, I don\u2019t think normal, but stronger it will be more towards the 15% and normal will be more towards the 10% to 12% range.", "Sean Lavin - Lazard", "Great. Thank you very much and congratulations guys.", "Timothy Guertin", "Thank you and I do want to correct myself. We have eight sites that have completed installation, not all of those are clinical.

Good afternoon and welcome everybody. Today we are reporting our results of the first quarter of fiscal 2011 with strong growth in margins and earnings and solid gains in revenues. We had double-digit net order gains for our x-ray products business and moderate growth for oncology systems, which great well in most regions with the notable exception of Japan. Revenues rose by 7%, or 8% on a constant currency basis, with a remarkable 62% coming from international regions. Our operating earnings increased by 15%, reaching nearly 24% of sales. Net earnings for the company increased by 22%, and earnings per diluted share rose by 27%.Our quarter-ending backlog expanded by 10%, reaching a record $2.2 billion. As discussed in our last call, we'll talk about net orders within each business unit rather than for the company as a whole. ", "Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $138 million, and we ended the quarter with a record $704 million in cash and cash equivalents. All in all we're in excellent financial shape, and our global outlook continues to be optimistic.", "I'll focus now on orders and operations in each of our businesses. Oncology systems first quarter net orders totaled $459 million, up 5% with a 20% growth in North America and a 6% decline in the overall international market. Oncology achieved double-digit order growth in North America for the third consecutive quarter with the help of new products, higher unit volumes, and some recovery in the healthcare market from the year-ago periods. European net orders grew in double digits with particular strength in France, Russia, Denmark, Austria, UK, and the Middle East. Orders in Asia fell sharply because of a $45 million decline in Japan, which has returned to more normal spending patterns following a two-year stimulus program that ended last March. Excluding Japan, orders in Asia were up in double digits. As our longtime followers know, this business typically experiences regional lumpiness, but the underlying global need for high quality, cost effective cancer treatment capacity is tremendous. We remain confident in the overall strength of this global market and our business.", "From the product perspective, TrueBeam was again the leading growth driver for oncology systems. As of the end of the quarter we had more than 170 orders for this state-of-the-art radiotherapy radiosurgery platform since its introduction in the second quarter of last year. It comprised more than 30% of global unit orders for high-energy machines during the quarter, and it represented a majority of the high-energy machines ordered in North America during the period. Installations of TrueBeams are proceeding smoothly with more than 40 installations complete or in progress. ", "As clinicians gain experience with this new system, we are seeing tremendous treatment possibilities. One center has already treated more than 220 patients, most of them with hypofraction radiosurgery for paraspinal lesions. Another center is routinely performing normal time-consuming radiosurgery on up to 10 patients per day using RapidArc and high-intensity mode to deliver doses quickly and precisely. In one such case involving metastatic cancer, this medical team took just six minutes to complete delivery of an 18 Gray radiosurgical dose to a spinal lesion. RapidArc upgrades also contributed to the oncology order growth during the quarter, as more clinics moved to modernize existing equipment to streamline treatment processes and increase their capacity to help more patients. ", "Our service business continued to grow, and our relations with our customers are excellent. I'm pleased to report in the newly-published 2010 IMV customer satisfaction survey, Varian received the top ranking in seven measures out of eight measures of manufacturer's performance. This included service, system installation, training, documentation, and overall manufacturer performance. We also got top marks in our system performance, and both of our field service and software engineers received the top rankings. ", "Turning to x-ray products, we're seeing excellent acceptance of our products and we believe we're seeing a recovery in the global imaging industry. This was a record first quarter for x-ray products, which grew net orders by 13%, sales by 22%, and operating income by 34%. The growth in this business was driven by higher demand for x-ray tubes as well as our flat panel detectors for faster, more cost effective filmless imaging. Shipments of our dynamic panels for fluoroscopic and CT imaging were up strongly, and we believe we gained share with our new rad panels for digital radiography. Our new rad panels address what we believe to be the largest and most promising growth area for the global flat panel market. We have successfully continued to develop this product line and build relationships with important new customers who can drive future growth. ", "Growth in our tube business was driven by broad-based demand for tubes and CT, mammography, gentle radiography, and industrial imaging systems. Record shipments as well as improved quality costs performance and x-ray tubes contributed to a record gross margin for this business. Improved market conditions with good execution and a great product line give us reason for continued optimism about the potential for strong growth in this business. In fact, subsequent to the close of the quarter we executed a new three-year, approximately $450 million contract for Varian to supply medical imaging subcomponents to Toshiba Medical Systems for integration into diagnostic imaging equipment for the global market. Orders will be booked over the period of the agreement. We are very proud to announce this contract, as it marks the latest chapter in our 30-plus year relationship with Toshiba Medical Systems. Over the years our two companies have developed a close cooperation at all levels of the business; we have complimentary design, engineering, and manufacturing capabilities and work well together to realize new products and improve existing ones. ", "Switching now to our other category, we reached some important milestones in our SIP (Security and Inspection) products business and our particle therapy business. This category generated combined net orders of $22 million for the quarter, up from the year-ago quarter when we reversed a $62 million order in Sweden for a proton therapy system. Excluding the reversal net orders for the other category were even with the year-ago period. We were unsuccessful in our appeal at Skandia and have dropped further litigation in this matter in order to put this behind us in order to focus on some very positive developments. ", "Earlier this month, we announced that we received FDA 510((k) clearance for the Varian Proton Therapy System, making it the first working system capable of delivering precise, intensity-modulated proton therapy or IMPT, using pencil-beam scanning technology. This means we have product-level clearance on our proton system so customers will not seek site-specific clearances. The benefit for our customers is that this may make it easier for them to secure financing for their products, and they can get up and running quicker after their systems are commissioned. Our IMPT technology is already at work at a center in Germany, and construction on the Scripps proton therapy center in San Diego is moving ahead rapidly. Base plates for the new gantries at Scripps are already in place, and you could actually watch the progress of the project on live web-cam at www.advanced particletherapy.com. Meanwhile, our first cyclotron has been manufactured and moved into our test cell. We're continuing to pursue other projects, and we hope to book an order or two this year. ", "In our security businesses, you will recall that we expressed frustration in our last call about repeated challenges to a large tender order award for U.S. customs and boarder protection. I am pleased to say the appeals were dropped subsequent to the close of the first quarter and we were instructed by CBP to continue to process our award, so this month we have booked a $21 million order for five of our turn-key Intellex cargo screening systems. These systems, which will be installed on the U.S. border on the next 12-18 months, will incorporate our latest technology from materials discrimination and detection of radioactive materials. ", "During the quarter we received an order for the world's first high-energy, high-speed x-ray source that makes it possible to identify hazardous materials on trains traveling at up to 20 km per hour. We believe the ability to scan moving cargo on trains or trucks has the potential to significantly expand market acceptance of our security products. Automated materials discrimination is now becoming a standard requirement for cargo screening systems, and we are leaders in this area with patented technology that can contribute to our growth. And now, here's Elisha. ", "Elisha Finney", "", "Thanks, Tim, and hello everyone. While Tim has already covered net orders, I want to briefly talk about the constant currency growth rate for the quarter. Oncology grew net orders by 5% in dollars or 6% in constant currency. Given these significant quarter-over-quarter strengthening of the Dollar against the Euro, oncology's European net orders growth rate was 17%, significantly higher than the reported 10% growth rate in dollars. While the weaker Dollar versus the Yen helped us in Asia, total international oncology orders were down 6% in dollars and down 4% on a constant currency basis. ", "First quarter revenues increased 7% to $580 million with constant currency growth of 8%. Not surprisingly, oncology systems posted a 5% increase in revenues consistent with moderate order growth in the year-ago period. x-ray products posted a gain of 22% and revenues from businesses from the \u201cother\u201d category decreased by $4 million, or 19%. The first quarter growth margin for the company rose nearly one and a half points to 45% with record levels achieved in oncology and in x-ray products. Oncology systems gross margin increased nearly one point to 47.3% due primarily to higher TrueBeam shipments and software upgrades along with improved installation and warranty costs. x-ray product gross margin rose 1 point to 42.3% due to record revenues and improved cost of quality for our x-ray tube. ", "First quarter SG&A expenses were $91 million, or 16% of revenues and first quarter R&D expenses were $39 million, or 7% of revenues. On a combined basis, operating expenses were down slightly from the year-ago period as a percentage of revenue. ", "Moving down the income statement, first quarter operating earnings of $137 million were up one and a half points as a percentage of revenues to 23.6%. Depreciation and amortization totaled $12 million for the quarter. The effective tax rate was 29.6% for the quarter, down four points from the year-ago quarter and down 1 point from what we had forecasted due largely to the retroactive lien statement of the 2010 R&D tax credit. ", "For fiscal year 2011, we continued to estimate that the tax rate will be somewhere in the range of 31-32%. Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased significantly from the year-ago quarter to $121 million due largely to the accelerated share repurchase program that was executed last August. Diluted earnings per share rose 27% to $0.80. ", "Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $704 million, debt of $23 million, and stockholder's equity of $1.5 billion. With strong global collections, DSO for the quarter improved by 6 days to 78. First quarter cash flow from operations was $138 million with most of it coming from net earnings and strong A/R collection. Another primary source of cash was $77 million in proceeds from employee stock option exercises. Primary uses of cash were $23 million for capital expenditures and $20 million for repayment of short-term bank borrowing. ", "Because of the accelerated repurchase program for approximately 3.8 million shares that was executed last August, and that will completed by late February, we did not use cash for stock repurchases in the quarter. At the end of the quarter we had another 4.5 million shares remaining under our repurchase authorization that extends to the end of fiscal 2011. Now I'll turn it back to Tim for the outlook.", "Tim Guertin", "", "Thanks, Elisha. We continue to believe that annual revenues for fiscal 2011 will grow 10-11% over the fiscal 2010 total. Given our improved margins and the strength of our earnings in the first quarter, we now believe that net earnings per diluted share for fiscal year 2011 could grow to a range of $3.39 to $3.45. For the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we believe the total company revenues could increase by about 9-10% over the prior year period, and that net earnings per diluted share could be in the range of $0.83 to $0.86. And we're now ready for your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Sean Lavin with Lazard Partners. Please proceed.", "", "Sean Lavin - Lazard Partners", "", "Taking our questions? ", "Tim Guertin", "", "Yes. Hi, Sean.", "Sean Lavin - Lazard Partners", "", "I guess to start, I was wondering if you could go over the Japan (inaudible) package in a little more detail and tell us maybe how long it was in effect, how much of a benefit you got in orders in the past, and whether it was only in the March quarter or if it was an all-year thing, and when exactly it ended. ", "Tim Guertin", "", "It was a radiotherapy stimulus, so other kinds of medical equipment were not necessarily affected. It lasted for two years, and it ended last March. So actually if you look at quarter 3 and quarter 4 of last year and quarter 1 of this year, we've actually increased quarter-over-quarter, so we've actually got more orders in Japan this quarter than we got in the last two quarters. It was just that this was first quarter where you saw that fall-back to that huge number that we had in the year-ago quarter. Actually, if you look at oncology systems and you exclude Japan from last year and from this year, oncology systems grew by over 17%. It was just a huge comp, $40 million in that one quarter. And we're glad to have had it, because quarter one of last year was not a great quarter in North America, we were down, and Japan came through and kind of rescued us, but now we had that big comp we had to compensate for this year. ", "Sean Lavin - Lazard Partners", "", "And then, for Elisha, how sustainable is the margin expansion you saw in this quarter? ", "Elisha Finney", "", "Yeah, well Sean we were obviously very very pleased to see record performance in both oncology and in x-ray products, but as we always say, one quarter does not make a trend. The good news is that the TrueBeam pricing continues to be very good, and we are seeing overall decreases in installation and warranty across the board, so I would think that those tend to be sustainable. Product mix is something that is a little more variable. We saw very strong software upgrades in the quarter that may or may not repeat. Again, x-ray products very strong performance with volume and with quality cost improvement. So for both of those businesses, looking out at the full fiscal year, we think they will see gross margin improvement of somewhere close to a point year-over-year. So very good performance by both. ", "Tim Guertin", "", "Yeah, I think from my perspective, the nice thing here was that a huge portion of our business was internationally, and normally that would pull us down, but we had the opposite effect, so that was very nice to see. There's just been some really good performance on the part of sales teams in order to get customers interested in our newest generation of products, our premium products, and also at the same time good cost measures inside our operations. So altogether I think we just had some nice execution that really helped us this quarter. ", "Sean Lavin - Lazard Partners", "", "Then a question I've started to get, is that I think you supply Hologic with tubes, and I was wondering if they see a significant ramp in 3-D mammography, how meaningful a benefit can that be to you? ", "Tim Guertin", "", "Well, you know, we do supply materials. I haven't asked Bob to actually estimate that. The important effect for Bob's x-ray tube business is in CT tubes. I think that's the strongest and most important part, and the tubes that we're providing are not CT tubes for mammography. So it would have a positive effect, but I don't think it would have a really significant positive effect for them. ", "Sean Lavin - Lazard Partners", "", "One last quick one. What was the yearly size of your last contract with Toshiba?", "Elisha Finney", "", "It was announced 3 years ago, Sean. I believe the increase in the total value is somewhere right around 40%.", "Sean Lavin - Lazard Partners", "", "Alright, perfect, thank you very much.", "Elisha Finney", "", "Mm-hm. ", "Operator", "", "And your question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla with Citi Group. Please proceed. ", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup ", "", "Hi, good afternoon.", "Tim Guertin", "", "Hi Amit.", "Amit Bhalla \u2013 Citigroup", "", "I want to follow up on this margin question. Elisa, I understand that one quarter doesn't make a trend, but can you take a minute and break out the contribution from each of these pieces that has contributed to higher margins this quarter versus last quarter and last year, so we get a little bit more of an understanding of that benefit?", "Elisha Finney", "", "Well, I'll take a stab at that question. I don't know that I have every level of detail, quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year that you might be looking for. Clearly, oncology was up 79 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Really, product mix has always been the biggest driver, so TrueBeam and pricing and software upgrades are by far the biggest driver in that margin improvement, and again, we get a lot of variation in product mix quarter-over-quarter, but the improvement in installation and warranty and the TrueBeam pricing I believe should be sustainable as we go forward. In any given quarter these geographies can also impact margin and as Tim said, we're very pleased to see this improvement despite the fact that international sales were almost 60% of the total this quarter, so it's a very good performance. x-ray products -  by far the biggest driver there is volume., and if we continue to see the volume that we have seen, I would think that is sustainable. As we've been talking about on the flat panel side, the radiographic \u2013 we are seeing, as these panels get higher volume, the pricing does start to come down as we would have expected. We are going to be relocating a factory through Dipix this year which may impact margins slightly but again, for the full year, I think we should see about a 1-point improvement hold in both businesses. ", "Amit Bhalla \u2013 Citigroup", "", "And on TrueBeam, I think that last quarter we talked a little bit about some delivery pushouts and install times and I think you're highlighting that some of that is normalized? Can you quantify what your TrueBeam install times are today, versus last quarter? ", "Elisha Finney", "", "Well this really actually doesn't refer to TrueBeam specifically because TrueBeam in the quarter still represented less than 5% of total oncology revenues. So it's still in terms of sales, pretty minor. We're seeing significant improvement in Trilogy and iX and in our standard Clinac iX  as we just chip away quarter by quarter and our getting improvement in warranty and installation. ", "Tim Guertin", "", "I spoke recently to one of the service managers who is responsible for installs for TrueBeam, and he was very pleased with his progress on bringing TrueBeam installs in and getting some good times. I think we're getting to normal levels on that product very quickly. It might have taken longer, so it's a good question, but I think they're bringing them under control nicely. ", "Amit Bhalla \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Okay, thank you.", "Tim Guertin", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "And your next question comes from the line of Amit Hazan with Gleacher and Company. ", "Amit Hazan \u2013 Gleacher and Company", "", "Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. ", "Tim Guertin", "", "Hi, Amit.", "Amit Hazan \u2013 Gleacher and Company", "", "I want to stick with the guidance just for a second off of the recent questions, because I think I'm trying to understand the extent to which you have conservatism built in You talked about 50% basis point improvement gross profit last quarter, so that's clearly gone up to 100% to 100 basis points. I'm guessing operation margin improvement is now expected as well. If you could help us out with that, and specifically, I'm looking at the next 12 months and thinking your geographic mix is going to go back to a U.S. benefit, which is obviously going to help you. TrueBeam, like you said, is only 5% of sales right now and that's clearly going to increase. Help me understand why operating margins should stay anywhere near flat as we go through the next few quarters. ", "Elisha Finney", "", "Well if you go through the guidance, Amit, for the full year, yes the gross margin will go up about a point. And remember, our comparables got a little tougher in the second half when the business really started to come back last year. But as we said, we expected R&D and SG&A on a combined basis should go up as a percentage of sales. Each should go up slightly, and net-net, the operating margin improvement should be somewhere around half a point for the full fiscal year. Now, it's early, admittedly, and we hope you're right that with North America and TrueBeam, and if all of these things pan out, but at this point, based on expected delivery dates and what we see in backlogs - ", "Tim Guertin", "", "Currencies. ", "Elisha Finney", "", "and (inaudible) all of those things. It's our best guesstimate. ", "Tim Guertin", "", "I'll add that , you know, R&D was a little lower than it might have been in the first quarter, and as a timing issue, I expect to see more R&D. I think Elisha mentioned that, but just to put some particular focus there. We're trying to increase our R&D quite a bit this year, and we have some great projects to invest in, and so, you'll see that rise as well. ", "Amit Hazan \u2013 Gleacher and Company", "", "Alright, that's great. I just want to get back to orders for a second. I'm looking at my model, and at least in my model, the comp that you had for your all-U.S. orders was about 9% in constant currency, which doesn't seem that great to me, and I realize Japan was a big part of that last year, but you guys are obviously a global business and I'm trying to understand, off of that kind of comp, where else there might have been weakness, and if and what you saw in Europe, specifically Western Europe where we're seeing more of the austerity measures, and whether you can comment on whether that had any impact or whether you're seeing any changes in those countries? ", "Tim Guertin", "", "You know I think I mentioned there were a lot of Northern European countries that did well, In the U.K. and the Middle East we did well. I would say we were slightly off in Spain and Italy, and Latin America Q1 is never a big deal, so that wasn't any help but it wasn't much of a hurt either. This quarter is a story of Japan. If you think of the oncology business, Japan was $65 million or something like that in the year-ago first quarter and was by $22 million this quarter. $40 million is \u2013 that swing - nearly 10% of their orders. They just couldn't - and despite as I indicated, if you take Japan out of the equation in both quarters, they were up over 17%. So this is really a story of Japan. Everyone else is in the weeds. ", "Elisha Finney", "", "Every single region, Amit, with the exception of Asia, was up for the quarter, and that held for both oncology and x-ray products. ", "Tim Guertin", "", "And I'll just mention, TrueBeam is not improved in some of our international locations yet for sale, and it's doing well in the locations where it is, and it hasn't yet even had an impact in those territories. So as we get those approvals, and of course, those are up to governmental bodies, so I have no way of predicting when that will happen, but hopefully sometime before the end of the 21st century we'll get those, and then we can sell TrueBeam and I think that will really be helping us in Asian territories as well.", "Amit Hazan \u2013 Gleacher and Company", "", "Final question from me, just a followup on that. So we essentially saw 6% growth on a 1% comps. The comps are getting much tougher, and starting in the March quarter, is this a business right now that, as you think of the next 12, 18 months just to keep it general, because I know you don't like to give specific guidance on orders, that is going to grow orders in the double digits? ", "Tim Guertin", "", "We're just going to have to see. Clearly Europe, people have been worried about Europe not performing and we've been reading the earnings releases of other companies in terms of what they've seen in North American and what they've seen in Europe, and frankly, we were stronger in North America and in Europe than other companies were. Some other companies had strong growth in Asia, but they didn't have that huge comp in Japan, and if you take out that huge comp in Japan, we grew in Asia. So honestly, there are a lot of positive trends here that make me enthusiastic and the sales funnels look pretty good. The sales managers are doing what they're supposed to be doing. That being said, in the long run, yes, I believe that we can get into the low double digits, but in terms of predicting what's going to happen this year, I think you're just going to take that ride with us.", "Amit Hazan \u2013 Gleacher and Company", "", "Okay, thanks very much guys.", "Tim Guertin", "", "Thanks.

I know there are a lot of moving parts in the order rates quarter-to-quarter comps, geographic mix, new product launches, etc. but kind of looking to your growth rate to normalize out some of the comps, it looks like North American oncology orders on a compound annual basis grew over that period in the 2% range. Can you help us think about normalized growth rates for some of the end-user markets in which you compete, especially as we sort of get beyond these gyrations in cyclicality? ", "Tim Guertin", "", "Yeah, well, your 2% number comes from the fact that I think North America declined, what, nearly 20% in - ", "Elisha Finney", "", "13% in the year ago.", "Tim Guertin", "", "13% in the year-ago quarter, so even if it grew 20% this quarter, it reduces the overall effect. But, I would remind you that the U.S. was going through a horrible recession in the United States and it's, frankly, still not over. Unemployment rates remain high, and I believe that as the U.S. really starts to pull out of this recession and as unemployment rates get lower, we have a lot of strong potential in the U.S. Elisha, what were you - ", "Elisha Finney", "", "I meant with TrueBeam, it appears to be that we are growing faster than the market in the U.S. (inaudible) TrueBeam.

So I don't think we have anything to apologize for in the U.S. market,  and you got to remember that that 20% number includes both services and products. So I'm not bringing it out in this call, but if you can well imagine, services are not likely to have grown faster than 20%. So this means the product news was really really good in North America. ", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs", "", "Sure. So the question looks like there is a pretty nice uptick in TrueBeam orders if I'm correct, quarter over quarter. Can you maybe talk about the, at least in the United States, the nature of the customers who are adopting TrueBeam? Is there a way to characterize the type of hospital that focuses on academic centers, is it more community center or broad based, individual stand-alone clinics?", "Tim Guertin", "", "It's a good question. Logically, you would kind of assume that it's the academic centers, and the big locations, but the fact is that we're seeing it be broad based, so that's really nice. I think the reason why it is is because TrueBeam brings a lot of powerful capabilities to users but in a way that is actually simpler for them to use, so it's not scary for a lot of people to use these enhanced capabilities because we've made the product so easy to work with. I think it's a real breakthrough in a number of ways, and so as a consequence, we just see it be across the board. That's good, and that's a good harbinger for Europe as well, because European sites, I think we're more and more going to see that broad-based acceptance. It's hard to predict for Asia, Asia generally does not buy premium products at the same percentage rates as you see in North America and Europe, with the exception of Japan. But I would hope that  having a product that is so easy to use in this way will help it gain acceptance in Asia as well. It's a very important introduction for us, and I think it's going to change the whole picture worldwide over the next two year.

Can we just talk about market dynamics there, and also your progress in China, in particular?", "", "Tim Guertin", "", "In China I think we're doing okay, but I think we can do better. I think we can do better in both India and in China. I think we should be able to add some share, especially as we gain permission to bring new products into those markets. I think we're going to see our share go up, but we're going to have to expand the size of our teams in those countries, and we're in the process of making those investments. As we made the comment earlier, we're not approved for some of our new products, but nonetheless China was up, I think \u2013 17% , 17% in a quarter. So that's nice to see. But I think if we get permission to have all of the products we want to have in China, and get permission to have all of the products we want to have in Japan, then I think we can gain a lot of share there. We're not quite there. We need some permissions that we do not yet have, and then we're going to build our teams in those operations, and I think, looking out a year, I think we'll see a lot of strengthening in those locations.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs", "", "Great.

", "Elisha Finney", "", "We just had a very high mix of RapidArc upgrades in the quarter that may or may not repeat moving into the second half of this year. I mean, hopefully it will but all things equal, our software products have about an 70-80% gross margin and the accessories 50 to 60, and then the (inaudible) from there and service about 50.

That's what we want to do. I think we have 933 people on our engineering teams now, and the more than half are software related, so we're clearly putting a lot of emphasis on doing that. I will say, with regards to RapidArc, that we have recently introduced gated RapidArc, which is sort of a new, more capable version of RapidArc that we're bringing into the market. So I think that will give RapidArc some legs.

So should we expect another quarter here of a tough comp in Japan, or was the bulk of it in the December quarter? ", "Tim Guertin", "", "Quarter two in Japan was not as strong as quarter one in Japan. Japan is a territory in which quarter one is often stronger than some of the other quarters having to do with the way their hospitals budget there. But it is a more difficult comp in Japan than it will be in the third quarter. I think Q2 was lower than Q1 by about $20 million. So it's going to be a difficult comp but not quite as difficult and painful as it was in this quarter. And I will also mention that, you know, when we look at Japan going forward, Japan has not fallen off an edge. It's behaving more like normal, so we're still seeing a decent funnel in Japan, but we'll have to see how the year goes, but I'm hoping that in the second quarter \u2013 well, certainly the numbers indicate that we won't have as big a comp problem as we did in Q1.", "Mark Arnold - Piper Jaffray", "", "A couple more quick ones from me.

", "Elisha Finney", "", "Yeah, it's pretty comparable, Josh. In terms of gross margin, remember, though, any revenue that we book for protons on systems most likely is going to be at the zero-profit model until we prove ourselves and the fact that we know how to do accurate cost estimates.

I don't recall anything in Australia  or China that was unusual. I think that $20 million in Japan is probably the biggest thing. Oh yeah, Canada. Canada is a larger territory than it usually is this year because there is kind of a stimulus going on in Canada. That will help us this year, kind of work against us in 2012. ", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "", "I'll take it in 11 I guess, worry about it in 12. Let's see, a couple other questions here. On the Toshiba, and Elisha, the last time you guys announced that, I think it was a $320 million supply agreement that you're right up 40%. If that's almost a third of your business in x-ray,, a third of your x-ray business grown 40%,, Tim, does that essentially put a 10-15% floor on the revenue growth and order growth that we should expect in x-ray over the next three years, and that would assume zero growth in flat panels and all this other stuff you have coming out? ", "Tim Guertin", "", "Well you know I haven't given you a forecast for orders growth and flat panels for the next three years, and probably won't give it right now, but a floor, let's see, a floor. Well, I certainly hope that if everything happens to Toshiba in the way that they expect, I mean this is really good news because I think we're going to get some great new growth in our flat panel business in the next few years that we'll be able to add to this, and I'm hoping to get some other good x-ray tube business as well. I think this is, it certainly fills me with greater confidence about the growth prospects of this business over the next few year. But you've got to remember that Toshiba, a large part of what they buy from us are tubes, and so this mostly relates to growth that Toshiba's expecting in the tube business and also the North American market for CT scanners was hurt two years ago, so I think that it means that Toshiba is more confident about the need for CT scanners in the U.S. and in the world going forward, and that's why we're seeing this number. Flat panels was a smaller portion of this number. I can't actually break it apart for you, but we still see flat panels as a big grower, especially our rad  panels. So you'll have to pencil out your own math. I don't want to give you multiple-year guidance on a particular business unit, but certainly this was pretty dang good news. ", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "", "Yeah, congrats on that. Last two questions I guess just for Elisha. 510(k) on the proton, Elisha, and the debt and equity in the Scripps deal that's already out there, does that mean you're less likely to use your balance sheet on that deal and/or any future deals, or do you still think your contemplating that?", "Elisha Finney", "", "You know, Jeff, to be determined on all of the deals that we have on the table right now. But again, we will be participating along with other financiers at some level. I'm just not willing to go out on a limb and tell you exactly what it's going to look like at this point, whether it's payment terms, whether it's a bond hold, whether we're part of a debt facility, but we are absolutely able and will to participate given that $700 million of cash earning effectively nothing, and it really gives us an ability to go out and prove ourselves and grow this business. So it is something we will likely do.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "", "Okay, and the last question just on afaxite. Going into this quarter, you had used a buck thirty-eight to a buck forty-two on the Euro, and obviously interquarter that looking maybe a little worrisome, so what are you thinking now for the rest of the year? Are you getting a little more conservative on your Euro assumptions here at a buck thirty-seven or what's embedded in your guidance from here? ", "Elisha Finney", "", "Oh boy. Well, we put all sorts of sensitivity analysis around that, Jeff. But fortunately when I look at Q2, the Q2 in the year-ago period was about $1.40, and we're running at about $1.36 or 7 currently, so the delta is much much less, so I'm encouraged when we look at Q2 that you won't get wild swings quarter over quarter.

", "Tim Guertin", "", "Good afternoon.", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "", "You know, a lot of the nitpicky modeling questions have mostly been answered, so why don't we focus more big picture. Tim, we're about five months away from the release of the preliminary hospital outpatient perspective payment system, the preliminary reimbursement rules for 2012. As you speak to your policy guys, what is your sense for the directionality of radiation and oncology reimbursement for next year? ", "Tim Guertin", "", "You know, I actually prefer the nitpicky questions because Elisha can answer them, and this requires me to use my psychic powers, which have not always, you know, all that good. I will say that obviously we've seen articles in the newspaper and from other sources be critical of the amount of money spent on prostate cancer treatments in North America. I think the prostate cancer death is still 30,000 people a year, so I don't think enough is being done for prostate cancer, but if you read some newspapers, you'd think that we're way over doing it. And sometimes I think that there are organizations in Washington that read those newspapers and draw the wrong conclusions. So there may be some attempt to control reimbursement for prostate treatments. ", "You know, right now in radiation therapy, the way the codes are written, they're generic, there is no indication of what disease they treat. So there's a possibility, I don't regard it as a likely possibility but there is a small possibility that they'll try to break out prostate cancer. And if they break it out, you know, where will it have the biggest effect? It will probably have the biggest effect on protons for prostates. What's nice about us is that we're not assuming very many prostate patients will be treated with protons in our models, and so we don't think it's going to affect us very much. So, if there's going to be an effect, I'm expecting a stronger effect on protons than I am expecting elsewhere. But I'm not predicting it, I'm just saying if it happened, I would be less surprised there. ", "At the same time we're continuing to concentrate on throughput. Every conference call you hear me over and over again talk about shortening treatment times, and being able to deliver a sterotactic radiosurgery procedure in six minutes with 18 Gray, which is kind of remarkable actually, and we're doing all of that because we really think that that's what we have to do for our customers. We have to be able to find ways for them to be able to deliver therapy faster because then if they do see reimbursement cuts, they'll be able to accommodate them in their clinics, and we think that's an advantage to us. We think that Varian has done a much better job in producing super high-quality treatments in a very short time. We think we've done a better job at that than anybody else in this field. So that's why we're focused on that so much. So I'm not expecting big trouble, I'm not predicting big trouble, but if there were going to be big trouble, it's probably going to be that somebody is going to try to fix prostate cancer from 50,000 feet, which is a bad idea but bad ideas have happened before. ", "Junaid Husain - Soleil Securities", "", "Gotcha. Now that's actually very helpful. And then I guess last question for you, speaking of articles in the newspaper, we've seen some media attention of late highlighting the radiation and oncology space somewhat negatively, especially as it pertains to safetyl. I guess this isn't really new information, but what are your thoughts, as you think about safety issues that have been coming up, and do you think that the regulators might want to put a little more scrutiny on the manufacturers?", "Tim Guertin", "", "We're obviously in constant communication with the FDA about any issues that arise. We talk to them about these things. I met with the FDA last year and probably will wind up meeting with them again this year, and when we had an FDA inspection just in the last few months, so we are and the regulators remain concerned about safety here. ", "Putting it in perspective, there were a small number of events. Unfortunately, we have a million and a half people who are treated per year, about that number on our equipment, so even if you're 99.99% good, that's still going to produce too many events. And so when we see a pattern, happen, and that's what certain newspapers seized on was the pattern, when that happens, even if it happens at only one or two sites, we treat it as something we have to deal with. We just got FDA approval for a modification that we're going to put on our machines, we told our customers all about it, and we'll be rolling that out this year at no charge to them. So even though that only a handful of events occurred, we think even one is too many, and we're going to deal with it. Around here, whenever anyone calls up and says a patient was injured, that's a really bad day for us. We just hate that. And so we're going to do everything we can to keep that from happening, and if it costs millions of dollars to keep it from happening, well then that's what we'll pay, because we think that patient safety is obviously something we have to take very very seriously. ", "At the same time, I will say, if you think about that 99.9% record, and when you realize how powerful these machines are, that they can treat and kill a small spot of cancer inside the body, I think that speaks well of our customers, I think our customers by and large incredibly scrupulous and diligent people who want to do a good job, and so we are very proud of them as well. But any mistake was too many, and so we're going to deal with that. So this year, we actually built that already into the numbers that we gave you as we roll out this change, we've already built that into our numbers that we've described for you. I think this change is a really good one and I think our customers are going to like it, so any time we have a problem, we're going to increase our safeguards.

At the same time, though, it wasn't just TrueBeam. Lester Boeh, who is the head of our proton business, was in the booth and talking about protons and he told me that he expected his role in the booth was going to be to direct people to where the TrueBeam demo was, but it turns out we had a lot of interest in protons as well, and he was constantly busy, so that was nice to see.", "I would have to say that we introduced some new technology on our information systems, we demonstrated a product that we call Nexus, which is the next generation of our software in our ARIA platform, which people really like, and we showed an iPad application that people really loved. We think that mobile, these kind of tablet applications in medicine, are going to become very very popular, because tablets are a lot easier to carry around than laptops. So we think that tablet software is going to become a big deal in medicine. And maybe I should be buying stock in Apple right now instead of this. But anyway, we think that as more Android tablets come online and the next generation of Apple products come online, we're going to see more and more people use that. So we had enthusiasm for a broad range of products. You're right, you're right, we had a lot of enthusiasm and I was really happy to see. Obviously I can't, I'm not allowed to spend a lot of time in my competitors' booths, but the mood in the Varian meeting was very upbeat. ", "James Terwilliger - Duncan Williams", "", "I thought you guys did a great job and I thought that the customers' tone was very robust. If I would switch to a different topic as it relates to proton therapy, could you highlight very quickly the benefits of proton therapy, and I know it's far away in terms of revenue and earnings for this, but you're having discussions with I'm going to guess, ten different parties. What does that party look like? Is this something that would be adopted more in areas where, due to its cost that maybe in areas of socialized medicine, where a certain company could step up and maybe use government proceeds and debt to fund one facility. Is that fair assumption? ", "Tim Guertin", "", "You know, outside of the U.S., it's almost all socialized medicine, so obviously a lot of those facilities will be government, but there will be some private ones as well. The center in Munich is a private center and is not part of that system. So we'll see a little bit of both happening. The basic principal of protons is that for a given dose to the tumor is that you deposit a lot less dose to healthy tissue than you would with an x-ray beam, and that's simply because when the  x-ray beam enters the body, the amount that's absorbed by the tissue starts relatively high by the skin and then diminishes as you go deeper into the body. Whereas with a proton beam, most of the dose is deposited at the tumor and very little dose is deposited as the beam enters, and no dose is deposited after the tumor, so it produces a much nicer dose pattern. That means that you don't need to use as many beams, and that means you can reduce the dose to healthy tissue. ", "Why is that important? Well, if the patient you're treating is 75 years old, it may not be that important, because the secondary disease may not happen for 30, 40 years. But there is a category of patients for whom it's very important. One of those groups is children. You don't really want to give children a high dose to healthy tissue because they're going to live 50, 60, 70 years from the time they get this treatment, so you don't want to see secondary cancers. Another group is people who have already been treated. They have already received maybe a high dose to their healthy tissues. Those healthy tissues will not tolerate additional dose, and so if you can use protons to treat them, that would be great. Another possibility is just tumors that are located adjacent to tissue that is very sensitive. So when you look at spine or you look at brain, you may be able to deliver doses that will have a lot less toxicity nearby healthy tissue. ", "And some of our customers are very enthusiastic about lung. Now lung is a relatively new application for protons but the idea is that you can avoid the healthy lung and deliver a lot more dose the the tumor. We'll have to see if that works out, but if it does work out, that could be hugely beneficial, especially for people who have lung cancer while they're in their 50s or 60s. We think that sterotactic applications for protons could be good because, once again, a sterotactic application uses lot of beams, in x-ray it puts a lot of dose outside the tumor but sterotactic protons will put much less dose outside the tumor. ", "So for all of the reasons it's good, and we think socialized medical systems may want to do it. We think about 10-15% of patients will benefit from protons as opposed to x-rays. We think that there's going to be huge growth in x-rays, don't get me wrong. We think there's a gigantic wave of people who are going to go over 65 years old, and we think that there's going to be big growth necessary in x-rays. But we also think that it's going to create a bit opportunity for protons going forward, and we think the United States might hold 60 or 70 systems from the what, dozen or so that it has now, and we think we might see an even larger number internationally ", "James Terwilliger - Duncan Williams", "", "Okay, great. Thank you. One other question. On the international side of the business, we've talked about Japan and China, Europe and South America, but Tim, could you please comment very briefly on what you're seeing in India and the Middle East? ", "Tim Guertin", "", "You know, India and the Middle East \u2013 the Middle East is being very good right now. That's a good territory for us. India, we've had some strengths recently in India, and in the long run, we think India's a terrifically important territory. A lot of Indian healthcare is delivered at public health clinics. Most of of our successes in India have been at private clinics, in fact, almost all have been at private clinics, and private clinics affect the upper middle class. But to get to the great mass of the Indian population, products like UNIQUE are going to be important. So I think that India remains a significant market, but I think it's tiny now compared to what it's going to be in five years. ", "James Terwilliger - Duncan Williams", "", "Okay, great, and the very last question is, you know, as you've raised guidance and your business seems pretty robust, do you have the infrastructure in place to support this growth? Are you looking to hire additional sales people or installers or is the organization positioned with the infrastructure to support the future growth initiative? ", "Tim Guertin", "", "I think we have the factories necessary to do it. We are always hiring to our service teams, and in fact, if anyone is listening today would like to join our organization, we can certainly arrange for that. But we're hiring service people all over the world. It is one of the fastest growing parts of our operation, and yes, you will see us add sales people, especially outside of North America. ", "James Terwilliger - Duncan Williams", "", "Okay great. Again, congratulations on a good quarter.", "Tim Guertin", "", "Thank you. Thanks, so that's all the questions we can take for the day.

Details are available on our Investor Relations website at www.varian.com/investors, you'll find the details under Events and Webcasts. ", "Before turning it over to Tim, let me say that because we have more participants in this call, I'm going to be asking questionnaires to limit their questions to one question. We will circle around again if we have the time to do it, but I want to give everybody an opportunity to ask at least one question in this call. So thank you very much. And now, here's Tim.", "Timothy Guertin", "Good afternoon and welcome. Today, for the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we're reporting financial results that demonstrate that our companies long-term growth strategy is on track. Demand for our new TrueBeam system, oncology services and X-ray tubes and panels, as well as strong performance in our Security business led to healthy orders and revenue growth and improved margins during the quarter.", "In summary, revenues grows by 11%, our operating earnings increased by 12%, topping 23% of revenues. Net earnings for the company increased by 13%, and EPS rose by 18%. Our quarter ending backlog expanded by 11% to $2.2 billion.", "We ended the quarter with $584 million in cash and cash equivalents, even after spending $238 million on a program for the accelerated repurchase of 3.5 million shares of our stock.", "As you all know that a quarter was marked by an unusual number of disruptions around the world including unrest in the Middle East, an earthquake in New Zealand and the most recent earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Many of you have been concerned about the possible impact of these events on our businesses, and I can now report that although many customers and employees were deeply affected, the overall effect on our financial performance has been very limited so far. I'll provide more details on this in a few moments. I'll focus now on orders and operations in each of our businesses.", "Oncology Systems second quarter net orders totaled $520 million, up 9% with 12% growth in North America and a 7% increase in the overall international markets. Oncology achieved double-digit order growth in North America with the help of some major wins involving our TrueBeam platform for radiotherapy and radiosurgery. ", "For example, we booked an order for six TrueBeam units with USMD, a leading cancer care provider, and Bayhealth in Maryland placed an order for three TrueBeam units. ", "We also had a significant software win for our ARIA information management system at the University of South Alabama. We have replaced rival systems. We continue to do very well against the competition in this important software market during the quarter. Year-to-date, orders are up 16% for our Oncology business in North America. ", "In Europe, net orders grew in double digits for the second consecutive quarter. This was driven by robust service gains, coupled with strong system orders with notable gains in Egypt, Spain, Norway, Poland, Romania and Russia. ", "For example, despite the political turmoil in Egypt, we received a multiunit order for a military hospital there. In the Netherlands, we won a large order to replace multiple units from one of our competitors. We are seeing customer demand for our clinical solution that combines high throughput, advanced clinical capability and cost effectiveness, a combination at place to a strength that is unique to Varian.", "Despite continued orders growth in China, Oncology Systems net orders for Asia again declined versus a strong year-ago quarter when Japan finished the large government stimulus spending program. At this point, we're pleased with the strength of business in Japan where orders have grown for three consecutive quarters.", "To give you a little more color on the effects of the disaster there, 12 Varian treatment centers were knocked out of operation by the earthquake and or tsunami. JASTRO, Japan's radiation oncology professional group rushed to reroute patients undergoing treatment to working facilities, while Varian service teams from throughout Japan worked with clinical personal to restore normal operations at the damaged centers as quickly as possible. These teams had eight clinics back in normal operation within 2 weeks.", "Despite this extensive disaster recovery effort, our service teams were able to complete installations of our new machines in Japan as scheduled during the quarter. I think what makes this all the more remarkable is that this work was successfully completed in spite of gasoline and food shortages, rolling blackouts, telecommunications breakdowns and other logistical troubles that may affect this nation for many months to come. We're working with our customers and suppliers in Japan in an effort to minimize the long-term effect of this catastrophe.", "The people of Japan have shown tremendous courage and resiliency in the face of this disaster, we're honored to be partnering with them on this recovery. Varian, together with hundreds of our individual employees from Japan and around the world has donated nearly $200,000 to the relief effort.", "Turning now to the rest of the world. Oncology Systems net orders grew nicely, driven by Brazil and Barbados and Latin America and by New Zealand, where we won another international order for TrueBeam. ", "Overall, we had another very good quarter for our TrueBeam product. As of the end of the quarter, we had more than 225 orders of this game-changing cancer treatment platform, since its introduction in the second quarter of last year. Installations of TrueBeams are proceeding smoothly with more than 65 installations complete or in progress as of the end of the quarter.", "As you may have seen in our recent press release, we have received SFDA clearance to market and sell our TrueBeam product in China. This opens up an important market where I believe firmly that this device can make a meaningful difference in the treatment of lung, liver and other cancers. ", "The clinical story continues to be the most exciting story about TrueBeam. To give you some reason examples, doctors at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, have taken advantage of TrueBeam's motion management technology, including gated RapidArc to deliver conventional and hypofractionated treatments for liver and lung cancer, as well as metastatic adrenal cancer. And clinicians using TrueBeam at UC San Diego are excited about the potential for sparing more healthy tissue and reducing complications for their Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma patients.", "At Stanford, doctors have now delivered RapidArc hypofractionated treatments for both lung and pancreatic cancer, using TrueBeam's unmatched high dose delivery rate and two arcs to complete each procedure in just three minutes.", "Our Trilogy and low-energy accelerators and RapidArc upgrades, as well as our software for treatment planning and managing clinical data, also contributed to the Oncology Systems' order growth for the quarter. Service orders and revenue, including the second quarter have continued to average around 15% year-over-year growth. Growth in this business has been driven by an increased contract capture rate, better pricing and a larger install base, which now stands at around 6,200 machines.", "Turning to X-Ray Products. We continue to see record-breaking second quarter growth in net orders and revenues for this business. Net orders increased by 18% to $124 million, revenues rose 15% to $118 million, and this business achieved record second quarter operating income. ", "Surprisingly, two borders grew faster than panel orders, and although both were in solid double-digits. Here again, Japanese business came through despite its natural disaster with large orders for CT tubes from Toshiba, and other Japanese manufacturers. Toshiba has continued to operate normally under our long-term purchasing agreement with them.", "Outside of Japan, we also had good growth and orders of tubes for mammography and industrial applications, including non-destructive testing, material analysis for environmental compliance and airport baggage screening systems. I'm pleased to note that our tube operation was the prime driver of a 2-point gain in gross margin in our X-Ray Products business, principally because of higher shipment volumes, manufacturing efficiencies and lower cost of quality.", "Our biggest dynamic panels for fluoroscopic and CT imaging were the biggest contributors to the continued expansion in our Panel business during the quarter, an apparent ongoing recovery in the market for dental and veterinary x-rays imaging systems also added to the growth of our Panel business.  Looking at the strong performance in X-Ray Products over the last several quarters, I believe we are witnessing an ongoing recovery in almost every segment of the X-ray imaging industry.", "Switching now to our other category, including our SIP, Security and Inspection Products business and our Particle Therapy business, we generated combined net orders of $38 million from the quarter, up by $25 million from the year-ago quarter. All of the order expansion in this category came from our SIP business as was mentioned in our last call, we booked a $21 million order in January from U.S. Customs and border protection for five of our turnkey IntellX cargo screening systems that will be installed on the U.S. border over the next 12 to 18 months.", "We also received a large order during the quarter for cargo screening components that will be integrated into scanning systems for installation in the Middle East. SIP also booked a multimillion order for a 15 million volt Linatron that will be used for nondestructive testing applications in Europe.", "In the Varian Particle Therapy business, we continue to see progress on construction the Scripps Proton Therapy Center in San Diego and we expect to book an $88 million order to equip that center when project financing is completed. And now, here's Elisha.", "Elisha Finney", "Thanks, Tim, and hello, everyone. While Tim has already covered net orders, I want to briefly talk about constant currency growth rates for the quarter. Our net orders and revenues were impacted by a stronger yen and aussie that were largely offset by a weaker euro. Oncology grew net orders by 9% in dollars or 8% in constant currency. ", "Total international Oncology orders increased 7% in dollars and 6% on a constant-currency basis. Oncology's European net orders grew 14% or 16% in constant currency, while the Asian orders declined by 13% or 19% in constant currency.", "Second quarter revenues increased 11% to $648 million, with constant currency growth of 9%. Oncology Systems posted a 9% in revenues, X-Ray Products, a gain of 15%, and revenues from businesses under the Other category increased by 20%. ", "The second quarter growth margin for the company rose by more than a point to 44.6%. Oncology Systems gross margin's increased by nearly 40 basis points to 45.5%, due primarily to improved installation and warranty costs, a favorable geographic mix shift to North America and higher TrueBeam shipments.", "X-Ray Products gross margin rose by nearly two points to 40.4%, due as Tim said, to high shipment volumes, manufacturing efficiency and improved cost of quality for our X-ray tubes. For the first half, the total company gross margin is up more than a point to 45.3%, with gains in all business segments.", "Second quarter SG&A expenses were $94 million or 14% of revenues, up as expected by about a point as a percentage of revenue, due largely to higher compensation cost compared to the year-ago quarter when austerity measures, including salary and hiring increases were in place. We have more recently been investing and expanding marketing and sales capacity to execute on our global growth strategy.", "Second quarter R&D expenses were $44 million or 7% of revenue, about even as a percentage of revenue with a year-ago quarter. For the first half, total operating expenses were up half a point as a percentage of revenue from the year-ago period. ", "Moving down the income statement. Second quarter operating earnings totaled $151 million, up 12% to 23.3% of revenues. For the first half, operating earnings are up 13% to $288 million or 23.5% of revenue.", "Depreciation and amortization totaled $13 million for the quarter. The effective tax rate was 31.8% for the quarter, down almost 1 point from the year-ago quarter, due largely to a net benefit of the free tax items. For fiscal year 2011, we continue to estimate that the tax rate will be in the range of 31% to 32%, including a 30% to 31% rate for the third quarter.", "Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased significantly from the year-ago quarter to 120 million, due largely to the accelerated share repurchase program that were executed in August of 2010 and this past February. Diluted earnings per share rose 18% to $0.86.", "Turning now to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $584 million, total debt of $143 million and stockholders' equity of $1.3 billion. Subsequent to the close of the quarter, we have continued to pay down short-term debt under our revolving line of credit, which as of today, is less than $40 million outstanding.", "DSO; Days Sales Outstanding, increased by three days from the year-ago quarter to 79. Second quarter cash flow from operations was $68 million, with net earnings partially offset by increased accounts receivable and inventory, related to current and expected higher shipments.", "Another primary source of cash was $120 million in net borrowing, mostly for the accelerated share repurchase during the quarter. Primary usage of cash was $238 million to repurchase 3.5 million shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 13 million shares remaining under repurchase authorization. Now, I'll turn it back over to Tim for the outlook.", "Timothy Guertin", "Well, while our business has faced some uncertainty related to ongoing effects of the catastrophe in Japan, our outlook for the balance of the fiscal year remains unchanged. For fiscal 2011, we continue to estimate that annual revenues could grow 10% to 11% over the fiscal 2010, total and net earnings per diluted share from continuing operations could be in the range of $3.39 to $3.45. ", "For the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we estimate the total company revenues could increase by about 11% to 12% over the prior-year period, and that net earnings per diluted share from continuing operations could be in the range of $0.80 to $0.83.", "We're now ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla with Citigroup.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc", "My question relates to the North America Oncology order book, typically we've seen in this fiscal second quarter in absolute dollars that North American Oncology order book grows. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the dynamics in North America and then your view for the next two quarters as the comps start to get a little bit tougher in North America.", "Timothy Guertin", "The comps are -- will of course, be tougher. But I mean the good news is we had 18% growth in the quarter, North America for Oncology, 22% in the first half. We had two points now that say that we're seeing some recovery in the North America market. That's very nice to see. TrueBeam is now a majority of our high-energy machine orders. That will help us in the North American marketplace. We've mentioned some big wins at certain sites like USMD you saw some conversion of impact sites to ARIA and we're not seeing major losses. So all of those things mean that I think we're doing well in North America. And I think our share is doing well in North America. SBRT is continuing to be important. Few years ago, I think SRS, stereotactic radiosurgery for intracranial was important and now more and more we're seeing people focused on stereotactic body radiation therapy. And that means a lot of the features that are in TrueBeam are really relevant. So all of those factors will weigh in our fortune. It's not my practice to prognosticate orders in any particular country because that's the way to get in trouble fast, but all I can tell you is so far, so good. And the signs in the marketplace are good. But as you mentioned, we will have tougher comps because the market started to recover 12 months ago. And that will help. The nice thing about getting those orders is we did go through this trough in the North American orders and that affected our sales. That's made it tougher in 2011 to get all the sales we would have liked to have in North America. So seeing this business come back, reassures me that going forward, we'll have nice revenue prospects.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc", "And, Elisha, just on the fiscal third quarter earnings guidance, given what you're guiding for the top line, I would have expected, I guess the earnings, to be a little bit stronger. I guess also coupled with the tax rate you're talking about, so could you just walk us through how you get to the $0.80 to $0.83 for earnings...", "Elisha Finney", "Sure. And Amit, let me do this at a very obviously top level without giving a lot of specific detail by line item. But clearly, if you look at the year-ago third quarter, the gross margin for the company was up about 1.5 points. So we are -- based on the guidance numbers that we just gave you, what I am assuming is that we'll be able to hold that margin relatively flat at about 44%. R&D will remain about flat as it has for the first half of this year. SG&A, we are still in a recovery and a building mode. And we're gearing up. We are doing some key hires and we are increasing travel and things of that nature, really to go after the business when the market is expanding. So SG&A will likely go up as a percentage of revenues by about 0.5 point, which gets you to RoS being down by about 0.5 point. But the tax rate, being helped somewhat by the accelerated share repurchase program. So that's kind of how we get to the guidance number for the third quarter. I will point out though, if you come back to the fiscal year, as we have been saying all year, gross margin for total company should be up about 1 point, SG&A will take about 0.5 point away and total RoS should be at around 23%, up about 0.5 point from last year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird.", "Jeffrey Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "A couple of questions here. Tim, I guess, one of the ways we're trying to track things on the TrueBeam side is the take rate. You talked about a 30%, I think a 30% or so worldwide take rate last quarter, 55%, 60% last quarter in North America. Any updates to those numbers this quarter?", "Timothy Guertin", "That take rates, I think, I just gave you the take rate for North America's is the majority. And I believe the number worldwide is that we're now greater than 40% of high-energy orders worldwide.", "Jeffrey Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "So North America 51%, 99.5%, I guess majority can mean a lot of things there. Can you ballpark that maybe a little tighter for me?", "Timothy Guertin", "I would like to ballpark it for you but I really don't have it in front of me, so I'm going to have to stick with majority.", "Jeffrey Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Okay, no that's fair. And then Elisha just on the guidance again for the full year. Similar to, I guess Amit's question on fiscal Q3 guidance, you've got some foreign currency tailwinds here, obviously significant share repurchase plans that have gone into the place since the last quarter. Has currency moved in those share repurchases plans came into effect subsequent to last quarter's end? It just felt like to us, there were some upside for the year. And is Japan just some caution around there, maybe offsetting? Or how should we think about what the puts and takes are going into how you hold the guidance for the year, stable?", "Elisha Finney", "Right. Of course, Jeff, in terms of the currency, you are correct. I mean assuming that it holds at today's levels versus the year-ago level, with the dollar today is about 12% weaker than in the year-ago third quarter, it will give us some help on the top line. But remember, we are naturally hedged. So what it does, is it puts a lot more pressure on the SG&A and the R&D expenses because we have a lot of costs, particularly with proton therapy now in Europe that are also euro-based. So it helps us on the top line, it kind of shuffles some things in the margin. Bottom line, it's fairly unaffected. I mean in the order rate, clearly, we benefit and look forward to competing with a weaker U.S. dollar. On the accelerated share repurchase program, I mean, as you know, historically, we have bought shares back throughout the year, anywhere from 1.5 million to 2 million shares per quarter. So if all we're doing here with the accelerated program is getting upfront delusion by our deduction in basic shares by a couple of months. That would have all equaled out by the end of the year. So it's only a couple of pennies difference by doing this as an accelerated program, versus if we had assumed we just continued our normal ongoing share repurchase. I mean, yes, of course, Japan. We just feel like it's prudent at this point, we're not aware of any particular -- we have some minor issues that we are aware of in terms of our supplier chain. We have mitigation plans in place. I'm very optimistic that we're going to be able to weather this. But I just think it's way early at this juncture not to have some caution for Japan, given that it's anywhere from 10% to 15% of our total business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Jefferies & Company.", "Joshua Jennings - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Just on the international order side, it was better than we expected. Had a very difficult comp at a 33% growth last year and in the face of Japan, headwind as well. Can you just let us in on whether there's a one-time bolus or system orders in any region that would interfere with sequential growth? And International Oncology, within a dollar basis in fiscal Q3, we actually have a much weaker comp?", "Timothy Guertin", "I really can't say so, no. I mean yes, obviously like in any quarter, we had some big deals, which I mentioned during my comments. But truth be said, no. The second quarter doesn't seem to have anything with it. Is that unusual beyond what we would usually see, and so, no. I'm not feeling like it's a special event.", "Joshua Jennings - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "And then, Elisha, on the gross margins side, I know I understand the comp year-over-year in terms of the growth margin expansion in fiscal Q3 last year, but looking sequentially and looking at some of the gross margin tailwinds that you have in this quarter and moving into fiscal Q3, could you just give us some of the puts and takes on why you're going to have sequential contraction in gross margin?", "Elisha Finney", "Sure. As I've said, Josh, for many quarters now, product mix is the biggest driver, and I'm simply just looking at what's in backlog and expected shipments, and the product mix and the proportion of software hardware acceptance revenue et cetera. So very backlog delivery driven. Geographic mix will also play into this and in both Q1 and Q2, we had a very favorable mix into both North America and Japan, which are two of our highest gross margin regions. So moving into Q3, there'll be more international shipments that just has a lower -- typically, has a lower gross margin by a couple of points.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Amit Hazan with Gleacher & Company.", "Amit Hazan - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "I thought maybe I'll ask first about the share repurchase and maybe, just in terms of kind of how you plan on going through your existing share repurchase with both of your cash right now overseas and that, makes kind of full use of your share repurchase a little bit hard to get to, unless you do a similar accelerated buybacks with borrowing as you've been doing. Is that how we should be thinking about that going forward? Or can you sort of talk to the U.S. component of your cash and how you might use of that?", "Elisha Finney", "Yes, well I mean I think we're in somewhat of an enviable position as lots of companies with strong cash flow and a very, very conservative balance sheet. And so we spend a lot of time thinking about how we're going to return, the best way to return this money to shareholders. So we plan to be opportunistic, Amit. I think you should assume that we will continue on our share repurchase program to be determined whether it's just an ongoing program or whether it's an accelerated program. That requires us to have an understanding of where our interest rates are at that time and board discussion et cetera. We are in this accelerated program through August, at which point, we can then do a more repurchases either in the open market. And then obviously, this program, the $13 million runs through the entire next fiscal year. So I think we have a lot of flexibility in terms of how we execute under a program and how much money, which it will depend on how much cash flow we generate in the next two quarters.", "Timothy Guertin", "This is Tim. Let me just comment here. When you look at our P&L for the rest of the year, I mean it is true that there are a lot of ins and outs and mix affects us, especially we're seeing a mix effect in the third quarter that's affecting us, and we have to deal with that. And below the line, there are some artifacts. The fact that last year, we were in austerity mode, and this year, we're coming out of austerity mode. And also, I'm investing now more in our international markets. We're making a substantial number of investments abroad to strengthen ourselves there. And although those are going to cost me money in 2011, I think everybody will be happy we're making those investments in 2012 and 2013. It's just the right thing for us to do. In terms of uses of cash, share buybacks will be part of our procedures, but I also have to say, going forward, as I've looked at the three to five year plan for the company, we're just going to have to step up M&A. I think it is the right thing for us to do. And so Elisha and I are trying to figure out what's the best way to use our cash, and we do that on a quarter-by-quarter basis based upon what's up ahead. I think that we can achieve the vast majority of our growth goals for the period of the next three to five years from our organic growth, but I think we need to supplement that organic growth. And I believe the company throws off enough cash that we can easily accomplish that mission. Long-term, long-term, our goal is to increase our EPS growth rate by -- in the 10% to 15% range. I think I've been saying that for years, we're going to go on doing that, we have a plan for doing that. And big opportunities to do that organically, our international in the Proton business, in our Service businesses, in new products like TrueBeam that can really step it up in our Software businesses. I think our Security business has huge potential and I believe that our Flat Panel business is a gigantic potential going forward. That being said, we need to supplement that with a little M&A activity. So a lot of the things that you're seeing in our P&L reflect decisions that we're making inside the companies. Some of which we can talk about and some of which we can't to make all of these things come true.", "Amit Hazan - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "Just one quick follow-up, if I may for Elisha. Just to be very clear then on the guidance in the share repurchase, I think what you mentioned to an earlier question is that, this is kind of what you expected in your guidance is for the share count to go down. But I can't recall your share count going down by 4 million to 5 million shares in any fiscal year that I've covered you. So are you saying that you were planning on the accelerated share repurchase or something like that or in the aggressive share repurchase when you gave that guidance and that's why it really hasn't changed because it's only a couple months difference from where it would have been? Or is there anything else in the P&L that also accounts for the lack of change in EPS guidance?", "Elisha Finney", "I would say that the tax rate coming in is kind of the higher end of the range, and we did assume that we would have a share repurchase. I don't want to give you all the details as to the exact number that was assumed. But what we did is we made it an accelerated share repurchase, as opposed to an ongoing, just daily open market repurchase program. But yes, we assumed in our guidance as we have more cash at this point than uses for, with this virtually 0% interest rate, with a very large share repurchase authorization that is granted to us by the board. But yes, we were going to step up our share repurchase program. It was the form of repurchase that allowed us to get the full benefit of the reduction in basic shares outstanding by doing it on an accelerated basis.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Tim, I was hoping you could expand a little bit on some of the sites where you're seeing some of the strong uptake of TrueBeam? For example, I think you said you had six at USMD, three at Bayhealth. Are you seeing a lot of the sales of TrueBeams go into centers where you're placing multiple units? And at those centers, are you seeing more like are there upgrade in TrueBeam or are they expanding the number of units they have? Or is it something like -- or are you just placing competitors? Anything you can help us just characterize some of these orders in a little more detail.", "Timothy Guertin", "Okay. When we talk about units like six orders from one side or three orders from another side, that remains unusual, but we of course, we like to brag about unusual things, which is why we brought it up. Now the majority of these deals are classic deals. It's if the customer wants to replace an older machine, and they have a machine that they think is either too old or they have a competitors machine that they don't think is working very well, and so they want to replace it. And they look at TrueBeam as an opportunity to upgrade their clinical and operational profile. Because they got a machine that can do things they can never do before, and they get a machine that's faster than anything they\u2019ve had before. Plus a lot of customers are moving towards stereotactic body radiation therapy. So they're seeing it happen, and they're looking at their existing machines and they're saying can these machines do SBRT? And if the answer is no, and they want to bring SBRT into their program, then they look on TrueBeam as a godsend for them, something that can really help their clinical programs. So it's an operational win and clinical win but otherwise, know, this is normal behavior normal buying behavior. I will say, I think your TrueBeam is doing well against the competition, especially in North America, because North America is where the predominant -- where we're seeing their earliest uptick for TrueBeam. But I think TrueBeam does well against competitors all over the world. I've been in a lot of meetings with customers recently. Where they come in and talk about TrueBeam and they really don't see any other companies machines as being a match for what that machine can do. So nice to see.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And in your prepared remarks, you just talked about a very nice growth in X-ray, and obviously came through in the reported numbers. And I think you referenced a general recovery in the X-Ray imaging market, is that really the underlying dynamics that's driving the strength there? Or is there something more variant-specific that's allowing you to outperform those expectations?", "Timothy Guertin", "Well, we think that there is a recovery. And that's the kind of thing that affects X-ray tubes. But we also think that Flat Panels continue on their march. This is -- we've been saying for years that Flat Panels are going to continue to grow, and I think that's what we're seeing. The Radiographic Panel business has been growing a lot. But I have to say this last quarter, we saw a lot of fluoroscopic dynamic panel growth. So that was very nice to see. And as a company, we're in a kind of unique position. Because when customers come to us and they need an imaging machine, we can offer them both tubes and panels. And so I think what you're seeing now maybe a little bit, we've been kind of predicting this for a wide, and hoping that it will come true. In this quarter, it did come true where we see people wanting to get both tubes and panels from us. So that's another strategy that I think is working for us and should work more for us in the future.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And lastly for Elisha, could you give us some sense as to where you exited the quarter from a share count perspective? I'm assuming that the modest sequential reduction, even though you repurchased just 3.5 million shares has to do with quite a bit of options being exercised, given the movement in the stock. But how should we think about share counts for the balance of the year?", "Elisha Finney", "Well, as I mentioned, we are effectively done with our share repurchase through August at this point. We can go back into the market around mid-August, so you will just need to take your assumptions on option exercises. And the diluted share change depending on the stock price as well. So all of those things that we will, at least cannot buy more shares until we come out of the accelerated program, which ends in the middle of August.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And how far below the 120.4 did you exit the quarter?", "Elisha Finney", "I don't have that number in front of me and we're just not going to give the information out. This is the only kind of share data that we've ever given and which an average over the quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Terwilliger with Duncan Williams.", "James Terwilliger - Duncan-Williams, Inc.", "Couple of quick questions. First of all Tim, could you talk a little bit about the developments in China over the last one to two months. I believe you had maybe a clinical conference or a trade show, and then you also received some sort of regulatory approval there. Could you just update all of us on the developments in China in the last two months please?", "Timothy Guertin", "Yes. First of all  we've been making -- we got SFDA approval for TrueBeam in China, very nice to have, because it means we can sell that product there. Here we were in China, a very important country for us, and we were able to sell our high-end products, so that's very nice to see. We did restructure our sales organization in quarter one and quarter two, and that restructuring is mostly complete at this point. And so I think that the China sales team did well, considering the fact that we had some significant organizational disruption over the course of the last six months. But we needed to make some changes, and now we've done them. We did have a recent trade show and the response was really, really excellent. And that maybe what you're hearing about. And so all of those things are good news for the future. We are manufacturing more and more equipment in China. The UNIQUE product is of course, built there. And with our manufacturer facility, we're conducting more courses than ever, and we're meeting with more customers than ever. And so I'm feeling good about it. And going forward, I think China will be a strong locus of business.", "James Terwilliger - Duncan-Williams, Inc.", "Tim, how should we think about China as a market? I mean in many different markets, China has become number 2 behind the United States, may past United States. Clearly, the U.S. is your number 1 market, you've got the EU and Japan. How should we think about the market opportunity for Varian medical with TrueBeam from today going forward in the Chinese market as a whole?", "Timothy Guertin", "Yes, I wish I could tell you the China market is monolithic in its behavior but it is not. It is true that there is a substantial portion of the market that is interested in high-end machines like TrueBeam, but there's a substantial portion of the market that can\u2019t afford those machines and in these a lot less expensive machines. So over time, we're going to continue to try to create machines that match up with all the segments of the market, the low-end segments and the high-end segment. Our C-Series machine, our standard bread-and-butter machine that we sell is doing very well in China. It matches the need, I think, of the middle of the market. Where I think we can do better, over time is in getting to locations where there is less budget and that's where we're courting more and more [ph] to try and get at that. I think China -- with the entry of TrueBeam into China, I think that we will be able to address the needs of high-end customers better than we ever have before.", "James Terwilliger - Duncan-Williams, Inc.", "A couple of questions on TrueBeam. When I look at these 225-- approximately 225 orders for TrueBeam, could you give me a ballpark percentage on where those orders are coming from? Is it 75% from the U.S.? Or is it less than that?", "Timothy Guertin", "We're going to do some math. Hold on. Yes, okay. It's about more than 65% and less than 70%. And that's based upon unbelievably rapid arithmetic by people sitting in the room with me.", "James Terwilliger - Duncan-Williams, Inc.", "So if I would look at the current installs completed in progress of about 65%, would that be a fair percentage? Maybe 70%, 75% of those installs would all be here in the United States?", "Timothy Guertin", "Yes, it's probably even higher than that, because TrueBeam really started in the U.S. the strongest. And then you'll see that number pick up abroad overtime.", "James Terwilliger - Duncan-Williams, Inc.", "And then in terms of the average length and the trend in terms of TrueBeam, is that coming down? And that will be my last question?", "Timothy Guertin", "Repeat the question. I'm sorry.", "James Terwilliger - Duncan-Williams, Inc.", "The average length of time to install TrueBeam in the U.S., could you have a ballpark figure of what that would be including training? And then is that number trending up or trending down?", "Timothy Guertin", "It's coming down. Our installation costs are coming down for TrueBeam. I think it's probably a little more than five weeks at this point, which is still more than C-Series but it's coming down all the time. Our service teams are just great. I mean they've been growing their business and they've been-- we have some folks, I'd like to name them all but Spencer would kill me. But the fact is we have some people on our service team who've just done a fantastic job of driving down cycle times and costs.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Jumping into the kind of the capital deployment comment, and I think you've mentioned M&A. Can you just talk to, I guess, your appetite within Oncology or to move outside of Oncology? And then Elisha, can you just remind us how much of the cash is overseas right now?", "Elisha Finney", "The lion share is overseas Tycho. It's still probably 90% overseas. Because we're still in a debt position in the U.S.", "Timothy Guertin", "So it's like obviously, that makes international acquisitions cheaper for us than North America acquisition, but it doesn't mean that we're not looking at North American acquisitions. We're talking to, I would say we're talking probably-- we're looking at more things than we've ever looked at. But a lot of them are still small, some of them will move the needle but they won't move it until 2014 or so. But I think they're very important when you look at our three to five year prospects. Some of them are new technologies, things that you've never heard of before. Others are companies that you already know about in the marketplace. So it's a nice mix. Everyone, of them has a strategic element to it. We're not looking at things that don't fit well with who we are as a company. Everything fits well, but it's a lot of work. So in terms of how cash will look differently, I don't think I can give you a quantifiable picture of that. I don't think I really want to give you a quantifiable picture as to how our uses of cash will change in the future, except to tell you that you should expect that we'll spend more money on M&A, and that will probably result in a little less spending on stock buybacks over time. But in terms of any particular quarter or time period, I just can't, I can't tell you, because these deals come to fruition at a pace of their own.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. And then on TrueBeam, are you seeing meaningful change in terms of treatment application areas? So any new kind of clinical areas that are emerging more rapidly? And is anything coming out of the development mode that you...", "Timothy Guertin", "I would say lung and liver, are two areas where -- and I think some interest in pancreas. Now pancreas is a relatively infrequent cancer, so that's not probably going to make a big different in terms of numbers, although it will make an unbelievable difference to cancer patients. But lung and liver, it's very high incidents of disease to lung and deliver, and there I think, if we can make a difference, it will count. We're also coming out with a new version of our software for TrueBeam in the next few months, and that version enabled some of these techniques to be run in an even spiffier fashion than they currently can be done. So I think we're going to see customers who get this software, are going to be experimenting with it. And I'm hoping that sometime in 2012, we'll see some nice papers about the clinical and technical results of using that capability.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then last one, just can you talk on what you're hearing out of D.C.? Any potential changes to reimbursement would be helpful, just given that it\u2019s that time of year.", "Timothy Guertin", "I really haven't heard anything. There were some discussions in, I think, in D.C. about this issue of whether or not, we should change Stark laws, but that doesn't seem to be moving forward very fast with respect to radiation therapy. And we are-- but in terms of reimbursement, no. I really can't say that I'm hearing anything. We'll probably hear something in the summer, but I'm not -- I'm listening to the tom toms in the jungle and I'm really not hearing a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dalton Chandler with Needham & Company.", "Dalton Chandler - Needham & Company, LLC", "Could you just remind us on the-- Japan winding down their stimulus spending? When will that annualized?", "Timothy Guertin", "It just did. It ended at the end of the second quarter a year ago, and this was-- we just graduated.", "Dalton Chandler - Needham & Company, LLC", "Okay. So that should help some with the comps going forward.", "Timothy Guertin", "It does help with the comps going forward. I think people are naturally concerned about North America but it does help in Japan.", "Operator", "And at this time, I'd like to turn the presentation back over to Mr. Sias for closing remarks.", "Spencer Sias", "Thank you for participating.

Management presentations also will be webcast and details will be available on our IR site. We look forward to your participation. And now, here's Tim.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Thanks, Spencer. Good afternoon, and welcome. I'm pleased to report that Varian has finished fiscal year 2011 with another good quarter. Our businesses in Oncology Systems and X-ray Products ended the fourth quarter on a solid footing with growth in revenues, net orders and backlogs. On top of that we had promising developments in our emerging businesses including the booking of an order and revenue for the new Scripps Proton Therapy Center. We are pleased with this overall performance, which we believe has positioned Varian for a continued growth in fiscal 2012. ", "To quickly summarize our results, revenues rose 10% for the quarter to $719 million and 10% for the year to $2.6 billion. Earnings per diluted share increased 9% for the quarter to $0.95 and 16% for the year to $3.44. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $146 million. We closed the quarter with $564 million in cash and cash equivalents and $198 million of debt after spending $267 million to repurchase and retire 4.8 million shares of stock and our quarter-ending backlog grew 15% to a record $2.5 billion. All of our businesses contributed to the order of growth during the quarter, and I'll focus now on the operational highlights for each of our businesses.", "Oncology Systems' fourth quarter net orders totaled $717 million up 9%, with a 2% decline versus strong year-ago comparisons in North America and growth of 22% in international markets. Oncology's net orders for the fiscal year increased 8% to $2.2 billion with 5% growth in North America and 11% growth in international markets, which generated about 55% of total annual net orders for this business. ", "The fourth quarter order growth in our Oncology Systems segment demonstrates the value of having a geographically diverse business together with a strong portfolio of desirable new products and services that advance clinical capabilities and efficiencies. Healthy demand for our versatile TrueBeam platform for radiotherapy and radiosurgery as well as our service business drilled the oncology order growth. We booked nearly 90 orders for TrueBeam during the quarter, bringing total orders for this platform since its introduction to some 380 units. Worldwide unit orders for our accelerators were up for the quarter and for the year. We believe our oncology business gained market share during the year in North America and Europe and succeeded in holding share in Asia with the help of a strong finish in the second half. TrueBeam was key to this performance, particularly in North America. We had a major win in this side in the Midwest where we are displacing several competitive units. We also had big wins at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, Mayo Clinic, UPMC in Pittsburgh, and the Vantage Oncology clinical network. ", "TrueBeam has now been purchased by 28 of the top 50 cancer centers in the U.S. and it constituted roughly 70% of our total high-energy unit machine orders in North America for the fourth quarter and for the year. There was also a strong interest for TrueBeam during the quarter in Europe where have achieved 2 significant wins, which again demonstrate our growing ability to win business in clinics that have traditionally been competitors' strongholds. Lung Hospital in Sweden has been an elected primary site -- research site for years, but it ordered 4 TrueBeam to be installed in 2012. It is also replacing its software with Varian's ARIA and Eclipse products. We had another big success in the Netherlands at the Masteral Clinic, which has been a primary Siemens research site. ", "Subsequent to the close of the quarter, we received 2 orders for TrueBeam unit, 2 TrueBeam units. The center has also ordered a full suite of Varians software for TrueBeam planning and oncology information management. ", "There've been many questions from investors regarding the condition of the European economy and its impact on our business. While we've seen softness in some parts of Europe, overall demand within the region including India in the Middle East contributed to the reported net order growth in the region for the quarter and for the year. Japan led strong net order growth in the Far East during the quarter, Japan was down for the year because of a tough comparable spending from an almost $60 million government stimulus program in the first half of fiscal year 2010. For the year, Far East net orders were flat with double-digit gains in China and several other countries that offset the decline in Japan. ", "Net order growth in the rest of the world including Australia and Latin America was robust for the quarter and for the year, order gains in Latin America stemmed from key wins in Mexico, Panama and the Dominican Republic. Looking around the globe, we booked orders from more than 50 countries during the quarter. The important point here is that we're helped to a great degree by having a global infrastructure and a geographically diversed business. The strength in one part of the world can more than make up for weakness in another region. ", "The oncology order growth was also helped by a very strong service business, where annual orders grew by nearly 15%, more than $650 million, which represents nearly 30% of total annual orders and revenues for this segment. This recurring revenue stream is becoming a bigger portion of our Oncology business. We provide service for installations in more than 100 countries around the world.  ", "Subsequent to the quarter, we acquired Calypso to complement Varian's motion management technology. This will enable Varian to offer cancer clinics additional real-time, non-ionizing tumor-tracking tools, including a single-use implantable transponders for enhancing the precision of radiotherapy and radiosurgery. We expect the Calypso products to enhance our growth as we make them more broadly available to the clinical community through our global marketing and sales channels. ", "The combination of Varian and Calypso technology has already resulted in promising findings for our prostate cancer patients. Earlier this month at ASTRO, the world's largest annual medical meeting for radiation oncology, researchers from 21st Century Oncology in Florida showed that 80% -- I mean, excuse me, that 80 prostate patients treated with radiosurgery using Varian and Calypso technology had favorable health-related quality of life scores and minimal toxicities, suggesting that it may be a viable alternative to longer, more time-consuming radiotherapy treatments. ", "We continue to be excited by our growth possibilities in radiosurgery, and ASTRO occasions several significant medical studies that highlighted the potential of this treatment method. For example, researchers from VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam and Washington University in St. Louis presented separate studies showing the promise of radiosurgery as a potentially viable alternative to surgery for treating early-stage, non-small cell lung cancer. The VU study involving 177 patients demonstrated that at 3 years post-treatment, 93% of the patients in the study did not show local tumor re-growth. This is comparable to outcomes from traditional surgery that involves a measurably higher risk of death from infection, anesthesia, and other competitions. The Washington University study involving inoperable patients with non-small cell lung cancer tumors in an essential part of the lung also showed promising results. These studies suggest that radiosurgery that couples faster, more precise dose delivery with advanced motion management technology could improve outcomes in lung and other types of cancers. ", "ASTRO was a good meeting for Varian. Our booth was jammed with customers, who were interested in clinical capabilities involving new TrueBeam, imaging and motion management features, and improved motion management interface for our Trilogy accelerator, and the integration of our ARIA information system and Eclipse treatment-planning product. ARIA is now usable with an iPad, an unmatched capability that has attracted tremendous interest from clinicians who are looking for a faster and more efficient clinical workflow. ", "Our pivotal technology for treating breast cancer also attracted interest from the clinical community at ASTRO. This technology, using a specialized table accessory for positioning patients on their stomachs rather than on their backs in the traditional manner could protect hearts and lungs during treatment. We also exhibited new brachytherapy products with Augmenix gel technology, which we believe has the potential to reduce complications from prostate cancer treatments by temporarily creating more separation between the prostate and the rectum. Based on our evaluation of this technology, Varian has an option to acquire Augmenix and add to our product portfolio for generating recurring revenue. ", "All in all, our Oncology business is focused on advancing the quality of cancer care in the most cost-efficient manner in every part of the world. We offer a broad product portfolio offering unmatched clinical capabilities, together with the great service. ", "Before leaving Oncology, I'd like to take a moment to congratulate Dow Wilson on his promotion from president of our Oncology Systems business to Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer with responsibility for all of Varian's business segments. And also, Kolleen Kennedy, who's been promoted to President of Oncology Systems, following a very successful 5-year tenure as Vice President and General manager of our fast-growing Oncology service business.", "Turning to X-ray Products. Net orders grew 13% to $126 million for the quarter and increased 15% to $483 million for the year. This was another record year for X-ray Products' net orders, with tubes continuing to comprise about 52% of the total net orders for the business. Growth in net orders for X-ray tubes was led by a high-end and mid-tier products for CT scanning as well as replacement tubes for the aftermarket. Net order growth in our flat panel product line was driven by our dental panels. A positive support from niche panel products for veterinarian and industrial imaging applications. ", "For X-ray Products, fiscal 2011 was a year of stepped-up R&D investment to develop new products and have the potential to drive continued growth in fiscal 2012. We will be displaying several important new products at the RS&A show in Chicago at the end of November. This includes several new X-ray tubes that are designed to operate and film imaging systems for mammography, surgery and other applications. We are also developing several new flat panel image-detection products, including a wireless panel for digital radiography, a large area dynamic panel for our fluoroscopy and cone-beam, CT-imaging and panels for next-generation tomography systems. Customer interest in these new products has been strong. We expect them to continue to contribute to the growth in this segment in the latter half of fiscal 2012.", " ", "Switching now to our Other category. We had excellent net orders growth for both our part-Varian Particle Therapy business and our SIP, Security and Inspection Products business. Combined net orders for this category rose by $117 million to $124 million for the quarter including the $88 million order for our ProBeam Proton Therapy System that is now being installed at the new Scripps facility.

This report describes our efforts to extend patient access to advanced care, improve clinical outcomes, optimize safety, and make a positive impact on the communities where we operate. The Varian sustainability report also outlines our government structure for this program and summarizes our policies and achievements and goals, while enhancing our performance in these areas. You can access it on our website, and we hope it gives you some useful insights into how we operate. ", "And so now, here's Elisha.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Thanks, Tim, and hello, everyone.  Before I get started, I want to clarify that I am first going to present the numbers for continuing operations including the Scripps project. I will then break out the impacts of the Scripps project for you. While Tim has already covered net orders, I want to briefly talk about the constant currency growth rates for the quarter, which were impacted by unprecedented volatility in the global foreign exchange market. Oncology, which was most heavily impacted by currency movement, grew net orders in the quarter by 9% in dollars or 5% in constant currency. Oncology to Europeans, net orders growth rate was 10% in dollars and flat in constant currency. The Far East was up 30% in dollars and 24% in constant currency.  And net order growth in the rest of the world was 64% in dollars and 54% in constant currency. .", "Fourth quarter revenues for the company increased 10% to $719 million with constant currency growth of 7%. Oncology Systems posted a 7% increase in revenues, X-ray Products posted a gain of 11% and total revenues from businesses under the Other category increased by $18 million or 53% with declines in the SIP business more than offset by the Scripps Proton Therapy project. ", "For the full fiscal year, total company's revenues were up 10% in dollars and 8% in constant currency. The fourth quarter gross margin for the company fell by a little more than 0.5 point to 42%. Oncology Systems gross margin increased by more than 1.5 points to 45% due primarily to higher TrueBeam mix, improved installation and warranty costs. ", "X-ray Products gross margin was about even with the year-ago quarter at 41% as pricing pressure and panel products was offset by higher volumes and improved quality cost for tube products. For the full fiscal year including the Scripps project, the total company gross margin was up about 0.25 point to 43.7%. ", "Fourth quarter SG&A expenses were $97 million or 13% of revenues even as a percentage of revenue with the year-ago quarter. Fourth quarter R&D expenses were $44 million or 6% of revenues, also even as a percentage of revenue with the year-ago quarter. ", "For the fiscal year, on a combined basis, operating expenses were up about 25 basis points to 21% of revenue. ", "Moving down the income statement, fourth quarter operating earnings were up 7% to $160 million or 22% of revenue. For the fiscal year, operating earnings were up 10% to $588 million or 23% of revenues even with the prior year as a percentage of revenue. Depreciation and amortization totaled $14 million for the quarter. The effects of tax rate was 30.9% for the quarter, up almost 2 points from the year-ago quarter, due largely to the geographic mix of earnings. For the fiscal year, the effective tax rate was 30.6%, down about 0.5 point from the prior year. ", "Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased significantly from the year-ago quarter to $116 million due largely to our ongoing share repurchases. Diluted EPS rose 9% to $0.95 for the quarter and rose 16% to $3.44 for the year. ", "Now, before turning to the balance sheet, let me summarize the impacts of the Scripps Proton Therapy project for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. We are recognizing revenue under contract accounting rules using the percentage of completion method. Under this method, revenues are initially recognized equal to cost with the expectation that profits would be recognized towards the end of the project. The $33 million of revenue recognized in the fourth quarter reflects our progress to date. Because the proton revenue was recorded at 0 profit, the fourth quarter gross margin for the total company was diluted by 2 percentage points and the EBIT margin was diluted by one percentage point. ", "Now, turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $564 million, debt of $198 million and stockholder equity of $1.2 billion. Our 2011, balance sheet now reflects our initial funding of our recently announced $115 million debt facility for the Scripps Proton Center. We recorded a $19.2 million short-term investment under current assets. DSO improved by 2 days from the year-ago quarter to 80. Fourth quarter cash inflow from operations was $146 million and short-term borrowing for the quarter was $181 million. The primary use of cash was $267 million for the stock repurchase program. We have approximately 7.4 million shares remaining under the repurchase authorization in effect for the fiscal year 2012. ", "Now, I'll turn it back over to Tim for the outline.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Thanks, Elisha. While we believe Varian is positioned for continued growth, with the wide array of new products capable of cost-efficient, advanced medical treatments in X-ray imagining. Furthermore, we have established a global presence including -- in important emerging markets, and we continue to see good potential in our Particle Therapy and Security and Inspection Businesses. For fiscal year 2012, including the Calypso acquisition, we believe that revenues could increase by 10% to 11% over fiscal 2011 totals and net-net earnings per diluted share from continuing operations could rise in the mid-teens to a range of $3.92 to $4.02. ", "For the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, total company revenues could increase by about 8% to 9% over the prior year. ", "In addition to the cost related to the Calypso acquisition, we expect that the first quarter net earnings will be affected by a substantially higher tax rate versus the year-ago quarter and a loss from our equity investment in dpiX related to the closure of the out-of-date panel manufacturing facility in Palo Alto. As a result, we believe net earnings per diluted share from continuing operations in the first quarter will be in the range of $0.74 to $0.75. ", "So now we're ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes the line of Amit Bhalla with Citi.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I wanted to start just with the revenues in the quarter. And if I remember back to fiscal 4Q '10, the Oncology business missed in that period also. There was a number of delivery push outs, install time issues, et cetera. And this quarter, Oncology Systems revenue also fell short of our expectation and consensus. Can you just walk through what happened in Oncology?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Sure. Let me start, Amit, by saying that Oncology was within spitting distance of our expectation. So the impact was really from our other businesses and so I'm happy to walk you through that. The revenue in deposits came from some slightly different places than we had first expected. SIP and X-ray Products were down on a combined basis somewhere between $12 million and $13 million in the quarter. And as you know, X-ray Products, we had the issue in Japan, which impacted us somewhat, and most of this coming from SIP, which is just a very lumpy business and where we had push-outs in the quarter. Good news is that the SIP sales target for FY '12 looks very strong so we will make those up as we move into next year. At the proton business, we had built in some proton revenue and let me just say that, that SIP and X-ray revenue was at about a 40% margin. So that was down and in return, we had higher-than-expected Proton Therapy revenue in the quarter and that's at a 0% margin. So as you know, that was not exactly a fair trade, if you will, on the top line. Fortunately, the -- as I mentioned, oncology was within spitting distance of what we were expecting. But we did have some territorial mix that impacted it. We had unprecedented quarter-over-quarter changed in FX rates and so as we sat down and looked at revenue around the globe, when you converted that into dollar, depending on where that revenue came from, you could get very different results. So I'm actually quite proud that we got -- that within -- that we hit the 10% number and that the Oncology gross margin made up a lot of difference because it came in significantly higher than what we were expecting. And then the last thing I would add in terms of the Q4 that was a little odd is, because of the intra-quarter wild fluctuations in FX, we had a $2 million hedging loss that flowed through SG&A from just doing our balance sheet hedges. That is fairly unprecedented, we tend to be closer to maybe $0.5 million up or down and had $2 million in the quarter from those FX losses. So that's really kind of where the changes were from what we initially expected.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "So just to follow up there. For Oncology, so there wasn't any issues with install timer push outs? And then secondly, can you just -- Tim, you said that linear accelerators were up worldwide, were they up in North America?", "Elisha W. Finney", "We were trying -- I'm trying to think back if we were talking about orders or sales when we were talking about the units.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "I think we were talking about orders. We were talking about orders, yes.", "Elisha W. Finney", "I think we were talking about orders. So the global order units were up. And then the U.S., yes, the units placements would have been up, I mean we saw, again, we saw 10% growth in sales for North America, so that was quite healthy.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And I just want to ask you a quick guidance question or just to understand what's implied inside these -- in the numbers. In fiscal 2012, if I assume that there is roughly like $44 million of Calypso and Proton revenue that adds about 200 basis points to the number, to guidance. Can you tell me how much you're assuming in your guidance? And also for fiscal 4Q, how much Calypso was in the Oncology order book?", "Elisha W. Finney", "There was -- in the fourth quarter, there was nothing. That was an acquisition that was made subsequent to quarter end. I would just tell you that Calypso had annualized sales of somewhere around $15 million. We do believe that Calypso can help our orders -- topline orders, next year by about a point or so. You're going to get some lag on that, turning into revenue growth because again, we tend to -- our expectation is we will bundle most of these with the oncology sale and they'll be in backlog for about 12 to 15 months. So we feel very good about the orders for Calypso moving into FY '12, most of the revenue bumps won't come until FY '13. In terms of protons, that's a -- boy, it's a tough one. Unfortunately, it's not going to move the EPS number, but it can make your margins look very strange. We are expecting somewhere close to $20 million additional revenue for the Scripps project in FY '12 and I would give that a fairly high probability, just given that we are already delivering under that contract. There could be additional revenue, as high as a total of $50 million, if we were to get another order depending on when that comes in the year and how much of the percentage of completion we have completed by that time. So again, that's why we're putting a range around this, but the Proton business is going to put some volatility in that number.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. So you're 8% to 9% -- I'm sorry, your 9% to 11% revenue growth is -- includes about 200 basis points from those 2 issues?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yes, it includes about $20 million of Proton revenue that again, we're pretty confident of, and you can assume somewhere around another $25 million or so that we're just estimating, could be potential revenue with if and when we book an additional order.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "But I think in terms of -- the point that we should make is in terms of guidance on EPS, Calypso loses money next year, the Proton business that we're booking makes no profit, so we're making that increase in our EPS through organic measures and...", "Elisha W. Finney", "Margin improvement.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Margin improvements and so that I think that -- I think we have, what, $0.05 of...", "Elisha W. Finney", "$0.05 to $0.06 for Calypso and it's a little loaded more in the first half than the second because we have some transaction costs and severance and those were for paying in Q1. And then some people will be transitioning off in the consultants and whatnot.", "Operator", "And your next question comes the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just a couple of quick questions. First, Elisha, just -- you talked about the gross margin impact from the Proton order. I espied just for the gross margins for the Proton order, I actually get stronger GM's than I guess we were expecting. I wonder if you could kind of walk us through some of the dynamics that may have attributed to stronger underlying gross margin trends, whether it was easing some retrofit issues from last quarter or a TrueBeam?", "Elisha W. Finney", "No, it was largely driven by TrueBeam. We -- our Oncology had a very strong margin, 45% in the quarter, it was up 167 basis points quarter-over-quarter, largely driven by higher percentage of TrueBeam at a higher margin and some improved installation and warranty costs as we continue to get faster on the -- on these installations. The X-ray Products margin, as I mentioned, was roughly even with the year-ago quarter. We're seeing a little bit of pricing pressure with the RAD panels and some mix between tubes and panels tend to drive that margin as well. So really, the total impact of the gross margin came from bookings, $33 million of revenue at a 0 margin. If you were to strip out Scripps, the total company gross margin would would've been up 140 basis points quarter-over-quarter. So a very good margin performance.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Great, very helpful. And then maybe, Elisha, one more question on fiscal '12 guidance. Can you just give us a sense in terms of your service business, which has been kind of a powerful driver of growth. How you expect that service business to perform in fiscal '12 versus fiscal '11?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yes, it had done very, very well. The -- I'm not going to sit here and say that level of performance is going to continue indefinitely, but I think we will definitely see double-digit performance in the service business. Somewhere around the 10% to 12% range.", "Operator", "Your next question comes the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.", "David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to see if we could -- just pick back up on Calypso a little bit and I just have a couple -- one logistical question, can you just remind us where the amortization gets booked through to the P&L? And of the $0.05 to $0.06, how much of that is really noncash versus cash expense. Then a follow-up to that would be just as it relates to Calypso specifically, what are sort of the clinical milestones or data points we should be watching out for over the next call it, 6 to 12 months just to sort of track the progress of that technology?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "I'll start with the non-numerics stuff. Basically, the Calypso folks have introduced some data for prostate that -- and so we're going to be talking to a lot of people in the United States about adding Calypso into their prostate programs. So you -- there's no big events there, it's just a continued activity on our part. For lung, Calypso is trying to get approval for a lung marker and of course, as you can tell from the presentation I made today and other presentations, we think that both operable and inoperable lung cancer can benefit from more radiation therapy treatment and -- but the trick with lung is you have to hit the target. And for especially prosteric types of treatment, it's important that, that be extremely accurate. So we're hoping that the Calypso device will get approved by the FDA. Obviously, they're in trials to do that. I'm not going to predict the date today because that's up to things that are beyond my control. But I would hope that maybe 6 months from now I can give you much a better insight into when that approval would be expected. But I think Elisha's remarks earlier are very important to us. Calypso -- we didn't invest in Calypso because we think it's going to have a huge and positive impact on us in 2012. In fact, we expected to lose $0.05 or $0.06 for us in 2012. Calypso is an investment for the sake of 2013 and 2014. That's when I hope to have more FDA approvals, that's when I expect the business that we got this year for prostate starts to be delivered in terms of sales.  So now I'll now turn it over to Elisha to comment on the financial stuff.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Great. David, so of that $0.05 to $0.06, most of that is cash-related, the -- we are not finalized on the purchase price allocation as of yet, but I am estimating at this point, the amortization will be about $0.01. That will flow through the SG&A, and that is included in that $0.05 to $0.06. So most of that is -- obviously, we had some legal and accounting and things to close the transaction, we had some severance, we are actually taking the Calypso operating losses that they've had over the last year and cutting that in half. So we are making progress, but we are continuing to invest quite heavily, particularly in the regulatory area so that we can get this FDA clearance that Tim mentioned.", "David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and then just on -- more on the target SG&A and the P&L. Maybe just give us some sense as to directionally what's happening with discretionary spending. Operating margins that I think we're kind of roughly flat in 2011 and you had talked to that kind of some lost quotas -- I think you call them austerity measures that had pulled back spending in fiscal '10 some of which returned in fiscal '11. Maybe you should just give us a sense that we're back on the trajectory that sort of annual 50 basis point of operating margin expansion that you had previously targeted?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Sure. I think for fiscal year '12, once you go through your model, you'll see that we are modeling out again somewhere around 23% or so of the EBIT margin. That is including the dilutive effects of Calypso, that is including the shutdown of the dpiX manufacturing facility, the Proton revenue, so it's a little hard to compare apples to apples, but in terms to answer your question, I would say we are still cautious on spending, we are not out like drunken sailors by any stretch of the imagination, but we do plan to get salary increases in equity brands and all of the normal things that we do year-over-year.", "Operator", "And your next question comes the line of Vivian Cervantes with Kaufman Brothers.", "Vivian Cervantes - Kaufman Bros., L.P., Research Division", "I wanted to focus a little bit on some a qualitative-type questions. The TrueBeam order rate is growing nicely and I try and balance that against your revenue guidance of plus 10%, plus 9% to plus 11%, and it looks like acquisition and Scripps adds roughly, by my calculation, roughly 100 basis points or so. Does this mean that you've got an extra 100 basis points coming from just good order flow and turning that order into revenue?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Well, we did have significant orders and increasing backlog. And we also, as Elisha said, we had some business that moved from quarter 4 into next year, which gives us a little extra tailwind which is nice to see. So all of those things have an effect. And I'm going to say about TrueBeam, the bulk of our TrueBeam business has been in North America. True -- if we start -- we're to see more pick up in TrueBeam internationally, and if we start to get a lot of TrueBeam international orders, then I think that, that's just hugely positive for us. So some of that obviously, is built into 2012, but I think the European and Asian story for TrueBeam is really going to help us in  2013 -- in 2014. I think when we introduced TrueBeam, I told everybody that it would take 2 years for that to hit the international markets, that it would first hit the U.S. market, because people set those budgets a long time in advance, internationally. And so I think that, that's proven to be the case. I was just at a meeting of users of scientific meeting of our users in Berlin and there are a lot of presentations about TrueBeam and a tremendous amount of optimism about the product. Not just from physicians and physicists but also from operators. I mentioned at ASTRO that I had met with our customer who went on and on about how much they love TrueBeam and it's really nice to hear. So I think all in all, it's a product that's going to give us a lot of strength. So we'll see orders strength into TrueBeam in 2012 and some of our uplift in terms of revenue is from that. And -- but I think our real potential -- and Oncology, did nearly, what, 45% margin in the fourth quarter. I mean, this is incredible what TrueBeam has done for us. So I think we're going to see that manifest even more strongly in the future because I think we can bring up our European and Asian margins as well.", "Vivian Cervantes - Kaufman Bros., L.P., Research Division", "That's helpful. So it sounds to me like are signals are go in terms of placing the TrueBeam systems, you're not seeing any delays in the places, such that you're able to recognize that net order into revenue in fiscal '12 without hang-ups?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "No, we, we're not -- there's nothing deferred, we're installing them quickly, our install times have come down very nicely, what, 3 or 4 weeks now, for 4 weeks for install times. And so I'm just -- we've hit the ground running.", "Elisha W. Finney", "We have now installed close to 150 TrueBeams so we've gone through a lot of learning doing all of that.", "Vivian Cervantes - Kaufman Bros., L.P., Research Division", "That's helpful. Shifting gears to x-rays. I appreciate the comments made on the new mammography system that's to be featured at RSA. Can you just sort of help us understand why this would be differentiated and why customers will want to look at this, particularly given the current base right now of selenium system?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Well, the selenium systems are very delicate and they have lifetime problems, they produce very good pictures, but they are not as reliable as amorphous silicon and so -- but people have preferred them because of image quality. What's happening now is that we've been able to make amorphous silicon products and then -- and the new generations of coatings performed so well and gets such high resolution that those panels are producing images good enough to use in these kinds of mammography systems. So I'm not saying we're going to get 100% market share and all that and far from it, but I am saying we're going to start to see some penetration of these kinds of panels which are cheaper to make, and more reliable and easier to ship into more and more mammography systems over time, so we're happy to see it.", "Vivian Cervantes - Kaufman Bros., L.P., Research Division", "Okay, so it doesn't sound like customers who are entrenched in the current amorphous system have to make big changes into how they're producing the materials they use. You're essentially giving the same product, but a better product?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "That's what we believe and so what we want to do now is -- obviously, we want to try to woo those people into offering this as maybe as an option on their product. So that they don't all have to deliver amorphous selenium, they have an option that they can deliver to customers. But that's what  Mr. Kluge has to do starting at RS&A is try to talk more people into doing that. And of course we already have been in contact with a lot of people who've seen the stuff that we do and people are incorporating our new mammography panel in their products. But I think 2012 is a year in which we're going to try to persuade a lot of people to consider this technology instead of what they already use.", "Operator", "And your next question comes the line of Dalton Chandler with Needham & Company.", "Dalton L. Chandler - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "I apologize if you gave this, but did you give the tax rate that underlies your EPS guidance?", "Elisha W. Finney", "For fiscal year '12?", "Dalton L. Chandler - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Right.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yes. It will be about 31%, Dalton.", "Dalton L. Chandler - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, and what about the share count?", "Elisha W. Finney", "We haven't guided to share count and obviously, fully diluted shares depend largely on what's going on with the stock price as well. I think you should assume that once this stock repurchase program that we are in, that we will have some ongoing share repurchases as we've done over the last several years. And then just building your stock price assumptions we ended the quarter -- we ended Q4 within 116 million shares outstanding, I believe.", "Dalton L. Chandler - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Then just shifting to R&D, you did mention you had a pretty good bump in the year as you're working on some new products. Should we expect that to moderate going forward? Could it even come back down a little bit? Or what -- how would you model it?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "No I'm -- I love R&D. So we will probably grow it as fast as we grow sales and maybe a little bit faster.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Just going to start with Calypso. Just a couple there, Calypso had 110 installed base units, I'm just wondering if any of those were already Varian -- had Varian equipment on the 1x side. If they did not, how long would that transition take? And then on the earn outs for Calypso, I'm just wondering what is the actual trigger for these earn outs and what is the timetable?", "Elisha W. Finney", "It's a 2-year earn out and the trigger is they have to exceed as of the expected units, and we haven't disclosed what those units are. But once they exceed what we expect on the installs going forward for the next 2 years then there's additional money.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "In terms of the rest -- first part of your question, I don't think I have that number, but I believe -- looking around the room at the people who're sitting here with me that it's going to be probably consistent with our normal share in North America, which is about 70% of units. So I would expect that, that's the number and we don't have any reason to believe it's lower or higher than that number.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then Elisha, last quarter you mentioned freestanding clinics had a little bit of a tough time on the credit side of things, getting access to credit. Although, today in Europe was a good announcement. Markets were up, and that's great. But did you notice that was an issue this quarter? And if indeed it is an issue, will the company consider using its balance sheet on the freestanding clinics side for systems and upgrades somewhat to how it's using it for the proton business?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Well, it really -- let me just say, it didn't circle up to my desk as being a big issue in the past quarter. And I've got financing folks on staff to go out and facilitate this financing, and it's been business as usual. So I don't think there's anything particular going on in the freestanding side right now. We have used our balance sheet on the proton business, and we used a good piece of it and we would always consider doing something for other segments, but at this point, it just has not been applied.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "They haven't asked us to, so Elisha hasn't had to be a drunken sailor yet in terms of doing that. So I think that's going to be okay. We have seen some nice activity on the part of freestandings in North America in the fourth quarter, so I think that they're getting access to money.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Two last ones for me, quick ones. One, just a housekeeping one on the balance sheet, $180 million in short-term borrowings. Is that just related to Scripps or...", "Elisha W. Finney", "No, no, no. That was related to our revolving line of credit that we drew down to do our accelerated share repurchase program.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Now Scripps is...", "Elisha W. Finney", "We are in the process of paying that down.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "What you have to realize is we built a lot of the inventory for Scripps. So loaning the money is, to some extent, using cash we've already spent.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, Tim, maybe the last one, just a general comment on reimbursement. We're approaching November. Just any of your thoughts heading into November on reimbursement for next year.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "We are -- well, to remind everybody on reimbursement, for hospital-based reimbursement, we are expecting about 1.5% for -- not counting -- let me -- I'll give you the answer and then I'll fix it. 1.5% for freestandings. The number varies, but it's around 6%, 7% negative win, which was anticipated. If the super committee does not come back, the super Congress does not come up with an answer, there will be a 2% on top of that, which won't affect hospitals at all. I mean, well, it will affect them, but I don't think it will affect their behavior. That will be harder, I think, on freestandings, and of course, we don't know what the super Congress is going to do. I guess November 26 is the deadline for a proposal, so we have not -- we don't know there. We'll see the final numbers next week, but we have no reason to believe that the numbers are going to be any different than those numbers.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Anthony, let me come back to one thing you said. I just want to make sure that we don't mislead on your question regarding the debt facility. We have committed $115 million to this facility. We have only funded at this point $19 million, which is new on our balance sheet, and this will be drawn down over a period of time. So a small portion has been funded for the centers to date.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then again, that 6%, 7% is not including what potentially could come from the super committee vote?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "That's correct. It could be -- for freestandings, they could be affected more. But this is -- they've all taken this into account. There's nothing here that they haven't known about for 3 or 4 months, and their behavior's still been good. And you have to remember, we have done a tremendous job in the last few years at driving cost out of what it takes to do radiation therapy when you use our equipment. It is true that if you use our competitor's equipment, if I do say so myself, you don't get the throughput that you get with our stuff. But in treatment planning and in delivery, we give people very good performance and that's why they prefer us. And so I think that everybody expects the pricing to go down, the payments to go down in radiation therapy. And I think one of the reasons why they like what we're doing is because we've shown them how you can use our stuff to get your cost out. And I think we can -- so I believe we can stay ahead of the curve.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I've been jumping between calls here, so forgive me if I repeat a question here that you've already had. But Elisha, I want to look at guidance here for a second. The $0.05 to $0.06 Calypso dilution that you're talking about, how much of that is being offset? Can you just remind me by the increased interest income from the loan to Scripps?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Well, again, only $19 million has been funded. As you know, it's an 8.25% currently, and that will be drawn down anywhere from $1 million to $3 million per month by the end of the year, somewhere around maybe $35 million to $40 million will be funded. Also, that has to be offset that we are borrowing more to, under our revolver, to do our share repurchase program.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. So let me ask it this way, and I'll walk through all that math offline I guess. But is the Scripps funding expected to add a few pennies or not as much as the $0.05 to $0.06 dilution on Calypso?", "Elisha W. Finney", "It would take an average of maybe $25 million outstanding in 8.25% and that's your number. That's it.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Yes. No, that's helpful. So then as I think about the rest of your guidance, it's the first quarter guidance that I'm still confused by the $0.74 to $0.75. How much of the dpiX closure, how much of that is going to cost to EPS?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Sure. Let me kind of walk you through the first quarter of '12, which I understand on the surface looks a little confusing. The problem with the near-perfect quarter is you always have to anniversary it the following year, and that's exactly what happened in the year-ago quarter. Virtually every single metric moved in the right direction. So if you look back into Q1 of last year, earnings per share were up 27%. So in this first quarter, again, you can see sales will be somewhere around 8% to 9% growth. We have $0.04 to $0.05 dilution from both Calypso, which is roughly $0.02 and then roughly $0.03 from the shutdown of dpiX. And that's a onetime charge, and that will all hit in the first quarter. If you look in the year-ago quarter, oncology had an unsustainably high gross margin at 47%, and we are now modeling that will be closer to the 45%, which is still very strong but will not be at the year-ago level. And then in the year-ago quarter, we also had that reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, which drove the tax rate down to 29% versus 33% or so in this Q1. And that's about a $0.04 delta right there just on the tax rate.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And that 33% Q1 tax rate, you're still, I think I caught before I jumped to another call, 31% for fiscal '12 is what you're still guiding to though?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Correct.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "So a lot of what we lose in Q1 just kind of gates into probably higher estimates on street numbers in the back half of the year?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yes. And I would just focus on for the full year and admittedly, $0.10 is a relatively big spread. It's early. The FX rates have been all over the board, and so we've put a slightly broader range on that. But if you take the midpoint, it'll put you at mid-teens growth year-over-year.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "I think altogether, next year looks pretty good. It just doesn't look so good in the first quarter. And a lot of things have just happened coincidentally in one quarter, and that's what we're trying to explain.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Yes. No, understood, Tim, and I guess what I was trying to feel out is it almost looks like Q2 through Q4 next year you're guiding to 20% plus EPS growth.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Well, we'll get to that guidance when we get to it by quarter. But for the year, we still think this looks pretty good.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Yes. And another one I'm sure you won't bite on, Tim, but I'm going to ask anyway. I mean, just kind of your overall outlook on orders for next year. Maybe just qualitatively you're up international and U.S.?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Well, obviously, I'm feeling better about Europe today than I was yesterday, so that's good news. I'm feeling good about that. In terms of North America, obviously, there's still turmoil. I want to see our Medicare reimbursement rates come out. But yet, even if -- I don't -- I just can't contemplate that thing getting much worse in the 2% that people were talking about, which I think is kind of a no op for the radiation/oncology business. So I would -- I'm not particularly worried at that point. It's more of a long-term consideration for the North American market. In Asia, we'll now have thoroughly graduated from Japan. And so I think that we have some opportunities there. We're showing share growth in China, and we're very strong in Japan and other parts of Asia and the rest of the world. You saw the rest of the world numbers for this quarter. So I'm kind of bullish on international overall. But for Europe, I think a lot depends on what that currency number does for us. And I want to say while I got you on the line. We started this year giving a range of guidance of I think $3.34 to $3.39. We came in at $3.44. So although the fourth quarter we were disappointed by some slipouts that happened, not in oncology and not in -- well, but happened in X-ray and Security, we nonetheless did well. And so I bet just -- and some of that business has slid into 2012 and gives me optimism for 2012. So I would have to say overall, I'm more bullish now than I was even a week ago about next year.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "All right. That's encouraging. And yes, I guess just last, let me just follow up one more. I thought I was done there. But if I look 2 years ago, your North -- your orders on a constant currency basis were much softer in North America, much stronger international. This past year now in fiscal '11, as I update my model, is pretty evenly balanced. You think when we get through 2012, you think we're going to look more like 2010 or 2011? Are they more balanced there in '12, or will one geographic area outpace the others?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "I guess my view is that North America -- in the past I've seen North America slow down and then eventually you just get a return. They just come back because they just have to buy. I don't think -- I'm not expecting a strong return in 2012 necessarily, but I am starting to see signs that people are starting to buy in North America as we emerge from this. So that leaves me to believe in the long run, we're going to see greater North American strength than we've seen for a while at some point here. I can't tell you exactly when, but some time in 2012, 2013, we're going to see more strength in North America. Is it going to be more balanced? Well, it's like I say, there are 310 million people in North America and 6.5 billion people outside of North America. Ultimately, we're just going to have to grow faster outside of North America than we do inside. But the nice thing is that if we can develop products for those markets and if we can get nice products like TrueBeam to be well accepted in those markets, then we can increase not only our share but we can increase our gross margin in our international businesses. So in the long run, I'm very bullish about international, and I'm very bullish that we can increase our profitability from our international business.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Junaid Husain with Ticondorega Securities.", "Junaid Husain - Ticonderoga Securities LLC, Research Division", "Elisha, just a quick question for you on collections and bad debt in Europe just given the situation, which, again, hopefully is improving after today. What's your DSOs look like in Europe? How does this compare to U.S. and then how does it compare to a year ago?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Well, it's -- I don't have an exact number for you, Junaid, but it is higher in international markets than in the U.S. We feel like we have adequate reserves on the books for whatever we might be experiencing in Spain or Portugal, et cetera. So I don't anticipate that there's going to be any real surprises coming out of there. We do have a few hemo plans in certain countries that we're executing on. And DSO, we have, if you average the last 4 quarters we've been right at 80 and yet again this quarter, we're right at 80. So I would say it's just kind of business as usual.", "Junaid Husain - Ticonderoga Securities LLC, Research Division", "Got it. And then, again, in Europe, your competitor over there can be, call it, fairly aggressive on the pricing side. Just, again, given the more macro issue going on in Europe, how has this impacted pricing?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "As we started to introduce new products in Europe, I think our pricing has done reasonably well. I have to say I think our competitors are pursuing an M&A strategy, and we've been pursuing an organic growth strategy and these are different strategies for growth. Both of them have their merits, but I think it has enabled us to hold our pricing better than you might otherwise think.", "Junaid Husain - Ticonderoga Securities LLC, Research Division", "And that's actually a good segue to your acquisition of Calypso. Tim, could you help us understand how this plays into other motion management strategies that you've been looking at, for example, Vision RT? Would you -- after Calypso, would you think of perhaps moving away from Vision RT? Or alternatively, would you even consider something more strategic similar to your deal with Calypso?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Well, motion management is one of those things where there are a lot of different ways to do the problem, to solve the problem. And to some extent, I guess you might say -- I don't know if you ever played roulette. We talked about drunken sailors earlier, so I'm going to use a gambling example. If you're playing roulette and you bet on 0 and double 0 and all the numbers, you stand a greater chance of winning. So in a way, we're betting on all the numbers here. We -- one way to know whether or not you're positioned properly is to use what I call active markers, and that's what Calypso makes. And active markers are nice because they -- the Calypso marker has -- you don't have to use ionizing radiation, it tells you where it is. Some people are going to prefer imaging. And of the people who prefer imaging, some of them are going to want to use what I call passive markers, which means gold seeds. They don't do anything except they're visible under radiation, and some want to use no markers at all. And we really don't know -- if you talk to one customer, you talk to one customer about how they prefer to solve this problem. We're going to provide an answer for the people who want to use no marker, we're going to provide an answer for the people who want to use passive markers and we're going to use -- we're going to provide an answer for people who want to use the Calypso markers. In lung, think about lung, because lung is very important to us going forward, but also liver. In lung and liver, if you want to do stereotactic treatments, it's a little different. In the lung, some lesions are visible when you treat them in the lung. So you can use regular imaging methods and maybe no fiducials inside the lung for visual -- for visible tumors. For other kinds of tumors that are hard to see and hard to distinguish between the background, then a marker might be very good. And the nice thing about the Calypso marker is you don't have to use extra x-ray to do imaging during that period. For liver, you can't see tumors at all in the liver with traditional imaging methods. And so Calypso could be very useful inside the liver, but also passive markers would be useful. So we don't know how this is going to play, but we do know that a lot of people love the Calypso product. Obviously, we didn't buy it without talking to users, and a lot of users are very bullish about it. But this is going to be -- it's not a one-size-fits-all market in terms of how this will be solved.", "Junaid Husain - Ticonderoga Securities LLC, Research Division", "Got it. I like the drunken gamblers analogy. Tim, we're about a month away from RSNA. I know that's Bob Kluge's time to shine versus the larger oncology business. I know that you've all already renewed with one of your larger OEMs for the year on the X-ray business. But as we head into RSNA and with new products coming, could you give us a sense for this meeting and it's magnitude to the X-ray business and perhaps signing up some other larger OEM customers?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Well, this is where Bob gets to show his new stuff, and he will be showing lots of new products. And obviously, a lot of his customers already sort of had guessed or know what we're coming up with and what we're going to show at RSNA, but we can show a broader variety of things. So for him, RSNA is an important show. He's way more busy. All of the oncology people -- we talk to people who come in from the Chicago area and from the Midwest, but otherwise, that's just not a big oncology show. But there's a tremendous number of customer meetings that goes on for Bob Kluge that -- where we get to meet important customers that are major buyers from us. So it's a huge show for Bob Kluge.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.", "Tycho W Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "First question. Tim, appreciate the color you've provided on reimbursement before. Just wondering if you can comment on the dynamics of the private payers? There's obviously been some noise there with Blue Cross Blue Shield in Massachusetts. And just wondering what you're hearing from customers about pushback from the private payers? And is your view that this ultimately doesn't impact demand on the freestanding side?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Yes, we've heard things like New England Blue Cross has been limiting IMRT to prostate, which is strange because we're head and neck -- you'd be crazy not to do IMRT for head and neck patients because you're going to experience tremendous cost. So we've seen insurers do nuts things before and obviously, we're going to still see insurers do crazy things. We've  seen some Western insurers blocking prostate SPRT, and we've seen insurers blocking IMRT for breast. IMRT for breast is probably not going to be well paid for except in certain kinds of cases, and there's a difference between left breast and the right breast for treatment. So it's hard to say where that's going to go. We've seen clinicians successfully challenge nonsensical denials, and I think we will continue to be and we're investigating. We're putting money into clinical trials to provide more clinical evidence. But I don't know what I can tell you. Obviously, some insurers are going to ignore the facts. But if you have relatives that live in New England and they don't get IMRT when they have head and neck cancers treated, then they ought to do something nasty to their insurer.", "Tycho W Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then you mentioned the clinical trials. I mean, to what degree do you feel a need to get a cost of that versus just coordinating? And obviously, we've seen some papers come out of the SPRT release at ASTRO. So how much are you able to quantify what you're spending on coordinating these trials?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Well, we spend a lot of money every year on research that's done by customers. Now what we spend is small, I think, compared to the total amount of clinical trial stuff. A lot of what we spend is additional money to help facilitators speed up the course of a clinical trial. But in the end, the critical trials that most people like best are the ones that the manufacturer doesn't support. They're paid for by the large investigative bodies like RTOG. But we're participating, and for example, lung data. We want to get lung data and we want to get it more quickly. So we're going to participate to the extent that we can speed up the accrual of patients because that's something we would really like to see. So if we can pay for a better status, more statisticians or easier assembly of data, et cetera, that's good. Also, sometimes, we want them to use a technology that's uniquely ours in a clinical trial. And so if you have a general-purpose clinical trial and only one vendor has a particular technical solution, then probably you're going to want to see some money from us to support that effort.", "Tycho W Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then on Calypso and now that the business is in your fold, any thoughts on the pricing structure there? I mean, the system's a couple hundred thousand dollars. Does that make sense going forward? Or do you feel a need to maybe adjust the pricing and further integrate the device itself into the Linacs?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Well, the Calypso had a pricing level that was based upon its volume. What we hope to do over time is increase the volume and get some advantages that we can offer in terms of pricing because we get scale. But right now, the scale isn't there yet, so we're going to have to be very careful in what we do in terms of pricing. And obviously, we're going to spend some money on cost reduction activities to see what we can do. Any technology like this, the more inexpensive we can make it, the better. But this remains a very exotic device right now.", "Tycho W Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then one of the competitive dynamics we tend to get is as we think about the dynamics here in the U.S., in particular around the Tomo-Accuray merger, how do you view the opportunity to go after some of those vaults and importantly, bringing UNIQUE to some of those customers to some of those low-energy vaults?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Well, TomoTherapy vaults, yes, people pull them out. Some people have decided not to put them -- I mean, they're putting TrueBeams in some of those things and some of them are putting 600 CEs in there. UNIQUE is a potential opportunity for some of those sites, and I have seen people express an interest in doing that sort of thing. So the only places, I think, where we -- maybe something special would be required that like UNIQUE would be extremely small vaults, in North America, that's not really a big opportunity. There are small vaults in North America, but most of those small vaults are outside of North America.", "Tycho W Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then last one on capital deployment. I think your Analyst Day back in May you'd kind of talked about ballpark $300 million to $400 million-type deals. Obviously, Calypso's much smaller. So can you just talk to the extent you're still looking at M&A?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Yes, I think I said $300 million in aggregate over several years, right? I don't want to scare the heck out of everybody else on the thing. Calypso is small. We're still looking at a number of opportunities. I think ultimately, Augmenix can be big. Right now it hasn't been approved for use in the U.S., but ultimately, I think it can be extremely important worldwide. I think there's about 100,000 prostate patients treated in the United States every year with radiation therapy. There's probably another 100,000 or so internationally, and that number is going to grow. So that represents a very large opportunity for us if we can get a good share. And I think that there's maybe some Augmenix opportunities elsewhere in the body as well. So I think Augmenix is probably already one of them. It's just that you haven't seen the rest of the acquisition happen. You've just seen the initial investment. Calypso, I think, is important but is never going to be gigantic in terms of that number. And there are a number of other acquisitions, but for the most part, they're not huge. I mean, they are -- I think some of them have big revenue torque, but not very many. But nonetheless, I think I've got a list that adds up to $300 million.", "Spencer R. Sias", "That's going to be all the questions that we can take today. I want to all thank you all very much for participating in the call, and we're certainly happy and look forward to meeting with you next week in New York. We will give you additional information. Again, that thing will be webcast as well. ", "This call has been recorded. A replay can be heard on the Varian website where it will be archived for a year.

My name is Cathy, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today's call, Mr. Spencer Sias, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please proceed, sir.", "Spencer R. Sias", "Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Varian Medical Systems conference call for the first quarter of fiscal year 2012. Participating in this call are Tim Guertin, President and CEO; Elisha Finney, CFO; Dow Wilson, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Tai Chen, our Corporate Controller. Tim is on travel and participating remotely. Tim and Elisha will summarize our results and will take your questions following the presentation. ", "To simplify our discussions, unless otherwise stated, all references to the quarter or year are fiscal quarters and fiscal years, quarterly comparisons over the first quarter of fiscal 2012 versus the first quarter of fiscal 2011. All results are for continuing operations, which exclude the sale of research and in proportion of ACCEL.

We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this presentation and discussion because of new information, future events or otherwise. ", "And now, here is Tim.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Good afternoon, and welcome. Today, we are reporting results for fiscal 2012 first quarter with revenue and earnings in line or ahead of our expectations, but net orders challenges in all of our businesses. ", "To summarize our results, revenues for the quarter rose by 8% to $625 million. Our gross margin dropped by 3% as anticipated due to a tough year-ago comparison, product mix and the Scripps Proton revenue recognition, which had 0 margin. ", "Net earnings were $0.79 per diluted share, down 1% from the year-ago quarter, but well ahead of our guidance for the quarter. Our quarter ending backlog, including the Proton business, expanded by 14% to $2.5 billion. I\u2019ll focus now on orders and operations in each of our businesses. ", "Oncology Systems' first quarter net orders totaled $485 million, up 6%, with a 22% increase in the overall international regions that more than offset an 11% decline in North America. This is in stark contrast to the year-ago quarter, which had a 20% increase in North America and a 6% decline in international markets versus the first quarter of fiscal 2010. ", "Compared to the first quarter last year, net orders rose 27% in the Far East driven by gains in China, Thailand and Malaysia, as well as in Japan where we have just announced the establishment of a new training and education center. I believe we've gained market share in this region, and we continue to see a healthy pipeline of potential business in China where we're [indiscernible] from a larger and revitalized sales force. ", "In Europe, net orders increased 18% with the help of key wins in Sweden, The Ukraine, Turkey, The Netherlands, Egypt, Finland and Russia. Net orders in the rest of the world, including Latin America and Australia, grew 37% versus the year-ago period. Growth in Latin America was led by Argentina, Chile and Brazil where we have won all 3 of the last public tenders. New technology, a broader product line, unmatched service capability and new educational programs have enabled us to strengthen our position in all international regions. ", "In North America, which comprised 42% of the net orders for the quarter, we were impacted by several order push outs. We fully expect that we will book these orders in this fiscal year. While the sales funnel for this region looks healthy for our hospital customers, we're seeing some continued reimbursement uncertainty and slow purchasing activity among freestanding clinics. ", "On a global basis, the number of accelerators ordered in the quarter was up from the year-ago quarter driven by strong demand in international markets for both low- and high-energy accelerators, including our TrueBeam platform for radiotherapy and radiosurgery. The take rate for TrueBeam almost doubled in Europe, showing that it is gaining traction as a product with a broad clinical appeal and a driver for future growth in all parts of the world. ", "TrueBeam continued to comprise about 40% of our high-energy accelerator orders in the quarter despite the order push outs in North America, which has been the strongest market for this product. Since TrueBeam was introduced in 2010, we have now booked some 425 orders for the platform and we now have about 100 installations complete or in progress. ", "The strength of our international business during the quarter also resulted in strong orders for our UNIQUE accelerator, which is a cost-competitive, low-energy system capable of delivering image-guided RapidArc IMRT. Customer demand for our other radiosurgical systems, including the Trilogy and Novalis Tx platforms was also up during the quarter. Demand for the onboard imager upgrades and RapidArc products rose during the quarter as more clinics position themselves with the technology needed to meet the new standards for delivering efficient image-guided treatments. ", "Our service business grew strongly, expanded by about 15% versus the year-ago quarter. Given the varying methods for reporting orders and acquisitions by our competition, objective measures of market share are different  -- excuse me, difficult, our analysis of the quarter shows that we held our own in North America while gaining share of the available accelerator business in emerging markets. This bodes well for our future growth as emerging markets become a more important driver of global growth. ", "There's been a lot of discussion in the market about Siemens exiting the accelerator business. And while it represents a growth opportunity for the rest of us, it's too early for anyone to claim that Siemens' decision has resulted in additional business for them. A typical sales cycle is about a year long. That said, Varian has been selected to replace more than 50 Siemens units within the last fiscal year and of course, of serving the normal replacement market and we're now pursuing additional opportunities. ", "We saw continued progress  --  excuse me, continued clinical progress in the fight against cancer during the quarter. As an example, clinicians at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the Humanitas clinic in Milan, Italy, showed a fast-dose delivery using high-intensity mode on TrueBeam, makes it possible to deliver radiosurgery in a normal radiotherapy time slot. This unmatched capability is designed to reduce the extent of tumor motion during treatment, as well as patient time on the table. This should also help to lower the clinic's cost per treatment. ", "Clinicians at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation have noted that they've been able to use RapidArc for stereotactic radiosurgery on brain lesions greater than 7 millimeters in diameter in addition to performing radiosurgery on smaller lesions. It's great to see that this radiosurgical capability could give clinics more options for treating large lesions. ", "Clinicians at the Humanitas clinic in Milan also showed that our new Acuros XB  algorithm is capable of calculating highly accurate RapidArc treatment plans for stereotactic surgery. This should help streamline clinical workflow while maintaining excellent treatment planning precision. ", "Finally, we're encouraged by an increasing number of physician-related clinical studies on using stereotactic radiosurgical techniques. Studies like these will encourage others to continue exploring and developing regular surgical techniques, and all of these studies support continued use of Varian technology in the fight against cancer and our mission to save another 100,000 lives every year. ", "Our X-ray Products business had an uncharacteristically weak quarter for both tube and panel products. Net orders were $110 million, down 2% from the year-ago period, and revenues rose 1% to $113 million. The principal cause of weak revenue growth was soft demand in Japan, where several customers appeared to be adjusting inventory levels to be more in line with their normal imaging equipment production rates. We believe this is a delayed reaction to the recovery efforts from last year's earthquake and tsunami, and we are expecting that our business will return to more normal growth rates as the fiscal year progresses. ", "While there was weakness in demand during the quarter, there were some bright spots, including strong customer interest in the new products that we will bring to market later in the year. Several large customers are currently working on integrating new products such as our wireless radiographic panel, our mammal panel and our new cone beam panel into their next-generation products. We also expect growth in X-ray tubes later in the year as we ramp up production of a new high-tier replacement CT tube that was recently exhibited at the RSNA meeting in Chicago. ", "Switching now to our Other category. Combined net orders were $12 million for the quarter, down $10 million from year-ago quarter. Demand for our security products was soft compared to the year-ago quarter when we received a large order for border screening products. ", "In our Particle Therapy business, we continue to make good progress for the installation of our ProBeam system at the Scripps Proton Center in San Diego. Subsequent to the close of the quarter, we signed a contract and booked an order from the Saudi Particle Therapy Center to supply the King Fahd Medical Center in Saudi Arabia with a $77 million system for a proton center in Riyadh. This facility, which will be the first in this region, will include our ProBeam system for 5 treatment rooms, as well as 2 of our TrueBeams. Equipment installation is expected to commence in 2013. This agreement will also include a multiyear service contract that should commence as the installation is completed. ", "We believe that more and more proton centers will want to employ the full suite of Varian products and technology for radiotherapy and radiosurgery, as well as particle therapy for world-class cancer treatments. The combination of these technologies based on 60 years of innovation plus Varian -- puts Varian in a unique position to help advance clinical care for patients around the world. ", "As a reminder, Varian is also been selected to provide equipment for their new proton centers at the University of Maryland and in Mestre, Italy, where a new center is planned to open in 2015. Furthermore, we've been identified as the preferred provider for a new center at Emory University, which just received its Certificate of Need. We are continuing discussions with several other groups who are planning to build proton centers. ", "And now here's Elisha to cover the financials.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Right. Thanks, Tim, and hello, everyone. While Tim has already covered net orders, I want to briefly talk about the constant currency growth rates for the quarter. In comparing quarter-over-quarter exchange rates, the euro was pretty stable and the yen was slightly stronger, so the FX impact in the quarter was minimal. ", "Oncology grew net orders by 6% in dollars or 5% in constant currency. Oncology's European net orders growth rate was 18% both in dollars and in constant currency, and the Far East was up 27% in dollars and 23% in constant currency. ", "First quarter revenues increased 8% to $625 million with constant currency growth of 7%. Oncology Systems posted an 8% increase in revenues. X-ray Products posted a gain of 1%, and revenues from businesses under the Other category increased by $9 million or 56%, including nearly $9 million of revenue for the Scripps Proton Therapy contract. ", "The first quarter gross margin for the company fell as expected from the year-ago record quarter by 3 points to 43%. Oncology Systems' gross margin declined by 2 points to 45% due primarily to a product mix shift. X-ray Products' gross margin also declined about 2 points to 40%, primarily due to a mix shift to lower margin products within our line of X-ray tubes. ", "The gross margin for the Other business and the total company was negatively impacted by the Scripps contract, under which revenue was being recorded using the percentage of completion method. Under this method, revenues are initially recognized equal to cost with the expectation that profits will be recognized towards the end of the project. The Scripps contract negatively impacted the company's first quarter gross margin by 60 basis points. ", "First quarter SG&A expenses were $96 million or 15% of revenues, down slightly as a percentage of revenues from the year-ago quarter. First quarter R&D expenses were $44 million or 7% of revenues, up slightly as a percentage of revenue from the year-ago quarter. First quarter operating earnings as expected fell 6% to $129 million or 21% of revenues. Depreciation and amortization totaled $14 million for the quarter. ", "The effective tax rate was 30.2% for the quarter, up slightly from the year-ago period when we benefited from a reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. The tax rate for the first quarter of this year is lower than expected due to a change in Japanese tax law. For the fiscal year, we expect that the tax rate will be about 30%. Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased from the year-ago quarter to $114 million due mainly to our previously announced share repurchase programs. Diluted earnings per share fell by $0.01 to $0.79. ", "Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $606 million, debt of $188 million and stockholder\u2019s equity of $1.4 billion. DSO increased from an unusually low year-ago quarter to 86 days, including a 4-day impact from the Particle Therapy business. First quarter cash flow from operations was $53 million with increases in inventory as well as somewhat slower collections on accounts receivables. Primary uses of cash were $10 million for the purchase of Calypso and $8 million for CapEx. ", "Now I'll turn it back to Tim for the outlook.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Thanks, Elisha. We remain confident in our growth outlook for fiscal 2012 and expect our businesses to strengthen as the year progresses, with annual revenues growing by about 10% and earnings per diluted share rising by about 15%. ", "For the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we believe that revenues could increase by about 8% over the second quarter of fiscal 2011 total and that net earnings per diluted share could rise by 12% to 13%. This brings us in at about the midpoint of our previous guidance for the year and it reflects the softness in the Japanese imaging equipment market, as well as our push outs in the North American Oncology business. ", "Thank you for your attention, and we're now ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Jason Wittes of Caris.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I have a couple of questions. First off, the way you characterize push outs from oncology orders, is that something that you -- is not necessarily next quarter but sometime this year? Is that the right way to think about it? And was there a specific reason surrounding why there would be a delay in those orders other than traditional capital equipment cycles?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "This is Tim. I'd just say that when you see larger -- when we talk about push outs, obviously we're talking about orders of some size. And when an order of some size moves, sometimes it just moves a short distance and sometimes it can move a quarter or 2 and that's generally the case.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So basically it's a big order but hard to say whether it's this quarter or the following but sometime this year\u2026", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Yes. I would be reluctant to say at this point when it will happen. It's just -- you make forecast based on what you know at the beginning of the quarter and your customers sometimes change their plans.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Understood. And also on X-ray orders, I understand what you said about Japan. How much visibility do you have in terms of when this sort of inventory levels normalize and you can get back to your normalized growth rate there?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Well, let me comment first, and then Dow, I'll see if you have anything to add. We constantly get information from our suppliers. We have some sense of what their inventory levels are. When this has happened in the past, it's generally persisted 1 or 2 quarters. Dow, do you have any additional insight on this?", "Dow R. Wilson", "No. And I think that's -- we do have some visibility into their inventory levels. We've seen this kind of call down before, not recently for sure. But we think of what we're seeing is really kind of a rebalancing from some of the activities that happened in Japan last year with the earthquake and tsunami.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yes. And we see this about every 3 to 4 years. It's just the nature of the beast of being a component supplier. I would just tell you that once you pencil out the guidance, Q2 is probably going to be in the high single-digit growth rate for X-ray and with double digit returning in the second half of this year.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And by the way, if I split out Japan, what would the order rate look like? Is that something    a figure you could give us?", "Dow R. Wilson", "Not something that we looked at.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Just want to quickly ask about Particle Therapy as well. My understanding is -- and you guys have been pretty open about business. There's a fair amount of dilution resulting each year as a result of doing the R&D to get your Particle Therapy business up to speed. I assume that's somewhere around 10% to 15%, but I also heard that you guys thought with your first real installation going forward it could get a little bit higher. Is that still the way you perceive it?", "Elisha W. Finney", "No, Jason. It's closer to about 5% of the total year EPS estimate.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I meant $0.10 to $0.15 not 5...", "Elisha W. Finney", "That is correct. Yes, not 15%, yes.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Sorry. And the new order, the order that you just put in for Saudi Arabia, that's a net orders. But it sounds like that won't really actually  -- there won't be any revenue recognition till next year, and when that happens, I think we can assume that it's going to be neutral to earnings based on how you account for it. Is that correct\u2026", "Elisha W. Finney", "Well, we're still analyzing the contract in gory detail at this point to really lock in the revenue recognition. You can assume it will be under project accounting, and really the revenue can start when the project starts. So we have not started the project specific to this deal at this point. So in fact, I am assuming that there will be some revenue in this fiscal year. For the total year, as we mentioned last quarter, this is between $50 million and $55 million of proton revenue. And yes, it will be at, if not 0, very low margin for the first couple of transactions.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "But that $50 million to $55 million does include -- would it -- did anticipate something like the Saudi Arabia order? Is that...", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla of Citi.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Question -- I want to start with on North America oncology. In general, it's unusual to see your book to bill fall below 1, and you are saying that you're expecting orders to come back. But can you talk specifically about freestanding clinics? I know you mentioned in your prepared comments, and it does sound like freestanding clinics have taken kind of a permanent step down. So why do you think that there's going to be kind of a bounce back? And how do you think freestanding clinics play into the North America outlook?", "Dow R. Wilson", "I would say that our overall funnel looks pretty good, so let's just start with that. That would include hospital business and the freestanding clinic business. We are seeing strength in the hospital segment, so that's encouraging to us. In the freestanding market, it is down. I think there is still some residual concern about reimbursements and also some concern about raising capital. So that's what we're seeing out there. I'd say our volumes in that segment have been light 2 quarters in a row.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. So the bounce back you're expecting has kind of nothing to do with freestanding clinics, is that fair?", "Dow R. Wilson", "We do see  -- as I said, our funnel looks very good. It is mostly a hospital market funnel. There is some reimbursement maybe in February. We get this reimbursement decision made and maybe that takes some away -- some of the uncertainty away in the freestanding market. But really what we're seeing is a hospital market rebound.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And the second thing here, just to clarify on proton. Last quarter, when you, Elisha, you talked about $50 million to $55 million. About $20 million of that was coming from Scripps and $30 million was coming from Maryland. But now you're saying that, that also includes Saudi Arabia. So did some of the Maryland revenue fallout?", "Elisha W. Finney", "It's all depends on when we began a project as to when the revenue and the cost began. And so when the $30 million was basically just order number 2 regardless if it was Maryland or Saudi, and Saudi is kind of first in at this point. So a combination of what we see right now gets us to about $50 million to $55 million for the year.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. So Maryland  -- you say order number 2. So order number 2 is Saudi, and that the means...", "Elisha W. Finney", "Correct.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Maryland is not necessarily as  -- you're not assuming Maryland right now?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Well, we are -- I mean, we firmly believe we will be booking the Maryland deal as soon as the financing is complete. And so there is a contingency, and so we have not booked it even though we have announced and they are out raising funds as we speak.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And is there any assumption that you have full year guidance for Siemens contribution?", "Spencer R. Sias", "Amit, again, and to all of you, please limit yourself to one question so we give everybody a shot at participating in this call. Much appreciated.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "But I'll answer the question. Siemens we've always been able -- I mentioned in the conference call that we've been able to take some business from Siemens from their installed base, and we would expect that other customers will be looking at who are in Siemens' backlog will be looking at making decisions. But what you have to remember is Siemens was strongest in China and Eastern Europe and a number of countries like that, and so some of those locations may take a little while to make their changes. And so I wouldn't expect anything over time immediately, but we'll expect an effect over time.", "Dow R. Wilson", "Maybe just a little more color. We do believe that they represented about 8% of the market, so it does represent an 8% market opportunity for us. To Tim's point, that is global market opportunity. We think it's probably a little too early to impact anybody's current orders whether ourselves or anybody else. And as Tim mentioned in the conference call, we did last year win more than 50 Siemens sockets. So we've already seen to some degree that installed base moving over to us, and we're encouraged at looking at additional replacement opportunities in fiscal 2012.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Roman of Goldman Sachs.", "David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Could you give us just an update on -- I think you said there are about 110 TrueBeams installed as of this quarter and 425 orders booked. If -- I don't think you gave those numbers last quarter, but I believe 2 quarters ago you said there were around 100 installs complete or pending. What's happening on the conversion rate? And is that -- are those numbers in fact slowing?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "David, it was 175.", "Elisha W. Finney", "175.", "David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, okay. Sorry. So I misheard that. So there's -- order installations continue to track basically one to one?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Yes, we're doing fine.", "David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then any impact on [indiscernible] -- follow-up question was around order cancellations, whether you were seeing anything to that effect. Philips they'd talked about that in their profit warning, and they had cited some markets in Western Europe as well. They weren't that specific, but they did talk about a slowing rate of conversion from backlog to order. So just wondering if you're seeing anything similar to that across any of your franchises?", "Dow R. Wilson", "Nothing outside of historical basis, no.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Feffer of Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "I just wanted to come back to Siemens very quickly. You mentioned 50 units that you've replaced in the last few years of theirs. Was that prior to their announcement or is that since?", "Dow R. Wilson", "That would have been 50 orders, I'd say 90% prior to their -- that was our fiscal year, that was our fiscal year '11. So...", "Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then just...", "Dow R. Wilson", "We we've got announcement just after the fiscal year or so, yes.", "Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Right. Okay. And then just quickly back to the North America. I think this quarter you said about 40% of these high-energy orders were TrueBeam. Last quarter, it was 70%. Can I then assume that most of these order delays, are these all TrueBeam orders?", "Dow R. Wilson", "The 40% is the global number, and that's consistent with our historical performance. North America is much, much higher than that.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Which we were actually thrilled to maintain a 40% take rate on TrueBeam given that virtually all of the orders growth came outside of North America, and we saw Europe basically double -- almost double their take rate. So to maintain 40% with the North American market down was very good.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Vivian Cervantes, Kaufman Bros.", "Vivian Cervantes - Kaufman Bros., L.P., Research Division", "Switching back to X-rays. I appreciate your comment that you've got some visibility into customer inventory levels. Having said that, did you get a sense that maybe production is back in order, in which case there's going to be normal usage and therefore expectations for a return to ordering is in line with what you were expecting?", "Dow R. Wilson", "We think it was just an overstocking and rebalancing of their inventory. So as Elisha mentioned, it's probably going to be a second half bump for us where we see the run-up, and we've got a very good product pipeline as well for the second half, including new replacement tubes for CT, some new filmless imaging X-ray tubes and then a number of new products in our panel business as well. So we're encouraged about the new product list we can get in the second half.", "Vivian Cervantes - Kaufman Bros., L.P., Research Division", "Understood. So there's -- I guess I'm thinking rolling blackouts, things of that nature, manufacturing disruption, you're not seeing or hearing anything of that kind?", "Dow R. Wilson", "That was kind of last year's news, and what we're really hearing is about a rebalancing of their overall inventory.", "Vivian Cervantes - Kaufman Bros., L.P., Research Division", "All right. That's helpful. And if I may just sneak in one more. Smart Segmentation received FDA clearance recently. Can you provide us with some feedback on how that's being taken in the marketplace?", "Dow R. Wilson", "Smart Segmentation will really be viewed as a very positive productivity and effectiveness play for our customers. I'd be very encouraged about the ability to do treatment planning faster and the ability to contour quickly, get recommendations and make their treatment planning decisions much, much faster and achieve really outstanding treatment planning. So the initial reception has been excellent on Smart Segmentation.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just wondering if you can talk to the sustainability of the trends you're seeing in Europe. I mean I know some of what you saw this quarter was again some easier comp, but you obviously had high teens, low 20s order growth the last two quarters there. So just talk about the sustainability of some of those order trends in Europe.", "Dow R. Wilson", "I think -- let me cast it overall. I think it really points to the -- we didn't have a great quarter in North America and yet we delivered 6% growth overall and it talks to the great balance that we have globally right now. We had a terrific quarter in Asia, we had a very solid quarter in Europe and Australia and Latin America and we had a bad quarter in U.S. If we can pull the U.S. up, we're going to rebalance this just fine. With Southern Europe, we saw some softness already last year. We don't see that improving right away. Tim, would you like to add anything else there?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "No. I think you've covered the waterfront.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then just to follow up on the U.S. comment, how contained were the delays or push outs? I'm just trying to get a sense as to whether these were a few larger centers and mainly on the TrueBeam side. Or can you just give us a sense of how widespread the push outs were?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Dow, why don't you take that?", "Dow R. Wilson", "I'd say it was concentrated really in 2 or 3 big sites and the high end of our product line, so TrueBeam and maybe a few Trilogy and other high-energy systems.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone of Jefferies.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Just to -- one on -- just to say on actually oncology service revenue. I don't know if I'm doing the math correctly here, but based on my math, it grew a little bit over 7% this quarter and that's down from last year's growth rate. It's been decelerating for a few quarters. Is that just the result of the light bookings in North America over the past few quarters? Or is there something else going on there, perhaps lower ASPs on new contracts? And then one follow-up on the North American orders. So it sounds like it was a hospital customer. Is there any look into actually why they pulled back? Was it a function of credit accessibility budget concerns or similar reimbursement concerns that some of the freestanding clinics had?", "Elisha W. Finney", "So Anthony, let me take the service question. I'm not positive where your math is coming from, but our service on revenue was up in the mid-teens and the net orders was in the high teens. So we had a fantastic quarter in our service business.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "On the delays, it's none of the above. It's just internal processes.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Signatures.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson of Robert Baird.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Dow, I want to go back to a point you made where you talked about Siemens accounting for about 8% of the market and that you've been taking about 50 orders a year from them. What's your sources? Or how do you guys break down how many, maybe, Siemens linear accelerators are coming up for bid each year? My sense is that number is around 200, but that you and some of the others are already taking maybe 100 of those combined each year. So how big is that kind of incremental opportunity of Linacs that you're not already taking share from?", "Dow R. Wilson", "We think that their overall market share has been 8%. I don't know that our science is as accurate as yours is, Jeff. But I think your number of about 100 systems sounds pretty good.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "So that would be 100 systems maybe that you haven't and nobody else has been taking, that they've been kind of rebooking each year, even though maybe 200 of their systems are coming up for bid each year. Is that fair?", "Dow R. Wilson", "Yes, and I think it's -- it'll be interesting to see how it evolved a little bit. I would say they've had some markets historically where they've done very well, but they've also been the low-priced guy in those markets. So I think that will be kind of interesting. China, they've done well; some other Eastern Europe markets where -- Middle East markets where they've done well. And in the U.S., they tend to do well in the enterprise accounts where they're providing all the diagnostic imaging and IT. So I think those will be the markets where it opens up.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "All right. And just a follow-up question for Elisha, some housekeeping here. Just what was the Calypso contribution in revenue this quarter? And can you remind me last quarter what you were guiding to for tax rate? I know this year -- or this quarter you took that to 30% I think, if I go back to my notes. But just what was it last quarter implied in your guidance?", "Elisha W. Finney", "We -- I said 30% to 31%. So it's about a 50 basis point improvement for the Japanese tax law.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And Calypso revenue?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Well, look. I don't want to get into breaking out revenue. I can tell you it was pretty much in line with our expectation. It was low, it's under $5 million and that's exactly what we expected because again, Varian's distribution channel, we are going to sell more through bundling. And so the revenue is going to follow a year later.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Junaid Husain of Dougherty & Company.", "Junaid Husain - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division", "Tim, just one question for you. I know that over the past couple of quarters, you've been spending a good deal more time on business development. You pulled the trigger on at least one small deal. Are you still spending about that same amount of time on business development?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "I've got Dow in the COO job now, and so he's doing a lot of things for me that's given me more time. So I'm kind of wondering around the building looking for work, and so I'm spending more time on business development, yes. Whether you should read anything into that in terms of its implications, I probably not. It's just I have more time to spend on it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "One housekeeping item, Elisha. Was there any impact of currency movement on earnings in the quarter or the outlook for the year?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Well, we would prefer a weak dollar obviously and it's not moving in the right direction. So what happens is we are pretty naturally hedged. It's never perfect, so there is a little bit of impact. I don't have an exact number for you. But obviously, on the top line, as the euro has been strengthening, that impacts the guidance that we gave for the full year. So we would love to have a weaker dollar. Unfortunately, I don't think that's going to be happening the rest of this fiscal year from where we sit today. We do have the proton business, which is European-based, which is helping us to become more naturally hedged.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And then Tim, put it simply, I mean the last 2 quarters in the North American oncology market has frankly been tough. And I think the mid-single digit growth profile in that market has been a key to the overall organic outlook for the company. So given that, can you give us a sense for where you think that order trend could go over the next 12, 24 months and given the outlook for the overall organic growth profile for the company and what are the drivers of any rebound that keep you comfortable with those expectations?", "Timothy E. Guertin", "In general, I think that the organic -- that the North American market is going to grow. And that given any individual quarter is more of an event rather than a trend right now, I think there is growth in the North American market. But I think it's in the single digits. And in some quarters it's going to be down, and in other quarters it's going to be up. But I don't think in the long run -- and I'm not talking about this year; I'm talking about in the long run. In the long run, I think the North American market is going to grow, but the major source of growth for the company is going to be outside of North America. So it's very important for us to get companies like TrueBeam and -- at higher take rates outside of North America. That's what we saw happen in this quarter, so it fills me with confidence that we're going to get additional growth. Plus, we've done well in some recent deals around the world in these small territories and growing territories. So all of those things I think are very important. The U.S. market is more and more a replacement market. That's not -- that probably means is not -- we won't see stupendous growth. But what we can get is if we can speed up the replacement market, that would be nice. We still have a huge number of machines in North America that are quite old. And so if we can continue to stimulate that market, I think that we can still see in the single digits for North America. Outside of that, the big business will be elsewhere. Also another key driver that I should remember is stereotactic radiosurgery in North America. If we can get lung and liver indications to take off, that is if we can get operable lung cancer patients and if we can get operable liver and learn how to treat them with radiation with stereotactic radiosurgery and get that to be widely accepted in the United States, it will be a huge boost to our business here. So there's some upside possibilities as well, and don't forget protons.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Dalton Chandler of Needham & Company.", "Dalton L. Chandler - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could maybe put some quantification around the order push out? For example, you are down 11% in North America.

Wilson", "I think probably as specific as we want to get is, Dalton, it was 2 or 3 big customers.", "Timothy E. Guertin", "Yes, I don't think we can be more specific than that, and you can look at our history and judge what big customers are like.", "Operator", "No further questions at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Spencer Sias. Please proceed.", "Spencer R. Sias", "Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Varian Medical Systems' conference call for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012.", "With me are Dow Wilson, President and CEO; Elisha Finney, CFO; and Clarence Verhoef, our Corporate Controller. Dow and Elisha will summarize our results and will take your questions following the presentation.", "To simplify our discussion, unless otherwise stated, all references to the quarter or year are fiscal quarters and fiscal years, quarterly comparisons are for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Annual comparisons are for fiscal 2012 versus fiscal 2011.", "Except as otherwise stated, all results are from continuing operations, which exclude additional losses associated with the sales of the research instruments portion of the Varian Particle Therapy business that were accrued in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011.", "Please be advised that this presentation and discussion contains forward-looking statements or use of words and phrases such as outlook, could, should, believe, can, estimate, will and similar expressions are intended to identify those statements, which represent our current judgment on future performance or other future matters.

Management presentations also will be webcast between 7:30 and 8:30 a.m., and details are available on our Investor Relations website. We look forward to your participation.", "And now, here is Dow.", "Dow R. Wilson", "Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone. I want to take a quick moment to congratulate Tim Girton on his retirement. And now, I'm handling over the company in such great shape, despite tough circumstances and a challenging global economy. We finished fiscal year '12 on a strong note with growth in our major businesses and a record -- good progress on our -- in our proton and security businesses and a record backlog that positions us for continued leadership.", "To summarize our results, earnings per diluted share increased 14% for the quarter to $1.08 and 9% for the year to $3.76. Revenues rose 5% for the quarter to $756 million and 8% for the year to $2.8 billion. Excluding protons, revenues were up 9% for the quarter and 8% for the year. Orders rose in double digits in our major businesses for the quarter. Our quarter-ending backlog rose 12% to $2.8 billion. Cash flow from operations was a record $191 million for the fourth quarter and $493 million for the year, exceeding net earnings for both periods. We closed the quarter with $705 million in cash and cash equivalents and $161 million of debt after spending $85 million to repurchase and retire 1.4 million shares of stock.", "Turning to the operational highlights. Oncology Systems' fourth quarter net orders rose 10% to $789 million, up 10% in both international and North American markets. Oncology's net orders for the year increased 7% to $2.4 billion with 5% growth in North America and 8% growth in international markets. International markets generated 55% of annual net orders for the business. The solid North American performance during the quarter was highlighted by multi-Linac orders and software purchases at numerous centers that are modernizing their treatment capabilities. To give you a few examples, we signed a major long-term equipment and service contract with the Cleveland Clinic. Multi-Linac orders were placed by institutions, including Indiana University, Centura and Exempla in Colorado and the University of Nebraska, which is replacing 2 Siemens units. There were multiple TrueBeam orders, including our first order at University of Wisconsin. Conversions from competitors' treatment planning and information management software also contributed to strong growth in North America. I will touch more on that in a few moments.", "Net orders for the quarter were up 22% in Asia with healthy gains in both Japan and China. Several centers in China ordered the TrueBeam platform, some together with our integrated suite of Eclipse Treatment Planning and ARIA information management software.", "In Japan, we received orders from several centers in the national hospital system, including one order stemming from our new strategic partnership with Siemens. In EMEA, net orders increased 12% or 20% on a constant currency basis with key wins in several countries. In Turkey, we received an order to equip 6 centers with a total of 2 TrueBeam and 4 Trilogy systems, as well as our integrated software suite. The Curie Institut in France placed an order for 3 TrueBeams, together with our Eclipse and ARIA software. Newcastle, a former Siemens center in the U.K., ordered 2 TrueBeams as well as the software to go with them.", "Net orders in the Rest of the World region were down 26% versus the year-ago period when we had exceptionally strong growth in Australia. The order decline in Australia offset growth in Latin American -- in Latin America where we sold linear accelerators in 11 countries during the quarter versus 8 countries in the prior-year period.", "We had key wins during the quarter in Brazil, Peru and Panama. As you know, Brazil is conducting a public tender for the purchase of 80 units, and Varian is aggressively competing for this business. To update you on the status of the tender, there have been some delays while the Ministry of Health sorts out the planned placements of the units it will be ordering. At this point, we are expecting to go through a reverse auction bidding process sometime in November or December.", "As you have probably noticed, our TrueBeam platform for radiotherapy and radiosurgery has continued to be a major driver for our growth in markets around the globe. As of the end of the quarter, we had booked more than 645 TrueBeam orders since its introduction in 2010, and we had some 330 installations complete or in progress. This premium product now represents about 50% of our worldwide, high-energy machine orders.", "Oncology's worldwide service organization once again delivered double-digit growth in orders and revenues during the quarter. It ended the year with a total of $749 million in orders and represented more than 30% of total net orders for Oncology on the year. Growth in this business is being driven by more sophisticated systems, such as TrueBeam coming out of warranty, higher contract capture rates, higher average pricing and more software service agreements as well as the growing install base in international markets.", "I'm pleased to report that Varian's customer support services organization has been rated #1 among linear accelerator manufacturers in 6 out of 9 key performance attributes, including Net Promoter Score, overall manufacturing performance and probability of repurchase. The rankings were recently announced by IMV, an independent healthcare market research firm that analyzes service trends in the imaging industry. It's gratifying to have this affirmation of our quality and field efforts.", "We also had 2 significant votes of confidence in our software during the quarter with contracts from Memorial Sloan-Kettering and the University of Michigan for a -- for our Eclipse Treatment Planning system. These leading institutions have written and used their own treatment planning software for decades because they couldn't get what they needed from a commercial product. This is a big milestone for us as a software company. In addition to these sites, there were more than 10 conversions in the quarter from competitors' software to either Eclipse and/or ARIA.", "We're very excited about our exhibit at ASTRO this next week in Boston, where we scheduled a special event in our booth at 2:07 p.m. on Sunday afternoon, when we're going to unveil our next move against cancer. I can't say more about it today, but I'm looking forward to discussing this and other exhibit features with you during our investor meeting at the show. See you, I hope, at 2:07 p.m. on Sunday afternoon. We will also have a strong joint presence in our booth with Siemens. And we're very pleased with the way our new strategic partnership is progressing. It is going live in North America this month. We will be launching an exciting new marketing campaign at the show. The partnership is on target with our plans to establish ARIA connectivity to the Siemens installed base, and our teams have already succeeded in making some joint sales of imaging and therapy products to customers in international markets.", "Let me give you a quick update on reimbursements in the U.S. We believe that CMS will provide some relief from its original proposed reimbursement cuts for freestanding facilities. Together with our partners in freestanding clinics, we have provided additional data, including actual equipment and facility cost that should enable CMS to recalculate and revise its proposed rates for freestanding clinics. There has been significant congressional support for a revision to the CMS proposal with the 1/3 of the Senate and more than 100 House members signing a letter to CMS opposing the cuts. However, we will not have certainty around the final numbers until early November. We're also hopeful that proton reimbursement could be restored in the final rule.", "Finally, we were pleased to see the adoption of a new code for thoracic radiosurgery beginning this January. This should help to expand the use of radiosurgery for lung cancer and it coincides with our focus on providing clinicians with more advanced tools to treat lung cancer.", "Let me now turn to X-ray Products. This business had a terrific quarter and finished the year on an especially strong note with the help of new products that spurred top line growth as well as productivity initiatives that led to substantial improvements in operating margins. Net orders for this business grew by 15% during the quarter to $145 million. For the full fiscal year, net orders rose by 5% to $506 million. Higher demand for our panels was driven by radiographic equipment makers in China and dental imaging equipment manufacturers in Europe. The quarter was also helped by initial sales of new products, which included a leading edge 43x43-centimeter cone-beam dynamic panel as well as new radiographic panel offerings. We also saw sales of panel workstation combination package during the quarter as a result of our InfiMed acquisition last year. More of these packages will be rolled out as engineering work is completed throughout this current year -- fiscal year. As the panel business continues to expand and trends in digital imaging create new tube opportunities, we continue to see the potential for a billion dollar business in X-ray Products.", "Switching now to net orders in our Other category, including our Security and Proton businesses. We had a tough comparison with the year-ago quarter, which included an $88 million order to equip the Scripps Proton Therapy Center in San Diego. Net orders for the Other category were $30 million for the quarter versus $124 million in the year-ago quarter. For the full fiscal year, Other category net orders rose 7% to $216 million, including 2 proton orders totaling over $120 million.", "Highlights in the Proton business during the quarter included a new $83 million contract for a multi-room center to be operated by Emory Healthcare. We plan to book this contract as an order when the project is financed. As a reminder, we have 3 booked orders for proton equipment at Scripps in San Diego; in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; and in St. Petersburg, Russia. We also have a contract to equip a center at the University of Maryland, and we plan to book this order when financing for the project is completed.", "Now, here is Elisha.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Thanks, Dow, and hello, everyone. While Dow has already covered net orders, I want to briefly talk about the constant currency growth rates for the quarter, which continued to be negatively impacted by the comparatively stronger U.S. dollar against the euro.", "Oncology Systems, which is most heavily impacted by currency movement, grew net orders in the quarter by 10% in dollars or 12% in constant currency. Oncology's European net orders growth rate was up 12% in dollar and up 20% in constant currency, while Asia and the Rest of the World was little impacted by foreign exchange in the quarter.", "Total international Oncology growth was 10% in dollars and 14% in constant currency. Fourth quarter revenues for the company increased 5% to $756 million with constant currency growth of 8%. Oncology Systems posted a 7% increase in revenues, and X-ray Products posted a gain of 9%. Total revenues from businesses and the Other category was down significantly as strong revenue growth in our SIP business was more than offset by a steep decline in proton revenues from the year-ago quarter when we booked more than $30 million of the Scripps project revenue.", "For the full year, total company revenues were up 8% in dollars and 9% in constant currency. The fourth quarter gross margin for the company increased by 1 point to 42.8%. As we expected, Oncology's gross margin decreased by almost 1.5 points to 43.5% due primarily to the continued shift to international markets and the comparatively stronger U.S. dollar versus the euro.", "X-ray Products' gross margin rose more than 2 points from the year-ago quarter to 43.3% due to a higher mix of panel products and improved quality cost for both tube and panels. For the first time, panels represented more than 50% of total revenues in the X-ray business. The company's quarter-over-quarter improvement in gross margin was helped by substantially lower proton revenues, which you will recall are booked at 0 profit. For the full fiscal year, the company's gross margin declined about 1 point to 42.6% due largely to a shift to international deliveries in our Oncology business and the stronger U.S. dollar.", "While I'm on the topic of gross margin, I want to confirm that the future impact of the medical device excise tax will be reflected in the company's gross margin beginning in January of 2013. We will highlight the effect of the tax each quarter.", "Fourth quarter SG&A expenses were $110 million or 14% of revenues, up 1 point as a percentage of revenues from the year-ago quarter. Fourth quarter R&D expenses were $46 million or 6% of revenues even as a percentage of revenue with the year-ago quarter. For the full fiscal year, total operating expenses increased about 40 basis points to 21% of revenues.", "Moving down the income statement, fourth quarter operating earnings were $168 million or 22% of revenues. For the fiscal year, operating earnings were $594 million or 21% of revenues, down 1.5 points from the prior year as a percentage of revenues. Depreciation and amortization totaled $18 million for the quarter and $61 million for the year, and CapEx for the year was equal to depreciation and amortization also at $61 million. The effective tax rate was 28.7% from the quarter, down 2 points from the year-ago quarter due largely to the geographic mix of earnings.", "For the fiscal year, the effective tax rate was 28.3%, also down a little more than 2 points from the prior year. Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased significantly from the year-ago quarter to 112 million due largely to our ongoing share repurchases. Diluted earnings per share was 14% to $1.08 for the quarter and rose 9% to $3.76 for the year.", "Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalent of $705 million, debt of $161 million and stockholders' equity of $1.5 billion. DSO of 85 days, was up 5 days from the year-ago quarter. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $191 million. The primary usage of cash or $85 million to repurchase 1.4 million shares, $21 million for CapEx and $14 million to pay down short-term debt. For the full fiscal year, cash flow from operations was a record $493 million, more than net earnings for the year. We now have an 8 million share repurchase authorization that will be in effect through calendar year 2013.", "Now, I'll turn it back over to Dow for the outlook.", "Dow R. Wilson", "Thanks, Elisha. Our company is positioned for growth by focusing on continuous innovation, expanding our global presence, building our software and services franchises and commercializing protons. We're also enhancing our operational performance through productivity initiatives in all parts of the company. As part of this effort, we will be taking a restructuring charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013.", "For the fiscal year 2013, we believe that revenues could increase by 8% to 9% over fiscal -- over the fiscal 2012's total. Including an estimated $0.06 to $0.08 effect from the pending medical device excise tax, fiscal year 2013 net earnings per diluted share should be in the range of $4.06 to $4.16. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, total company revenues could increase by about 8% to 9% over the prior-year quarter. Net earnings per diluted share, including the planned restructuring charge of $0.02 to $0.03, should be in the range of $0.83 to $0.88.", "We're now ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeremy Feffer with Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "First, I wanted to ask about -- I just want to make sure I'm clear on reimbursement. I recognized your comments. I know we'll probably get the final rule in the next week or so. But just so I understand, assuming there's no change, assuming things stayed the way they were proposed, given your waiting of hospital to freestanding, how do you look at the net-net impact of those proposed rules, and how are there reflected in guidance?", "Dow R. Wilson", "First of all, that freestanding market is only about 10% of our global orders now, probably about 20% of U.S. Not too many years ago, that number was more like 30%. So we've already seen that market change quite significantly. I would say that, in the fourth quarter, that market was sort of quiet, and you saw our first quarter performance was pretty good. So we did see good hospital market growth in U.S. in the fourth quarter. If the regulation is not changed, if -- I'm sorry, if the reimbursement is not changed and left at the proposed rate, I think it's safe to say that it will be pretty dramatic impact on that market.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Jeremy, I would just add -- to answer the second part of your question, we are a backlog-driven company. And so fortunately, most of the revenue that we have in the guidance for FY '13 are machines that are already sitting in backlog plus our service organization.", "Dow R. Wilson", "There was a -- there also was a -- the Marwood Group published a report earlier this month, suggesting that they expected maybe a 10% cut instead of the 40% proposed cut. As I mentioned during the call, Congress and Senate have been very supportive of providers and the industry, and I think we're pretty encouraged by these new thoracic code. We think that, that's going to be a very important deal in helping open up radiation -- radiosurgery to the lung cancer clinic. So that will be nice for us.", "Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then, I just wanted to switch over to X-ray. Obviously, a nice rebound from the last couple of quarters. I know you're citing some of these new products to drive that order growth. Do you see this as sustainable? Or these more -- some one-time things? Or is this a more sustainable run rate that we should be thinking about going forward?", "Dow R. Wilson", "Frankly, the radiology market has been flattish. So the market has nothing to write home about. But the -- our game in this business, though, is growing our served market, and that business has done just a terrific job at introducing new products and signing up new customers. We had several new product launches last year. By the time you get a customer signed up and get it designed into the product and rolling out, it takes a while. We're starting to see that impact and we have a whole bunch of new products we're introducing again this year. So we're very encouraged. We've got a new replacement tube for CT scanning. Our tubes are optimized for the new digital panels. That could drive a new replacement cycle in the tubes business. We've got a new wireless panel. Anyway, a whole bunch of new products coming out of the X-ray business. So I think we got a game here for the next little while. They're doing well, and that game is going to continue.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Palmer with CLSA.", "Jonathan J. Palmer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Dow, I was hoping if you could maybe just dive a little deeper in the 10% U.S. order growth. How much of that is coming from the freestanding clinic market?", "Dow R. Wilson", "That's a very small -- that's, I'd say, very small.", "Jonathan J. Palmer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And then, when do you expect that to pick up after we get the ruling here?", "Dow R. Wilson", "Oh, I'll tell you after that I hear about the reimbursement decision. So I think that market has been quiet, frankly, all year, but especially the second half of this past year, it's been very quiet. And if reimbursement remains flattish, I think we'd see it pick up a little bit. There has been -- we are seeing the hospital market -- just kind of stepping back from a market standpoint, we are seeing the hospital markets being more aggressive in really trying to go after the business that they've lost over the last few years.", "Jonathan J. Palmer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "That's helpful. And then, for Elisha, how should we think about the margin progression throughout the year? I mean, looking at the order growth in international, should we assume some continued pressure on gross margins?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Well, if you look at the guidance for FY '13, the sale is up 8% to 9%. And I do want to mention that, that includes some significant proton revenue. So 80%, 90% -- $80 million to $90 million in proton revenue in the fiscal year. So if one of those deals were to fall out, we would be on the low end of that range; if it all materializes, towards the higher end of that range. But the gross margin for the total company, if you exclude the excise tax next year, is about flat at 42%. So despite higher proton revenues and this continued shift to the international deliveries, we're going to still be able to maintain margin roughly flat with the FY '12. Again, that excise tax does take the margin down by about 0.5 point.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dalton Chandler with Needham & Company.", "Dalton L. Chandler - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "I just want to follow up, Dow, on your comments about seeing these multi-unit orders. I know there's -- to some extent, there's always an upgrade cycle going on. But you're sort of implying that maybe you're seeing an acceleration in that. Is that the case? And if so, why do you think it's happening right now?", "Dow R. Wilson", "I'd say we always have a few. We did have maybe more this quarter than we usually see. I don't know if that's a trend yet that I could say, Dalton. A, we always have more orders in the fourth quarter anyway, so it ends up being what? 28% of the year-ish. And I don't know that, that there's a market trend that we could point to at this point other than let's hope it keeps going.", "Dalton L. Chandler - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Fair enough. And then, just on your $0.06 to $0.08 impact guidance from the excise tax, I'm having a hard time getting to a number that low, could you just walk us through how you get there?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Sure. Well, it's 2.3% tax on FDA-listed devices that excludes service. You can deduct installation. So there's a few things that you can deduct. You can also deduct freight. So a very, very high level of math, Dalton. If you take Oncology sales in the U.S., U.S. only with no service, call it roughly $750 million, you take out 7% for installation, freight, that gets you close to $55 million. You tax effect that at 2.3%, and it gets you right at about $4 million a quarter, $3.5 million to $4 million per quarter. The $10 million to $12 million for this year, again is only 3 quarters are covered in FY '13.", "Dalton L. Chandler - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So the -- like the X-ray tubes that you sell to OEMs, you don't pay tax on that?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Very little in panels because they are sold for further manufacture because they are components. They are not included in this. And then, I should also mention, on protons, while the dollars are high, it's also very a high installation cost that we get to deduct and we contractually pass the tax onto our customers in our contracts for protons.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla with Citi.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I wanted to just, Dow, dig a little bit deeper into the U.S. Oncology performance and see if you could just piece out a little bit about the Siemens' contribution as well as the multi-unit orders that were kind of above and beyond what you'd normally see. So maybe you could just help us, Dow -- and maybe what percentage of the U.S. orders this time around were different than the past, and how sustainable that would be?", "Dow R. Wilson", "As I said, I think that's an event. I think it's, kind of, in a normal range. We always have, I'd say, significant multi-unit orders. So that's not a change. We maybe saw a little bit more this last quarter than usual, but I don't think it's anything abnormal from what we've normally had. The U.S. market as well as the Siemens, we are seeing some Siemens install base trade out. We have not really been able to launch our Siemens partnership in the U.S. Our GE partnership expires right before ASTRO, this week, in fact. And so, we'll really be launching that -- yes, it expires at 26th of October, so we'll really be taking off our Siemens/Varian relationship in the U.S. at ASTRO. Outside of the U.S., I think the Siemens partnership has helped us out a little bit, and we've also helped them out a little bit. So I think that we -- I did point to a couple of customers in the U.S. that were Siemens units, but that was largely without their help at this point.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Is it sustainability, Dow, on what you're seeing right now in the U.S.?", "Dow R. Wilson", "Well, it's -- we are -- we love what we saw. I think, at this point, it's too early to decide is this a trend or an event, but we're -- the funnel looks pretty good and the freestanding market is still very quiet yet, but we were certainly very pleased on the quarter.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I just -- if I could sneak a quick one in for Elisha, in the guidance, if you look at the low end of your earnings range at the 8%, that component, you're getting very little leverage. So can you just talk about the leverage components? I know you gave gross margin already, but talk about expenses and tax, how you're thinking about those in the low end of your guidance versus the high?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Sure. Yes. So again, gross margin, flat at about 42% for the full-year, ROS also about 21% for the full-year. We do have the restructuring charge that Dow mentioned, the excise tax, obviously, goes into that as well. Tax rate of 28% to 29% helped by the share repurchase program that we've done to get to that range. We also put a range on there, a fairly broad range, because of just the unprecedented euro fluctuation that we saw in the last year. So we've run this at $1.20 to $1.30 and everywhere in between and we just have to be -- at this -- I think we have to be prudent this early in the fiscal year to assume that the euro won't necessarily stay right at the $1.30 it is right now.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I want to kind of follow up on a question a minute ago and just kind of the strength in U.S. market. Obviously, it's a lot better than people were expecting. Can you just talk to where you saw -- you were most surprised relative to your own expectations? And how much of what you're seeing, you think, is a function of share shift versus other factors?", "Dow R. Wilson", "I'd say, I think our share was up. We haven't seen everybody's results, but I'd say we probably got a couple of points market shares in the fourth quarter. We usually don't get too excited about quarterly movements, and we're not always sure how much we should celebrate even movements in orders. When you look at a year back on a sales basis, we do see our share growing on a revenue basis. And as we like things that we can put in our wallet; that tends to be the way we can measure it. In terms of the market conditions and what surprised us, we were obviously pleased at the results in the Q4 U.S. performance. We do have a new sales team. I think that was part of it. We've got a very energized sales team, and we're very pleased with how that is going. The -- maybe there are some external factors. Again, I'd rather wait a quarter or 2 before commenting on that. We've talked a little bit about the big IT spends that has been happening in healthcare, maybe a lot of capital dollars have been allocated in that direction, might we see some come back to revenue-generating capital investment, we're obviously hopeful. But I certainly haven't seen any data yet to suggest that, that's the case. We are seeing our treatment planning and information system products are getting very good traction. We've had new releases of both of those products, and people are excited about that. We'll cover that some more in Boston at the Investor Event, but that's exciting. Anyway, it was really kind of broad-based with the exception of the freestanding market. So that was encouraging.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then since this is your first call in the CEO role, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about your priorities and maybe some of the initiatives we should think about you -- you're taking in, in your first year? And I know you obviously mentioned the restructuring charge as well, can you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the cost structure?", "Dow R. Wilson", "Sure. I'd say -- first of all, we're going to be who we've always been and that is we're an innovation-driven company. And it's new products that drive our growth to being more than a $1.5 billion of growth. RapidArc's $600 million of growth. The terrific job that Bob Kluge and his team have done in X-Ray Products with flat panel. Just a number of stories like that. We're an organic-driven growth company. That's who we've always been. That's who we're going to be. So our R&D investment is very important that we get juice out of that investment. We think we have something very exciting to show you in Boston on Sunday. So come see what some of that investment is buying us. Going down the list, I think in terms of things that will be changing a little bit, clearly, emerging markets are very important for us, both in terms of distribution and service investment as well as having the right product at the right price points. So that's going to be continuing and an important theme for us. Our software and services businesses are both great platforms. We want to -- they've been growing well. We want to keep growing them. Our service business is now almost 1/3 of the company, $750 million of orders, I think, I mentioned on the call, still growing at double-digit rate. Our software business -- now, some of that is double counted in our service business, but our software business overall is a $500 million business. I think we've got continued big opportunity there. We were -- it was a small thing we said in the script, but really one of the most important things for us in the quarter was the wins that University of Michigan and Memorial Sloan-Kettering for our treatment planning product just really demonstrates the great strength of our software products and their ability to do what customers want them to do in the most demanding of environments. We also won in the oncology information system space, a conversion at the Mayo Clinic. So again, a huge endorsement of our software business. So I think -- anyway, software and services is going to be a big initiative.", "Protons is -- we've got some big milestones next year. So we want to get San Diego, first patient done next year. That's probably our single biggest proof statement for our ability in protons next year. So watch this space about next summer time. And then, on the productivity side, it's -- and I think we've got a little wake-up call 6 months ago with the markets changing and shifting and the shift to international markets. We clearly want to drive gross margin, so we've got a number of initiatives. We talked -- we have talked on this call in the past about TrueBeam. We are seeing the traction on TrueBeam that we would like to see. So that's good, and we're now extending those efforts to the rest of our product line. The restructuring is really pretty small. We're offering an enhanced retirement package and we're really kind of looking at how do we redeploy some of our resources to those markets. That's the game for us as we go forward. It's really do we have the right resources in the right place given where our growth is, especially in the emerging markets.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Great. I just have one quick one for Elisha, and then I'll hop off. You have a lot of your cash offshore. Can you just talk about your ability to fund repurchases given [indiscernible] cash?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yes. I would say 90 -- 98% of our cash is offshore and as we continue to grow more internationally, I don't see that really changing any time soon. But given the very strong cash flow that we have in an extremely conservative balance sheet and an almost 0 interest rate environment right now, both on the borrowing and on the investment side, you should assume that we will continue to deploy a significant part of our cash flow into share repurchase. We have an 8 million share authorization that will carry us through calendar year 2013, and we will not be afraid to take on a prudent level of debt in order to execute under that authorization.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I wanted to pick up on a topic that Tim had brought up earlier this year. And I believe, over the last 3 calls, had chosen to proactively address -- and it's product pricing. I didn't hear about it on this call. Is that a signal that your product pricing is less of an issue than it was before? I think the skeptic would say that when we had to a big-order quarter, there could be a pricing dynamic there. Could you help us understand how things are evolving?", "Dow R. Wilson", "Good question. I'd say -- first of all, I don't think in the quarter, pricing was any more intense than it's been in the past. So I don't think that was a lever that we used to drive share in the quarter at all. In fact, I would say that our order pricing is stabilizing. We have repositioned some of our products. This goes back. It wasn't something we did in the quarter, but we did some repositioning 6 to 9 months ago with some tweaks over the last quarter to -- of our product line to make sure we were achieving the margin targets that we needed in markets. So I -- we're actually hopeful that, that helps us go in the -- in a positive direction. I'd say competition has still been tough. We've got to be disciplined about the way we price. We focus on capability, reliability, throughput. We do a lot of training of our sales force. We're as committed as any organization to sales training as anybody out there. We want to really make sure we've got people who can sell the value at each price point. And as we've said a little bit in the past, we also want to be careful about how we offer price and terms. In this environment, everybody wants terms and that's okay, and clearly we've got the balance sheet to do that but we don't want to be in that position where we're offering terms and price. So Elisha and her team have a good process. The sales team and Kolleen Kennedy, who runs the Oncology business, have a good escalation system, so that we're monitoring this as we go. So I think -- you know what? It's a good question. We're looking at it. I would say as the take away, stable.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "All right. And another topic that I'm sure you're really enjoying talking about as CEO is reimbursement. I want to ask a question in a different way. Are we all making this out to be a bigger risk, financially, in terms of the order patterns for the company than it really is? Let me say it in another way. If the rule, let's say, comes in with some sort of moderation as you suggest, say it's minus 12 so that's minus 20 over a 2-year span, what does that really mean for orders over the balance of the year? Are we too concerned about it?", "Dow R. Wilson", "I'll start with I haven't done the regression, so I couldn't tell you what the r squared is on this, but when you stand back and look at the overall picture, there is some good news. The good news is hospital reimbursement is up 2%. So in a 0 inflation environment, they get a price increase. Two, we've got this thoracic code coming with the single most exciting thing that's happening in our business is radiosurgery to treat lung cancer. Not so driver for everybody. And now what happens in the freestanding market, as I said, it's 10% of our global orders. It's just not that important anymore. So I'd say in the short-term, yes, I think it probably is a little bit overplayed.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from David Roman with Goldman Sachs.", "David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I was hoping -- i know we didn't [ph] pick up on things Tim said in the past. I know we obviously have you now as the CEO, but one thing that was sort of a topic of discussion over the past year or so was M&A. But in a response to an earlier question, you made it pretty clear that organic growth was going to really be the crust of the growth profile going forward. If you could maybe talk about your latest thoughts on acquisitions and how that fits into your business, particularly in the context of the solid numbers that you've just put up?", "Dow R. Wilson", "We'd love to do more quarters like the last one. That's kind of where we are, and we've got a new product coming out at ASTRO. We've always been an organic growth company. We've got lots of opportunities. Our big challenge in allocating our R&D investment is not looking for the next opportunity. It's really which ones are we going to fund and not fund. That's our biggest challenge going forward. So I'd say we're always looking. If there's a good acquisition that comes in, we'll take a look at it. But it's going to be product, technology and probably small and accretive quickly. That's what we want to look at. So I -- Tim is smarter than I am, so I'm not going to talk too much on this one. But the -- I'm -- we're going to be conservative on this.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions at this time.", "Spencer R. Sias", "Okay. We want to thank you very much.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Spencer Sias, for Varian Medical Systems. Thank you. Mr. Sias, you may begin.", "Spencer R. Sias", "Thank you very much. Good afternoon, and welcome to Varian Medical Systems conference call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2013. With me are Dow Wilson, President and CEO; Elisha Finney, CFO; and Clarence Verhoef, our Corporate Controller. Dow and Elisha will summarize our results and will take your questions following the presentation.", "To simplify our discussion unless otherwise stated, all references to the quarter or year are fiscal quarters and fiscal years.

We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this presentation and discussion because of new information, future events or otherwise.", "And now here's Dow.", "Dow R. Wilson", "Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone. Varian's revenues and net earnings continue to grow during the second quarter in line with our expectations for the company. Net orders on the other hand were mixed with strong growth in our X-ray Products business and the decline in our Oncology business.", "To quickly summarize our results, revenues rose 7% to $768 million. Our gross and operating margins improved. Earnings per diluted share increased 9% to $1.02, and our backlog grew 4% over the year-ago quarter to $2.8 billion. Net orders fell by 2% and Oncology Systems grew by 10% in X-ray Products and declined by $131 million in the Other category versus the year-ago period when we booked orders for 2 Proton Therapy Systems in Saudi Arabia and Russia. I will cover the operational highlights for the quarter and let Elisha walk you through the details of the P&L and balance sheet.", "A 9% decline in North American Oncology Systems net orders offset the 4% increase across markets outside North America leading to an overall 2% decline in net orders, which totaled $555 million for the quarter. The North American oncology market is experiencing slower capital spending related to ongoing uncertainty regarding health care reform and potential reimbursement changes. For example, many of our customers appear to be focused on developing new partnerships across clinical specialties to prepare for operating in an Accountable Care Organization, or ACO, environment, and the possibility of bundled payments for cancer therapy services as well. We're also seeing some continuing consolidation activity among hospitals and clinics, which may be contributing to purchasing delays.", "The U.S. market uncertainty will likely extend in the next fiscal year. However for the long-term, we believe a transition to our ACO environment could lead to renewed investments in more advanced and cost-efficient clinical capability to support outcome-driven standards of care and pay-per-performance. Radiotherapy and radiosurgery are among the least invasive and most cost-effective ways of treating cancer, and Varian's technology and product portfolio fits this scenario to a T.", "During the period of uncertainty and transition in the U.S., we expect bigger variations in net orders from quarter-to-quarter.  A host of factors including deal size, timing and changing purchasing processes will contribute to this increased variability.", "Net orders in our EMEA region rose by 4%. While Western Europe continues to be impacted by austerity and recession in several countries, we received sizable equipment orders from customers in Russia, South Africa, Switzerland and the United Kingdom during the quarter. We also saw the first TrueBeam systems installed in South Africa and Bangladesh.", "Emerging markets are driving growth, and the BRIC countries, in particular, grew product orders by nearly 20%. An example of our strength in these markets is in Russia, where we have nearly doubled our order volume year-to-date. Among the highlights in the second quarter was a large order for multiple linear accelerators, including a TrueBeam that will be installed in several Russian hospitals. We booked our first orders for the new EDGE radiosurgery system during the quarter, and several other customers ordered EDGE radiosurgery upgrades, accessories and software for their existing treatment machines. Customer interest in this technology is high, and the sales funnel for our radiosurgery solution looks solid. We hope to receive CE Mark to sell EDGE in Europe later this year.", "This month, we are celebrating the shipment of our 500th TrueBeam. This is the fastest adoption of any treatment machine in the history of radiation oncology. Today, TrueBeam represents nearly 60% of our high-energy machine orders, and the average pricing on this system remains stable even with the shift to markets outside of North America. Our service business remains a growth driver as we continued to see a high-contact capture rate. Net orders were up by 8% for the quarter and 10% year-to-date. Customers, globally, are recognizing the value of comprehensive service and software contracts. We expect to sustain growth in service as more than 300 TrueBeams move out of warranty in the next 18 months.", "Our Siemens partnership is making good progress. We now have the software complete to enable connectivity with about 80% of the Siemens installed base. The first clinical treatment using a Siemens accelerator and Varian's ARIA software took place this month.", "The auctions to equip public cancer centers in Brazil with more than 80 treatment machines is now set for the end of June. Meanwhile, business continued normally in Brazil, where we received orders for 3 TrueBeams and a UNIQUE system during the quarter.", "I'd like to take a moment to call your attention to some new clinical studies that demonstrate recent advances made in radiotherapy and radiosurgery. In March, the International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology and Physics published a paper on follow-up prostate research involving 1,002 patients treated from August 2007 until December 2008 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The paper shows that IMRT makes it possible to deliver higher doses to the prostate without increasing normal tissue complications. By escalating those to the prostate, investigators demonstrated excellent biochemical control rates without incurring higher toxicity.", "Another article published in April issue of Cancer [ph] on a study of 112,000 breast cancer patients between 1990 and 2004 showed breast-conserving therapy, including a lumpectomy and radiotherapy, had improved survival compared with mastectomy. Finally, an online article in the Red Journal on research into stereotactic radiosurgery for inoperable liver metastases reported promising findings in a Phase II prospective study of 61 patients between February 2010 and September of 2011. Researchers at the Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland achieved a 94% 1-year local control rate with acceptable toxicity using radiosurgery. These findings warrant further investigation and may someday lead to an ultimate treatment option for liver metastasis. The big picture in all this is that significant clinical research in radiotherapy and radiosurgery continues to advance in existing and new cancer indications.", "Before leaving Oncology Systems, let me recap our long-term view of the market. As noted earlier, we believe the U.S. market will exhibit a high degree of variability. Growth in EMEA is expected to be mixed with stronger growth in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India, offset by lower growth in Southern Europe. The outlook for Asia, Latin America and the Rest of World remains robust. Overall, we believe the longer-term global market will continue to grow, on average, in the mid- single-digit range.", "Turning to X-ray Products, this business had another good quarter. Net orders for X-Ray grew by 10% during the quarter to $144 million. Revenues grew by 14% to $140 million and the X-ray team managed to improve its operating margin despite pricing pressure in the flat panel business. New products in our X-ray tube and flat panel lines helped to drive the growth. The tube business grew with the help of strong demand for CT tubes including our newest high-performance CT tube. The tube business is benefiting from the performance of its main customers Toshiba, which continues to do well in the tough diagnostic imaging market.", "We began delivering our new series of panels for high-resolution, low-dose imaging in radiographic and dynamic applications. Our new wireless panel is now being designed as the next-generation systems for portable radiography. Some customers are reporting that these more sensitive panels may help them to reduce the X-ray dose to the patient by more than 20% without any loss in image quality. Customer interest in our new panel and workstation packages increased during the quarter. Several customers are seeking integrated imaging solutions that shorten the development time it takes to get their new products to market. With new products gaining momentum, good growth prospects for panel workstation packages and an ongoing conversion to digital imaging, our outlook for the X-ray Products business remains bullish.", "Net orders for the Other category were $37 million for the quarter versus $168 million in the year-ago quarter, when we booked $124 million in Proton orders for our systems in Saudi Arabia and Russia. Second quarter revenues for the Other category were $46 million compared with $32 million in the year-ago quarter. We did not book any new orders for Proton installations during the quarter, but the pipeline continues to look good. We are on track with the Scripps installation where the first patient treatment is slated to begin in September. Construction is continuing on the center at the University of Maryland, and we are hopeful that financing will be complete and an order booked before the end of the fiscal year. Meanwhile, construction is expected to begin soon on a new center at Emory University in Georgia and the financing works needed to book this order is underway. We will be at the groundbreaking ceremony there next week.", "Net orders in our Security business were down versus a very strong year-ago quarter. This business grew revenues by more than 50% in the quarter. We've now refocused our Security business R&D efforts on new components to address currently underserved markets, and we're aiming to introduce more compact industrial linear accelerators as well as a new class of panels able to support megavoltage imaging systems.", "Now here's Elisha.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Thanks, Dow, and hello, everyone. While Dow has already covered net orders, I want to briefly talk about the constant currency growth rates for the quarter.", "In comparing quarter-over-quarter exchange rate, there was a significant effect from the weakening of the yen and a small effect from the weakening of the euro and other currencies. Oncology net orders declined 2% in dollars and were flat in constant currency. Oncology's North American net orders were down 9% in dollars. EMEA's net orders increased 4% in dollars and 5% in constant currency, and Asia, where we saw a roughly 15% weakening of the yen, was flat in dollars but up 7% in constant currency. Oncology net orders in Rest of World region grew by 16% in dollars and 17% in constant currency.", "Second quarter revenues for the total company increased 7% in dollars and 8% in constant currency. As expected, Oncology Systems posted a 3% increase in revenue during the quarter with 56% coming from outside North America. Oncology revenues were particularly strong in Asia, as well as in Africa and the Middle East. X-ray Products posted a gain of 14% with double digit growth in both tubes and panel. Revenues from businesses under the Other category increased by 43%. We recorded $20 million of Proton revenue as a percentage of completion accounting commenced for both the Saudi and Russia as projects.", "While I'm talking about Proton, let me remind you that we are expecting about $80 million in Proton revenue with roughly a 10% to 12% gross margin for the year. Our Proton revenue and margin expectations for the year assumed that financing for the University of Maryland project will be completed in our fourth quarter, and that we will then be able to book about $40 million in revenue for this project.", "Returning to the P&L. The second quarter gross margin for the company increased 40 basis points to 41.6%. Oncology Systems gross margin improved by 60 basis points to 42.8% even including the $2 million or 30-basis-point impact of the excise tax. This gain was primarily due to a product mix that included a higher proportion of service and TrueBeam revenue. X-ray Products gross profit dollars increased by 13%, driven by volume gains in both tube and panel businesses. The gross margin rate, however, fell by 0.5 point to 42.5% from the year-ago quarter principally because of pricing pressure in the panel business partially offset by volume and productivity gains in both tubes and panels.", "Second quarter SG&A expenses were $113 million or 15% of revenues essentially even as a percentage of revenue from the year-ago quarter. These included the previously announced $2.5 million restructuring charge to complete our enhanced retirement program. Second quarter R&D expenses were $51 million or 7% of revenues, also about even as a percentage of revenue with the year-ago quarter.", "Moving down the income statement. Second quarter operating earnings totaled $156 million, up 8% from the year-ago quarter in dollars and up 30 basis points to 20.3% of revenues. The restructuring charge and excise tax together reduced our operating margin by about 1 point for the quarter. Depreciation and amortization totaled $16 million for the quarter. The effective tax rate was 27.9% for the quarter. And for the second half, we estimate that the tax rate will be about 28% to 29%. Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased significantly from the year-ago quarter to $110.7 million due largely to our ongoing share repurchase program. Including the $0.03 impact from the restructuring charge and excise tax, and roughly a $0.02 impact from the weakened yen, diluted EPS rose 9% to $1.02.", "Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $740 million, debt of $238 million and stockholder's equity of $1.6 billion. DSO increased by 4 days from the year-ago quarter to 87, including a 5-day impact from the Proton therapy business and reflecting a continued shift to international delivery. Second quarter cash flow from operations was $31 million as net income was more than offset by working capital changes. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was $103 million. Primary uses of cash were $90 million toward the repurchase of 1.4 million shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we have 5 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization.", "Now I'll turn it back to Dow for the outlook.", "Dow R. Wilson", "Thanks, Elisha. The company remains on track for achieving its fiscal 2013 growth targets. For the third quarter of fiscal year 2013, total company revenues could increase by about 7% over the prior year quarter. Net earnings per diluted share for the third quarter should be in the range of $0.98 to $1.02. For the fiscal year, we continue to believe that total company revenues could increase by about 8% over the prior fiscal year and that net earnings per diluted share for the fiscal year could be in the range of $4.09 to $4.14.", "We're now ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Amit Hazan with SunTrust.", "Amit Hazan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "So I think going straight to the orders where I think a lot of people will focus, you talked about a lot of things. What would probably surprised me the most is your referencing of ACOs and bundling -- I mean, ACOs, I think, there's probably like 500 of them now. And so I'm kind of wondering, with regard to that, if you're seeing radiation therapy for some reason is seeing more of the hospital systems that are going to ACOs that also have radiation oncology clinics inside of them, why you'd reference that at this point in such a pretty small number relative to the number of hospitals in the U.S. And then bundling as well, if you could just talk about whether you're referencing freestanding centers or whether you're thinking that, that could impact the hospital setting, outpatient setting as well.", "Dow R. Wilson", "I think the overall, message about U.S. market should be one of uncertainty. There's just a lot of -- people don't know exactly what they're shooting at in the market, continued rumors of reform and reimbursement and where it's going to go. We do see, especially on freestanding side, people lining up with other cancer services, so that they can offer a bundled cancer therapy offering. And so I think that's where we're seeing some of that kind of pause on that side of the market. The software market is still solid. We're seeing pressure on folks to replace product, so that they can have stereotactic radiosurgery and stereotactic body radiation therapy capability. Our funnel looks good, but we've definitely seen kind of a transition in the market. You kind of look back. Last 4 quarters we've had 1 very good quarter, 1 outstanding quarter, and 2 not-so-good quarters, and that's a little bit of the reflection of, I think, what we're seeing in the U.S. market.", "Amit Hazan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, then maybe let me ask a question in terms of reimbursement, and then just going into the next round here, what's your understanding of where CMS might be in terms of the hospital outpatient setting? And maybe separately just talk about whether you expect kind of the ASTRO reimbursement proposal to play out in the freestanding side?", "Dow R. Wilson", "I think the -- clearly, the ASTRO coding proposal is going to have to go before the American Medical Association and their CPT Panel. We do expect modifications in that [ph] and don't have a lot of visibility on which way that is going to go. We do not expect significant reductions in the freestanding center reimbursements and thinks that -- I think that, that will probably maintain.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla with Citi.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Dow, I just wanted to just dig into North America, the minus 9% order growth. Can you just give us a better sense of software and service versus like linear accelerators? Were all 3 of those areas down, or was there any pockets of strength in North America?", "Dow R. Wilson", "Service remained very good. And as I mentioned in the call, we're bullish about where that goes both in North America and long term, interesting little highlight there. I think I said in the call that we have 300 TrueBeams coming out of warranty over the next 18 months. That's one per working day, and that's a big contract opportunity for us as we look out the next 18 months. Software was okay. And clearly, it was the hardware market that was softest in North America.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And, Dow, when you talk about the overall radiation oncology market, you said it's a kind of mid-single-digit growth market. I think last time around you said mid to high, so there clearly is some slowing. The tube -- the first half of this year has seen the oncology orders decline roughly 2%. So as we look out to 2014, are we looking at the potential for revenue to be down next year?", "Dow R. Wilson", "We'll give guidance later. But as we said, we think the market is in the mid-single range. Last 2 quarters are that down 2%. Fourth quarter was a strong double-digit performance. Just going around the horn, as I mentioned, we still see a very good funnel in North America. And so it will be interesting to see what happens here in the second half in North America. Europe is mixed. Central Europe, Germany, France, have been very strong for us. The U.K. has been strong. Southern Europe is very, very quiet. So Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, kind of the usual culprits there, have been very, very quiet. So we think that's going to be kind of mixed. We still see Asia as very strong. Orders do take about 1 year to translate into the P&L. So it's going to be really a second-half discussion. Elisha, you got --", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yes, Amit, I would just that total company backlog is up 4%,  but if you just look at the oncology backlog quarter-over-quarter, it was up 6%, which is right in line with the 5% to 6% that oncology that is going to grow revenues this year. Obviously, not much services in backlog, and that's growing at a faster clip. So again not guidance into FY '14, but I think it kind of sets us up for the next 12 months that we do have backlog to support mid-single digit growth as we sit here today.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And, Elisha, just a quick one on expense cuts. I mean you are -- you did a little restructuring. How much room do you still have for the back half of the year for reducing the expenses if needed?", "Elisha W. Finney", "For the full fiscal year, we've got $6.5 million of restructuring that's built into these numbers. We've got excise tax. We've got negative impact on the yen. In all of that said, we're still going to see a relatively flat year-over-year operating margin. So I think from an expense perspective, with all of those things built in, it's a huge win for FY '13 that we can have a flat operating margin year-over-year and I think sets us up pretty well going into next year. But again we'll give guidance on next year when we get to the end of this fiscal year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone with Jefferies Group.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Couple for Dow, and then a couple gross margin questions for Elisha. First, on the guidance. Dow, if we look at the third quarter guidance, you put up 7% growth for the top line. By my math, if you run that through, you need about 9.5% to 10% growth to come in at the 8% range for the year. So the comments on North America were a little apprehensive. I'm wondering where that fourth quarter confidence comes from if we look at Oncology, X-ray and perhaps Proton?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yes, let me take a stab at that one. It really is reflective of the Proton business, which is going to grow significantly in the second half versus the first half. So if I look at third quarter, the guidance on sales up about 7%, when you compare that to the full year, you can do the math and deduct that we have to have a double-digit revenue growth in Q4. And really, a significant piece of that is coming from the Proton business where again we expect that we will get the financing completed on the Maryland deal and be able to take close to $50 million of revenue in Q4 in our Proton therapy business.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And was that a change also in the expectation? You actually realized some profitability on that and I thought there was no expectation for any profits this year?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Well the good news is for the first few of these, they were booked at a 0 margin. So of course Scripps is under the percentage of completion. We're deferring any profit until we get to the very end. Saudi, Russia, a little bit, but by the time you put all of this together for this fiscal year, our expectation is that the gross profit on that total $80 million or so should be in the 10% to 12% range. So again, significantly below the company margin level, but starting to contribute some dollars.", "Dow R. Wilson", "And again that's at the gross margin level.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "To stay on gross margin for a second, Elisha, you spoke about pricing pressure in the panel business. Can you just elaborate there on how extensive that was in the quarter, and if you expect that to continue?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yes. So let me just kind of back up and say, for the full fiscal year, we still expect that X-ray is going to be in the 42% to 43% growth margin range. Just as a data point, if you look back 3 years ago, they were at 40%. So this panel business carries higher margins than the tube. It's been growing at a much faster pace than the tube. So I think just the reflection of a product line that is maturing and is becoming more mainstream, although I think Spencer would still tell you we're only in the third and fourth inning in terms of adoption of digital imaging. But we're just seeing some normal pricing pressure associated with that, but this is a highly profitable product line, and as it continues to grow faster than tubes, I think it's going to -- the X-ray segment should continue to be able to hold that margin level.", "Dow R. Wilson", "Yes, just as an aside for that business, last year, we made 3,000 (sic) [10,000] panels and this year we'll make about 13,000 panels.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that helps. Last one for me. I'll hop back in. Dow, you mentioned a lot about the North American market. One of the things you mentioned was consolidation perhaps of freestanding clinics into hospitals. How many of your freestanding customers do you believe are actually in discussions to be acquired? And sort of how long do you think this consolidation phase takes to unfold?", "Dow R. Wilson", "All right. I think we're seeing 2 things in that. Let me just emphasize what I said in the call. I think what -- the consolidation that we're seeing, first of all, is people trying to round out their product basket to make sure they can compete in a bundled pricing environment, whether that's ACO or bundled reimbursements or whatever it might be. So the -- I'd say, that's probably the leading trend at this point in time. We are seeing some consolidation. We've tried to quantify it. I can say that inside we don't have any real current data. We're scratching at that pretty hard. We are seeing some consolidation. I think the bigs are all very comfortable. When you look at US Oncology, 21st Century, Vantage kind of customers, which probably represents the majority of this market. They're evaluating investment opportunities. They see this as an opportunity to grow in this uncertainty. And they certainly want to be consolidator not consolidatee as they go into this environment, so they're not part of it. And I made a mistake on the panel. The panels are up 3,000. It went from 10,000 to 13,000. My math was bad.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "So sorry, I've been jumping between calls here. If I ask something that's already been asked, just -- I'll go back to the transcript, just tell me to do that instead. But, Dow, I've heard some of the discussion on the U.S. market. I was wondering if you could touch on maybe your competitive positioning within the U.S. market. I see some -- I hear some of the broader issues maybe impacting all of market. But your competitive positioning there, obviously, the MD Anderson news, your competitors want to play that up as they got a couple of systems sold into there. But you feel like you're gaining or losing share in the U.S. market, especially mine share maybe with some of your bigger customers?", "Dow R. Wilson", "We think our market share in the U.S. is actually up. We -- when you kind of look -- we look at it 2 ways. We look at it on both on orders basis and a trailing revenue basis. Trailing revenue, you've heard us talk about that before. On a trailing revenue basis, we think our market share is actually up a couple of points globally and probably even a little more than that in the U.S. The -- there's always some puts and takes in the market, as you mentioned. But in the core of the market, we're doing very, very well. TrueBeam continues to capture the imagination of our customers, and it's winning a lot of market share. Elekta has a new product. It's clear it's no TrueBeam. In fact, really all it's done is narrow the gap to the Clinac iX and Trilogy product. It can't match us for SRS, SBRT capability for efficiency of delivering those [ph] , for throughput, for flattening filter free capability and for motion management. It's still significantly behind. So from a product positioning point of view, we are very comfortable from a market share point of view. Obviously, we'll be looking at their year-end numbers to see how they do. But when you look at the last 12 months of orders, we think our share is going faster than theirs in the -- globally and in the U.S.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Fair enough. And then just one last follow-up. Just on the radiosurgery side, a lot of discussion here over the last -- well, more than just the last few weeks. But it's been heightened over the last few weeks here as we think about what kind of impact that might have on system sales as we go to hypofractionation. And I think long term we all see that could be a risk. But in the near term, meaning the next 2, 3, 4, 5 years, is that really an opportunity more of an upgrade opportunity and really to drive higher price systems and new technology into the market before we have to start worrying about volume declines on the Linac side?", "Dow R. Wilson", "No, absolutely. I think in the short term, this is going to drive an upgrade cycle for customers. To be able to do SRS and SBRT with confidence, you need image guidance, you need very fast delivery time, and you have to really know where that tumor is. And you're going to want to do that on new technology. So in the short term, I think it's very positive news. In the long term, I also think it's very good news because it brings more patients from other cancer therapies into radiation. And I think it's a win in that way in the long term as well. So I kind of view it as good news and good news.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Do you think Linac per million population all the different stats that we look at by country in that 5 years from now starts trending down not up? Or do you think because of the increased utilization across new indications, that it could at least hold steady?", "Dow R. Wilson", "I think for the next 5 years, it's only going to go in one direction, and that's up. There's just so much need out there that it's going to go up. Beyond that, I think we're going to be talking about new applications in cancer and maybe even outside of cancer that can even drive more penetration of Linacs. You've heard us say before that just to get the Rest of the World to kind of the Europe standard for Linacs per million people, we need 10,000 new Linacs, which is basically a doubling of the global installed base. Now for the long term, when you look at the horizon here and look at the long term, we're still very comfortable where this is going. There's lots of opportunity and very confident about where we're headed.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.", "David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to just to follow up on your previous comments regarding sort of the long-term growth rate of the business and maybe just to ground us. Can you just remind us how big emerging market are as a percentage of your sales today?", "Dow R. Wilson", "Emerging markets today are about 10%. And as I said, they grew this last quarter about 20%, and that's just going to keep picking up. This last quarter in orders, our o U.S. business was 58% of the quarter, which -- that's -- have we done bigger than that before? That's got to be pretty close to a high watermark for us.", "Elisha W. Finney", "That's a high watermark.", "David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So when I think about the growth rate, is it too simplistic to say the your 90% of the business in developed markets kind of paces along at a low single-digit rate maybe consistent with where health care spending is growing or hospital CapEx. And then you're dependent really on that emerging markets bogey, continuing to grow at that rate. Is that how we should think about the aggregate top line growth rate and that will sort of get you to a mid-single-digit type number? Obviously, below where you've been historically, but somewhat consistent with where the industry is going.", "Dow R. Wilson", "From geographic point of view, as I said, we see the global market in kind of this mid-single-digit range, which is going to be made up of a tough and lumpy environment in North America. Developed Europe is going to be kind of tale of 2 cities. There's going to be those economies that are strong. And I think we'll see them grow at mid- to single-high digit kind of growth. And then Southern Europe is going to be de nada (sic) [nada] for a while, I think, until credit crises get solved. We had a huge performance in Africa. We haven't talked about Africa much. I think you'll hear as talk more and more about Africa. India, China, Brazil will -- when you look at Asia, Rest of World scenario, it's going to be a double-digit growth scenario. And then, of course, the piece we haven't talked about is service. And the service business continues to be a double-digit grower for us.", "David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then my last question, a similar topic just related to the operating margin and gross margin profile of that geographic mix. I think one thing they came up last year that negatively surprised investors was the extent to which margins were negatively impacted by geographic mix last summer. I mean, have you gone to a point where either that stabilized or there are things you're doing with your cost structure that can maintain the profitability profile of the franchise even as the greater percentage of sales come from developing markets?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yes, David. And I think that's reflected in the quarter where you're absolutely right. In the year-ago period, we had a reset on the oncology gross margins. For the half and for this Q2, it is absolutely in line with where we expect it to be. If you were to take out the excise tax, the margin would be up about 1 point to 43%, and that's even with a 4-point shift in revenues to international deliveries during the quarter. So I think the oncology team has done a great job of being on track with cost reduction, and that we can hopefully be in that 43% to 44% as we go forward with the cost reductions offsetting this continued shift to international markets. I also think service is obviously helping. And if I were to look out over the next 5 years, I think we're going to take service from, call it, a 30% of our total oncology business, probably closer to 40%, nice recurring revenue stream at a higher margin.", "Dow R. Wilson", "Yes, and that's -- one of the things we get as we grow in these emerging markets is, early on, it's all about the equipment business. And then as you grow, you build the installed base and a good service and software business that goes with it. So that will be a positive long-term upward pressure on margin rate.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Feffer with Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "I just wanted -- on a bigger picture, I mean, Dow, you've gone through all the headwinds here. I think we're all pretty familiar. What I'm wondering is, and you can probably speak about it qualitatively, but if you can talk a little bit about the impact on pricing because presumably we see customers that are delaying or lengthening replacement cycles. You have new competition in there that I imagine is coming in at lower prices. So to what extent is that going to play a role in your trying to drive order growth over time?", "Dow R. Wilson", "I'd say so far, as you heard me say, share has held and the mix, the TrueBeam is very positive. So our customers want capability and that capability is around throughput, stereotactic radiosurgery, stereotactic body radiation therapy to do these new applications. And as a result, we're maintaining price on TrueBeam even given the geographic mix that went a little bit against us, at least just looking back on the quarter, we feel very good about that. Obviously, we're going to keep innovating. Innovation is what drives price in this industry, and we're going to keep working on new applications, better outcome and productivity for our customers. And at least historically, when we've done that, they've paid for those innovations. So that's the strategy and what we're working on, and at least so far that's -- we've seen stabilization in pricing.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Palmer with CLSA.", "Jonathan J. Palmer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Dow, it sounds like the Brazil tender has been pushed back here multiple times. How confident are you that a June decision comes to fruition?", "Dow R. Wilson", "Not. What we know right now is that they've announced the date. I think they've issued a tender, and that's -- so that's big progress. They made -- they had issued a tender before. They had some changes to make. And so we do have a date for the reverse auction, and right now that's the end of June. And I'd say, everything that we know at this point in time is that the Ministry of Health is driving this, and it's going to happen. Might it slip a week or 2?  There's always that possibility. But given what we know today, this auction date is supposed to happen end of June. Now as to when orders get really placed, they're going to complete their auction end of June, when do we see purchase orders. I think there's more uncertainty around that, but the actual auction date and the Ministry of Health delivering on that timing is probably better than we've seen it -- the visibility on that's probability better than what we've seen at least so far in time.", "Jonathan J. Palmer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "That's very helpful. And then just staying on the topic of emerging markets. You gave a great review earlier on your competitive position in the U.S. So I wonder if you could provide a similar overview in emerging markets from a product-offering perspective?", "Dow R. Wilson", "Sure. I'd say we continue to do extremely well at the high end. Depending on the market, TrueBeam is at least 1/3 of even -- the most emerging of our emerging markets, so we clearly do very, very well there. We are seeing uptake in UNIQUE. So we had some good volume on the UNIQUE product here this quarter in the low-energy and fairly low-priced segment of the market.", "I think customers are looking for products that have a lot of capability, that have a high throughput; I was with a customer recently that was doing over 140 patients in a 24-hour day just really kind of staggering volume. And that's not -- that volume is atypical. But north of 80 patients a day is not unusual at all in these markets. And so to do that with high reliability and image guidance and RapidArc is kind of what the market wants. And I think our position is very good. I think we -- in China, we can probably enhance our coverage and our relationship with some key accounts better in China. But I'm -- I think that's a little bit more about China's sales coverage and relationships than it is product. I think we're pretty comfortable across the markets at each price point with where our position is at this point.", "Jonathan J. Palmer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And then, Elisha, just one quick housekeeping question here, and I apologize if you mentioned it. What was the growth in product and services for the quarter in Oncology Systems?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Make sure I understand the question. So Oncology, you're talking revenues, were up 3% in the quarter with service revenues up about mid-teens in the quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I wanted to go back to David Roman's question earlier on the margins, and I understand your answer on the gross margin. But can you just talk a little bit about your willingness to show a little bit more of balance sheet -- middle of the balance sheet leverage? In other words, is your cost structure in terms of sales and R&D, properly aligned with where the growth is coming from today? And is there a chance you can get back on a path to 22% to maybe 23% operating margins over time? So maybe just talk to the operating margin dynamic.", "Elisha W. Finney", "That's a tough question, Tycho. I mean, the business is obviously going to change as we move forward into the coming months, quarters, years, and we'll be looking at this. I mean we have been committed to getting increasing leverage year-over-year. We went from 11% at the time of the spin to 21%. You're not going see anywhere, anywhere close to that. But if we can get 25 to 50 basis points, I mean that's what we're striving for, it's really going to be dependent on what kind of growth opportunities do we see, both if we're looking internal at our organic growth opportunities, as well as through our M&A opportunities, which most of those end up being dilutive in the short term. It's going to come down to where we place our bets and where we think we can drive continued growth and where those investments need to be. So I can't sit here today and absolute tell you we're going to that a 1 point improvement in the operating margin next year. I will say that we are committed to growing the corporate cost slower than the top line. We will likely continue to grow R&D at least as fast as the top line growth, and SG&A is, again, is going to depend on where the opportunities are. But I do think we've made a good effort at putting resources where the growth is, and that was all part of this whole retirement restructuring that we announced, and we'll continue to do that as we move forward.", "Dow R. Wilson", "Yes, and as we said -- as we kind of said on the call, too, I think one of the big questions here is where the U.S. market grow -- where does it go? And what we're seeing in our funnel right now suggests that it's going to be lumpy and a little bit crazy, but funnel still looks very good. And so as the U.S. market remains stable, I think it's a little bit challenging for us. But if the U.S. market declines, then clearly, we'll be -- we'll have an opportunity to reallocate more resources to our growth markets. So I think we've got an important 6 to 9 months here to kind of watch where that U.S. market goes and maybe do some rebalancing as we see where that market goes.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then, Elisha, you mentioned M&A. Can you just talk a little bit about your capital allocation priorities? I mean, as growth rates change over the years a little bit, can you talk about how you're thinking about your capital allocation strategy, the potential to -- I mean you've got a trapped cash problem, so how do you think about repatriating or maybe levering up? Do you consider potential dividend at some point? Can you maybe just talk to some of these dynamics?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Right. So, Tycho, we have -- I mean, we've done fairly limited M&A over the last several years, mostly tuck-in acquisitions. And I think you should expect that we will continue that strategy going forward. But nothing that I would sit here today and say it's going to be transformational. Therefore, the cash that we do generate and virtually every dollar plus some have been allocated to the share repurchase program over the last year. And so we have taken on some short-term debt in the U.S. We ended with our revolver of about $200 million as we completed our Q2 share repurchase. Since that time, the net debt is almost half of that. So collections have been good. We have been getting cash in. So you should expect that we will continue to execute on the share repurchase program. We do talk about dividends extensively. We formally debate it probably every quarter. We talk about it at the board level. For us to do anything meaningful with the amount of cash we have trapped offshore, it just -- it would not make sense, and we would become a serial borrower at significantly higher rates if we were to go down that path. So we have elected to do a share repurchase program and have consistently been in the market quarter in, quarter out, somewhere between 1 million and 2 million shares per quarter.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then, Dow, to back your comment a minute ago on just the U.S. market, can you talk a little bit about any impact you've seen from watchful waiting in terms of impacting, discussions around the installed base? In other words, if hospitals have 5 Linacs are they going to replace 4 of them over time because of the prostate dynamic?", "Dow R. Wilson", "I think for most of our customers, it's anniversary-ed. So I did notice that 21st Century in their quarterly report a couple of weeks ago pointed to prostate volume being down. And we actually pinged the number of our other customers, and they thought that their volumes to a year ago were roughly the same. So I think for most of our customers, that impact is already anniversary-ed. And now people are actually -- a lot of our customers are seeing prostate volumes come back up with 3 treatments and surgical failures. So I think there's -- there might be a few folks out there left, who haven't seen the watchful waiting impact. But I think most of our customer -- that report was published, I want to say, 1 year to 1.5 year ago and kind of found its way into the market. So, yes, it's a little bit of -- there's a little bit of see me now, see me later going on. And maybe we do have some patients delaying and watching what happens to their PSA and other markers, Gleason score and delaying, but eventually they'll come to us. So I'd say, at least at this point, that I have as many customers telling me that they're seeing prostate volume come back as I do saying that they're seeing a watchful waiting loss.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then last quick one. Can you talk on linearity in the quarter? Was March any different than January and February? Or any change post the ASTRO proposal?", "Dow R. Wilson", "No, I don't think so. I think...", "Elisha W. Finney", "The third month is always the biggest just because it's 4 4 5 in terms of how we allocate the fiscal month.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Dow, I wanted to dig in a little bit on your comments on ACOs. As far as we know, there's one oncology ACO in the U.S. that's functioning right now. But I guess a pretty large number, maybe 40% of hospitals, are participating in ACO's not necessarily oncology-specific in some way. So I guess, what I'm getting at, is why now? Why is it that today and not 90 days ago were -- was this a factor? Is there something about these pilot projects that has people thinking this is going to become an issue, a bigger issue and faster? Why now?", "Dow R. Wilson", "Let me just say again that ACOs was 1 of 5 or 6 items in the list and not the main item. So ACO is a factor. I think what we're hearing from our customer base is in a lot of these reimbursement scenarios, what they want to make sure is that they have a service offering that they can take to the payer and give the payer comprehensive cancer services. So I think that's kind of the net impact of this. Whether it's reimbursement, bundled payments, Accountable Care Organization, pay-for-performance, other quality measures, that's the impact that we're seeing in the marketplace as it's causing our customers to really look to each other and what kind of partnerships they should be forming, so that they can go to the payers with a full service capability. I wouldn't want you to leave here today thinking ACOs is the be-all, end-all or the end of the world. It's one in a list of items that our customers are thinking about as they prepare for what frankly is uncertain in most of their minds about where it's going. And I think it's kind of that uncertainty that most people are facing into. They just don't know, and frankly, we don't either.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Got it. And then the comment that you made around capital spending in the U.S., some of that's clearly tied to what's going on in D.C. Why wouldn't there be a case for that to reverse in the capital spending environment in the U.S. actually to get better over the course of the year as...", "Dow R. Wilson", "I think we've got into next fiscal years some uncertainty. I mean, in my own experience, I've got some scars on my back from DRGs in the early '80s and Hillarycare in 1992. And in both of those scenarios, the market stalled for 12 to 18 months and then came roaring back with a vengeance. And I think we're seeing a little bit of that here. People are uncertain in the environment. I don't think it's 1983 or 1992, but there's a lot of uncertainty out there. The good news is, there's a fleet of equipment in the U.S. that's old and ready for replacements. And there's a new clinical application, new clinical applications, plural, that are a real reason to trade up. So I think people are going through an uncertain time and that -- the midterm and long term look very, very good. I think we can talk about, is that a 6-month impact or a 12-month impact, and I don't really know, but I think it is keeping our eye on the horizon. We think it's optimistic.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And then just one housekeeping item. On TrueBeam, I'm sorry, if I missed it, but what was the number of TrueBeam orders in the quarter?", "Elisha W. Finney", "I don't think we've...", "Dow R. Wilson", "I think I mentioned that we shipped out 500. We -- in keeping with our practice, we stopped reporting the number of TrueBeams since it's an established product.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jason Wittes with Brean Capital.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Dow, I think you gave a pretty succinct answer in terms of why TrueBeam is a more successful product than Versa is probably going to be. But I can imagine there's still going to be some sort of account taking a look at those systems and therefore some delays. Is that accounted for in your thinking for the rest of the year, especially in North America?", "Dow R. Wilson", "I think we've seen very little of that. I'm -- it's their fourth quarter, and they're out pushing the business hard and -- so this is -- in our fiscal second quarter, there's a lot of activity going on because it's their fourth quarter. And at least feedback from our team is Versa is not causing any delays. It's the other things that we've been talking about.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then Proton is actually...", "Dow R. Wilson", "And let me just say one other item on that, and that is Versa isn't new news. We've been competing with this thing for -- yes, they formally introduced it at ASTRO or whenever it was, but this thing has been out there in the marketplace for, in one way or another, for some time. So at least from my kind of a market point of view, this is kind of old news.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Okay, very fair point. Also just want to switch gears. Proton's actually going to be somewhat contributive to the bottom line this quarter. Elisha, I think you said you're going to assume there's going to be about a 10% to 20% margin on that business or gross margin in the business?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Gross margin. But it is not contributing to the bottom line. It is still dilutive and will be for the remainder of this year and next year most likely. So just want to be real clear, it's just contributing growth profit dollars that are more than the 0 on the Scripps scale.", "Dow R. Wilson", "It's just a contribution margin level not at the bottom line level.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yes.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Understood. And could you quantitate what is the impact to EPS is on -- from Proton? Because traditionally it's been about a 10% to 15% hit per year. Is that still the case in 2013?", "Elisha W. Finney", "It's about -- I think we said about $0.15, and that is still the case.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "And then just -- the other thing about Proton. I mean, it's starting to -- obviously, you're starting to book revenues and even some modest profits here, although again not enough to offset the dilution. But last year you seemed like you were on a pretty good clip announcing quite a few contract wins. This year, I have -- other than the Maryland ones, which I think has been in your pipeline but not fully funded yet, I haven't really heard that much. What's the outlook for Proton this year in terms of potential orders, and what's sort of the pipeline look like in terms of potential orders?", "Dow R. Wilson", "As I mentioned on the call, we are aiming for a couple of orders. The pipeline looks pretty good. We think by end of the year, we should have a couple of orders in the order book. Maryland will be one of those, and then one other one. There's a number of prospects in that funnel. It's always about financing and -- as we have a pretty good idea who those prospects are. In some cases, we're kind of selected as vendor of choice. I think I mentioned we're headed off to Emory for the groundbreaking actually, where we've been selected as vendor of choice. But we will not book that order until their financing is complete. And that one is probably not a this-year scenario. It's probably next year.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then last Proton question. Some of your competitors, they don't have them operating yet, but they have been selling single-room centers. It seems like the marketplace has a fair level -- a higher level demand for the single rooms versus the large sort of $200 million centers. Is Varian working on a single room center? Or can we expect any kind of announcement on that in the near term?", "Dow R. Wilson", "We do have a single room product today. It's a little more expensive, but it works. And we also -- with the Cyclotron we have, the most economic position for folks to be in is in a multiple gantry facility. Now obviously, they have to have the patient volume for that, and it gets a little more expensive, but we have a nice economic price point for 2-room, 2-gantry center and I think are pretty well positioned in this marketplace. Frankly, I think right now in Proton, the game is all about credibility. We haven't done a patient yet. We're going to do our first patients late this summer, August, September timeframe. Other competitors in the marketplace have sold a lot of PowerPoint and are waiting to do their first patients as well. So I think the market is very much waiting to kind of see what happens. Do these systems come up? Do they deliver dose [ph] and get good curative intent and get cured for patients? And there's a lot of folks out there just kind of watching. And I think that's probably the biggest factor right now.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Toby Wann with Obsidian Research.", "Toby Wann - Obsidian Research Group, LLC", "Yes, mine have been answered.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, I'd now like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments.", "Spencer R.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Spencer Sias, Vice President, Investor Relations for Varian Medical Systems. Thank you. Mr. Sias, you may begin.", "Spencer R. Sias", "Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Varian Medical Systems conference call for the third quarter of fiscal 2013. With me are Dow Wilson, President and CEO; Elisha Finney, CFO; and Clarence Verhoef, our Corporate Controller. Dow and Elisha will summarize our results and will take your questions following the presentation. To simplify our discussion, unless otherwise stated, all references to the quarter or year are fiscal quarter and fiscal years. Quarterly comparisons are for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 versus the third quarter of fiscal 2012.", "Please be advised that this presentation and discussion contains forward-looking statements.

We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this presentation and discussion because of new information, future events or otherwise.", "Before turning it over to Dow, let me remind you that Varian will be hosting its annual investor meeting at ASTRO in Atlanta on Tuesday morning, September 24, and we'll be posting details on the website. Please mark your calendars, and we hope to see you there.", "And now here's Dow.", "Dow R. Wilson", "Good afternoon and welcome. We're reporting third quarter results with several positives, as well as some challenges that impacted our performance.", "Net earnings per share grew ahead of expectations for the quarter. Revenues for the company grew, but we're short of our objectives for the period principally because of a sharp decline in the yen and unexpected weakness in our X-ray tube business.", "To summarize our results, our net earnings per diluted share increased 7% to $1.03. Revenues were $726 million, up 3% on a reported basis and 4% on a constant-currency basis. Our backlog grew 4% over the year-ago quarter to $2.75 billion, including 6% in the oncology backlog -- 6% growth in the oncology backlog. Net orders in our Oncology Systems, X-ray Products and Security businesses totaled $725 million, up 5% on a reported basis and up 7% on a constant-currency basis.", "I will cover the operational highlights for the quarter and let Elisha walk you through the details of the P&L and balance sheet.", "In the third quarter, Oncology Systems grew net orders by 4% to $582 million. Net orders outside of North America grew by 8% on a reported basis and 12% in constant currency. Currency had a huge impact in Asia, where oncology net orders decreased by 6% on a reported basis, but increased by 5% on a constant-currency basis. Meanwhile, EMEA grew by 21% in dollars and 22% in constant currency. Net orders in North America fell by 1%. Overall, markets outside North America comprise 57% of oncology's net orders during the quarter. EMEA was the big driver with substantial wins in the U.K., Poland, Turkey and North Africa.", "Our 2 biggest markets in Asia continue to perform very well. Net orders in both China and Japan were up over 20%. In China, I'm pleased to report that we made 2 package deals with Siemens imaging and Varian treatment equipment. In Japan, growth was driven by strong interest in our tubing systems as well as upgrades. The rest of the Asia region was down on tough comps.", "As you probably know, the large tender to equip public cancer centers in Brazil has been delayed further with no auction date currently set. Meanwhile, purchasing continued in Brazil, where we generated solid double-digit net order growth over last year.", "The North American oncology market experienced slower capital spending amid reimbursement and concerns over Health Care Reform. Subsequent to the close of the quarter, CMS announced its initial proposal for 2014 reimbursement rates in the U.S. Generally speaking the proposal increases reimbursement for hospitals, while calling for a reduction for freestanding clinics, which now represent about 5% of our global oncology business. There are some real positives for hospitals in the CMS proposal with recommended increases for newer and more efficient treatment advances. As an example, under the proposal reimbursement for a single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery for both linear accelerators and Cobalt-based systems would rise and continue to be equal. This should help encourage replacement of older technology with newer and more efficient systems.", "As a reminder, the rates for 2014 will not be finalized until November, and we can expect to see a lot of debate and some changes to the current proposals. In any case, we expect long-term pressure on reimbursement rates to place a premium on fast, cost-efficient delivery of both radiosurgery and radiotherapy. This continues to be a Varian strength, because we believe we offer greater performance and value than any of our competitors.", "We believe the need for better and more efficient health care is creating a market trend towards consolidation, integration and standardization across multisite networks. Customers need better cost productivity, higher quality and measurable outcomes. This can lead to larger and more complex deals. As an example, shortly after the close of the quarter, we received a multimillion dollar order from a customer in the southeast of the United States, which is integrating a consolidated 5-site network. They will be equipping the network with 6 new Varian Linacs, including 2 tubing units as well as our full suite of treatment planning and information management software.", "Like a lot of our customers, they used to provide standalone solutions in each of their sites. Now they'll be updating their equipment and transitioning to one common patient database with common standards of care across their entire network. This customer is also purchasing Varian's innovative full-scale program, which will allow us to maintain and update the network's full software and hardware IT infrastructure through a private cloud.", "During the quarter, we booked multiple orders for the new EDGE radiosurgery system, and several other customers ordered EDGE radiosurgery products, accessories and software for their existing treatment machines. Customer interest in this technology is high and the sales funnel for our radiosurgery solutions looks solid. We hope to see this business accelerate further once we receive Shonin and CE Mark to sell EDGE outside of the U.S.", "Our service business remained the growth driver with a 12% rise in net orders. Service comprised 36% of oncology's net orders for the period and year-to-date. This business contributed to healthy margins for our oncology business.", "Turning to X-ray Products. Third quarter net orders grew by 2% to $123 million and revenues grew by 7% to $135 million. In a light volume quarter, this business did an excellent job managing operating expenses. Net orders and revenues were impacted by customers in Japan who began reducing excess tube inventories. We have experienced similar inventory adjustments in the past and business has typically normalized after a couple of quarters.", "Flat panel revenues grew 10% in the quarter as the market continued to adopt digital X-ray solutions. While analog X-ray equipment sales have been soft for the last several years, a continued trend towards the adoption of digital imaging technology enabled Varian to gain share, and we continue to see growth opportunities here. As an example, we saw increased customer interest in our solutions that integrate panels, workstations and image processing software. As well, emerging X-ray systems manufacturers in China and Korea are designing our digital imaging components into their products and setting the stage for further growth.", "Net orders for the Other category were $22 million for the quarter versus $7 million in the year-ago quarter helped by a $12 million order from Smiths for 25 compact accelerators that will be used in their mobile cargo screening systems.", "Third quarter revenues for the Other category were $30 million compared with $32 million in the year-ago quarter. We're excited about new product developments in the Security business that we expect could lead to more growth in this business in 2014.", "On the proton therapy front, work continued on the Scripps installation in San Diego, where the first patient treatment is slated to begin later this calendar year. We did not book any new orders for proton therapy installations during the quarter. The pipeline continues to look good, but the timing of financing for deals is very difficult to predict.", "Now, I'll turn it over to Elisha.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Thanks, Dow, and hello, everyone. Dow has already walked you through how net orders were affected by the sharp decline of the yen. I'll simply add that there was a negligible effect from the euro and other currencies.", "I'll focus now on revenues and the rest of the P&L, as well as the balance sheet and cash flows. Third quarter revenues for the total company increased 3% in dollars and 4% in constant currency. Japan is our second largest national market, and virtually the entire effect of the yen decline was felt in our Oncology business, where we sell in local currency. Our X-ray Products business sells almost exclusively in dollars.", "While we're on the topic of the weakened yen, we estimate that EPS was negatively impacted by about $0.04 in our third quarter and could total about $0.06 for the full fiscal year.", "Going back to revenues, oncology Systems posted a 3% increase during the quarter, with 53% of revenues coming from outside North America. In BRIC countries, oncology revenue growth was a strong 25%. For both the quarter and year-to-date, BRIC revenues represented about 10% of the total oncology business.", "X-ray Products posted a revenue gain of 7% with low double-digit growth in panels and mid-single-digit growth in tubes. X-ray tube revenues were lighter than we expected due to the previously mentioned inventory adjustments among Japanese customers. Revenues from businesses under the Other category decreased by $3 million. We recorded $7 million of proton revenue as percentage of completion accounting continued for our projects at Scripps, Saudi Arabia and Russia.", "While I'm talking about the Proton business, let me update you on our expectations regarding the balance of this fiscal year. As I mentioned in last quarter's call, we estimated annual proton therapy revenues of about $80 million including $40 million of higher-margin revenue from the project in Maryland. Given that our customer there has not yet completed financing for this project, we are removing this from our revenue projections for this fiscal year and estimating that this will reduce net earnings per share by about $0.06 for the year.", "Returning to the P&L walk, the third quarter gross margin for the company was 42.8%. Oncology Systems gross margin was 43.7%, down from the year-ago quarter by 60 basis points but includes the $3 million impact of the medical device excise tax. Year-to-date, even with higher revenue growth outside North America and the impact of the yen, Oncology Systems gross margin is 43.5%.", "X-ray Products gross margin for the quarter was 39.8%, down almost 6 points from the record year-ago quarter. X-rays margins were hurt by a tube warranty issue that we believe has largely been resolved, as well as continued pricing pressure in our flat panel business. Year-to-date, the X-ray Products gross margin is 41.3%.", "Third quarter SG&A expenses were $102 million or 14% of revenues, an improvement of 1 point as a percentage of revenue from the year-ago quarter. Third quarter R&D expenses were $53 million or 7% of revenues, about even as a percentage of revenue with the year-ago quarter. Year-to-date, combined operating expenses have been running at about 22% of revenue.", "Moving down the income statement. Third quarter operating earnings totaled $155 million, up 1% from the year-ago quarter in dollars and down 0.5 point to 21.3% of revenues. Year-to-date, the operating margin was 20.6% almost even with the year-ago period, a big win considering the impact of the restructuring charges in Q1 and Q2, the excise tax and the yen decline.", "Depreciation and amortization totaled $15 million for the quarter. The effective tax rate was 27.6% for the quarter, and for the full fiscal year, we estimate that the tax rate will approach 29%. Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased by 3 million shares from the year-ago quarter to 109.8 million due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Including an estimated $0.04 impact from the weakening of the yen and a $0.02 impact from the excise tax, diluted EPS rose 7% to $1.03.", "Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $766 million, debt of $174 million, and stockholders' equity of $1.7 billion. DSO at 84 was up 4 days from the year-ago quarter, but down 3 days from the previous quarter as collections were strong. Third quarter cash flow from operations was a record $198 million, significantly higher than net income due to working capital improvements stemming from accounts receivable and advanced payments. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was $300 million.", "Primary use of cash during the quarter, was $95 million for stock repurchases. At the end of the quarter, we had 4 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2013.", "Before turning it back to Dow, I want to let you know that Varian's board has approved negotiations to secure a $500 million 5-year term loan, which we expect to execute in our fiscal fourth quarter. This loan will be in addition to a $300 million revolving credit facility. The proceeds will be used to pay down our existing credit facility, to fund ongoing share repurchases, and for general corporate purposes.", "Now I'll turn it back to Dow for the outlook.", "Dow R. Wilson", "Thanks, Elisha. We remain confident in the strength of our core businesses. However, the sharp decline in the yen as well as uncertain timing of revenues from a proton therapy project in Maryland that has not completed its financing are leading us to adjust our expectations for the balance of the year. We now believe that for fiscal year 2013, total company revenues could increase by about 5% over the fiscal year 2012 total. Net earnings per diluted share for fiscal year 2013 could be in the range of $4 to $4.04.", "We're now ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Amit Hazan of SunTrust bank.", "Amit Hazan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to ask the first question on stereotactic reimbursement. I think there's still a lot of confusion out there kind of maybe disbelief out there, so I want to ask you to clarify the point. And as I look at what CMS did, it seems to me that they essentially consolidated cobalt, robotic and Linac into a new set of codes. And in doing so, if we think about where these codes were last year, so not including the fiscal cliff deal, cobalt and robotic got something like a low-single digit increase, but Linac-based stereotactic, which was significantly lower previously, is now lumped into the same cobalt, robotic category and will get something like 50% to 100% increase because of the lumping in. Is that essentially correct? And if so, how much more comfortable does it make you as you think about the next year in the North American market?", "Dow R. Wilson", "That is correct, Amit. And I guess, from the top I should say that this is a proposal, and there will be debate and dialogue on these proposals in Washington until they're finalized in November and implemented January 1. If they do stand, yes, you're absolutely right. That would be a fairly big increase for Linac-based SRS. So if it remains, I think it's very good news, and we're hopeful that it also may help encourage a replacement of older technology that these kinds of treatment applications are difficult to do on and drive an upgrade cycle. And of course, it also -- it's consistent with what happened in law earlier this year, and that is a premium between -- premium for cobalt systems goes away and it equalizes Linac versus cobalt-based reimbursement. And that is of course, what the law was requiring earlier this year.", "Amit Hazan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then I just want to ask -- I know you're not giving fiscal '14 guidance yet, but maybe just a general modeling question as we think about how to think about that year. If oncology backlog is up mid-single digits, which seems to be up about 7% right now, and obviously, it does not include much service, which is obviously growing even faster, is it fair to assume that, that's going to be kind of the leading indicator for how to think about growth next year? It's based on those metrics and also maybe a little bit of the proton now moving to '14 as well?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yes. I mean, I think it's fair, Amit, that you obviously consider the backlog because the time in backlog on average is about anywhere from 12 to 18 months. But I think if you use 12 months as a general rule, that's great. Of course, currency can impact that pretty significantly. But if you have the backlog, it's 6% for oncology and then services growing faster than that. I believe our X-ray Products business over the long term will return to double-digit growth. We're seeing a temporary inventory adjustment in our tube business, but we feel very confident about that business over the long term. And then same -- and same with SIP, and then of course the wildcard is proton therapy. We feel confident about that business going forward over the long term. It's just the timing of revenues can be very, very difficult to predict given percentage of completion and financing.", "Amit Hazan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then just one last question on gross margin. Obviously, the oncology gross margin was very good considering the geographic mix. And I'm just wondering, as we think about that over the next 12 to 18 months, I know the international orders have been growing faster, so in terms of the mix within that international, is that something that you're concerned about at all, or relatively speaking, should we be thinking about a similar gross margin profile for the oncology business going forward?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yes, but as we've said once we hit the reset last year, we believe -- I mean the goal is that oncology can maintain their gross margin in the 43% to 44% level as service and software grow fast, and as we have this continued shift to emerging markets. I mean, to have 25% growth in BRIC in the quarter and to turn in their gross margin was really, really good performance. If you look at for the full fiscal year, again, we think the margin is going to be about even with the year-ago period despite $8 million of excise tax, the impacts of the yen. So they have done a really good job at reducing variable cost and being able to maintain the gross margin even as we become more of a global company.", "Dow R. Wilson", "Yes. And I think when you kind of step back and look at the overall initiatives of the company, 2 of our big 5 are exactly what we're talking about. Globalization and expanding in emerging markets is a big deal for us. We're putting up good growth in those markets. We want to keep feeding that and growing that. And then of course, as a piece of that, is we want to work on the margin rate, and our oncology business has got very good traction at driving some variable cost productivity and getting cost, but frankly, all of our product down. I think, probably about a year ago, we talked a little bit about our TrueBeam product cost and some of the initiatives that we had there. We've got good traction on TrueBeam, and we're translating those initiatives across our product lines. So we're hoping to offset some of that margin difference between our emerging market business and the U.S. business by increased focus on productivity. And then as well across the business in the X-ray business, we saw some margin pressure this quarter, and overall, they're looking at viable cost productivity as well as base-cost productivity and have done a very good job at managing cost.", "Operator", "The next question is from Amit Bhalla of Citibank.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Question just on oncology in the quarter. Can you just help me reconcile the revenue performance? Was it all yen related, or was there any delays in acceptance of systems in the oncology business that led to the miss in revenue?", "Elisha W. Finney", "No, it was -- the lion's share of it was just yen. The entire effect of the yen was felt in our oncology business. If you look back at Q3 revenue guidance versus where we came in, roughly -- if I take the midpoint, about a $25 million short, of which the yen was $10 million, our X-Ray and SIP business combined was $10 million, and the rest of it's just a rounding error in oncology.", "Dow R. Wilson", "Yes, and I think we said it in the script, but it's probably worth emphasizing. Our X-ray business prices all of its product to Japan in dollars, so we don't see the yen currency impact in our X-ray business.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then, secondly, on the order book, as you move into the fiscal fourth quarter now that reimbursement is proposed, and that's not lingering right now, how do you think about fiscal fourth quarter for oncology orders?", "Dow R. Wilson", "We're going to go after every one of them. I mean, I think -- what are we seeing? When you kind of stand back and look at it, the reimbursement is good news. Obviously, it is a proposal. It's not final, so there's a fair amount of uncertainty about that. The freestanding market has been very, very quiet for a long time. Our view is that impact is more less anniversary-ed in the business now, but we are having more and more discussions with customers on SRS and SBRT. Whether those -- that reimbursement rate sticks remains to be seen, but it's still good news in whatever form it comes back. It's good news for Linac-based SRS and SBRT. And I'd say that we're having a lot of conversations with customers around new technology. And that's a positive thing. And I think the thing to remember is this is application based. People are excited about the developments that are happening in lung cancer and in some of these new areas. And the evidence, the clinical evidence is growing, and that's a very positive thing for our industry.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Elisha, can I just clarify one point? You just talked about -- you just talked about backlog in oncology is up 6% as a leading indicator, but how do you reconcile that with oncology orders looking to be down about 1% for the year? How is that not part of the leading indicator?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yes, well, I mean, because the revenue was coming a little lighter than expected as well, given some of the currency issues. So I mean backlog is a cumulative number, so this is looking at cumulative orders minus cumulative revenues, different baselines. And now, it remains to be seen how we end Q4 with the backlog, but as we sit here today looking 12 months out, I think that 6% is a fairly good indicator of systems sales for oncology.", "Operator", "The next question is from Jeremy Feffer of Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "First, I just want to come back to sort of bigger picture on the U.S. hospital situation. I mean obviously, we've seen the same trends pretty much all 3 quarters now. What -- I guess, in very broad terms, what do you see as the inflection point? I guess now we have a little more clarity on reimbursement. We'll be heading into a new budgeting cycle for a lot of hospitals certainly this quarter or next. Where do you see the inflection point? And how do you see this thing turning around?", "Dow R. Wilson", "Here's kind of my view of it, Jeremy. I think the long-term trends are all very, very good. There's a lot of old equipment out there. There's new applications going on. I think in the long term, even in the U.S. we're in very good shape. We've seen some independent studies done that suggest that SRS and SBRT are driving a long-term buying cycle and people are lining up budgets on a long-term basis to invest in new technology. So we're encouraged about that. In the short term, there's a lot of consolidation going on. People are -- like the example I cited in the call, people are looking at more integration in their networks. I think there's still some uncertainty over what long-term health care reform means, and how that's going to impact our industry in the short term. The freestanding market is very, very quiet. I don't see that changing in the short term. Maybe as the reimbursement decisions finalize, maybe we'll see some change there. But anyway to kind of go around the horn, I think North America is going to be very much the kind of market that we've seen for this past year. We might be seeing a little slight thawing of not a great market. We've seen pretty good strength out of Europe, and we had a very good quarter this past quarter in the U.K. That's going to be hard to repeat, but we have seen continued strength in the Middle East, in Northern Africa and in Eastern Europe. So that's positive. Asia, we had a very good quarter in both Japan and China. We had a very tough comp in kind of the rest of Asia but -- and then of course, you heard about the yen issue. But I think the Asia business is going to continue very strong for us. Emerging markets for us are up double digit, and we think we can continue to drive that. So I think that the overall for oncology, when you net that all out with a good service business, it's probably a mid-single-digit grower. With the X-ray business growing long-term double digits, some upside in protons. Obviously, we've got this emerging market growth, and then maybe some risk around currency. We think it's a mid- to high-single-digit target scenario that we're looking on for total company.", "Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Okay and then just following up quickly on the hospital side. Comment a little bit, if you can, on the pricing environment, because you talked about facility consolidation, obviously, delays in purchasing decisions. You have a new competitor or a competitor with a new product out there. How does the pricing environment look from where you sit right here?", "Dow R. Wilson", "Pricing is holding. We're comfortable with the price levels. And as Elisha said, we've managed, from a margin point of view, our gross margins are holding, excluding the excise tax. And we're comfortable where the price levels are.", "Operator", "The next question is from Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Dow, in your commentary, I didn't catch it, but I wonder if you have one, an estimate of what in the proposed rule the hospital reimbursement basket might be up. Did you guys put a figure to that?", "Dow R. Wilson", "I mean it depends on everybody's mix, so we've been encouraging customers to kind of take their own mix through the model. The bottom line is SRS and IMRT are up and could even be at a double-digit kind of rate. And then there's other puts and takes. What we like about the proposal is it encourages more conformal, advanced treatments, and that's the deal. There's very substantial evidence on the advantages of IMRT, and especially in prostate and head and neck, and this supports those advantages. And we think in the market that we're looking at, if these hold, it will really help us on a replacement cycle basis.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And so I guess, as you take a step back and you think about the packaging initiative that CMS has spoken to, I got the sense from reading that they were looking for budget neutrality across the program. Is this a signal that they want to treat radiation oncology differently relative to the overall basket? And if so, is that a function of the clinical arguments you're making, or is there some other driver?", "Dow R. Wilson", "I'm reluctant to speak for them. I think at a very high level across all the baskets, I think that's what they were trying to accomplish. I think as I said, we like very much the proposal as it relates to the support for new technology and treatment applications that are demonstrated with clinical effectiveness, and that's the world that we're going into. So on that basis, I think it's consistent with the other kinds of things we've heard from CMS about comparative effectiveness and actually support some of the initiatives that they're trying to drive.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "That's very helpful. Then just a couple on housekeeping. I mean one in software, last quarter it sounded like the growth there was, I don't know how to be too precise, but maybe mid-single digits. Was it similar in this quarter? Any better or worse?", "Dow R. Wilson", "It's pretty close. We are the clear leader in treatment planning. So in treatment planning from a share point of view, doing very, very well. In oncology information systems, it's neck-and-neck with us and Mosaic. We're confident this market will keep growing. There's been some noise around the ARRA-HITECH incentive, and, yes, customers have been taking advantage of that. But there's a couple opportunities that we see in the future. One, there's going to be other ARRA-HITECH levels that people have to qualify for. Second, all of this conversation around comparative effectiveness is driving an informatics discussion. And then third, we have a huge opportunity outside of the U.S. where frankly, oncology information systems have been diffused at a lower rate than the U.S. So we think we still have opportunity in the software business to grow this at double-digit rate.", "Operator", "The next question is from David Roman of Goldman Sachs.", "David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I know that there have been a few attempts to kind of get at an FY '14 number, but I wanted just to try...", "Dow R. Wilson", "Want to try one more time?", "David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I got to try at least one other way and I certainly can appreciate the comment down the longer-term growth in the mid-to high-single digits and you can certainly see that materializing through a combination of more favorable geographic mix, as well as the continued growth in X-ray Products and development in Security and Inspection. But it is sort of a, I guess, a 2-part question, but if I just look at year-to-date orders and backlog, it seems like growth over the immediate term sounds -- is more like a mid-single-digit type number. And then if you're -- if sort of the revenue growth rate were sort of in the 4% to 6% range, what would that sort of portend for the earnings outlook? I mean, can you grow double-digit earnings below 6% top line? And where are the flex -- what are the levers there that could get you through the P&L?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yes, so David, let me take a stab at this without giving you guidance into FY '14. I don't see any material changes in the tax rate. It may vary a point up, a point down depending on a geographic mix of products. But you're not going to see a drastic change in the tax rate. What you will see is that the diluted shares outstanding should continue to go down. We announced the $500 million debt facility that we are about to negotiate, we have some commitments for. We plan to pay down the revolver and use the balance to continue with our ongoing share repurchase program, which is somewhere between 1 to 2 million shares per quarter is what we've been averaging. So you should expect that, that will continue and so we will get some leverage on the P&L through our -- through returning capital to shareholders.", "David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then on the gross margin side, X-ray, obviously, took a big step down this quarter. You did cite a onetime dynamic in your prepared remarks, but you also talked about underlying pricing pressure. I know that the margins there had sort of spiked up pretty significantly. What sort of -- is the trend -- can you keep X-ray margins kind of flattish from the year-to-date level? Or are those going to have a downward bias to them?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Well, that's our goal. They have a lot of cost controls and they've had a lot of quality improvements in the X-ray business. We were at a record level in the year-ago period. It was unsustainable at 45%. I think the low 40s is something that we can expect to continue as we go into FY '14 in this business. It is a volume business. So as sales start to pick up, you do see that fall through their gross margin quite nicely. And that's both true in tubes and panels. So while we do have some pricing pressure in panels, it is still a higher-margin product line than the tube. So if it grows faster than the tubes as we expect, it should also help the gross margin balance overall. So I'm pretty confident that in the low 40s, we should be able to maintain that.", "David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then just to make sure I understand the crosswalk between the prior earnings guidance and the revised earnings guidance, I think you cited $0.04 from -- before I think, $0.06 from the Maryland order and then -- or a couple of pennies from currency. Is that the entirety of the delta from your prior expectations?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Well, so there for the full year, we believe the impact of the yen is about $0.06 versus the prior guidance that we gave, and that would be in Q3 and Q4. And that the Maryland project is also $0.06, so a total of a $0.12 impact from those 2 items. You'll see that we've taken the midpoint, the low, the high and the midpoint of the guidance down by $0.10. So what we're saying is if it weren't for these 2 things, we think we would be at the top end of our prior guidance or slightly ahead. The temporary issues that we're facing in X-ray, we think we've covered through pretty significant cost controls and -- as a total company. And you saw SG&A came down as a percentage of sales in the quarter, should tick back up to about even year-over-year. So we -- if the only thing we were dealing with, were the X-ray temporary problems, we would have that more than covered, but these 2 other things are pretty significant.", "David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then last one, just for Dow, on the deal you signed in the Southeast, can you maybe just talk about how you think that type of selling strategy or that type of market dynamic plays out over time? And it sounds as if -- first, I think that you've highlighted a specific deal of that nature on the call. Maybe -- are we very early in that transition? Maybe -- how does that -- does that change market dynamics? And how should we think about the opportunity there?", "Dow R. Wilson", "I think it's a continuing trend, David. We have been talking a little bit about consolidation and integration. Those would be the 2 trends. Consolidation on the customer side, for those of you in New York City, Mount Sinai and Continuum of -- got their merger approved this week. That's more on the hospital side, but even then they have a network. And as they bring their networks together, they will be interested in sharing information across their networks to drive informatics and comparative effectiveness. This particular customer in the southeast was a combination of hospital and outpatient settings. And I think, on the one hand, it makes the negotiation tougher because they kind of lengthen out. We don't love that part of it. But on the IT side, it actually gives us a very good opportunity, and we like that aspect of it a lot because people are really looking at how do they integrate their systems so they can get better productivity and efficiency in their departments. And we are the productivity, versatility and efficiency leaders in the industry and so that aspect of it, I think, actually is very favorable to us. It does make negotiations a little longer and more complex, but I think at the end of it, it's very good for us. I think in the software space, you heard me briefly mention this new product we call FullScale, which is kind of a private cloud for our customers. It variablizes [ph] their hardware investment and we kind of manage the department for them in the IT space. It's not a perfect kind of SaaS, software-as-a-service, model but pretty close and our customers are responding very well to that, and I think we'll see a lot of that as we see this kind of consolidation and integration trend come together.", "Operator", "The next question is from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "First question on the proton. Was this purely a financing issue or were there other factors there? And maybe can you just address kind of the need for more clinical data around proton and how you think about your role in maybe facilitating studies and trials?", "Dow R. Wilson", "Sure. I mean, it is purely a financing issue. There's nothing else at play there and just kind of stuck on timing of pulling that financing together. The -- in terms of our role long term, we think there are some indications where proton is very well indicated and a lot of the conversation in these centers is around those indications. It's clear that as we move to a comparative effectiveness world, playing a big role in -- bigger role and a big role in clinical studies that demonstrate that effectiveness better. Whether it's proton, SBRT, SRS, IMRT, image guidance, Calypso beacons or otherwise, we're going to have to demonstrate that clinical effectiveness better than we have in the past and it will be a growing investment area for us.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Can you talk a little bit about EDGE, what the order book looks like and just in terms of mix of customers? Are these competitive swap-outs? Are they neurosurgeons versus rad oncs? And talk about timing on CE. I think you'd said by year end. Is that still on track?", "Dow R. Wilson", "Yes. I think we're -- again, as I said in the call, right now it's pretty much a U.S. market discussion. We do not have the CE Mark yet and we do not have Shonin in Japan, so we're still working on those. But in the U.S., we're seeing very good uptake. We have seen some CyberKnife replacements so we're thrilled about that. We are seeing growth over our historical BrainLAB business and pretty substantial growth over our -- over last year's offerings. So we're up there. And we're also seeing very good traction in the upgrade market as people upgrade. So it's -- it is the most efficient and cost-effective SRS tool on the market. With the new reimbursement, maybe we'll see expanded growth there next year, depending on how that's finalized. And we are seeing also -- we're having a number of conversations with thoracic surgeons as they figure out what this means for lung cancers. So we're -- I mean, we're still kind of in the market development. We have seen some good traction and it's growing based on historical business and pretty substantially. And in the U.S., we're kind of right where we thought we'd be, if not a little bit ahead, and we'd like to get the global traction going and are working on the regulatory approvals for that.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Then you called out China in the comments. Can you talk about the size of your installed base now in mix? How much of this is TrueBeam? And obviously, you've got UNIQUE approved there now, too. Is that starting to get some traction?", "Dow R. Wilson", "We're growing very well in China. We had another double-digit quarter in China, so we're pleased with the growth there. We've got a new leadership team in China that we're very encouraged about. So we're expanding distribution. And I think we're going to keep growing. We do have approval for UNIQUE and TrueBeam in China. We -- the prospects are good and we see continued growth in that market. The installed base, it's off the top of my head, our installed base, 300-ish units. If I'm really wrong, I'll send out a note, but the -- it's about 300-ish units and most of these are in new vaults. So it's all installed base growth and we're starting to see some service growth in that business as these units come out of warranty. The TrueBeam penetration in that market is still fairly small, so there is a high end of that market. So I'd say we're selling a couple every quarter or so TrueBeams in that market, and we're seeing nice traction. We do think there's a few more regulatory hurdles for us to address with TrueBeam and some of its new products like EDGE. And as we get that regulatory approval, we'll even see further expansion of that brand in China.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And 1 or 2 quick ones for Elisha. With SG&A down, were there additional cost cuts? Or can you just maybe talk to the SG&A being down here?", "Elisha W. Finney", "I'm sorry, I'm having a little bit of a hard time hearing you, Tycho. You're talking about the variability in the SG&A, yes.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Yes, the fact that it was down.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yes, we did a lot of variability. If I'm going to take a guess, that we're roughly 60% fixed, 40% variable costs. And depending on hiring, trade shows, travel, legal, you name it, FX, you can get some pretty big shifts. I think what happened is, as you know, we had a restructuring charge in Q1 and Q2. We had 80-some-odd people and we didn't hire all of those replacements on day 1. It was kind of a slow build as we went through the quarter. So I think you're going to see it go up in Q4. We have our largest trade show in Q4 this year and it's always just bigger because with commissions and whatnot. So I think for the year, it will be maybe a little bit of leverage but pretty close to what we had in the last fiscal year as a percentage of revenue.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then with the term loan, it sounds like -- you did mention potentially additional share repurchases. Any thoughts on whether you would do an ASR? And you did mention dividends, but I assume that, that's something that's...", "Elisha W. Finney", "Well, I said we were going to use it to do our typical share repurchase program, which is that 1 to 2 million shares per quarter. We have been using virtually all the cash that we generate in the U.S. on our share repurchase plus drawing down under our revolver. This gives us the ability to pay down the revolver, use those proceeds going forward and keep our $300 million revolving line of credit as it should be, kind of as an insurance policy. We have done ASRs in the past. It's kind of the best of all worlds. You can mirror a traditional buyback over some period of time. You get a discount to the weighted average purchase price. We reduce shares up front. And in the very low borrowing environment we're in today, it really kind of makes sense to pay that in advance. So to be determined, we have not decided anything along those lines so this is not an announcement by any means. We should finish our negotiations and have the debt in place by the end of Q4 and we'll know more after that.", "Operator", "The next question is from Jason Wittes of Brean Capital.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Dow, I want to revisit -- you got a lot of questions on reimbursement, but one thing that you did say which piqued my interest is that if the codes stay as they are, especially at the hospital level, or specifically at the hospital level, we could actually see a resurgence or replacements of -- as people move towards SRS. Is that kind of your feeling? And is that something that we should be looking for in November when the rates finally do get finalized?", "Dow R. Wilson", "We're all going to be looking hard at the rates as they close out. If they remain as proposed, it looks like a double-digit increase for SRS and SBRT, at least Linac based, and that would be positive news for our customers. So these things always take a while to kind of work their way into budgets. Most of our customers are on a 1-year budget cycle and how this impacts them and what timing they push given the the broader capital health care environment is kind of the question. I think, from our point of view, if these remain, that will be a positive thing for our customers in replacing -- especially some of this older technology that you can do SRS or SBRT on, but it's very slow and very inefficient and you can do it much better with modern technology.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "When you say modern, you're just talking about TrueBeam or...", "Dow R. Wilson", "TrueBeam and EDGE, yes.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "And EDGE. So that would be -- mean -- basically, I would assume something like 80% of the installed base would look to potentially upgrade. Is that a fair estimate?", "Dow R. Wilson", "Maybe even higher.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just to touch on that as well. Your comments last quarter about, basically, a year of sort of 0% growth in the U.S., it doesn't -- it's probably too early to make a call as to whether these reimbursement proposals will make a difference in that. Is that a fair assumption?", "Dow R. Wilson", "As you know, we don't give orders guidance. I mean, just -- we talk markets a little bit. I think the U.S. market, at least in the short term, we don't see changing dramatically from where it's been. We think Asia is going to remain strong. Europe, we're always kind of watching Western Europe to see what it does. We've managed to hold or even do a little bit better. We had a terrific quarter this quarter in Europe. We're a little measured about what that is long term. But we've seen very good growth in Eastern Europe, very good growth in the Middle East, very good growth in Turkey. And so if Western Europe can hold, our map of Europe should be okay. So the U.S. market is -- it's a question mark, and at least at this point in time, in the short term, it's -- our performance so far this year is probably a pretty good indication of where the market is in the short term.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just one quick clarification. For the proton order, which is delayed due to financing, that, I assume, is still a near-term event, something that should happen in next couple of quarters? Or how should we be thinking about that?", "Dow R. Wilson", "Yes. The financing is not complete so we haven't booked the order yet. The construction is in progress, so there's a very nice building in Baltimore underway. They're nearly ready to receive the equipment. It's a fairly large order for us and -- but we're not exactly share when they'll complete financing. So we've obviously got to think through that as we complete our guidance calculation next quarter but with, hopefully, over the course of the quarter, we'll have some new information to give us a little better feeling about where to guide that order.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "But I guess just -- it sounds more like a question of when as opposed to if. Is that fair?", "Dow R. Wilson", "We're hoping.", "Operator", "The next question is from Anthony Petrone of Jefferies Group.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "A question just on the guidance you issued for the full year and how that plays out for the fourth quarter. I think if you go ahead and model out 5% growth for the year, you're calling for about 2.5% growth for the fourth quarter. And so in dollar terms, it's about a $55 million delta relative to consensus where it stands now. And Elisha, you called out a $40 million impact in proton. So I'm just trying to reconcile how the balance shakes out when we look at FX again, specifically. And on -- in U.S. Oncology, is there anything in there in the way of softness for the fourth quarter as well?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Right. So you mentioned it, Anthony, $40 million for Maryland, which will presumably come out of fourth quarter. The temporary issues in X-ray, we're assuming, are going to continue at least partly into the fourth quarter. Based on our history, these things tend to last 1 to 2 quarters. So between X-ray and a little bit in SIP, I'm assuming down $10 million. The yen is probably another impact of maybe $5 million. Most of our Japanese sales occur in Q2 and Q3. We do have a large service business though, so we will see some impact in the fourth quarter. We're thinking about $5 million. So that kind of -- that bridges the delta as to where we are and where we thought we would be for the quarter.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Fair enough, fair enough. And then maybe just another question that relates to margins for next year, Dow, you mentioned last quarter that about 300 TrueBeams would be out of warranty over the next 18 months, so we're 3 months into that. So how many TrueBeams have come out of warranty and are on the higher-priced service contracts? And assuming we do get all 300 out of warranty into next year, what do you think the impact on gross margin could be?", "Dow R. Wilson", "We haven't looked at it recently, but what I can tell you is that we have basically a TrueBeam coming out of warranty per workday over the next year. So that's the math. That business is now $700 million, $750 million-ish and so we see it growing at a continued double-digit rate. And the team's doing a great job chasing the contracts, and our contract capture rate on TrueBeams is very high, 75% to 80%-ish.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "And the premium on TrueBeam service contract is relative to...", "Dow R. Wilson", "It depends how it's configured. But in general terms, it's probably 15% to 20% higher.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Great, great. And this is just a question, actually, on the freestanding clinic. So I'm full well understanding it's only 5% of the business now, but you have OnCure filing for bankruptcy in the quarter, and it seems that Radiation Therapy Services is close to consolidating that company. Is that represent a potential order next year? Or how do you think about the consolidation?", "Dow R. Wilson", "I don't think it'll represent an incremental order for us. I think you'd have to talk to the guys at 21st Century, but I think that they'll -- this is a good acquisition for them and expands their network and gives them an opportunity to think about some of their own -- I think it's another example of some of the consolidation trends that we're seeing out there, and clearly, they're interested in same-store sales and they're interested in incremental stores. And this will give them an opportunity to kind of consolidate their position in some of those markets and look at where they may have duplicative services and can drive efficiency or look at those places where they can try to get a bigger footprint in the market. So I think it's something that, in this particular segment, we've seen for a while so I actually -- OnCure had some specific financial aspects to it, but in terms of the consolidation that's going on in the freestanding market, that's not new news. We've seen a fair amount of that over the last 2 or 3 years.", "Operator", "The next question is from Jeff Johnson of Robert W. Baird.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Dow, most of my questions have been answered. Let me just ask, I guess, 2 follow-ups. One, going back to some of the reimbursement stuff, you've hedged it about every way you can. You just sound a little skeptical to me on whether or not you think some of these big increases, especially maybe on the SRS side, maybe on the IMRT side, are going to stay in place so they don't get rolled back in November. So just wondering kind of your thoughts there.", "Dow R. Wilson", "I'll apologize to our international listeners, but I'm from Missouri and I'm -- in the Show Me State, you got to see it, and this is a proposal. And so yes, we are hedging a little bit. We like what's come out. We think it's good but we'll feel a lot better when it's final. So it's -- there's always a little bit of uncertainty around these. We've seen a move in the past a little bit and we just want to be conservative about how we feel about this and, at least in the short term, as I said at the beginning, we are seeing some SRS, SBRT movement in the market. My own gut is that's as much clinical as it is reimbursement-driven. This is the right thing to do. We got a good approach for lung cancer. There's a growing body of clinical data. We've got some data from some independent sources that say people are looking at purchasing, that -- there's an IMV study out there that people are looking at SRS and SBRT purchases and they're also looking at replacements of IMRT devices. And it's kind of some encouraging news and, frankly, that survey was done before the reimbursement news came out. So kind of put that together with the reimbursement news, there is reason to be optimistic. I think our customers are from Missouri and so they're going to wait and see what happens in the final ruling, and if this sticks, it will be very positive news.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And maybe it's a naive question, but when we get those November final rates and you kind of read-through who was pro; who was con; why they argued different sides of it. Who's going to be arguing against higher rates?", "Dow R. Wilson", "I'm not sure.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I mean, why would it maybe get rolled back significantly? I can see when the lobbying groups go out there and argue against the rate cuts. But when CMS proposes some rate increases, I guess, I just have a harder time figuring out who might be on the opposite side of that.", "Dow R. Wilson", "I mean, there's a number of things at play here. Clearly, one of the aspects with SRS and SBRT is maybe you'll get lower costs by doing fewer fractions. But clearly, the initiative here is on the payer side, who is going to pay for this? And that's Congress, CMS, insurance companies. Those are the folks that are looking at, okay, there are some increases here, how are we going to pay for this in the context of everything that's going on? And as we've said here before and continue to believe, radiation therapy is a terrific approach for cancer care. It's very economic, very low cost, relatively noninvasive on patients and a growing body of outstanding clinical evidence in new cancer sites. So we think there's a reason to support it, but it's going to be, how do you pay for it?", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "All right. Fair enough. And then we have heard some rumblings maybe under a bundled initiative like you're seeing, if hospitals aren't sure who's going to get paid for the daily TQ or whatever you call it, the daily physics that are performed on these machines and all that, that there could be some pushout. Just purely a -- not necessarily on orders, but on order acceptances in the near term, any truth to that? Or how do you feel the revenue side, not the order side, could play out in the near term until we get some finalization there?", "Dow R. Wilson", "I've seen no impact from that and I haven't even heard a whisper from our customers, da nada [ph].", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. Fair enough. And Elisha, just one quick follow-up for you. Just if yen was a $0.04 hit relative to last time you guided $0.04 hit this quarter, $0.02 hit next quarter, at least in my math the yen is going to be an even bigger drag year-over-year next quarter than the third quarter. So why is the incremental impact only $0.02 next quarter versus $0.04 this quarter?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Because most of our sales in Japan occur in Q2 and Q3. They take delivery of their machine around their fiscal year, which is the end of March, and so we get a lot of shipments and installations in that period of time. And then that's where we saw the drastic 20% reduction -- decline in the yen. If we moving into Q4, it's probably closer to $0.02 because, again, it's really just our service business that's going to be impacted as opposed to a lot of equipment sales.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And not that you're guiding '14, but would it be the same kind of 1, 2? It looks like the year-over-year drag is going to be about the same from change a yen. So would the Q1 hold as well?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Until we anniversary, and hopefully, we are back at 80% by Q3 next year. It's just a lot of variability right now. Unfortunately, we saw it with the euro last year. That has now tended to stabilize and it's holding. Hopefully, we will start to see some stability in the yen as well.", "Operator", "The next question is from Charley Jones of Barrington Research.", "Charley R. Jones - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "So I have about 6 questions, but I'll try and keep it to 2 here. The first one is, I guess, a little bit of history, if you wouldn't mind spending it on reimbursement. When I think back about reimbursement, I think about these 40% decreases proposed that always get cut in half or 1/3 and it's been going on for a decade, it seems like. And yet they increased it double digits this year. So I don't know how much you talk to them but I'm a little bit confused in this. I think it's probably the differentiation of SVT and radiation and whatnot, but did they overshoot on the downside and so we are kind of due for some increases in reimbursement? Or what clinical studies have been done that would really validate a double-digit increase?", "Dow R. Wilson", "I think the...", "Charley R. Jones - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "And if you wouldn't mind spending [ph] a little bit of history, has there been any decreases in reimbursement in these line items over the last 5 years?", "Dow R. Wilson", "There's been -- the general decline over the last several years has been, call it, 2% to 5-ish percent and so that's kind of been the history. It's -- I think for SRS and SBRT, there's a -- there's growing clinical evidence. For lung cancer, this could be a cheaper way, as you compare it to alternatives, although we have not been party to any of those studies. So short version is we don't know exactly what CMS' thinking was other than, in a comparative effectiveness world, these are new treatment paradigms that are very effective and lower cost. And when you look at it, especially on a cost per patient basis over time, it's probably very good for them. So we are not party to that conversation. So this is pure Dow conjecture, just for the record, but we do talk to them regularly, but we don't always know. The system isn't overcome with transparency, but I see on these new treatment sites, they're trying to support the new technology, especially where it makes a cost comparative impact, and that's certainly what this new proposal shows.", "Charley R. Jones - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "That's helpful. And then real quick follow-up on that. You guys had some kind of confusing information out there a little bit ago about costs that rolled up into their reimbursement equation for proton. So curious if there's any update there. But my real -- really, my second question was about Elekta. We didn't really talk about it much. They had decent growth. Just curious, are they acting kind of more rationally and recognizing -- just kind of curious how you see your growth relative to theirs and -- on any geographic basis and whether or not it seems like a more reasonable environment is starting here?", "Spencer R. Sias", "So before Dow tackles those 2 questions, we'll just say those are the final 2 questions that we've got. We've overrun the call here. And so Dow, take it away.", "Dow R. Wilson", "Yes, on proton reimbursement, the proposal is up from where it was revised downward to last year but doesn't return all the way to where it was the year before. So it's mixed positive news. In terms of Elekta, I think both Varian and Elekta are winning share from replacing the Siemens share that's gone out of the market, as well as Accuray and TomoTherapy. We continue to see them be aggressive and that's probably what I could say at this point in time.", "Spencer R. Sias", "So thank you all for participating.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Spencer Sias, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Sias, you may now begin.", "Spencer R. Sias", "Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Varian Medical Systems conference call for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. With me are Dow Wilson, President and CEO; Elisha Finney, CFO; and Clarence Verhoef, our Corporate Controller. Dow and Elisha will summarize our results, and we'll take your questions following the presentation. To simplify our discussion, unless otherwise stated, all references to the quarter or year or fiscal quarters and fiscal years.

We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this presentation and discussion because of new information, future events or otherwise.", "Before turning it over to Dow, we are advising those who participate in the Q&A following these prepared remarks to limit yourselves to one question and a follow-up. This should give all participants a chance to ask their question during the call. We thank you for helping with this. As a reminder, please mark your calendars that Varian will be hosting its annual year-end meeting for investors at the Marriott Marquis in New York at 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. on November 5. Details are posted on our Investor Relations site. We hope to see you there. And now here's Dow.", "Dow R. Wilson", "Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone. We're reporting mixed, but promising results for the fourth quarter of 2013. Revenue and earnings fell short of our targets for the quarter, primarily because of slow short cycle sales of oncology systems upgrades. Our backlog grew 1% despite a $156-million adjustment that I'll cover in a moment, and we generated order growth in all oncology markets outside of North America during the quarter with the help of a strong performance in our service business.", "We had a record performance in our X-ray Products business, and we reached an important milestone in our Proton Therapy business.", "To summarize our financial results, which Elisha will detail in a few moments, our net earnings were $1.08 per diluted share for the fourth quarter, equal to the year-ago quarter, and $3.98 per diluted share for fiscal year 2013, up 6% from the prior year. Revenues for the quarter were $770 million, up 2% on a reported basis and 3% on a constant currency basis. Company revenues for the fiscal year were $2.9 billion, up 5% on a reported basis and 6% on a constant currency basis.", "As we reported in our press release, we reduced our quarter ending backlog by $156 million. This was the result of ongoing uncertainty in the U.S. health care environment, as well as a higher level of cancellations in the quarter, primarily relating to orders from small freestanding clinic developers whose projects did not move forward. This prompted us to reevaluate similar transactions. We determined that some orders were no longer firm and consequently decided to remove them from our backlog. We ended the year with a $2.9 billion backlog, up 1% from the end of fiscal year 2012.", "Today, less than 5% of our total company backlog is comprised of orders from freestanding clinics. The remaining freestanding customers with orders in the backlog include large long-term partners who have continued to expand their operations. In order to provide additional detail going forward, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013, we are changing our presentation of orders to gross orders. A table showing the gross to net order comparison is provided in our press release.", "I will now focus on the operational highlights of our businesses. Oncology Systems grew gross orders on a global basis versus a strong year-ago comparison despite ongoing weakness in the U.S. health care market. Oncology gross orders grew by 3% to $841 million in the fourth quarter, while net orders, including backlog adjustments, fell by 13% to $685 million. For the year, Oncology gross orders rose by 2% to $2.6 billion, while annual net orders, including our backlog adjustment, fell by 4% to $2.3 billion.", "Compared to the year-ago quarter, gross orders in all markets outside North America grew by 12%, more than offsetting a 6% decline in North America. Orders grew strongly in several international markets, including Brazil, China, Japan, Scandinavia and Latin America. As an indication of our expanding global footprint, the quarter included some $20 million in orders from emerging markets such as Georgia, Kazakhstan, Guatemala and Burkina Faso. China was particularly strong, with fourth quarter gross order growth of 30%, which brought the order growth rate there for the fiscal year to 25%.", "China is clearly investing in radiation oncology for its cancer patients, and we have stepped up our investment to serve them. In August, we held a very successful oncology summit for more than 525 customers in China, and we believe we are building stronger relationships than ever in that community. We've established a strong team in China that is performing well.", "As you may have heard, earlier this week, Brazil's Ministry of Health conducted its reverse auction to equip its public health care centers with 80 linear accelerators. I'm pleased to report that Varian was the successful bidder, and we are now working with the Ministry of Health to finalize the deal. This calls for delivery of our digital Clinac CX accelerators over the next several years for some $55.5 million. We are pleased with the outcome, proud of our team's performance and excited about the prospect of helping Brazil reach its goal of giving more cancer patients access to radiotherapy. This is an expanding market for radiotherapy.", "Turning to the U.S we continue to see growing interest in our new stereotactic radiosurgery products, as well as in our software and service offerings that we believe are setting the stage for long-term growth. This is largely a replacement market. At the moment, the U.S. market is challenged by ongoing uncertainties related to the implementation of health care reform, cumulative cuts and reimbursements for freestanding clinics and consolidation of radiation oncology centers. We believe these factors are causing customers to change business models and to slow purchasing decisions. One impact of this was that our short cycle upgrade business, where orders typically convert to sales within the same quarter, were lighter than we anticipated.", "We continue to believe that market adoption of stereotactic radiosurgery will be a catalyst for replacing aging equipment with new products such as our EDGE systems and upgrade packages, as well as our more advanced software tools. As we've noted in earlier discussions, the proposed reimbursement rates for 2014 support investment in modern treatment systems and radiosurgery capability. We are hopeful that the new rates will be finalized on schedule next month, now that the 2-week government shutdown is behind us.", "Our Oncology Service business grew 12% during the quarter, driven by higher capture rates and more software service agreements. TrueBeam contracts continue to drive global growth in the business. During the quarter, we received the CE Mark for our EDGE radiosurgery system, enabling us to move forward in marketing this product now in most major markets of the world. The first treatment using an EDGE system is slated to take place at Champalimaud Centre in Lisbon. To date, we have received orders for more than 10 EDGE systems, as well as more than 50 EDGE technology upgrade packages.", "We also saw increased traction during the quarter in our Calypso motion management systems for enhancing radiosurgery precision. This underlines the growing interest in stereotactic radiosurgery.", "At last month's ASTRO show, we unveiled RapidPlan, a game-changing software for enhancing the quality standards, speed and cost efficiency of treatment planning. This introduction generated great interest among customers at the show and reinforces our global leadership in radiotherapy treatment planning software. This month, we received 510(k) clearance to begin marketing and selling RapidPlan to the more than 3,000 customers who already have installations or Eclipse Treatment Planning software. This represents a several hundred million dollar opportunity for our Oncology business.", "Innovation and new product development is a key to our strategy, and we increased our R&D investment during the quarter and for the year. We see a lot of growth opportunities for the company and we have stepped up R&D, particularly on global product opportunities and software in Oncology Systems.", "Turning to X-ray Products. Fourth quarter gross orders rose 26% to $183 million, and gross orders for the fiscal year rose 15% to $585 million. Our X-ray Products business generated double-digit order growth for the quarter and the fiscal year in both tubes and flat panels. Our components are being designed to the next-generation imaging equipment from several large manufacturers and we're growing by gaining share in this market.", "The quarter was particularly strong for our flat-panel digital image detectors, which grew orders by more than 30%, thanks to the continued shift away from film-based imaging to the speed, convenience and cost efficiency of filmless imaging. This growth occurred in spite of enhanced pricing pressure in the panel business. We also saw market acceptance for our new mammography panel, which should bolster sales in fiscal year '14.", "We enjoyed double-digit order growth in our Tubes business, thanks to large orders from existing customers and the addition of significant new customers who should help to drive growth going forward. We also gained ground with our patented anode grounded technology. Our imaging workstations and image processing software offerings are beginning to gain traction among some of our bigger customers as well.", "The company's Other category, which is comprised of the Security and Inspection Products business, the Varian Particle Therapy business and the Ginzton Technology Center, recorded gross orders of $18 million in the fourth quarter and $86 million for the full fiscal year 2013, down $130 million from the prior year when the company booked 2 proton orders totaling over $120 million.", "Varian Particle Therapy achieved an important landmark during the quarter with the filing of our 510(k) clearance with the FDA, which is an important step closer to the first patient treatments at the Scripps Proton Therapy center in San Diego. Now I'll turn it over to Elisha.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Thanks, Dow, and hello, everyone. Let me start by talking about the backlog adjustment in the quarter. Historically, we have reported net orders which we have defined as new or gross orders minus customer cancellations, currency adjustments and other orders that we no longer expect to convert to revenue.", "Looking back over the last several years, annual backlog adjustments typically have been between 3% and 5% of total company backlog. Given a larger than typical level of cancellations this quarter, particularly from small freestanding center developers, as well as the ongoing uncertainty in the U.S. health care environment, we reevaluated similar transactions and decided to remove $156 million from our backlog. This brings the total backlog adjustment for the fiscal year to $255 million, about 4% more than in a typical year. In order to provide you with an additional level of detail going forward, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013, we are changing the presentation of orders to gross orders. Net orders will be given for comparison purposes.", "While Dow has already covered orders, I want to briefly talk about the constant currency growth rates for the quarter. In comparing quarter-over-quarter exchange rates, there was a significant negative impact from the weakening of the yen and a small benefit from the strengthening of the euro and other currencies.", "Oncology gross orders for the quarter increased 3% in dollars and were up 5% in constant currency. Oncology's North American gross orders were down 6% in dollars and in constant currency.", "EMEA gross orders increased about 13% in dollars and 10% in constant currency. Asia, where we saw a roughly 25% quarter-over-quarter weakening of the yen, was up 2% in dollars, but up 14% in constant currency. Oncology gross orders in the small rest of world market grew by about 40% in dollars and constant currency.", "Fourth quarter revenues for the total company increased 2% in dollars and 3% in constant currency. For the full fiscal year, total company revenues were up 5% in dollars and up 6% in constant currency. And while we don't capture FX-adjusted revenue by business, virtually the entire effect of the significant yen decline was felt in Oncology Systems, where we sell in local currency. To put this in perspective, for the full fiscal year, the yen negatively impacted Oncology Systems revenues by roughly $30 million. Our X-ray components businesses sell almost exclusively in dollars and therefore were not impacted.", "Oncology Systems posted a 1% decline in revenues during the quarter, with revenue split evenly between North America and the rest of the global markets. While our customers generally took delivery of equipment in backlog as we expected, oncology revenue was $10 million to $15 million lighter than we anticipated due to short-cycle upgrade business that did not materialize in the quarter. For the full year, Oncology revenues were up 3% to $2.3 billion.", "Service performed well, with revenues up 9% in the quarter and up 12% for the year, accounting for 35% of total Oncology revenue.", "X-ray Products posted a fourth quarter revenue gain of 6%, with Tubes up slightly from the year-ago quarter and Panels up in double digits. For the year, X-ray Products revenues increased 11%, with 8% growth in Tubes and 14% growth in Panels. This business achieved a milestone with Flat Panels exceeding more than 50% of the X-ray Products business for the year.", "Revenues from businesses under the Other category increased by $11 million for the quarter and the year due to continued progress in completing our Scripps, Saudi and Russia Proton Therapy projects.", "Total company gross margins for the quarter was 42.7%, about equal with the year-ago quarter. Similarly, for the full year, total company gross margin was 42.5%, also about equal to the year-ago period. Oncology Systems gross margins was 43%, down from the year-ago period by 0.5 points, including a $2-million impact from the excise tax. For the full fiscal year, Oncology Systems gross margin was 43.3%, down about 40 basis points from last fiscal year due to the excise tax.", "We continue to believe that Oncology can sustain margins in the 43% to 44% range.", "X-ray Products gross margin for the quarter was 42.2%, down about 1 point from the year-ago period due to the continued pricing pressure in the Panels business. For the full year, the X-ray Products gross margin was 41.5%, down about 1.5 points from last year, again due to Panel pricing. We continue to believe that this business can sustain gross margins in the low 40% level.", "Fourth quarter SG&A expenses were $111 million, or 14% of revenues, a slight improvement as a percentage of revenues from the year-ago quarter. Fourth quarter R&D expenses were $57 million, or 7% of revenues, up 1 point as a percent of revenues from the year-ago quarter due to stepped up investments and our product pipeline. For the full year, operating expenses were 22% of revenue, up slightly from last year.", "Fourth quarter operating earnings totaled $161 million, or 21% of revenues, down about 1 point, reflecting our increased investment in R&D. For the full fiscal year, the operating margin was 20.7% of revenues, down 0.5 points from the previous year, including the impact of the excise tax.", "Depreciation and amortization totaled $15 million for the quarter and $63 million for the fiscal year. The effective tax rate was 27.5% for the quarter and 28.4% for the year.", "Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased from the year ago quarter to 108.8 million, due largely to our ongoing share repurchase program. And diluted EPS was $1.08 for the fourth quarter and $3.98 for the fiscal year.", "Turning to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we secured a new $500 million 5-year term loan and maintained a $300 million revolving line of credit. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 billion, debt of $506 million and stockholders' equity of $1.7 billion. DSO at 85 was equal to the year-ago quarter and up 1 day from the previous quarter.", "Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $155 million, significantly higher than net income due to working capital improvements. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $455 million. Primary uses of cash were $135 million towards the repurchase of 1.9 million shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 2 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2013.", "Now I'll turn it back over to Dow for the outlook.", "Dow R. Wilson", "Thanks, Elisha. We remain confident and committed to executing on our strategic initiatives, global growth, innovation, software and service, commercializing in protons and operational excellence. Our product line and global presence has never been stronger. The company is driving for continued growth in all of our businesses during fiscal year 2014.", "For the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, we expect revenues to grow by 6% to 7% and earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $0.87 to $0.91 per share. For fiscal year 2014, we expect revenues to grow in the range of 6% to 8% and earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $4.22 to $4.34.", "We're now ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Amit Bhalla from Citigroup.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I wanted to start with fiscal '14 guidance for a second. Can you just walk us through what the underlying assumptions are for revenue and what you're including in on proton? And walk us also through the leverage. There's not as much leverage from the 6% to 8% revenue to the earnings number you've outlined, so can you just explain the earnings and revenue on guidance?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Sure. Let me just kind of give you the walk on fiscal year '14. So sales should be up for total company between 6% and 8%. Remember, the yen is significantly weaker now than in the year-ago first half, about 20% to 25%. The euro is a little stronger, but it doesn't completely offset the yen. In that number, our core businesses, if I look at Oncology and the X-ray Products group, it's going to increase somewhere between the 5% and 6% range on a combined basis. So we are expecting some significant pickup in proton revenue in the year. Amit, it's difficult, just given the timing of these deals, but I'm anticipating anywhere from $100 million to $150 million. So I just picked the midpoint at $125 million, and it's going to be -- that's going to be somewhere around a 15% gross margin. So the gross margin at about 42% is down about 0.5 point year-over-year, primarily due to the increased proton revenue at a significantly lower margin. And we do have an additional quarter of excise tax that we didn't have last year. I'd say, both Oncology and X-ray, we're anticipating to be in that range of margins that we've talked about. So they're doing a good job of sustaining that. And the ROS or EBIT margin is somewhere between 20%, 21%. Again, it's going to be a little lower due primarily to the gross margin and the higher proton revenue. We are increasing R&D in oncology. But as a percentage of revenue, because proton is growing so rapidly, total company should stay at about that 7%. Tax, around 28%, and then that gets you to the EPS guidance that we gave you.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then just a second follow-up question on just this shift to gross orders and the cancellations. I'm just trying to understand the rationale because you can make the one quarter adjustment and take these cancellations out. And then going forward, are you assuming that there's more volatility in your cancellation rates? Because I would just assume you would just continue to report net orders, unless you're thinking that cancellation rates are going to be more volatile going forward. Can you help explain this rationale?", "Dow R. Wilson", "Yes, sure. Let's start with just repeating why the adjustment again. We did have an unusual level of cancellations in the quarter. These were primarily large orders with small freestanding clinic developers that did not move forward. The U.S. health care environment, especially in this freestanding clinic environment, cumulative with years of reimbursement cuts, the ongoing uncertainty related to the implementation of longer-term health care reform on them and just what we've seen in terms of some consolidation in that market and purchasing delays at the end of this last quarter, especially as there was a lot of conversation around the repeal of the excise tax, you know that caused people, I think, to delay. And so we went and looked at what had happened there and the environment led us to reevaluate order firmness of similar customers. And that's how we netted out to the adjustment. I'll let Elisha talk about some of your other questions more directly here.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Sure. Well, the good news, Amit, is now, in terms of these small freestanding centers -- I mean, in total, freestanding centers are now less than 5% of the company's total backlog. And what's remaining tend to be the large, stable customers and they are continuing to expand. So I want to stress that the type of customers that we were talking about, that came out of backlog, were very different. Roughly half the adjustment was from cancellations and about half from this reevaluation that we did, of similar customers that were in backlog. In terms of volatility, you're going to see both. You're going to get both growth and you're going to get net, and you're going to get ending backlog. So I think it gives you more level of detail. Historically, the adjustments have been about 4% in any given year. I don't expect that's going to change significantly, but you'll be able to see that quarter-over-quarter. And we think it gives you a good reflection of actually what's going on currently in the market environment that we're dealing in when you have the gross orders.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Robert W. Baird.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "So just a couple more questions on, I guess, EPS guidance, more than anything, for next year. So, Elisha, I'm trying to understand -- I mean, the yen is basically 6 months into its big move here. So the year-over-year kind of impact for next year shouldn't be hugely different than the incremental headwind yet this year. Brazil, is there anything from your guidance in Brazil at this point? I guess that's what I'm trying to figure out, if that's why EPS was so much lower. There are some losses in year one of the Brazil deal that might be in guidance for next year?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Very little. I mean, we are -- this just happened this week obviously. We're still talking with the MOH, negotiating contracts, which is going to take us a bit of time to complete. We're just now starting to discuss what their delivery schedule plans are for this year and beyond. So we don't -- we think the impact to FY '14 is likely to be fairly small. We don't disclose gross margin by region or by customer, obviously. But as we promised, the equipment margin is lower on this deal. But looking forward, over the long term, particularly if you look at what service and upgrade opportunities we have, we think this is profitable for Varian, and we're very excited about it. Even if you look out over 5 years, it's going to represent about 2% of our total delivery. So again, it's a very large deal, but when you spread it over 5 years, the impact should not be that significant in any given quarter or any given year.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "All right. Then the follow-up there, I guess -- but I would assume, if -- at $55 million on Brazil, at best probably over a 5- or 6-year period is somewhere near break even, hopefully a little positive, but near break even. So in the first year or 2, how much dilution should we think from that, number one? And then just again kind of trying to understand the bridge on guidance, I thought there was going to be about a $0.06 gain from the University of Maryland deal this year. Is that $0.06 gain, in fiscal '14, in that low guidance number you've put out now for this next year?", "Elisha W. Finney", "So again, we -- it's way too early on Brazil to know what deliveries they want this year. Again, my assumption is that it's going to have a minimal impact on FY '14. It's really more of an FY '15 and '16. In terms of the guidance -- I mean, the timing of not just Maryland but all proton deals is -- it's just -- it's very difficult to predict. If that comes through in the short term, we should be at the higher end of guidance. So yes. I mean, of course this proton business -- I think it's about a $0.10. That's why we put a pretty wide range on our guidance this year. It comes down to the timing of these deals, some of which are already in backlog, some which are not. I mean, I have to say the Maryland -- the building, the project is progressing nicely. They are not yet ready for equipment. They've completed equity financing. They're making progress with the debt, and they're working with the German trade bank, which just is complicated and takes time to do. So when we get all the t's crossed and i's dotted, we'll book the order and start recording revenue at that time.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "All right. And then last question, I promise, just on R&D. Dow, you talked about this at ASTRO when you and I met, that R&D -- you had so many projects you wanted to invest in. We see R&D up significantly year-over-year this quarter. It sounds like -- I guess, how would you quantify, Elisha or Dow, how much R&D might be weighing on EPS next year? I know you said 7% of sales, but it sounds like x proton, kind of the rest of the R&D budget is going up pretty significantly. Any color you can provide on the projects there and the impact that's having next year?", "Dow R. Wilson", "Within Oncology, I'd say the 2 investment areas we're making are in the software area. We think there's a big opportunity, especially in informatics. That's a global opportunity. And we think we've got a really good space to grow there in both the U.S. and outside of the U.S. And then I'll say the rest is really in global product opportunities, hardware and software, but we've got a number of nice initiatives going on to make sure we've got global product lined up for markets where we struggle with complexity of existing systems. And customers want very high capability at a good price. And of course, we want to maintain our margin on those product offerings. So that's a key investment area for us. Those are the 2 big areas.", "Elisha W. Finney", "And, Jeff, once you pencil this out in your model, you'll see that the absolute dollars are going up roughly 10%. Most of that increase is in Oncology Systems. But as a percentage of revenue, it's about flat, given the sizable increase in proton revenues that we're expecting.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just a clarification. In your prepared remarks, Elisha, as you were discussing the backlog adjustment, it sounded like it was predominantly freestanding, partially hospitals where you're seeing the change in the market. And, Dow, you've pointed out a number of issues in the freestanding center market that drove the backlog adjustment. Is this 80-20 freestanding versus hospitals, where the issues are driving the adjustment?", "Elisha W. Finney", "I think that's probably a fair assumption, Steve.", "Dow R. Wilson", "Yes, yes.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And then I guess given that backdrop, it's a little surprising to see the adjustment, given that we had the solid proposals out there on the reimbursement rates for '14. I wonder, Dow, if you could just give us your latest thoughts on the outlook for the market in the U.S. When does it get better? What might the market for orders look like over the next year or so?", "Dow R. Wilson", "Yes. I'll start by saying the proposal is not good for the freestanding centers, and it's kind of the cumulative impact of reimbursement rate reductions that we've seen for freestanding centers over the last 3 or 4 years. So -- and I think we've been pretty consistent about pointing that out. The proposal is fairly good on the hospital side. We understand that the release of the final rules may be delayed a few weeks. Frankly, the delay shouldn't have a material effect on the market for 2014 and the rates should still go into effect on January 1, at least that's what we're hearing. Just to kind of review for everybody, the hospitals are positive. It's focused on a higher-end capability, so stereotactic radiosurgery and IMRT are up if the proposal bill is adopted and it's down for 2D and 3D conformal radiation therapy. But we like the fact that it encourages advanced treatments, and it also should encourage the replacement of older installed base. So that's good news.", "I think on the overall market side, so we are seeing activity in the hospital side. There is a lot of old equipment out there. The freestanding clinics has been very quiet. I think we're getting to that period where that's starting to anniversary now, and it's going to be less of a factor moving forward. I think seeing what happens in the final proposal is critical. And if it remains as proposed, I think that'll be fairly good news on the hospital side, although there may be some movement.", "And maybe just to add a point here, and that is we are seeing a fair amount of activity in the U.S. around our EDGE product and stereotactic body radiation therapy, in particular that stereotactic radiosurgery as well. And as you know, the reimbursement rates between those products and the Gamma Knife was equalized this past year. And in all the proposals, that also remains the same though up a little bit from where it was. Actually, not a little bit up, quite a bit from where it was in the July timeframe. And we're seeing a fair amount of activity in that part of our funnel.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jason Wittes from Brean Capital.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "I guess, 2 questions. One if I could follow up on that. In terms of, Dow, the cascade of when you think this activity leads to actual order rates. I mean, how should we be thinking about that, especially through the course of 2014?", "Dow R. Wilson", "I'm going to be a little careful until I see the reimbursement proposal finalized. I think -- the good news is we're seeing a lot of activity, but I think it's -- I think people know a sequestration coming at the end of the quarter and Washington shutting down, I think there were some people that got conservative, especially as the excise tax got discussed. And I think that's kind of where we saw the impact in our short cycle revenue opportunities. So we're hoping that business will come back, but I think until the proposal comes out, I'd be a little careful on -- no, I think if the proposal stays as is, I think we'll have a -- it'll be a good year in the U.S.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then for another follow-up. I guess my understanding is the CX linear accelerators that you sold for the Brazilian contract lists for about $1 million. So -- and the price that works out, if I do the math, is something like $650,000 per machine. Is that the right way to think about it? And are you still making a profit off those sales with that -- if those are the right assumptions?", "Dow R. Wilson", "I think -- let's start with -- we found out the news on Monday afternoon. We're extremely pleased. We executed our strategy very successfully. I can confirm that it's $55.5 million. The deal will be dilutive in the short term. As Elisha said, we're not sure it has that big an impact in 2014, probably a bigger impact in '15 and '16. And then of course, in the long term with the upgrade and service opportunities, as Elisha mentioned, it will be profitable. Over the course of this product development, we've got a lot of opportunity for volume-based cost reduction and sourcing savings. This is the largest single deal in the history of radiation therapy by at least a factor of 2. And so we're confident we can get some of the cost out.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Roman from Goldman Sachs.", "David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I know that a lot of questions going through sort of the details on the moving parts in the quarter, but I was hoping you could give us a little bit of a broader perspective on what you think is happening in the U.S. market. I guess specifically what I'm asking is if I try to tie a lot of the pieces here together between changes in the business model to customer level, reimbursement pressure in freestanding clinics, consolidation among radiation oncology practices. Are the number of bunkers in the U.S. shrinking? Was there overconstruction during a period of time? And if that is a fair assessment, how do we think about the underlying growth of the, sort of, the available addressable market going forward?", "Dow R. Wilson", "I don't have hard data for you, but I would say with the consolidation, there has been some very small reduction in the number of bunkers out there. So we are seeing some of that go on. But I think mostly, the number of bunkers is -- and I'd say at the margin, that's very small. So I think we're seeing people just be very careful in this timeframe, especially our freestanding customers being very careful about how they invest and where they invest. And they're looking for local, regional consolidation opportunities on the freestanding side. On the hospital side of the market, we're not seeing that at all. We're seeing growth. We're seeing a lot of excitement about new applications, especially in brain and body stereotactic radiation therapy, and we're excited about that. I think the other factor is the baby boomers are retiring and moving into the demographic that needs this kind of equipment, and we're seeing good demographic over the next -- that's a longer-term thing. But I'd say on the freestanding side, David, some consolidation. On the hospital side, we're seeing investment.", "David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up, and Elisha, I appreciate the comments on the earlier question regarding the bridge between FY '13 and FY '14, but maybe if I could just go a little bit deeper into -- when I look at the orders or net orders that you reported in FY '13 versus FY '12, they look to be down year-over-year, but you are guiding to a reasonable amount of revenue growth next year. And even when you adjust for the proton contribution, it still looks like revenue growth will meaningfully exceed order trends in fiscal '13. And then on the P&L side of the equation, you bought back a ton of stock this year and got to earnings that I think were roughly flattish year-over-year. So just wondering about how we think about the order to revenue tie, and then your flexibility to continue to repurchase shares at this rate.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Sure. Well, David, I mean, if I look at it, if you exclude protons on a gross basis, orders for the total company are actually up 4%. So our short cycle businesses and X-ray, Flat Panel is growing well. Our Service business is growing clearly in double digits. Oncology's backlog, even with this adjustment, is up about 2%. So we blend all of that together and we think our core businesses can grow in that 5% to 6% range. Of course, our X-ray Products business and our Service business have to continue to perform. And you're right, protons has the ability to get us a couple of points above that, assuming we can hit that $125 million or so number in proton revenue, depending on the timing. In terms of leverage, we have consistently bought back shares. We spent virtually every dollar that we generate in the U.S. on share buybacks. You should expect that we'll continue to purchase between 1 million to 2 million shares per quarter. It's very accretive, when we're borrowing at less than 1.5% pretax right now. And you'll note that we did take out a debt facility to give us some flexibility, so that we can continue on that share repurchase program and continue to return capital to shareholders.", "Dow R. Wilson", "Maybe just coming back a minute to the overall growth in orders. I think we hit the North America piece pretty hard on gross orders. Year-over-year, North America was down 6% in Q4 versus a very strong year ago comp, and I think we've talked through the reasons why. But I think we have to talk just for a minute about some of the other regions. In Europe, Middle East, Africa, on the quarter, we had a very good quarter. We were up 13%, up 10% in constant currency. We had strength in the Scandinavian countries, Switzerland, Africa, and we're starting to see some traction in those markets from our Siemens relationship.", "In Asia, we were up 2%, 14% in constant currency. As I said in the text, China was up 30% and Japan was very strong. We had a huge Q4 last year in Korea and other parts of Southeast Asia. So the overall was a little quiet, but we were really pleased with the ongoing sustaining growth that we've had in China.", "Rest of world was up 42%, 44% in constant currency. We had very strong growth in Latin America. And before this Brazil tender, we had good strong double-digit growth last year in Brazil, even outside of the tender. Now so that's kind of the roundup on the region. So again, pretty strong, very strong o- U.S. performance.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Amit Hazan from SunTrust Bank.", "Amit Hazan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Just a quick question, again, on the order revision. If we kind of think about that $156 million coming out of backlog this quarter, I'm wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on the age of those orders and maybe how long they've been in backlog? I know that varies, but just a little bit of color on what we should be thinking about there in terms of how long that's been in the backlog. And maybe what you think might need to happen for any of those to potentially come back to become orders again?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Sure. Well, Amit, I mean this is -- I think this has been accumulative over, say, the last 3 years. I mean, at the time we booked the order, we believed the order was firm and had an estimated delivery date within the 2-year period. Some of those did age beyond that. And then with yet another reimbursement cut, as Dow has already outlined all of the reasons, we did see a higher level of cancellations. I have to say, though, I mean, in any quarter we have backlog adjustments. And so if this had been a typical quarter, we would've probably had somewhere between $30 million and $40 million of just typical backlog adjustments. So that net amount of, call it, $120 million, that's what we're talking about as this subset of our backlog that really deserved a very strong look and a reevaluation of whether or not those orders were still firm. It is possible that these orders could come back. I'm not counting on it. But again, the good news is in terms of freestanding centers in backlog today, less than 5%.", "Dow R. Wilson", "Half of them were cancellations, in fact, so we wouldn't expect those to come back.", "Amit Hazan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on Brazil. I'm just wondering if you have any plans to increase manufacturing in Brazil to any extent with regard to this deal, whether you think there are any orders beyond the 80 for that market or whether it gets pretty saturated at that point in terms of new units, and what the implications are strategically for you in South America from winning this deal?", "Dow R. Wilson", "We think this is a great opportunity for us. It's interesting when you look at the Brazil market -- you've heard us talk about some of the benchmarks in terms of Linacs per million people. When you kind of look at that analysis, we think that over the next 3 years, there will be 250-ish Linacs that go into Brazil. So this is a small piece of that big market that's down there. So we're excited about that opportunity. There are requirements in the tender for local content and the tender also has the capability of going to 100 units. It's a minimum commitment of 80 and the Ministry of Health can go to 100 units within the context of this tender. But we're excited about the long-term opportunity. And as we said before, there will be service opportunity and upgrade opportunity over and above the $55.5 million over the life of these accelerators.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Feffer from Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "I guess, first, just very quickly coming back to the U.S. on this short cycle upgrade delays you were seeing, is this something that we can expect? I mean, I know this is kind of -- you have a confluence of a lot of challenges now with the ACA coming online and sort of some residual effect of CapEx constraints. Is this something that we can expect going forward? Or do we look at this kind of as a 1- or 2-quarter blip?", "Elisha W. Finney", "So, Jeff, I mean, if we look back historically, every quarter we have anywhere between $40 million and $60 million of upgrade business. And this is things such as RapidArc, OBI, multileaf collimators, some of our accessories which tend to be high margin, anywhere from 60%, if it's hardware, to 80%, if it's software. And no, it just did not materialize as we expected in the quarter. However, the good news was the EDGE upgrades, which we're not yet shipping, those came in very strong in the quarter. So I think it had a little bit to do with the mix as well, and we won't be shipping the EDGE upgrades until we get into our fiscal second quarter, I believe, is the target date on that.", "Dow R. Wilson", "And I think the other thing I'd add is I think we might have some upside next year with RapidPlan upgrades. We introduced this at ASCO this last year, as you saw. The customer reception was outstanding, and we'll start shipping those as well this next year, and that probably have some upside on the upgrades number for us.", "Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then shifting over to EDGE, and now that you see your mark and are ready to launch there, can you just give maybe a little bit more color on the opportunities and the interest you're seeing in Europe and Asia and how you expect that market to be segmented between the early TrueBeam interest there versus EDGE? How are those going to sort of work together?", "Dow R. Wilson", "I'll keep it pretty simple. Between Gamma Knife and CyberKnife, we think it's about 100- to 120-unit market and we really want to penetrate that market. The upgrade opportunity is significant in our own installed base and that's kind of what you've seen in the numbers from this last year. But with our first system going to Champalimaud late this year, and really kind of getting now into the production phase of this product, people being able to kick the tires and see it. We really want to drive share in that new unit market, and that's what we're targeting.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies Group.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "First one on the backlog, I'm wondering if you can maybe give us some color on were those existing customers that are simply no longer there? And if so, does that mean, in the future, we should see a write-down of receivables from things such as service contracts that were in place? And then a couple of follow-ups on Brazil and guidance.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Anthony, no. The answer is no. I mean the fact it's sitting in backlog and is taken out, it did not turn into revenue and therefore did not create an AR. So these were mostly small freestanding developers who were going to go out and develop these clinics. We do not have an AR risk associated with them.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Great, great. And on Brazil, wondering if you can maybe give us a little bit of an indication as to sort of the types of machines you'd be selling in there? Will they be completely new machines or refurbished machines?", "Dow R. Wilson", "These will all be new machines, all new digital machines.", "Clinac EX is part of our Clinac series. A product that's got a terrific history and doing patients in every geography of the world.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "And then last on guidance, Elisha. Maybe can you just remind where you are in terms of restructuring? I know there were some programs in place. Where those programs are, and maybe how those play into the earnings guidance for '14?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Well, we had a restructuring charge last year. Most of it was in our first fiscal quarter, some in our second fiscal quarter. I believe the total was $6.5 million roughly. And that was largely so that we could redistribute employees into growing markets and that's largely been done. So as we speak right now, I don't expect any other restructuring charges. We had it as a retirement program that was very positively received. But I'm not anticipating anything else at this point.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Well, in terms maybe of the benefit of those restructuring programs, in terms of restructuring the business from, say, oncology -- I know Kolleen had spoke about restructuring the oncology business quite a bit at the midyear review. And so the actual benefit of that over time from a margin standpoint, when should we see the benefit from those efforts?", "Dow R. Wilson", "I think as we -- the big issue for us here is redeploying the resources. So we've had restructuring in mature markets, so that we can invest in growing markets. And that's so -- it's kind of good news, bad news. Good news is we had a restructuring; bad news is we've been reinvesting it to make sure that we're positioned for growth markets as part of our strategy to be a multi-domestic company and make sure we've got a great global footprint.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yes. And SG&A was down very slightly as a percentage of revenue. So we are focused on controlling those costs and putting the dollars in R&D, as we talked about.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "All very hopeful. Just maybe one last one on X-rays. The order number was quite big. Maybe can you speak about was that the catch-up order on inventory drawdowns from some of your customers from prior periods?", "Elisha W. Finney", "I'm sorry, we missed that question.", "Dow R. Wilson", "It was X-ray orders. We had a very good quarter in X-ray on the quarter. It was broad-based in both tubes and detectors. The Panel business, we had a number of our large customers ordering strongly, Carestream, Toshiba, [indiscernible] and Siemens. On the Tube side, we also had big orders from Toshiba, Hitachi and Hologic, as well as a number of new customers in the Tube business. So that business really ended the year with strong order momentum and sets us up for a good revenue year here in 2014 towards our X-ray components business.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Not to beat a dead horse on Brazil, but one of the things it does is kind of highlight the consolidation of purchasing power in this case, as you mentioned it, the largest order ever. Do you worry about the precedent being set here, in particular with the U.S.? I mean they are going to look at the potential to consolidate purchasing power and try to get larger tenders together?", "Dow R. Wilson", "I think a couple of things. The second largest unit order we've seen is, and I'm guessing, 20 to 25 units, so kind of a quarter of the size. We have seen some kind of 10-unit orders in the U.S. The kinds of equipment that people order in the U.S. and in Western Europe is a dramatically different configuration, totally, totally different. For example, on these accelerators in Brazil, there's no imaging. There's not a portal imager and there's not a kilovoltage imager. Long term, we think that's a nice upgrade opportunity for those systems. But virtually, every system that we sell in the U.S. and in Western Europe, for that matter, has a portal imager and a kilovoltage imager. So as we look back on the year, our pricing was stable. We were pleased with the pricing performance in the overall business as we look forward. If there's another 80-unit tender, we're going to go compete on it, as I'm sure our competitors are as well. But we think this is a pretty isolated case.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then on margins, I mean EBIT margins are down from -- have been down for a couple of years now. And despite revenue growth next year, it looks like there's still going to be some margin erosion. Can you maybe just talk about, in longer-term, how you're thinking about middle-of-the-balance-sheet leverage and your overall cost structure? Obviously, you made some changes when you first came on a year ago. But talk to how you're feeling about your cost structure today.", "Dow R. Wilson", "Yes, I might -- I think I'll let Elisha fix this after I'm done. But at a very high level, we have a regional shift from a high U.S. margin business to a faster-growing international business, so that's downward pressure, offset by product mix, which is favorable for us for software and services. So as we look forward, we're doing everything we can to have those offset each other. At the same time, Kolleen and her team are driving very hard the variable cost productivity piece of the equation. We've had very good progress this last year. I think you've seen some of the numbers in installations and warranties. That's been terrific on TrueBeam. In the second half of the year it had very nice traction. And so I think we've got some nice very soft productivity activities going on throughout the business. So the game is can we have those offset each other going forward?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yes. And, Tycho, let me just clarify that next year, the Oncology margin is actually -- it's going up a little bit. And it was even year-over-year this year of course for the fourth quarter and the year. X-ray and oncology will be in that range that we talked about. The entire impact of that 50 basis point year-over-year has to do with the additional proton revenue at a much, much lower margin and an extra quarter of excise tax.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And if I could squeeze just one quick one in at the end. On Siemens, there's a lot of excitement when you took over a year ago, Dow, on that JV. I mean can you just talk to how it's tracked? We don't hear as much about it lately. Just wondering if it's lived up to your expectations.", "Dow R. Wilson", "I think it took us longer, quite frankly, than we thought to get it going. So we'll admit that. But we had some very nice deals in Q4 happen. We're pleased about that. The sales funnel is growing. I think one of the things that we are hearing as a big positive from customers is that they now have a choice. These are customers who did not have a choice before. It was kind of Elekta or LANTIS and nothing else. ASTRO, to 100% of the Siemens installed base. So we're starting to see some good movement. You heard me mention earlier that we saw some activity in Europe just last quarter. And so we're -- I'd say, I think it's fair to say that it took us a little longer to get this going than we thought it would when we first got in, but we're starting to see some nice activity, I think, on both sides.", "Operator", "At this time, I'd like to turn the call back to our speakers for closing comments.", "Spencer R. Sias", "Thank you for participating. A replay of this call can be heard on Varian's investor website at www.varian.com/investor, where it will be archived for a year.

With me are Dow Wilson, President and CEO; Elisha Finney, CFO; and Clarence Verhoef, our Corporate Controller. Dow and Elisha will summarize our results, and we'll take your questions following the presentation.", "To simplify our discussion, unless otherwise stated, all references to the quarter or year are fiscal quarters and fiscal years.

[Operator Instructions] And now, here's Dow.", "Dow R. Wilson", "Good afternoon, and welcome. We are reporting results that we believe put us on track for hitting our revenue and earnings targets for the fiscal year. To summarize our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 versus the year-ago period, revenues rose 5% to $712 million. Our gross margin grew by 60 basis points to 43.5%. Our operating margin remained about level even after a significant step-up in our R&D investments, and our net earnings grew by 6% to $0.91 per diluted share. We had several positive developments subsequent to the close of the quarter. This includes the big win for oncology in Algeria, our announcement of an expanded agreement to supply an estimated $550 million in imaging components to Toshiba and a 510(k) clearance from the FDA for our ProBeam proton therapy system.", "I'll focus now on the operational highlights of our businesses in the quarter. Oncology Systems grew gross orders by 5% to $533 million for the quarter with the help of strong 13% order growth in North America, where we saw a broad-based increase in hospital purchasing activity. Hospitals accounted for the lion's share of our orders in North America. We booked $19 million in orders related to agreements with 2 large health systems in the U.S. to supply a total of $50 million in equipment and services for their consolidated networks over the next several years. The remainder of these orders we booked over the terms of the agreement.", "Numerous takeouts of competitor's software and hardware products, including several aging Siemens and TomoTherapy machines, added to Oncology's growth in this market. New products, including our EDGE platform and upgrade for stereotactic radiosurgery also contributed to our orders growth in North America. Our newly introduced RapidPlan software for fast and high-quality, knowledge-based treatment planning got off to a solid -- a good start with several orders, including one that was coupled with the replacement of a competitor's accelerator.", "We continue to see signs that the Affordable Care Act is causing decision-makers at treatment centers to sharpen their focus on both clinical efficacy and cost efficiency. Our oncology product line is closely aligned with this focus, and we believe our competitive position is stronger than ever.", "During the quarter, health authorities in the U.S. recommended lung cancer screening for people deemed to have a higher risk of developing this disease. This recommendation could result in earlier diagnosis for a large number of cases that could be treated with lung radiosurgery. We are hopeful that this prompts more centers in the U.S. to acquire and use our radiosurgery products to help these patients.", "Turning to markets outside of North America, gross orders were relatively flat in EMEA, where weak equipment purchases were offset by robust gains in our service business. The sales funnel in EMEA continues to look promising despite the ways that pushed potential deals in several nations outside of the quarter. We believe our market share in this region is stable.", "In India, TrueBeam enjoyed continued success during the quarter with 5 wins, including a key placement in the National Oncology Centre at Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai. As an aside, TrueBeam constituted more than 60% of total high-energy machine orders in the quarter. We have now booked more than 1,000 orders for TrueBeam, and completed more than 600 installations since its introduction in 2010. We had a big win after the close of the quarter in Algeria, where we've entered into an agreement to supply the Ministry of Health with $51 million in equipment and service for 6 centers over the next 5 years. We expect to book about half of this order during the second quarter and the remainder as delivery sites and dates are set.", "In Asia, oncology gross orders for the first quarter declined as a result of softness in both Japan and China. Slower repurchasing activity, competitive pressure, negative currency fluctuations and a tough year-ago comparison resulted in a significant decline in Japanese orders during the quarter.", "In China, first quarter gross orders fell slightly versus the year-ago period due to delays in purchasing decisions. We believe these decisions will be finalized later in the year. Both TrueBeam and UNIQUE have established firm footholds in the China market, and we believe they help Varian to gain share there during the quarter.", "In Brazil, we had another quarter of strong order growth even though we have not yet booked any orders from the tender we won for 80 machines. We expect to book orders relating to this tender as sites and shipment schedules are set. In the meantime, clinicians have continued to show interest in upgrading purchases to deliver IMRT, which is now being formally reimbursed by private insurers with the government likely to follow.", "In total, gross orders for Latin America and the rest of the world declined by 5% versus the year-ago quarter. Service represented a record 40% of oncology gross orders in the quarter and continued to be an important growth driver for the company. The service business expanded by 15% during the quarter with particularly strong growth in EMEA.", "Turning to X-ray Products. The timing of order placements resulted in a first quarter gross orders decline of 19% to $108 million. Shortly after the close of the quarter, we booked over $20 million in orders for panels and tubes. We saw a strong demand for our new mammography and wireless panels and continued interested in our bundled panel and workstation solutions. Separately, we are announcing the execution of an expanded 3-year agreement to supply an estimated $550 million of imaging components to Toshiba. Orders will be booked over the period of the agreement. As was announced earlier, we are adding 120,000 square feet to our production facility for manufacturing imaging components in Salt Lake City.", "Before leaving X-ray Products, I want to take a moment to recognize the contribution of Bob Kluge, who is retiring in February from his role as Head of Varian X-ray Products and Security and Inspection Products businesses. Bob built X-ray Products revenues from $95 million in 1993 to $546 million at the end of 2013. We are indebted to Bob for his strategic vision, intelligent management and consistent execution that have propelled Varian to a leadership position in the global imaging industry. He set the stage for continued success and growth in our components businesses. At the same time, I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome Sunny Sanyal to Varian. Sunny, who's a former President of McKesson Provider Technologies, will replace Bob effective February 3. I'm sure Sunny will successfully build on the solid foundations laid by Bob.", "The company's other category, which is comprised of the Security and Inspection Products business, the Varian Particle Therapy business and the Ginzton Technology Center, recorded gross orders of $14 million in the first quarter. Varian Particle Therapy reached a major milestone after the quarter ended when our ProBeam proton therapy system received 510(k) clearance. This sets the stage for commencement of patient treatments when systems are fully commissioned. With this clearance, we believe Varian has the most advanced proton system on the market. With our unique scanning beam technology, ProBeam has the capability to deliver intensity-modulated proton therapy or IMPT with the precision needed to capitalize on the power of protons. It also integrates some of Varian's most advanced technologies, including exciting elements of our TrueBeam user interface, as well as our image guidance and motion management tools. As it stands, we now have contracts to install our ProBeam system at several centers around the world, including 4 in the United States, 1 in Saudi Arabia and 1 in Russia. Now, I'll turn it over to Elisha.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Thanks, Dow, and hello, everyone. While Dow has already covered gross orders, I want to briefly talk about the constant currency growth rates for the quarter. Overall, currency exchange rates had virtually no effect on the company's total order growth in the quarter. However, exchange rates had a significant impact within some of our regions. For example, the yen weakened significantly from the year-ago quarter, which resulted in oncology growth orders in Asia being down 7% in dollars and even with the year-ago quarter in constant currency.", "By contrast, currencies strengthened in Europe. Oncology's gross orders in EMEA increased 2% in dollars and fell 1% in constant currency. Oncology orders in our Rest of World region declined by 5% in dollars and by 1% in constant currency. The company ended the quarter with a $2.8 billion backlog, down 1% from the year ago quarter, including a roughly $50 million decline in proton therapy backlog. As a reminder, both gross and net orders are shown in the consolidated statement of earnings attached to our earnings release.", "First quarter revenue for the total company increased 5% in dollars and 6% in constant currency. Oncology posted a 3% gain in revenues during the quarter with a significant increase in revenues outside of North America.", "Service revenues grew by 11% over the year-ago period and represented a record 40% of oncology revenues in the quarter. X-ray Products posted first quarter revenue growth of 9%, with both tubes and panels contributing about equally. Revenues from businesses in the other category increased by $4 million due to continued progress on our Scripps, Saudi and Russia proton therapy projects.", "Total company gross margin for the quarter was 43.5%, up 60 basis points from the year-ago quarter, with favorable product mix and lower quality cost in both of our major businesses. Oncology Systems gross margin improved by 1 point to 44.9%, helped by the continued growth in our service business, as well as improved quality cost. While we are pleased with the margin performance in the quarter, we continue to believe that oncology can sustain long-term gross margins in the 43% to 44% range.", "X-ray Products gross margin for the quarter was up more than 0.5 point to 42.2% due to improved quality cost in both tubes and panels. We continue to believe that this business can sustain long-term gross margin in the low 40% level.", "First quarter SG&A expenses were $110 million or 15% of revenues, a slight improvement as a percentage of revenues from the year-ago quarter when we incurred a $4 million restructuring charge related to an enhanced retirement program.", "First quarter R&D expenses were $58 million or 8% of revenues, up more than 1 point as a percentage of revenue as we continued to invest in our global strategies and execute on our product roadmap.", "Moving down the income statement, first quarter operating earnings totaled $142 million, up 3% from the year-ago quarter in dollars and almost even with the year-ago quarter at 20% of revenues. Depreciation and amortization totaled $16 million for the quarter. The effective tax rate was up slightly from the year-ago period to 31.2%. Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased from the year-ago quarter to $107.4 million due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted EPS was $0.91 for the quarter.", "Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $971 million, debt of $481 million and stockholders' equity of $1.7 billion. DSO at 94 was up 7 days from the year ago quarter, with an approximate 10-day impact from the proton therapy business, where extended payments are not yet due, but revenue has been recognized under the \"percentage of completion method.\"", "First quarter cash flow from operations was $43 million, lower than net income, primarily due to working capital increases and accounts receivable and inventory versus the year-ago quarter. Primary uses of cash were approximately $155 million toward the repurchase of 2 million shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 6 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2014.", "Now, I'll turn it back to Dow for the outlook.", "Dow R. Wilson", "Thanks, Elisha. The company is executing its marketing and operational strategies effectively, and we believe we are on-track for hitting our fiscal year 2014 growth targets.", "For the fiscal year, we continue to believe that total company revenues could increase by about 6% to 8% over the prior fiscal year. Net earnings per diluted share for the fiscal year could be in the range of $4.22 to $4.34. We expect total company revenues for the second quarter of the fiscal year 2014 to be about equal to the year-ago quarter when proton revenues were high. Net earnings per diluted share for the second quarter could be in the range of $1 to $1.04.", "We're now ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Johnson from Robert W. Baird.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Dow, I was wondering if I could start with you, 2 quick questions and then a follow-up for Elisha. For you, Dow, I guess, any update on the short cycle business. Obviously, that was a shortfall last quarter, just maybe how that bounced back, if it did at all, in the quarter. And also an update maybe on tone that you're hearing from the hospitals. The obvious -- obviously, the North American order number looked better this quarter. But do you think that's been driven by reimbursement? Just what are your conversations in the field telling you the follow-through has been since the better reimbursement rates were finalized?", "Dow R. Wilson", "I'll answer the North America question first. North American business was obviously very good. We're very pleased with that. 13% orders growth in North America, that's the strongest quarter we've had in over 2 years. So we like that a lot. As I mentioned in the script, we did see a couple of large deals in the quarter, and we think that, that is -- that we'll continue to see -- as the market consolidates, we'll continue to see some large orders. I'd say the short-cycle business is about the same. I wouldn't say that, that's ticked up. We did see some nice EDGE and RapidPlan activity. So that's good news. The new products are taking. We did add -- we did see some strong competitive takeouts. I think it's too early to tell whether this is -- I frankly don't think it's reimbursement-driven. I think maybe there was a little bit of a pent-up demand as people watched the -- watched Washington make some decisions. But I think it's still a little early to tell what the long-term impact is going to be. I guess our gut now it's is still kind of in the mid-single-digit growth kind of scenario, which is better than we've done in the last year or 2, so we like that. The good news is we still have a lot of product in the installed base that's aging. We've got 1,100 Linac installed base in the U.S. that's over 10 years old, so we can go after that. And then the other thing that we're curious to see how it impacts the market, it'll be positive in the long term, certainly is this new lung screening mandate that's come down. And clearly, the earlier we can identify a lung lesion, the more appropriate it is for radiation. And that will also have a positive impact on the configuration that we sell, because folks are going to want SBRT-capable, motion-managed-capable machines. So that's kind of the tour of North America.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Yes, that's helpful. And when you say mid-single digit, do you still see it that way as -- from a growth perspective, Dow? You mean worldwide, or are you saying that for U.S., sorry?", "Dow R. Wilson", "Right now, for both.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "For both. Okay. And Elisha, just a follow-up for you, where is it? On the gross to net adjustment in oncology, I think last quarter you talked about that typically being a 3% to 5% adjustment. This quarter it was above that, a little north of $40 million, bigger than we were thinking. So are we still seeing you take more out of the backlog on the oncology side, more cancellations, things like that, than normal, or how do you explain that, I guess?", "Elisha W. Finney", "No, Jeff. This was very normal for a quarter. We had about $40 million of dormancies in cancellation, the lion's share of that being within the Oncology Systems, about a $5 million FX adjustment. That 3% to 5% is a backlog that we typically would deliver on about 95% of backlog. If you do the math, it's about, I think, 1.3%, 1.4% of backlog right now. So we're in that range. And really, I think proton impacted at our backlog, and proton was down $50 million. If that had been flat year-over-year, we'd be well within, say, the 1% of backlog range that is very typical.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. Would you give a net order for oncology, a net constant currency growth rate for the quarter? Just like in the tables. We only get a reported, I believe.", "Elisha W. Finney", "It's -- the constant currency is the same. So we -- the yen and the euro were almost an exact offset in the gross and net.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "One housekeeping question, sorry if I missed it. But could you give us the North American and international net order figures for oncology?", "Elisha W. Finney", "We have -- no. What we gave was the geographic breakdown on gross orders. The lion's share of any impact of net is -- impacts North America.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. So the lion's share, the 40 -- I'm sorry, $43 million, maybe 80%, 90% of that was on North America?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Correct.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "So we can get to the number that way. Got it. I wonder, Elisha -- sorry, 2 questions for you, and one on gross margins. As you look at the quarter, clearly above what you've called out for the year. Does it imply that there's maybe some upside to the view that the right number for the full year is $42 million for the total company, and clearly, there's an embedded question there, which is could you speak to the impact of what proton means for gross margins and operating margins over the balance of the year?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yes. So Steve, I mean, clearly, we were very pleased with the margin performance in both of our core businesses this quarter. That said, it's early in the fiscal year. We still have currencies moving around. What really helped both businesses this quarter was strong service in oncology. And we had lower quality cost in both our tubes, panels and Oncology business. We had a much higher percentage of revenue outside of North America. But that said, the revenues in our BRIC countries were down. So when I look at all of that together, I mean, obviously, we're pleased the product cost reductions are coming through as we anticipated. But I -- the geographic mix for the balance of the year could impact that. So at this early stage, I'm holding to that 43%, 44% for total oncology.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Amit Hazan from SunTrust bank.", "Amit Hazan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "So maybe the first question on the service business, given it was a bigger-percentage quarter and continues to grow nicely. I'm just wondering if you can lay out for us, again, as we kind of start out this new calendar year, how much visibility you have that service business can continue to grow double digit. If you can walk through some of the underlying factors you're seeing now having grown double-digits for quite some time. And then also if you can just kind of walk through what that means for service gross margin dynamic, if 50% plus gross margin is sustainable for service, if you can improve further.", "Dow R. Wilson", "Yes, I think the margin rate one is an easy one. We do believe that, that will continue. There's no reason to see that decrease at all. I mean, the #1 analytic that we look at inside is installed base out of warranty and our installed base out of warranty and service continues to grow. I think, as we said on the call somewhere -- middle of last year, we basically have a TrueBeam coming out of warranty. One per order day this year, and that's driving our growth. We do have -- we are seeing more TrueBeams come out of warranty, in particular, outside of the U.S. So a lot of that early TrueBeam volume went into the U.S., and now, we're kind of moving into the bubble outside of the U.S., from an installed base out of warranty perspective. We're also seeing a richer contract mix that comes with that. The TrueBeam pricing is better. And we also -- the service team, I think, has done a very good job of going after software service agreements, as well as a driving capture rates, contract capture rates in the business. So we see this kind of double-digit scenario in the service business continuing.", "Amit Hazan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "All right. And the second question for me is on China. The tone has changed a lot since just last quarter, and it's within the same calendar year, really. So I just wonder if you can give us a little bit more color on what you think is going on in that country, and now in terms of orders. We saw GE come through with some weak numbers as well. And so, are you seeing something changing there in terms of how they're looking at purchase of capital equipment and why you think it's now towards the back half, back end of the year or what else...", "Dow R. Wilson", "Well, we have seen a slowing of purchasing activity in China. We think it's temporary. Our share was up in the quarter, as I mentioned, and we're pleased to see that. Our funnel is very strong in China, so we think it's just a timing issue.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeremy Feffer from Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "I wanted to, first, just -- I want to double check that the $19 million of U.S. orders to a couple of hospitals, were those new customers for you or were those replacements of existing systems?", "Dow R. Wilson", "Let's see. I think it's a little bit of both. Both of these are consolidated customers and -- so there has been some acquisitions. I know the parent organizations were both Varian customers. But in their consolidation, there's some competitive equipment that they had consolidated and that we will be replacing. And that's the $19 million is the amount that we actually booked in the quarter. The deals were -- together, they were $50 million. And as we get a little more visibility on the sites and the dates, we'll be looking the other $31 million of those orders.", "Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then I wanted to come back to Japan. You mentioned that you're seeing -- I mean, beyond the obvious currency issues, you've been -- you mentioned some -- a bit of a tougher competitive landscape. Can you provide a little more color there and how you see that market developing over time?", "Dow R. Wilson", "I think it's -- the way we kind of view it here is we had a tough comp. We got a lot of accelerated purchases in the Q1 of last year with a little budget acceleration that they were doing in Japan. We also had some yen impact year-over-year, and so the market is soft. We still think the long-term growth in the market remains very, very good. Less than 30% of patients in Japan get radiation as part of their cancer therapy that in Western Europe, in the U.S, that number is over 50%, 50% to 60%. So we think that Japan remains a good long-term growth market. We do have a lot of opportunities in the MELCO installed base, which is gradually replacing. For those who don't know the history there, we bought that installed base a dozen of years ago or so and those products are kind of coming to the end of their life, and we're seeing a nice replacement opportunity there. Over the last year, our share has been stable in Japan. We have very high share there and we think that, that will continue in the long term.", "Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Okay. Last one, quickly. Any updates on proton reimbursement now that you have ProBeam approval? Any -- are you getting any thawing in the reimbursement -- on the reimbursement side?", "Dow R. Wilson", "The hospital reimbursement rate went up. As part of the reimbursement package that was approved in December, hospital proton reimbursement went up. Freestanding reimbursement in protons is negotiated with each carrier. They typically kind of follow the federal hospital guideline in protons. So we think this is encouraging news, but it's not. It still has to be negotiated center by center -- carrier by carrier.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jason Wittes from Brean Capital.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Just 2 quick ones here. One, the U.S. order rate. It sounds, based from what you said, that hospitals' purchasing dynamics haven't really changed for the last few quarters, but the real driver this quarter was a big lump order? Is that the right way to think about it? And...", "Dow R. Wilson", "Well, in fact, no. I mean, it was only $19 million of a huge number. So yes, we got a nice $50 million order, but we only actually booked $19 million of it. So we did see broad-based strength in the U.S. market. There might have been a little bit of timing because people were waiting for some certainty with the reimbursement decision. Did we have a little bit of pent-up demand? You heard me say, our kind of forecast on the year is that this market is going to be a mid-single-digit market. That would be great news for us. That has not been a mid-single-market for a while. So we'd love to see that stability, and we're thrilled with the start that we have in Q1, and our funnel looks pretty good.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then on China, just to clarify on that as well. It sounds like you're optimistic that you got a recovery, but it does sound that'll be later in the year. So if I think about the growth rate that you guys are thinking about for orders, roughly, I think you're still saying it's going to be mid-single digit, which, again, is an improvement. It sounds like that'll be more U.S.-centric than I would have expected this year, though. If I think about the moving pieces, meaning the U.S. looks a little stronger than it was in China, looks like it's going to be back-end loaded, is that a fair way to look at it?", "Dow R. Wilson", "Kind of stepping back at the highest level, I think the Oncology business is in the mid-single digit range. The imaging components business is in the double-digit range, proton's kind of the wild card. We got a pretty good proton funnel. But our long-term growth in kind of the mid- to high-single digits is a pretty good forecast for what our markets are doing.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Amit Bhalla from Citigroup.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Dow, I'm just trying to foot the 2Q guidance with what you're saying about what's taking place in the regions. I guess, what's clear is that underlying your full year guidance is China being back-end loaded, but your second quarter guidance, can you walk through some of the moving parts? Clearly, it's coming in a little bit lighter than -- we're expecting both on top line and earnings.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Sure. So on it, for Q2, sales up 1% to 2%. And that's primarily driven by the proton therapy business will be down significantly versus the year ago quarter, where we started recognizing revenue under both the Saudi and the Russia projects, as well as a significant Scripps revenue. In the second quarter, Oncology, we're expecting, again, to be up in the low-single digits, X-ray up in the high-single digits, with half -- the second half's going to really be driven above that level by the proton business, where we're continuing to make progress, but it's just not done, at this point. On financing, it's going well, from what we hear, but we won't be able to book revenue until that is completed on the Maryland project.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And question -- I guess, question for you, Elisha, on the quality -- the product quality costs that are coming in better, you mentioned it both in the Oncology business, you mentioned it in the X-ray business. Can you put some quantification around that? And what exactly have you improved and why can't that just continue straight on out?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Well, we just get variations in any given quarter. It relates to scrap and warranty and rework and, of course, retrofit cost. And it was just kind of a perfect storm, if you will, on the positive side this quarter. We're hoping that holds, but again, it's just too early in the year to say that it's going to be that good for the remainder of the year. We always get quarterly fluctuations, but again, very pleased with the performance in the quarter.", "Dow R. Wilson", "It is a focus for us. Some of them come in lumps, which gives us some of the issues with the predictability issue. But as far as yield and scrap goes on the overall quality, it's a major initiative for us across the entire business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "A couple for you, Dow, on Oncology, one on X-ray, and just a numbers question for Elisha. You mentioned the E orders were pushed out in fiscal 1Q to 2Q. I'm just wondering if, maybe, you can quantify that, for one. And then, on the Toshiba contract, how does that stack up versus prior contracts? Is it a bigger contract? Is pricing favorable on that and how additive is that to the X-ray outlook?", "Dow R. Wilson", "First of all, coming to Europe, we did see strength in Southern Europe, which kind of surprised us, that was not something we were expecting. So France, Spain and Italy were strong. We were expecting weakness in Northern Europe. We had a very large order last year in the U.K., which I think we'll be explaining a little bit of that all year, in Northern Europe. Central Europe was relatively flat. We had good performance in India, and our Service business performed very well in Europe. So kind of -- Northern Europe and Central Europe was where we were down, and India and Southern Europe was where we were up. The Toshiba contract and the X-ray business, we're thrilled. Obviously, it's been a terrific partner and really driven the growth in our X-ray components business for the last several years. The contract value, the agreement value is about $515 million, which is up about 10% from the last time. So it's part of what gives us this confidence in calling a double-digit scenario in our components business.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "That's helpful. And then, quickly for Elisha, you mentioned, also, in your prepared comments of $50 million decrease in proton therapy backlog, so maybe just a clarification on where that was, which order. And then, on the $51 million emerging market deal that Dow referenced in his comments, is that sort of similar pricing and margins relative to Brazil? Is that the way we should be thinking about that revenues?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yes, on the proton therapy backlog, really, it's just -- it's a cumulative number, right, over the last 12-month period, but I'm looking at quarter-over-quarter. And it's just simply because we are getting very close on some proton orders, but we have not yet booked those orders because it hasn't met all of our order booking guidelines. And so, we've been recording significant revenue over the last 12 months, particularly as Scripps has progressed, and we have not booked an order over that period. So once an order is booked, that backlog should come back nicely for our proton therapy business. With respect to the Algeria deal that we mentioned, it is at a significantly higher margins and it is at significantly higher featured equipment, with the TrueBeam STx and a lot more software content, so much higher than the Brazil margin.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Elisha, just -- can you comment on the reclassification on products and services revenues at the bottom of the release? I'm just not entirely clear what drove that.", "Elisha W. Finney", "Sure. So we average -- if you look at any given quarter, we average about $25 million in parts sales. Historically, we had put that into our product category and not talked about it as part of our service business. We just simply did a reclass because it's more consistent with how we talk about our service business to The Street. Also how we monitor and look at performance in our product lines and businesses internally and, frankly, how incentive plans are structured. I just wanted to make sure that we had all of that perfectly aligned. So simply a reclass of that $25 million a quarter, roughly, of the parts businesses, which represents less than 10% of our total service business.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then, on the margins. I mean, if we look -- this quarter, 6% earnings growth off a 5% top line. I know you talked at the Analyst Day in December about 25 to 50 basis points of leverage per year. Why couldn't that be more? I mean, I understand supply chain is part of it. But there has to be other parts of the balance sheet where you can drive additional leverage. Can you maybe just talk to your level of commitment to driving leverage in the model?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Absolutely. For this fiscal year, and really what's driving and we're going to be down, call it, maybe 0.5 point, roughly, on operating margin, and that's driven by, really, the proton therapy business. We are expecting significant revenue out of protons this year. If you don't mind, I failed to answer Steve's second question, which was the margin on protons. If you take the total revenue for the year, it'll be at roughly a 15% margin. As we mentioned, it will be somewhere between $100 million and $150 million of proton revenue, depending on the timing of projects, I've just picked the midpoint at $125 million. So we do have, between that 6% and 8%, some significant variability, if you will, around the proton business. And then, secondly on leverage, we made a conscious decision to take the R&D up this year. It will go up about 1 full percentage point, and that's just so that we can continue to execute on a very robust product pipeline. So those 2 factors are what's driving it. If it weren't for the proton's significant increase in sales, I believe we wouldn't be getting leverage in the P&L.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then, last one. Dow, you called out software. Can you maybe just give us a sense as to how much share you think you've pulled on, on that side of the market? And are you lacking in hardware sales at this point with RapidPlan?", "Dow R. Wilson", "As I mentioned on the call, we did see a conversion of the hardware socket with RapidPlan, so we were glad to see that. We think that there will be more of that. We did see a lot of purer software conversions, of people converting either treatment planning or oncology information system installed base to either ARIA or Eclipse. And that's been a multi-year trend. We think we've been winning it more there than we've been losing. And I'd say that, especially with the strength of RapidPlan coming out of ASTRO, we've got a nice lead in treatment planning and -- with RapidPlan, I think, it's really hitting a chord with people, whether you're the best at treatment planning or new in the business, RapidPlan is going to help you. And I think customers are seeing that and it's really driving the conversation for both software and hardware.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then, one last quick one, if I can. On the commentary on China before, as we think about the back half of this calendar year. Are these going to be larger tenders or is it a lot of singles and doubles? I'm just trying to gauge the lumpiness of...", "Dow R. Wilson", "There's always going to be the PLA tender, but, otherwise, I don't think the structure of the -- I mean, it might be consolidating a little bit, but I don't think, at least at this point, anything -- I don't see any material change in kind of the structure of the China market. It happens, kind of a customer at a time and province at a time.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Roman from Goldman Sachs.", "Aimie Faucett - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "This is, actually, Aimie, in for David Roman. I was just wondering, looking at your guidance for 2Q, and kind of going through the numbers, that's getting me to an average growth rate, in the back half, of about 9.5% to 13.5% for both revenue and earnings. So could you just walk me through what you're seeing that, that gets you there, that makes you confident that you can deliver that in the back half?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yes, and again, this is -- it's going to be largely dependent on the timing of our proton therapy revenue, where we're going to see a huge increase in proton revenue once we get these -- once our customers gets the financing completed on the Maryland project. We're coming to the end on Scripps, in terms of revenue recognition, but Russia, Saudi and Maryland are all in the queue for the second half of this year to have significant revenues with them. So again, that's really what's driving the top line growth, above that midpoint that Dow talked about. If I just took our core businesses, again, Oncology is going to grow in the low single-digit range, call it the 3% to 4% range. Our X-ray Products top line should grow near the low-double-digit range with the balance coming from huge increases in protons.", "Aimie Faucett - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then, maybe just as a follow-up. With so much of the revenue coming from proton in the back half, how are you thinking about gross margins, especially you were saying that you expect them to still kind of reach that 42% number. So what are you seeing in the back half that gets you there on margins?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Yes. So again, we're seeing that the Oncology and X-ray margins are going to hold well within the ranges that we've talked about. The proton gross margin is coming up from prior years. For the total proton business this year, we think we'll average around 15%. And what that equates to is, in the FY '13, total company gross margin was 42.5%. And again, should be just down slightly for the total business for this fiscal year. We have one more quarter of excise tax in Oncology, and then the proton revenue, at a much lower margin, driving that slight decline.", "Aimie Faucett - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And if I could just squeeze in one more quick one. I was wondering if you have any guidance around the share count for the full year, for '14.", "Elisha W. Finney", "No. Other than -- if you look historically, we bought between 1 million and 2 million shares per quarter. We do have an existing authorization in place for calendar year '14 for 6 million shares. So we look at this opportunistically, based on U.S. cash, interest rates, share price, all of those things, but you should assume that we will continue to purchase through the balance of the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Toby Wann from Obsidian Research Group.", "Toby Wann - Obsidian Research Group, LLC", "Elisha, quick question on the R&D, the percent of revenue. I mean, is it fair to assume that it's going to be above 8%, kind in that 8% range on a go-forward basis, given the product pipeline that's coming up?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Well, again, we're seeing significant increases in the oncology R&D, but because of that proton revenue increase that I've been talking about, it should be about 7% of revenues, both this year and last year. If you were to strip out the increase in proton revenue, yes, it would go up by about a point.", "Toby Wann - Obsidian Research Group, LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. And then, cash balance in the U.S. was -- of the $971 million, about how much of that is outside the U.S.?", "Elisha W. Finney", "Most of it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Charley Jones from Barrington.", "Charley R. Jones - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "So I just want to start, I guess, with market growth. I was wondering if our growth -- I see your U.S. growth is driven more by the market improving or are you making some competitive inroads?", "Dow R. Wilson", "I think our share is stable to up a hair. It's not up dramatically, by any stretch, but our share has been, at least, what it's been historically. So I think most of this is, at least, that we saw in Q1, is a pretty good market. We haven't seen Elekta's results yet, and won't see them for another month or so, but that's kind our gut. When you look at the last rolling 12 months, which is probably a better way to look at it, our share is stable to a hair up.", "Charley R. Jones - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "I guess, the reason for the question is, I'm thinking, after the loss of Brazil, the change in reimbursement, maybe they'd get kind of aggressive. And so I'm just wondering if they've changed their behavior a little bit. I guess, as a follow-up to that, are you seeing TomoTherapy at all anymore? And can you comment on...", "Dow R. Wilson", "As I said, we did have some takeouts of TomoTherapy units in the quarter, they're still out there and they win a few. But I think RapidArc and biometric arc therapy from Elekta have also made it very tough for the competitive differentiation of TomoTherapy. There was another piece to your question...", "Charley R. Jones - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "I guess, there's more on Elekta right after the year...", "Dow R. Wilson", "Yes. I was just going to say, on the overall pricing environment is good. We have -- we've seen stability in pricing.", "Charley R. Jones - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "And if I could just squeeze one more in. I guess, in general, would you say, U.S. health care reform is kind of a non-issue, as far as uncertainty within the purchasers? And you've got better reimbursement for radiosurgery to boot, so...", "Dow R. Wilson", "I think the good news is, the short-term environment doesn't look too bad. And the reimbursement news, at least, stabilized. The investment environment for people over the next year, I think, there's some question about where it ends up in the 2016, 2017 time period, as legislation drives to more accountable care organizations and things like that. And I think there's -- I think our customers still have some uncertainty about that. I think what we are seeing is a reinforcement of what our customers are looking for, they're looking for real clinical value. If you've got product that has a demonstrated clinical value and can help drive efficiency, you win. So I think, both radiation and Varian have a very good story in the value that we drive in healing patients.", "Operator", "Thank you. I'll now turn the call back over to our speakers for closing comments.", "Spencer R. Sias", "Thank you for participating.

And welcome to the Varian Medical Systems Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions)", "As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Spencer Sias, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Thank you, Mr. Sias. You may now begin.", "Spencer Sias", "Thank you. Good afternoon. And welcome to Varian Medical Systems conference call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2014. With me are Dow Wilson, President and CEO; Elisha Finney, CFO; and Clarence Verhoef, our Corporate Controller. Dow and Elisha will summarize our results and we'll take your questions following the presentation.", "To simplify our discussion, unless otherwise stated, all references to the quarter or year are fiscal quarters and fiscal years. Quarterly comparisons are for the second quarter of fiscal 2014 versus the second quarter of fiscal 2013.", "Please be advised that this presentation and discussion contains forward-looking statements.

We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this presentation and discussion because of new information, future events or otherwise.", "Before turning it over to Dow, let me remind you that we are holding a Media Review and Webcast for investors in New York on Tuesday, May 6th, details are available on our IR site. And now, here is Dow.", "Dow Wilson", "Good afternoon and welcome. For the second quarter of 2014 we generated good order growth. Revenues that came in slightly ahead of expectations and solid margins before accounting for the settlement of patent litigation. Quickly summarize our financial results for the second quarter versus the year ago periods.", "Revenues rose 1% to $779 million, our gross margin grew nearly 60 basis points to 42.2% and earnings came in at $0.88 per diluted share, including a $0.16 per share charge related to the settlement of the seven-year patent dispute with the University of Pittsburgh regarding our respiratory gating technology and our quarter ending backlog rose to $2.8 billion with the help of about $60 million in proton orders.", "Turning to operational highlights, Oncology Systems grew gross orders by 6% to $613 million with strong gains in Latin America and Australia, 3% increases in both North America and EMEA and a 3% decline in Asia, where the weaken offset constant currency growth of 3%.", "In North America, we see hospitals continuing to consolidate and hospital administrators focusing increasingly on system purchases that enabled cost efficient quality care with the best clinical practices. This is our strong suit.", "As an example we entered into two new multiyear agreements with large hospital systems to supply them with packages of accelerators, accessories, software and services, portions of these agreements were booked in the second quarter and the reminder will be booked over the five to seven-year terms of these agreements. We have more of these type deals in the sales funnel.", "In EMEA, we booked roughly half of the $51 million multi-machine Algerian order that we announced early in the second quarter. We also booked sizable orders in Italy, Spain and Switzerland.", "Subsequent to the close of the quarter we exhibited at the ASTRO meeting, Indiana, where attendance was up and where we saw heavy booth traffic with a lot of interest in our RapidPlan software and in radiosurgery solution.", "In Asia, Japan had double-digit order growth with the key win in Hiroshima and good replacement business from conversations of aging Siemens and Mitsubishi unit. We grew gross orders slightly in China. In the meantime interest in radiotherapy is rising in other Asian markets including Vietnam, the Philippine and Myanmar.", "Growth in rest of world including Latin and Australia was particularly strong during the quarter. In Brazil, we received orders for several treating unit, as well as the software systems which were outside of the 80 machine tender that we won earlier this year. We have not yet booked orders relating to this tender. Columbia, Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador were also active during the quarter. We received numerous orders in this region for our cost efficient low energy unique accelerator with RapidArc capability.", "In Australian, we received a sizeable order from Genesis care network that included 10 TrueBeams that will be delivered over the next three years. In total, TrueBeam comprised more than 60% of our high energy accelerator orders during the quarter. This product has generated more than $2.5 billion in gross orders since its introduction just four years ago.", "Siemen's replacement business contributed to our Oncology order growth in North America, EMEA and Asia, the strategic partnership has gained momentum and is working well for our business. Siemen conversations have accounting for more than $80 million in gross orders this year.", "We also landed new business in the Philippines working with Siemens. Thanks to their help, Varian will supply accelerators to the first three of eight planned radiotherapy centers at some of the country\u2019s leading hospital.", "We also made good progress during the quarter with our Edge radiosurgery offerings. We have booked nearly 100 orders for Edge, upgrades and systems. We reached an important radiosurgery milestone during the quarter when Champalimaud in Portugal commenced the world first treatment with our Edge platform.", "Champalimaud\u2019s first Edge radiosurgery patient was a 53-year woman with operable stage one non-small cell lung cancer. Physicians there also treated the 67-year-old man with two metastatic brain tumors. He received radiosurgery for both tumors in a single session that took less than 10 minutes.", "To my knowledge there is another system that matches the combined precision and treatment time of our Edge radiosurgery platform. Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit recently became the first center in the United States to commence treating patients with Edge radiosurgery.", "Turning to Oncology services, we expanded gross orders in this part of the business by 11% during the quarter. Year-to-date, service orders represented almost 40% of the total oncology gross orders.", "As was recorded earlier, we completed our acquisition of Velocity asset, including software design to help clinicians, make more informed treatment decisions by organizing patient data and making it available in one place. This acquisition supports our commitment providing clinicians with tools for data-driven clinical decision making.", "The Velocity software enabled healthcare professionals to use oncology patient images and data to plan and assess treatments, collaborate with colleagues and share clinical knowledge. We expect this to play an important part in the movement towards evidence based medicine.", "I\u2019m pleased to say that the skilled clinicians who developed this software are joining Varian to help develop and commercialize this product on a broader scale. This software is already in use at over 200 centers around the world. And we believe we can achieve faster and deeper market penetration for this product to our global sales, marketing and service network.", "Let me turn to our new imaging component segment which is comprised of our X-ray flat panel detectors to and security products. We consolidated these product lines into a single segment as a result of an organizational change that puts them under the management of Sunny Sanyal, our new Imaging Components President.", "Growth orders for this segment increased 14% to $205 million, driven exclusively by very strong demand for our panel. As we mentioned on the last call, this business benefited to some extent some catch-up orders that flipped from the first to second quarter of this fiscal year.", "X-ray equipment manufactures have designed our panel into a new C-arm surgical imaging system and new digital mammography system and into a digital radiography system that was the winner of sizable public tender in India. As sales of these systems ramp up, it should contribute to the continued growth of our panel business.", "Gross orders for X-ray tubes and security products were soft compared to the year-ago quarter. Two purchases were slowed in part due to improved quality and lifecycle. Demand for security products remains healthy but competition and pricing pressure impacted security business during the quarter.", "The company\u2019s other category which is comprised of the Varian Particle Therapy business and Ginzton Technology Center recorded growth orders of $60 million in the second quarter. The Varian Particle Therapy business booked two orders during the quarter and approximately $50 million order for a new proton installation at at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital and approximately $10 million order from the Paul Scherrer in Switzerland for technology and equipment. We look forward to additional clinical research.", "Before closing on protons, I\u2019m pleased to report that treatments are progressing at Scripps where they have permission two rooms and are treating as many as 36 patients a day for range of disease including prostate; lung; head and neck; and breast cancer. Average treatment time is 26 minutes with the faster treatment session completed in just 10 minutes.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Elisha.", "Elisha Finney", "Thanks Dow and hello everyone. While Dow has already covered growth orders, I want to briefly talk about the constant currency growth rates for the quarter. In comparing quarter-over-quarter exchange rates, the weakening of the Yen and the Aussie dollar was mostly offset by the strengthening of the Euro and other currencies.", "Oncology growth orders increased 6% in dollars and 7% in constant currency. Oncology\u2019s North American growth order was up 3% in both dollars and constant currency. EMEA growth orders increased 3% in dollars and 1% in constant currency. And in Asia, where the Yen weakened by roughly 15% quarter-over-quarter, that region was down 3% in dollars but up 3% in constant currency.", "Oncology growth orders in rest of world region including Latin America and Australia rose by 71% in dollars and 82% in constant currency. The company ended the quarter with a $2.8 billion backlog, up 2% from the year-ago quarter.", "As a reminder, both growth and net orders were shown in the consolidated segment of earnings attached to our press release. Second quarter revenues for the total company increased 1% in dollars and 3% in constant currency.", "For the first half, total company revenues were up 3% in dollars and 5% in constant currency. Oncology systems posted a 4% gain and revenues during the quarter, bringing the revenue growth for the first half to 3%.", "Imaging components posted a second quarter revenue gain of 2% with double-digit growth in our flat panel products, largely offset by declines in our security and inspection products. For the first half, imaging component revenues were up 4% from the year ago period with similar headwinds from the security and inspection business.", "Revenues for the other categories fell significantly from the year ago quarter, when we started to report revenue under percentage of completion method for both the Saudi and Russia for proton therapy project.", "Total company growth margins for the quarter, rose 57 basis points to 42.2%, driven by a smaller percentage of lower margins proton revenue. Oncology systems gross margin equaled the year ago quarter at 42.8%. For the first half, Oncology\u2019s gross margin increased nearly half a point to 43.8%.", "The imaging component gross margin for the quarter declined by 80 basis points to 41.5%, due largely to pricing pressure in X-ray tubes and volume declines in our security and inspection products. For the first half, imaging component gross margin fell 20 basis points to 41.4%.", "Second quarter SG&A expenses were $140 million or 18% of revenues, including a charge related to the $35 million Palo patent litigation settlement. Let me take a moment to walk you through the accounting for this settlement.", "The settlement expense includes $5 million that was reserved in a prior year and another $25 million or $0.16 per share expense that was booked to SG&A in the second quarter. An additional $5 million will be booked in our current third quarter on the balance sheet as a prepaid royalty that will be amortized over the next two and a half years.", "The patent settlement added approximately 3 points to SG&A as a percent of revenues in the second quarter. SG&A was further impacted by about a $5 million increase in our bad debt reserve in the quarter to reflect uncertainty in our ability to exchange our Venezuelan Bolivars that we have collected into dollars.", "Second quarter R&D expenses were $61 million or 8% of revenues, up 1 point as a percentage of revenue with the year ago quarter, as we continue to invest in our global strategies and execute on our product roadmap. For the first half, R&D expenses also rose 1 point as a percentage of revenues to 8%.", "Moving down the income statement, second quarter operating earnings totaled $128 million, down 18% from the year ago quarter. The patent litigation settlement reduced the operating margin by more than 3 points to 16.4% for the quarter.", "Depreciation and amortization totaled $15 million for the quarter and $31 million for the first half. The effective tax rate fell slightly from the year ago periods to 27.6%, with about half a point of benefit related to the patent settlement. Given the ongoing geographic mix shift of profits to outside North America, we now believe the tax rate for the full fiscal year will be approximately 28%.", "Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased from the year ago quarter to $105.4 million, due largely to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted EPS was $0.88 for the second quarter, including the $0.16 per diluted share litigation settlement charge.", "Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $939 million, debt of $469 million and stockholders\u2019 equity of $1.7 billion. DSOs, day sales outstanding at 95, was up 8 days from the year ago quarter with an approximate 10-day impact from the proton therapy business, where deferred payments terms are not yet due, but revenue has been recognized under the percentage of completion method.", "Second quarter cash flow from operations was $126 million, significantly higher than net income, primarily due to working capital increases and accrued expenses and customer deposits.", "Primary uses of cash were $159 million toward the repurchase of 2 million shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 4 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2014.", "Now back to Dow for the outlook.", "Dow Wilson", "Thank you, Elisha. The company is continuing to execute well, and our businesses remain on track to reach our fiscal year 2014 growth targets. For the fiscal year, we continue to believe that total company revenues could increase by about 6% to 8% over the prior fiscal year. We expect net earnings per diluted share for the fiscal year, including the $0.16 effect of the patent litigation settlement, to be in the range of $4.06 to $4.18. We expect total company revenues for the third quarter of fiscal year 2014 to increase in the range of 5% to 6%. We expect net earnings per diluted share for the third quarter to be in the range of $1.06 to $1.10.", "We are now ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Question, on net orders, you guys came up a little bit late versus the street [5.59% versus 5.83%] (ph) I think can you maybe just talk through some of the dynamics there and then Elisha you want to breakout net orders in oncology, North America versus international?", "Elisha Finney", "Yes. So Tycho, we had two what I would say rather unusual items in the second quarter. First because of the situation that I mentioned in Venezuela, we took roughly $5 million out of backlog relating to deals that we had previously booked there as well as we had kind of an unusual and what we believe to be one-time cancellation in flat panel of another about $5 million from both the Chinese and the Korean customer. So if you -- that said, for the first half, typically, if you look at it as a percentage of backlog, it\u2019s 3% to 5% in any given year. And if I look at the first half, we are about 4%. So if we assume the backlog will continue to grow throughout the year, I think for the full year we still have a shot at being at 3% to 5% for the year.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "And then a color, is the North American versus international split of oncology net orders?", "Elisha Finney", "So net orders, yes, and I can mark you through this quickly, I am just having to refer to my notes here. So for oncology, the geographic split was 39% in North America, 61% in international versus growth that look 42. That was net.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "And then is the momentum picking up with Siemens though, I mean you hadn\u2019t commented on the conversions picking up and so is that driving most of the growth?", "Dow Wilson", "I think we commented last quarter that we felt very good after last quarter and I would say that momentum is continuing and we are seeing good strength with Siemens globally. Frankly, we like what we see there. Now some of that was at in the product ready and we\u2019re trying to get connectivity with the product and that\u2019s good. And I think we are going doing a nice coming there, so in their hardware, but it\u2019s really kind of the story of all the software coming together and completing that capability in our product lines next to their old install base and that\u2019s all done now and we\u2019ve got some site to take people, improve statements and clinically and I think that momentum is turning now.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay. And then last one given the guidance for next quarter year-over-year becomes little bit more back end loaded, could you comment on some of gives and takes in the back half of the year. I know you previously talked about hoping for recovery in China, so what are your thoughts on that and maybe some other drivers for the back half of the recovery?", "Elisha Finney", "Sure, Tycho. The biggest driver is as we have assumed that our Maryland proton we have been talking just at the beginning of the fiscal year. It will be ready for equipment at the end of May which doesn\u2019t give us a whole of leverage there leeway there for Q3. So we moved that into assumptions as into Q4. So that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving. If you look through the settlement and my lawyer told let me do the math for you, but if you do the math, you will see that the guidance is essentially unchanged from the prior year. We simply moved Maryland into Q4 but the full year remains where it was.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay. And now you are still confident China getting better back half of the year?", "Dow Wilson", "", "No. Our funnel remains very strong. We were positive. It wasn't as biggest as we hope this last quarter, but it was still positive. We do believe we're getting some share in China. So that's good. But we do see a pretty strong second half in China.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay. Thanks. I\u2019ll hop off.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from David Roman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to maybe start with something came up in your prepared remarks regarding Brazil, I think, I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t remember you gave exact number, but you did talked about having some strong orders for proton now we are outside of the 80 unit tender you had won and that you haven\u2019t booked any orders on the tender. To what extent do you think that having the tender might be helping your access to some of the private market and your own ability to perform well in Brazil versus just general strength in the end market and the fact that you're kind of already the market leader?", "Dow Wilson", "", "Let me start by saying, we had a very good position in Brazil before the tender win. We are finally the market leader in that market. So we always had a good position in Brazil. Winning the tender has certainly helped us. It has reinforced that leadership position.", "So I think there has been maybe a little bit of a halo effect. This is the private market. I think our product is very well-positioned. We've got a very good distribution for this team down in Brazil and we think we are very well-positioned for both the short-term and the long-term.", "I guess maybe what especially given from investor point of view is the new tenders both government and non-government are not affected by the MOH, Ministry of Health pricing. So we're seeing good pricing on these other orders as well.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs", "And then maybe just go to kind of a follow-up which is just on pricing in general. Could you maybe give us some sense as to how pricing is trending globally? I mean, if I look at the gross margin, which was, I think, pretty flat, it was just flat in the quarter that would suggest to me that pricing is also pretty stable given your shifting mix of business. Maybe you just sort of help us understand pricing trends by regions specifically in Oncology?", "Dow Wilson", "", "On the quarter, well, on the half, for that matter as well, pricing has been stable. So our pricing is definitely holding and we're please about that. On the quarter, we did have -- our unit volume was up and our mix was a little more of kind of international mix, we had more unique and usual and we had a little bit more of kind of value segment mix for that. But product-to-product with year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter pricing is effecting very stable.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs", "And maybe I just sneak one more in here just on the U.S. Well, I know this market is seen some variations past several quarters around uncertainty and reimbursement and look like things are kind of coming back last quarter and I know you briefly talk about some of the issues around consolidation the U.S. where you thought that was a competitive advantage for Varian. But maybe just kind update us on your latest thought regarding the U.S. market and maybe sort of help us draw kind of the trend line to kind of transcend what's been some volatility over the past couple of quarters?", "Dow Wilson", "", "Sure. The good news is that volatility has measured in the last two quarters, sorry someone sneak here a little bit, last -- measure in the last few quarters, we've had good U.S. market performance and that's, for us have -- we had together, it's been a tough market as you said, David. But our orders on the half or very good year-to-date gross orders were up 8%, gross orders in the quarter were up 3% as we said.", "Yes, the market is consolidating and the free standing clinic market is pretty quite, but we are seeing the hospital market to be pretty aggressive. In terms of outlook, the funnel looks good and I would say, we're looking for kind of mid single-digit market growth out of U.S. and frankly that's a part of positive outlook as we\u2019ve had on that market in the long-term.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Amit Hazan of SunTrust Bank. Pleased go ahead.", "Amit Hazan - SunTrust Bank", "First, I just want to go back to the difference between growth and net orders and in quality side. I'm getting the number -- the printed number is about $54 million, which is a actually a little bit bigger than normal. I know Elisha you touched on it in the prior question, but some of that what you touched on was not inside of oncology. And in particular, if I apply kind of majority of that to the net order for the North American line, I get a pretty weak North American order number -- net order number despite a really weak comp?", "Elisha Finney", "Yes. I mean, most of the cancellations and dormancies are in North America. We did have some of the international market as I mentioned particularly in rest of world related to Venezuela this quarter. But you\u2019re going to get variability in any given quarter. I just want to come back to in terms of history, 3% to 5% of backlog is typically adjusted. You just haven\u2019t seen it really up until this point for this year, but this is very typical to what we historically have seen. Every single year it\u2019s been 3% to 5%.", "Amit Hazan - SunTrust Bank", "Can you confirm what was the change of growth rate for net orders in North America?", "Elisha Finney", "It was down slightly mid-single digit.", "Amit Hazan - SunTrust Bank", "Okay.", "Elisha Finney", "And it was up in international market. And then you get a lot of variability within the international market.", "Amit Hazan - SunTrust Bank", "Okay. Thank you for that. And just I want to ask a question about Edge, and to one of your competitors. Just kind of going -- thinking through SRS in particular, but some of your Edge related comments in the past couple of quarters, seeing one of your big competitors missed numbers due to GEMini weakness. I\u2019m just wondering if you guys can set a little bit of color on whether there is a direct link to the new imbursement changes there that happen at the end of last year to the extent what we\u2019re seeing maybe a change in the marketplace where the traditional neurosurgeon call point for a GEMini type product is now being rolled into the oncology suite. Is that helping you at all? Just any color on what\u2019s happening on the SRS side, where it kind of look from very short term numbers that you might be gaining some share?", "Dow Wilson", "No, I would say it\u2019s a combination of factors. You named the number of them, but certainly the reimbursement was helpful to get those on the same footing now as the big deal, if we were substantially lower than GEMini for reimbursement before for radio surgery and those are now reimbursed at same level. So that\u2019s one help. Two is clearly on the environment that we\u2019re in. Administrators are particularly looking at making their purchases go farther, and when you look at the number of patients and indications they can threat with Edge versus what they can threat with GEMini. Testing with the single largest trend in radiation therapy being SDRT with lung, liver and pancreas growing, it\u2019s having the flexibility and versatility of the Edge is a big deal.", "And then last of all, Edge, as I said in my prepared remarks, is the combination of the most precise and fastest delivering method to threat this indication. And it has obviously a throughput impact, but also has a patient impact. Now these patients are sick and having to in some cases, sit on a table half hour to an hour for complex treatments on Edge. They can have that completed in 10, 15 minutes and they\u2019re set to go. So I think it\u2019s really kind of combination of all those factors and I do agree. I think we are seeing some momentum there with that product from a relative little competition point of view.", "Amit Hazan - SunTrust Bank", "Okay. Thanks very much guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Jason Wittes of Brean Capital. Please go ahead.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital", "Hi, thanks for taking the question. Actually, I wanted to ask about the gross margins and specifically, Dow, I know that when I spoke to you recently, you discussed some investments being made in terms of your emerging market product offering and how that might translate into better gross margins in outer years. Can you just talk about the spend you\u2019re doing now and sort of how that might translate into the outer years margin improvement?", "Dow Wilson", "Yes. I think from an R&D point of view, we\u2019re kind of three significant areas where we\u2019re spending this increase in R&D. One is software. We think there is a big opportunity where as a market leader in Eclipse, we will continue to invest in algorithms in Eclipse and you\u2019ve seen things like RapidPlan for us, that will continue. ARIA is a terrific product. We\u2019ve had to make investments this last year for the Siemens connectivity and things like that. We continue to bring a lot of enhancements to that product and look forward really to evolving that product in the informatics space and in globalizing the product, so that\u2019s some of the investments there.", "And then for the rest of the product line, emerging markets are a big piece of our product line more and more and that's where we have a big chunk of our investment going that will yield products this year, next year and beyond. So we're investing aggressively in those areas.", "As we already, as we said on the call, we're pretty comfortable with the margin rates on the quarter and pricing holding. We continue to invest a fair amount as well in operational program to drive productivity across our business and have made pretty good progress on the variable costs of our TrueBeam platform as well as on, our cost of quality and built our X-ray component business as well as Oncology.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital", "Okay. But I guess, what I was trying to get at was, I thought there was some effort to bridge the gap between emerging market and developed markets in terms of gross margins by product mix, is that?", "Dow Wilson", "", "Absolutely. I mean, from a long-term point of view that's absolutely what we've got to do and that\u2019s -- in terms of new product, we want to deliver products that deliver what the customers want from a feature performance point of view and match our requirements, our shareholder margin point of view and so we are -- so that is where our significant piece of our investment is going.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital", "Okay. If I could just do one follow-up in terms of the U.S. market, you had mentioned that there was some consolidation I think there was some other questions about it. But you also mentioned that the funnel was strong, does that imply partially seen your guidance as well that there is going to be some backend loadedness in terms of obviously, a revenues or even order rates as well, they were held back for some of the consolidation this quarter?", "Dow Wilson", "", "As you know, we don't guide the orders and I will say that second half of last fiscal year, we had a pretty good funnel and their results weren\u2019t that great.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital", "I see.", "Dow Wilson", "So, I think part of what we're seeing is the yield on the funnel is good. So we continue to see a very good funnel, yield on the funnel recently has been good and I'll stick to the comment I made before and that is, we are kind of seeing market outlook in the -- for long-term in the mid single-digit.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital", "Okay. Fair enough. Thank you management guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Toby Wann of Obsidian Research Group. Please go ahead.", "Toby Wann - Obsidian Research Group", "Hey, good afternoon everybody. I just wanted to ask quickly, kind of, about rapid plan market adoption, kind of, how the pace of that, how that\u2019s been received both domestically and across the globe?", "Dow Wilson", "There is a lot of enthusiasm and excitement for the product. We showed it at ASTRO, of course, last year as you know. It has European introduction at ASTRO, very strong global interest. We shift the first units to customer here in eight weeks or so and kind of, official commercialization is this summer.", "So we've got lots of customers lined up for us. We think it's a game changer and it was a little color we will start with prostate model and then head and neck followed through shortly after that. And then we\u2019re onto breast cancer models and other cancers. And with the enthusiasm that we're seeing from our customer based both luminary and committee and outside of the U.S., we think this is -- this remains $700 million opportunity for us.", "Toby Wann - Obsidian Research Group", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Sias for any closing remarks.", "Spencer Sias", "Thank you very much. Thank you all for participating.

", "Spencer Sias", "Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Varian Medical Systems conference call for the third quarter of fiscal year 2014. With me are Dow Wilson, President and CEO; Elisha Finney, CFO; and Clarence Verhoef, our Corporate Controller. Dow and Elisha will summarize our results and we'll take your questions following the presentation.", "To simplify our discussion, unless otherwise stated, all references to the quarter or year are fiscal quarters and fiscal years, quarterly comparisons are for the third quarter of fiscal 2014 versus the third quarter of fiscal 2013, references to the year-to-date or for the first three quarters of the fiscal year. ", "Please be advised that this presentation and discussion contains forward-looking statements. Our use of words and phrases such as outlook, believe, can, expect, will, hope, and similar expressions are intended to identify those statements, which represents our current judgments on future performance or other future matters.", "While we believe them to be reasonable based on information currently available to us, these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of the important risks relating to our business are described in our third quarter earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this presentation and discussion because of new information, future events, or otherwise.", "Now, here is Dow.", "Dow Wilson", "Good afternoon and welcome. For the third quarter of 2014, we are reporting solid good order growth for our Imaging Components and proton businesses, some big wins in emerging markets as well as weakness in Japan for our Oncology Systems business, a 4% increase in our orders backlog, revenue and gross margin gains in all of our business segments and earnings in line with our expectations before the impairment of a portion of our existing investment in Augmenix. ", "Compare to the year ago, revenues for the company rose 3% to $748 million, and net earnings were $1.02 per diluted share. The impacts of the approximately $8 million Augmenix impairment was about $0.06 per share. ", "Oncology Systems' gross order came in at $620 million, down by 1% despite strong wins in key emerging markets including China, Latin America and in parts of Eastern Europe. Orders for Oncology were up by 2% in EMEA and about even in North America and down by 6% in Asia with a sharp decline in Japan where we faced tough year ago comparisons. Orders rose by 20% in China where we believe we are gaining market share. ", "For the BRIC countries in total, orders grew by more than 50% during the quarter. Our business in Latin America grew by more than 30% in the quarter. We continue to generate new orders in Brazil, but have not yet booked any from the 80 machine public tender conducted in the first quarter of this fiscal year. ", "In EMEA, Varian was selected to supply four TrueBeam systems for the Beatson Cancer Centre in Glasgow and its planned new satellite center at nearby Monklands hospital. We also had a key win in Germany where a hospital group placed an order to replace two of their eight Siemens machines with TrueBeam systems. This group also ordered our Eclipse treatment planning software and our ARIA oncology information software to replace their LANTIS network.", "We continue to expand our business across Africa with orders in Algeria, Morocco, Libya, Nigeria and South Africa. North America generated strong order growth for service and software, while equipment orders were soft during the quarter. We had a big win in Nebraska at the Buffett Cancer Center which ordered our Edge Radiosurgery system, our TrueBeam system as well as treatment planning and oncology information software to replace competitive products. ", "U.S. hospitals which today comprise about 90% of our North American equipment orders, we see positive reimbursement news at the end of the quarter. CMS has proposed a modest overall 2% increase in rates for calendar year 2015.", "Hospital rates would rise for both radiotherapy and radiosurgery and a proposed new bundled rate for radiosurgery remains equal, whether the treatment is delivered with a LINAC or a Cobalt unit. All those being equal, I expect that machine versatility and patient throughput will become more and more important for buyers of radiosurgery systems. ", "As an aside, a study conducted at the University of Alabama at Birmingham shows that RapidArc radiosurgery is substantially more efficient and comparable in plan quality to a competitive Cobalt system for treatment of multiple brain metastases. This study has been published online and is slated to appear in the October issue of Neurosurgery. ", "We are generally pleased with the hospital reimbursement proposal which we hope will lead to further replacement of older systems with newer higher throughput units that are capable of delivering both video therapy and radiosurgery. ", "For freestanding clinics, CMS is proposing a policy change to exclude the radiation treatment vault as a direct expense in the rate calculation. Rate reduction for conventional 3-D radiotherapy IMRT and SDRT would range between 2% to more than 6%.", "We expect that this proposed policy change will be the topic of debate between now and November when CMS finalizes the rates for next year. We are partnering with others within the industry to advocate for reversal of this policy. ", "Oncology Service was again a star performer, delivering another quarter of double-digit growth with particularly strong performance in North America. Service represented about 40% of oncology orders for the quarter and the year-to-date. ", "On the product front, we have made good progress during the quarter in our software business which was particularly strong in North America. Orders ramped up for our FullScale solution that fully integrates our ARIA information system and our Eclipse treatment planning software in the cloud for hospitals and clinics of any size. ", "Earlier today we announced the deployment of FullScale at e+CancerCare, a multi-site network of cancer clinics in the U.S. FullScale is also deployed at Vantage Oncology, a network of over 60 oncology centers. FullScale users are delighted with the speed, flexibility, scalability and accessibility of their data on smartphones and tablets, as well as computers.", "At the annual meeting of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine, or AAPM, this week, we featured several products for quality assurance and sharing clinical knowledge through data analytics.", "We exhibited a new software tool called Machine Performance Check for automating tests to help confirm that our tubing system is operating within proper parameters. It completes 18 tests in just five minutes and adds another level of competence for centers that are performing more and more sophisticated procedures.", "We also showed Qumulate, a cloud-based data management tool for quality assurance as a works in progress. Clinicians will be able to use this tool to create templates for their QA processes, identify trends in QA data and compare their machines' test performance to the average of machines at other treatment centers. By using tools like this, we expect clinicians will be able to enhance the consistency and efficiency of their treatment processes.", "Other products featured at the meeting included RapidPlan for knowledge-based treatment planning, our new Velocity tool for aggregating imaging and treatment data, and TrueBeam 2.0 which now includes enhanced image guidance and motion management capabilities to the TrueBeam platform.", "Among the presentations at AAPM was a talk by researchers from Champalimaud Center in Portugal and the Henry Ford center in Detroit confirming that our Edge radiosurgery system can target cancerous tumors with sub-millimeter accuracy. Their end-to-end testing showed that our efforts to integrate multiple subsystems can result in a high level of precision for certain radiosurgery cases.", "You may have seen a press release issued early in June about a 79-year old patient who chose RapidArc radiosurgery rather than conventional surgery for his lung cancer. He got five treatments on our TrueBeam surgery unit and each session was completed in about 10 minutes, a much easier alternative to surgery. It is both exciting and gratifying to all of us at Varian to see the dramatic improvements in treatment opportunities our innovations offer patients.", "Let me turn to our Imaging Components segment. Gross orders for this segment increased 12% to $162 million, with strong growth in panels and tubes that was partially offset by soft demand for our security products. Gross orders grew in excess of 30% in our panel business. This included a contract with a large OEM in China for 1,000 panels that will be delivered over the next two years. ", "Other X-ray equipment manufacturers are designing our panels into new imaging systems, setting the stage for continued growth in this product line. Healthy order growth in our X-ray tube product line was driven by our big OEM customers for use in CT scanners, general radiography, and mammography systems.", "We are now focused on targeting new OEMs to expand the market and we shipped a number of new X-ray tubes for evaluation by these customers during the quarter. Our Imaging Components has built its backlog, as we assign more long term contracts for both panels and tubes. ", "The company's Other category which is comprised of the Varian Particle Therapy business and Ginzton Technology Center recorded growth orders of $57 million in the third quarter.", "During the quarter, our proton team booked its third order of the fiscal year to supply our ProBeam proton therapy system at the National Taiwan University. We expect the total value of the agreement is estimated to be about $100 million including long-term operations and maintenance services. We continue to see strong customer interest and good momentum in this business which is now booked nearly $120 million in gross orders so far this year. ", "During the quarter JPMorgan assume $45 million of our approximately $125 million loan commitment to the Scripps proton project. We believe this is a mark of the growing confidence of the financial community has in our ProBeam proton solution. ", "Scripps is continuing to expand the range of cancers that it is treating with this exciting and it has completed its first pediatric treatment on a 17-year old patient from Provo, Utah. She has been affected with the tumor on her brain stem for 15 years. She had numerous surgeries to control the spread of the tumor, but doctors could not completely eradicate it because it was too close to her brain stem. Further surgeries were not recommended, so she turned to proton therapy. Her hope is that the treatment ends the tumor once and for all. We hope so too. ", "Now I will turn it over to Elisha. ", "Elisha Finney ", "Thanks, Dow, and hello everyone. While Dow has already covered gross orders, I want to briefly talk about the constant currency growth rates for the quarter. In comparing quarter-over-quarter exchange rates, the negative impact from weakening of the yen was more than offset by a positive impact from the strengthening of the euro and other currencies.", "Oncology gross orders decreased 1% in dollars and 2% in constant currency. Oncology's North American gross orders were about even with the year ago quarter in dollars and constant currency.", "EMEA gross orders increased 2% in dollars and declined 1% in constant currency. Asia, where we saw a quarter-over-quarter weakening of the yen was down 6% in dollars and down 5% from the year ago quarter in constant currency. Oncology orders in rest of world region fell by 19% in dollars and 17% in constant currency, driven by a slowdown in Australia.", "Third quarter revenues for the total company increased 3% in dollars and 2% in constant currency. Year-to-date, total company revenues were also up 3% in dollars and 4% in constant currency.", "Oncology Systems posted a 3% gain in revenues during the quarter, consistent with year-to-date growth of 3%. For the quarter and year-to-date, Oncology Service comprised about 40% of Oncology revenues. ", "Imaging Components posted a third quarter revenue gain of 2% with double-digit growth in our flat panel products, largely offset by a decline in our X-ray tube products. Revenues were impacted by improved CT tube quality that has enabled our largest customers to lower inventory levels and delay purchases.", "Year-to-date, Imaging Components revenues were up 4% from the year ago period, with double-digit growth in panels largely offset by declines in tubes and Security & Inspection products. ", "Revenues in the Other category were up slightly from the year ago quarter. Year-to-date revenues were down from the year ago period when we recorded higher revenues from multiple proton projects.", "Total company gross margin for the quarter was 43.3%, up 55 basis points from the year ago quarter. Year-to-date, total company gross margin was 43%, 58 basis points. Oncology Systems gross margin was 44.1%, up 38 basis points from the year ago quarter. Year-to-date, Oncology Systems gross margin was 43.9%, up 44 basis points. These gains are largely due to a mix shift towards higher margin software and service as well as improved quality costs.", "Imaging Components gross margin for the quarter was 42.2%, up 125 basis points from the year ago quarter, with a shift to more higher margin panel sales and significant improvements in X-ray tubes quality costs. Year-to-date, Imaging Components gross margin was 41.7%, up 29 basis points from the year ago period due largely to improved quality costs in our X-ray tubes products. ", "Third quarter SG&A expenses were $124 million or 17% of revenues. This included an approximate $8 million non-cash charge for the impairment of a portion of our existing equity investment in Augmenix. ", "As a reminder, we invested in and obtained an option to acquire Augmenix three years ago. Augmenix is today announcing additional financing from multiple investors and the expiration of our option.", "We recorded the impairment charge based on the current valuation of Augmenix. We continue to hold our minority interest in this company and see promise in their technology. ", "The impairment charge increased SG&A as a percentage of revenue by one point. Year-to-date including the patent litigation charge in the second quarter and the impairment charge in the third quarter, SG&A expenses were 17% of revenue. These unusual charges together increased SG&A as a percentage of revenue by 1.5 point. ", "Third quarter R&D expenses were $57 million or 8% of revenues, up 30 basis points as a percentage of revenue from the year ago quarter. Year-to-date, R&D expenses were also 8% of revenue, up 90 basis points from the year ago period as we continued to invest in our global strategies and execute on our product roadmap. ", "Moving down the income statement, third quarter operating earnings including the impairment charge totaled $143 million or 19.1% of revenues. Year-to-date, operating earnings as a percentage of revenues were 18.4%, down about two points from the year ago period.", "The impairment charge together with the patent litigation settlement in the second quarter accounted for 1.5 point of the two points decline in the year-to-date operating margin.", "Depreciation and amortization totaled $15 million for the quarter and $46 million year-to-date. The effective tax rate was down two points from the year ago quarter to 25.5%. And year-to-date, the effective tax rate was down about half a point to 28.1%. ", "Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased from the year ago quarter to $104.9 million, due largely to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted earnings per share was $1.02 for the third quarter. The impairment charge negatively impacted EPS in the quarter by about $0.06.", "Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $926 million, debt of $480 million and stockholders' equity of $1.7 billion. DSO at 95, was up 11 days from the year ago quarter with an approximate eight-day impact from the proton therapy business, where deferred payments terms are not yet due, but revenue has been recognized under the percentage of completion method.", "Third quarter cash flow from operations was $86 million, less than net income, primarily due to working capital increases in inventory and the payment of the Q2 patent litigation settlement.", "Primary uses of cash were $103 million toward the repurchase of 1.25 million shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 2.75 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2014.", "Now, I will turn it back to Dow for the outlook.", "Dow Wilson", "Thanks, Elisha. We realize that our guidance range for Q4 is broad, the timing of our proton therapy projects is hard predict and any one deal can have a significant impact on our financials in a given quarter. ", "We expect total company revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 to increase in the range of 7% to 15% and we expect net earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.14 to $1.29.", "We are now ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, we will conduct our question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) ", "Our first question comes from Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird. Please state the question.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Can you hear me okay?", "Dow Wilson", "Hi, Jeff. ", "Elisha Finney", "Hi.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Okay. Elisha, I wanted to start with you on the SG&A line, I appreciate that the last couple quarters there's been some non-recurring items in there, but I by exclude them including the $8 million charges this quarter, it looks like your SG&A this quarter hit and almost five-year high as a percentage of revenue definitely came in $7 million or $8 million hot relative to our expectations. So, just wondering if you could give us any insight on this SG&A costs.", "Elisha Finney", "Sure Jeff we get a lot of variability in SG&A from hedging and legal expenses and I would guesstimate it's about 60% fixed, 40% variable. I think it's better to look at year-to-date and if you come back to year-to-date as a percentage of revenue if you exclude the impairment and you exclude the University of Pittsburgh charge it's up 40 basis points.", "So, that really was -- in our expectations for the year as we've noted both on R&D and SG&A, it's the year of investment. And so we\u2019re just expanding our global operations and that's where those 40 basis points come from.", "But yes, if you look at any given quarter you\u2019re going to get variability. I think really it was more a factor of we had some proton revenue move out of the quarter and so as a percentage of revenue, it looks very high in Q3.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Okay. And that segues on to my question. I guess on the proton side, at one point you were talking about $100 million to $150 million in revenue this year. I think year-to-date you've done $23 million. So, hard to see even if you book Maryland and flow some of that revenue through that you get those targets. So, wondering maybe if you can address that? Number one.", "And number two, if the cyclotron is now in at Maryland, I thought in the past you guys a talked about you wouldn't install the cyclotron unless financing was largely in place or fully in place. And so just wondering what the hang-up is still on either finance being in place there for that order officially being booked and those profits flowing through this year into the guidance. Thank you.", "Elisha Finney", "Sure. So, Jeff let me come back to your first question. So, I think as of the last time, I had tagged it at about $125 million that we have built-in to our revenue expectations for the year. Come off that a little bit just based on Q3 is closer to call it $110 million, $115 million for the year. And you\u2019re absolutely right; there is a significant portion of this $65 million, $70 million hedging on Maryland.", "These tend to be very large projects and if a customer\u2019s date moves on when they're ready for equipment, we then obviously slowdown on building the inventory. That slows down the cost we\u2019ve incurred, which slows down the revenue. So, it's really just the timing of these can be very, very hard to predict.", "That said it is just a matter of timing. We've had none of these are proton deals fall part and we're feeling very confident about that business in general. In terms of Maryland, again, we continue to be -- we're working closely with ATT our customer there. They\u2019re making good progress. They have completed their equity financing, working with several large institutions on the debt.", "Thanks to stealing documents and it\u2019s the due diligence and the timing and the documentation, the timing is just so hard to predict, but we\u2019re absolutely committed to the viability of this project.", "We did deliver the cyclotron. We have a large almost $20 million non-refundable down payment as well as we've retained his security interest in the equipment. So, again, we felt like it was the right thing to do to keep this project moving so that we can get this center out of the ground.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "All right. Thanks. And just last question I was going to ask it, but with EBS change in the guidance by a few pennies coming down of the low end and JPMorgan taking that trench of the Scripps debt out. If memory serves that was a pretty high price debt that you guys had financed and were getting the benefit of an interest income. Does that explain the changing guidance or am I over-reading that?", "Elisha Finney", "No. It's really just one quarter that's coming out. So, it will have an impact. Hopefully, we\u2019re going to get to take that money that's indicated and redeploy it to another proton project and get our 8%, 9% interest back.", "But Jeff if I look at where we were originally, 422 to 434 because we have the midpoint in Q3, it was right where in the middle of where we expected to land. We just came off $0.02 on the high end to reflect that. And then we broaden the range for protons just given as time goes on and we're incurring more cost of these things without is just a bigger impact to revenue. So, just gave ourselves a little more breathing room on the proton business, but it had nothing really to do with the debt syndication.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Understood. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Please state your question.", "Patrick Donnelly - JP Morgan Chase & Co.", "This is actually Patrick Donnelly in for Tycho. Thanks for taking the question.", "Dow Wilson", "Hi Patrick.", "Patrick Donnelly - JP Morgan Chase & Co.", "Dow you talk about the CMS proposed rates from earlier this month and noted throughputs are going to become more important. We've also heard building discussion about clinical data. How you go about build out building clinical evidence on a different technology to show Varian is the best option? And how important do you view this?", "Dow Wilson", "Well, I think the -- first of all from an overall reimbursement point of view as mentioned in the script, we\u2019re positive about the hospital side. I think that's pretty good momentum for our market. That freestanding side as I mentioned is again we've got another year of pressure for freestanding. Largely due to a change in how the vault is calculated as an expense. And -- so between now and the final ruling on reimbursement, there will be a lot of activity around that which we will join.", "In terms of clinical data, clinical data is very, very important. I think I mentioned UAV paper that will be published here this next month on stereotactic radiosurgery in the brain that will be a very nice paper for us. That will really demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of our machine.", "And equivalency in terms of clinical outcome relative to cobalt-based brain radiosurgery. So, we're optimistic about that. I think the growing body of evidence in lung cancer is a big deal. We continue to see that grow literally almost every day. And I think that will be a theme at Astro both in the customer presentations clinical presentations at the show as well as some of the technologies that we're working on for the show.", "In proton therapy, one of the things that we're seeing is a nice demonstration, especially of the benefit of proton therapy in head and neck, that's an emerging application with good clinical data forthcoming. And I think that will help boost some of the proton therapy efforts.", "Patrick Donnelly - JP Morgan Chase & Co.", "Thanks. And can you expand a bit more on China. I know you guys expected growth to see an uptick in the second half and certainly saw that with the 20% growth number you mentioned. Maybe just talk to those dynamics and how you expect growth to trend going forward?", "Dow Wilson", "Sure, may be for just a second I can step back to the overall emerging markets. Brazil, Russia, India, China, Africa for us we're up 70% in the quarter and are up 20% year-to-date. The BRICA now including Africa is about 15% of our oncology business.", "And as I said in the script we've had double-digit growth this quarter in China, India, Eastern Europe, and Africa. Interesting in Africa, we had good orders performance in Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa, and Libya. So, we continue to seek the content move which is encouraging.", "India was up 50% for us on the quarter and 35% year-to-date. So, that's kind of a nice story overall emerging markets. China itself to get your question, we had a very good quarter. China orders were up 20%. The market appears to be recovering. We\u2019re continuing to make a pretty substantial commercialization effort in that market. So, we began in earnest in 15 or 18 months ago.", "And we have a terrific team in place right now. And I think we\u2019re really starting to make some nice headway in that market. We -- as I mentioned, the market is recovering and we also believe our share is improving in that market and we\u2019re seeing some nice success in the tender business there in China as well.", "Patrick Donnelly - JP Morgan Chase & Co.", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley", "Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions everyone. Dow I wonder if you could spend a minute talking about what you\u2019re hearing from customers in the U.S. particularly in hospitals about large equipment spending.", "Software is doing well, service is doing well, equipment is not doing as well and it\u2019s clearly the on-market issue. Can you give us a sense for what you\u2019re hearing from the hospitals about how they\u2019re thinking about budgets and how they\u2019re evolving? What the impact of ACA has been so far this year? And your general thoughts on the market in North America? Thanks. ", "Dow Wilson", "You know, I would say the -- we continue to hear some of the things that we talked about continued consolidation of the market, people moving to more regional integration on the full provider side, hospital and non-hospital. So we are seeing regional consolidation there.", "I think we've talked about the fact that deals are getting larger and more complex as a result. It does slow down a little bit the purchasing process. Freestanding market, as I mentioned in the script, is very quiet and an uncertain reimbursement environment. And I think that will continue on the hospital side.", "Still very bullish about radiation therapy and the strong are investing and figuring out how to strengthen themselves. We see a continued attention given to total cost of ownership. I think that underscores our capability. We have the most versatile machine out there, and that people will look especially at cost of -- lifecycle ownership of their radiation therapy, we're very favorably positioned.", "I'd say at a very high level hospitals are looking very hard at their capital budgets and we are -- there's been a lot of conversations about where the budgets goes. But I think still very favorable outlook in hospital market towards radiation therapy.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley", "Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. Actually piggybacking on your comment about large orders, Elisha, have you given people a sense at this point for how the backlog in Oncology has evolved in terms of what fraction of the backlog is comprised of these large multi-year orders?", "Elisha Finney", "Not really, Steve. I mean, we do have several orders that have been announced that we have not yet booked. I mean, Brazil, obviously being the largest one in there or several in North America as well. So, we have very strict order booking guidelines. So if it doesn\u2019t have a two-year delivery window, it doesn\u2019t go into backlog. And if it's contingent on financing, it does go into backlog.", "I think one thing, if you look at Oncology on a net basis in the quarter and year-to-date up 2%, so slightly different, I think we've gotten through a lot of the removable of these freestanding cancer centers where we had issue the last several quarters.", "I just don\u2019t have it quantified, but we have several of these large deals that have not met the order booking guidelines as of today.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley", "Got it. And Elisha could we get the percentage of net oncology orders that was North America?", "Elisha Finney", "That was North America was -- yes, up 6% on a net basis.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley", "Perfect. Thanks so much everyone.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you again. Good afternoon. I wanted to come back to the guidance, make sure I understand what's implied in the 7%to 15% number for the fourth quarter. Am I reading this correctly that 7% basically excludes that $65 million and the 15% inclusive, that\u2019s basically the delta that I'm getting high to low?", "Elisha Finney", "Yes, David roughly. But don\u2019t hold me to an absolute dollar amount. But, yes, we would be at the high-end if we get the Maryland deal. We will be towards the low end if we don\u2019t. So that\u2019s kind of how -- that\u2019s why we are putting this -- it's just such a big number on a single deal that we felt like we have to give you the full range.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs", "That\u2019s perfectly understood. And then just as you think about the low end of the range, you haven\u2019t put a 7% growth number now and in basically since the second quarter of fiscal 2013. What are you seeing in the business that gives you confidence in seeing that acceleration in the fourth quarter, ex-proton, particularly when I look at the gross order numbers in the fourth quarter of last year being fairly sharply down year-over-year? ", "Elisha Finney", "Yeah. Well, again, I come back to, it's just a detailed look at what's in backlog and the fact that our service business continues to grow, our flat panel business which are short cycle businesses, which we saw very strong order growth in Q3 from both of those product lines, it's just coming back to what we expect to deliver out of backlog.", "Oncology in terms of revenue has been spot on this year from forecast on looking at the backlog and what the revenue is going to be. So, I hear you, I understand you. But what it means is its still for 4% for Oncology for the year. So it's not like we are seeing huge high-single digit growth year-over-year. It's just how the quarters play out.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs", "Got it. And the last just on the imaging business, because that\u2019s been a really strong franchise for you, and maybe you could just go into little bit more detail on the comment you made on revenues impacted by, I think you said, improved CT quality.", "And maybe just how we should think about that in the context of the business on a go forward basis and if you think that\u2019s going to have any appreciable impact relative to the strong growth rate we've seen over the past several quarters?", "Dow Wilson", "Maybe I can talk about the overall business and Elisha can talk about the two quality piece. Overall, first half of this year we had a little lighter growth rate, so we were really pleased to see the higher growth rate in Imaging Components business this quarter. Tubes were up 14%, flat panel was up 34% and then our security was quite substantially, so overall we were up 12%.", "We continue to see digitization driving the flat panel piece. So we think that that growth will continue. On the tube quality side, one there is improvement in tube quality it tends to drive one time or gradual one-time adjustments in order rates. And I think that\u2019s what we've seen from some of our big customers, is that we've executed nice tube, it helps on a margin rate side. But it causes things to slow down little bit on the order rate side.", "We might have another quarter of that -- two quarters of that as we go forward. But I think we will see it anniversary and move forward.", "Elisha Finney", "Yeah, and I would say, the tubes are just lasting significantly longer. So I think we are building some customer loyalty and satisfaction. And as Dow said, the gross margin the quarter was up 125 basis points, driven almost exclusively by -- and the tube margins were up I think 5 points in the quarter. So it does -- it hurts us on the revenue line, but it comes back at the gross margin level.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful perspective. Thank you.", "Dow Wilson", "And it makes us tough to compete with. It makes tough to get out of there. So tube-like is good. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Hazan with SunTrust. Please state your question.", "Amit Hazan - SunTrust", "Hey, good afternoon guys. Can you hear me okay?", "Dow Wilson", "Yeah.", "Amit Hazan - SunTrust", "Great. Let me just start with a softer one first. I want to maybe ask on the software in U.S. market share side in particular. I wanted to be careful on how I asked because I know every company likes to say they are gaining share that Oncology is really no exception to that. But I want to try to understand what you are doing on the software side and on the Oncology IT side, maybe in particular FullScale and maybe RapidArc and things like that, new offerings. ", "If that visibly helped you gain system market share at all yet, be it competitive conversion, the Greenfield units, and if you kind of how you see that going forward as well. How important the factor is that in the market right now?", "", "Dow Wilson", "I would say it's helping us. We've always had a very strong position in treatment planning, our introduction of RapidArc really strengthen that business five year ago. The continued strength of our algorithms, our capabilities in treatment planning is a nice differentiator for us in the marketplace and we are demonstrating a leadership for there for sure. ", "The ability to deliver the physician prescription in there and they just want to know that it happens, the QA happens, the delivery happens and then the record and verify and interaction with the EMR, all happens the way it's supposed to. That\u2019s really what the physician wants to care about, that\u2019s all seamless and integrated.", "And I think we've got a very good position there. And I think that we are starting to see -- I think we've always had some benefit in treatment planning and we are starting to see some benefit from our Oncology Information System, our ARIA product as well as it impact hardware sales.", "So, as I said in the script, we think our share in North America is up a little bit. So, to answer your question directly, I think that\u2019s part of it FullScale. People really like the virtualization of FullScale, going to the private cloud is a big deal, we've seen that in front of our large accounts.", "We are starting to see that in kind of the next tier of accounts, folks you have 5 to 15 centers. I'd say the early adoption of FullScale has been folks that have -- customers that have more than a dozen accelerators. And what we've seen is that virtualization is driving our productivity story and our credibility story and I think we've got a nice position.", "We've launched the product in China. It's not just helping us in the U.S., its helping us outside of the U.S. and we've got teams across the globe getting very excited about it and customers, I think, are taking notice.", "Amit Hazan - SunTrust", "It just -- two more quick questions. One, to follow-up on the orders comments in North America. And I had the similar question last quarter and I think it's pretty important to ask it again. From Oncology orders in North America, if I remove the service component from the quarter, it implies the non-service side, the unit side. It would be down way into the double-digits on what frankly was another not so hard comp.", "So just trying to put that in context with your commentary, especially into quarter that you are seeing signs of recovery in the North American market, just does not seem to be the case in any way from the numbers that you are reporting on the actual system side.", "So, I'm just trying to reconcile there was commentary that -- especially in your slide presentation which was your actually putting up in terms of unit -- implied unit numbers into North American market.", "Elisha Finney", "Yeah, so let me bring you back year-to-date again. I think it's more reflective of what's going on in the market and you get such volatility in any given quarter. Year-to-date North America is up 5%, international is up 2%. ", "So it is true that the service year-to-date is up in the low-teens, so 13%, which means the rest of Oncology is down 1% to 2%. Service is driving the growth. So, yes, the rest of the business is down, but nowhere near double-digit. It's 1% or 2% year-to-date.", "Amit Hazan - SunTrust", "Okay. Fair enough. And then last one, still I have that -- this question at this point. I mean, I thought you guys are long time, I think during that time in terms of your ability to forecast revenue and earnings and then hitting or beating those targets, I've kind of witnessed, which is kind of a rather significant change between the Varian of several years ago that literally never missed the number.", "And the Varian of today that I think it missed at least one number and more than half of the last quarter in the last couple of the years, I realized a lot of things going on and there is huge FX factor out there that\u2019s out of your control, that\u2019s hurt you in quarters in the last couple of years.", "But I think maybe it\u2019s a proper time to ask you, what you think has changed within the company to cause that? And what you're doing maybe to change that, to be able to forecast more accurately and go back to maybe the Varian of old?", "Elisha Finney", "Yeah, so -- and I don\u2019t want to come up across defensive that I'm going to just start with we hit the high-end of our range in Q1, we hit the high-end of our range in Q2, we hit the midpoint of our range in Q3. So year-to-date, let's call it up a $0.01 from the range that we've given. ", "In a word, Amit, it's proton. As the revenue starts to come to fruition in these proton deals, it is almost impossible on the timing. So that\u2019s why we are trying to guide with and without proton. It is just extremely difficult to predict with accuracy. So hear you, the sales mess was entirely proton in the third quarter, and, again, why we are putting this broad range on Q4 and the year. ", "There is no change in how we are forecasting. I mean, the business is bigger, its complex. We have more software, which means we are trying to tie in exceptions. It's just a nature of the beast. But our forecasting, we try and go into is absolute much detailed as we can.", "Dow Wilson", "Yeah, and I would just echo that. The core business, our processes haven\u2019t changed. If anything they\u2019ve improved. And to at least Elisha's timing issue if Linac moved one day outside of the quarter that\u2019s basically a $0.01 share for us. So I think we've done really good job of managing our overall earnings and EPS forecasting.", "Now, the revenue forecasting with protons is where it gets tough and that\u2019s what we had missed this quarter. ", "Amit Hazan - SunTrust", "Fair enough. I appreciate the commentary. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Petron with Jefferies. Please state your question.", "Anthony Petron \u2013 Jefferies", "Thanks guys and good afternoon. So how are you there? Just to start on Oncology for a second there. Dow, your comments last quarter talking about large orders that we initially signed with hospitals in the U.S., some of those Lenexa potentially could have booked this quarter and next quarter.", "I'm just wondering if there is an update on -- actually if there was any orders that were signed in the fiscal second quarter that would book this quarter and how should we be thinking about that for the fourth quarter?", "Dow Wilson", "I think we -- as we mentioned last quarter, we continue to see large orders and yes we do see some move from quarter-to-quarter, but I think at this point now it equal. What moved from last quarter into this quarter and moves from this quarter into next quarter are different ones. So we do look at every one of these very hard.", "But I would say in any given quarter depending on the size of an order it can move the number around, and that we don\u2019t guide to orders and its maybe predictability of orders forecasting a little bit tougher.", "But we do continue to see large orders. These large orders contain complex equipment with multiple-year deliveries and little more complexity on that side of the order as people consolidate a couple of years' worth of purchases together, and then across multiple sites.", "So we are seeing that. Yeah, in any given quarter it maybe goes one direction or the other. I think at this point it\u2019s at least coming into Q4. Yeah, there were some orders that we thought we would have booked at the end of Q3, we'd love to have them. Now they're going to happen in Q4. Those are going to be incremental to our number in Q4. I can look you in the eye and tell you one way or the other.", "Anthony Petron \u2013 Jefferies", "Right, right. And maybe just a quick follow-up and then a move over to proton. So is it safe to say your book-to-bill, clearly, has extended here the book-to-bill cycle. But is there any maybe number around about how much that\u2019s actually extended?", "Dow Wilson", "I think it\u2019s hard to tell, because of the continued globalization of the business. I'd say in the U.S. we probably are seeing the book-to-bill extend a little bit. But outside of the U.S., tender driven business -- once the tender is done people want their equipment.", "Now, I haven't done the analytics, but I would say on balance its probably haven\u2019t changed that much. Elisha, any change to that?", "Elisha Finney", "No, I think that\u2019s correct.", "Anthony Petron \u2013 Jefferies", "And then just round that with protons just to stay on that -- the lumpiness. Maybe Dow and/or Elisha, can you maybe give in a little bit as to actually where you are actually seeing the delays? I know these are complicated construction projects. These project delays are they financial delays or maybe something else that we are just not seeing from the outside looking in?", "Elisha Finney", "No, it just have to do with the timing of the projects. So if a date gets delayed when they are equipment by a quarter, then we are not going to build as much inventory quite as fast. And so we are not incurring the cost.", "If we are waiting on a gantry that we purchased to deliver to go into our cost structure and that gantry hits in one quarter versus the other, it's just everything about protons is small number, great big dollar. And it just moves us from one quarter to the next.", "Anthony Petron \u2013 Jefferies", "And last one on proton and I will jump back in. Is -- we've been hearing a lot about single vault systems and you guys had the FDA approval for ProBeam. So was that playing out there in the marketplace? Is there more of a discussion on price and or some of these contracts maybe slowing down because they are considering single vault units et cetera. But maybe a little bit of color there would be helpful. Thanks. ", "Dow Wilson", "Yeah, I think the -- we've had pretty good year so far. We've booked three systems this year. There is -- we are competing on a large number of projects. So we continue to feel poorly bullish that the proton business can be $200 million to $300 million business for us. There is noise about compact machines. We have our own probing the compact machine. We've got several customers looking at that machine. It has several advantages. It's the only compact machine on the market with full 360 degree rotational gantry capability and it's got the best intensity modulated proton therapy capability which over at the PT cog, the Proton Therapy Meeting in Shanghai last month that was all the news.", "It felt a little bit like to 2000, 2001 and IMRT. And we feel very good about our position with that capability and a short version is the feedback from customers is multi-room or single room, don't want to do proton therapy with outstanding capability.", "And -- so we feel great about our position there. We have not seen a lot of growth in that compactor room market yet. There's others that got some early share maybe a year or two ago, but there hasn't been a big increase in recent orders because people want scanned beam technology and until there\u2019s scanned beam option in that market, it\u2019s not going to grow and that's why we feel very good about our position. We do have scanned beam capability with that probing compact product. And we\u2019re in discussions with a few customers about worldwide about taking on that product. ", "Anthony Petron \u2013 Jefferies", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with ISI Group. Please state your question.", "Vijay Kumar - ISI Group", "Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess my first one, Dow, you guys have been talking about this replacement cycle in the U.S., so can you just sort of talk to us because I think some of the signs that we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re seeing utilization pick up. I think some of the commentary from to hospitals is sounding more positive. They do you feel like the pursing to loosening up. So, if these trends were to play out, do you feel like the replacement cycle is finally going to happen and can be get more comfortable more positive on the timing?", "Dow Wilson", "I think the challenges the freestanding market. The hospital replacement market, I think as we said, there is now 90% of our oncology orders is the U.S. hospital market. The freestanding centers as a percentage of installed base, it's a strong third of the U.S. installed base. And they are not replacing. That replacement market is very, very quiet.", "And until we see some movement there, I think -- the good news is the hospital market is moving and we're seeing some nice action on the hospital side. But we\u2019re -- that's not enough to offset the one-third of the installed base that's the freestanding market. And that one third is at least at this point very quiet replacement cycle.", "I think the that to happen, we would need to see some movement in reimbursements and as I mentioned in the call that's why there's a lot of consensus and activity going on around getting this vault calculation back in the reimbursement scenario for freestanding customers.", "Vijay Kumar - ISI Group", "That was helpful, and maybe one for Elisha. You guys have probably been one of the most balanced cap room -- very shareholder friendly. You've done all the actions right. And so I guess if you\u2019re looking at this new environment right Elisha to Dow's point, if the freestanding centers remain anemic, what else can you do from the balance sheet capability like have you guys thought about additional avenues, create shareholder value.", "Elisha Finney", "VK, I'm not exactly where sure you're going with this. We\u2019re using our balance sheet strategically to go in and offer financing and it's on a fairly limited basis. We don't want to go crazy with this.", "When we can win business by offering terms in a zero interest rate environment, we\u2019re doing that. I think we've got the ability to step-up a lot more in terms of our proton financing. I don't know that we\u2019ll do like we did at Scripps on our first one when we essentially financed at all until it was built or the vast majority.", "But I do anticipate that we\u2019re going to participate in these proton projects to some extent going forward. We\u2019ll continue to spend more than our cash flow from operations in the U.S. on share repurchase.", "We've got 1 million to 2 million shares per quarter and I think you should expect that at least in the short-term that should continue. But if you were going -- because I don't think we\u2019re going to actually buy or invest in customer-centered and then be competing with our other customers.", "Vijay Kumar - ISI Group", "Got it. And maybe if I could speak one last one in. On the tax rate Elisha what are your thoughts longer-term tax structure?", "Elisha Finney", "Well, we've been able to bring the tax rate down over the last several years by I don\u2019t know 50 basis points to 100 basis points a year. Right now it\u2019s going to kind of depend in the short-term on whether this R&D tax credit gets extended or not.", "But as we\u2019re selling more international all things equal that helps on the tax rate. So, I think for the fiscal year, we\u2019ll be around 28%. If I look back several years ago, we were in the low to mid-30. So, we\u2019re taking down as we become more and more international all things equal.", "Vijay Kumar - ISI Group", "Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jason Wittes with Brean Capital. Please state your question.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC", "Hi, thanks for fitting me in. I wanted to ask about proton revenues and recognition. I think what you said earlier was roughly beginning of your thinking about $100 million to $150 million of proton revenue this year and I think assuming looking at Maryland it\u2019s going to fall in the $110 million to $115 million range. Does that mean that roughly $20 million to $25 million or so revenues that we should have seen this year was just getting pushed into next year, mainly because of project delays and things like that? That's the right way to think about it?", "Elisha Finney", "Yes.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC", "And I mean specifically which projects, I assume everything that's ongoing right now has seen some kind of small delay and that's what's contributed to this?", "Dow Wilson", "We\u2019ve got eight or nine in the backlog and I\u2019d say four or five are impacting the number.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC", "Four and five that are basically started construction?", "Dow Wilson", "Yeah, started to recognize revenue. ", "Elisha Finney", "Recognize, yeah.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC", "Okay. And then it sounds like with some refinancing from Scripps, you can use that for of the projects and perhaps even like a Maryland use that to push -- get them over the gap in terms of financing and then recognize revenues. Is that a reasonable assumption to look at it that way?", "Elisha Finney", "That is a distinct possibility. And if you should assume that on -- we will likely be in the facility at some level. But not -- I don't expect at this point that we would be a majority participant.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC", "It sounds like that would be enough potentially to bridge them over the gap and allow you to recognize revenue hopefully.", "Elisha Finney", "Hopefully.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC", "Hopefully, fair enough. And then I just wanted to ask about -- I read your comments -- I think your commentary was pretty accurate pretty much in line with everybody else is thinking in terms of reimbursement.", "The hospitals look like they are up slightly. The freestanding clinics again took a hit. I guess the question is I assume that will basically stall anything going on as a freestanding clinics in purchasing until things are decided November, but also to we have a risk--", "Dow Wilson", "Jason the only thing I'd say that does not stalls anything, because it's already installed.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC", "I was going to put the distinction and that's a fair -- I agree with that. But curious if there's something in the backlog that could potentially be written down as we saw at the beginning of last year or the end of last year. Just because there may be a big contract in there that could be impacted by-- ", "Dow Wilson", "We look at a very hard every quarter now. We\u2019re very comfortable with our order booking guidelines.", "Elisha Finney", "I can't predict cancellations. That should something we have to take as they come.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC", "Fair enough. And then just one last question on Proton. There was a question about single room centers which appear to be emerging. I guess if you look over the next two years, do you see them playing an important role in the market itself or do you still think that the focus is going to be in the larger three or five room centers?", "Dow Wilson", "I think focus is going to be -- link this to previous question is going to can you demonstrate the clinical evidence to the advantage of proton therapy and to really get that you need good intensity modulated proton therapy. And therefore, you got to have hand beam technology and that's what people are going to be looking at.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC", "Okay, that's fair. I appreciate that. Okay. Thanks a lot guys. I appreciate it.", "Dow Wilson", "We have time for one more question. We\u2019re over the top. But I'm sorry we couldn't get to everybody, but this will be the last question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question today comes from Jeremy Feffer with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please state your question.", "Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.", "Good afternoon guys, thank you for squeezing me in. Most of my questions have been answered. I will just ask this one follow-up to a previous question about service versus systems within oncology. You mentioned system is being down, is that more units or come in a little bit on the pricing dynamics going on?", "Elisha Finney", "It's really more a reflection of units. The pricing is a hard question to answer because for instance if it's a TrueBeam versus a unique it's very, very different pricing. But I would say apples-to-apples, machine-to-machine pricing is holding.", "Dow Wilson", "You can see that in the margin rate.", "Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.", "Okay. And so last one -- squeeze last one in. You talked about this obviously is an investment year. I know we're not talking about 2015 guidance just yet, I\u2019m just wondering how we think about I guess in general terms margin performance going forward. Can we expect small bits of leverage obviously correcting for variations in proton, but just in the core business, can be expect some -- little margin expansion over time?", "Dow Wilson", "In 90 days.", "Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.", "I want to know now.", "Elisha Finney", "Not guidance Jeremy, but I mean I\u2019d we\u2019re going to try and manage to get a small amount of leverage. We're kind of at the top when it comes to our EBIT margin relative to the medical device space. And so -- but we\u2019re going to manage for incremental improvement. But generally by growing corporate expenses slower than we grow the topline.", "Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.", "Okay. Appreciate that. Thank you very much.", "Dow Wilson", "Thanks all. Thank you for participating. A replay of this call can be heard on the Varian Investor website at www.varian.com/investor. It will be archived there for a year.

Thank you, Mr. Sias. You may begin.", "Spencer Sias - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Varian Medical Systems conference call for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014. With me are Dow Wilson, President and CEO; Elisha Finney, CFO; and Clarence Verhoef, our Corporate Controller. Dow and Elisha will summarize our results and we will take your questions following the presentation.", "To simplify our discussion, unless otherwise stated, all references to the quarter or year are fiscal quarters and fiscal years, quarterly comparisons are for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.

Details are posted on your Investor Relations website. We hope to see you there.", "And now, here is Dow.", "Dow Wilson - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Spencer and welcome everyone. We are reporting mixed results for the fourth quarter of 2014 with strong gross orders growth, but earnings that fell short of our expectations for two primary reasons. Earnings were $1.02 per diluted share. We did not book the Maryland Proton Therapy Center project, which would have added $0.17 per diluted share and we had $0.09 per share diluted share impact from an unusually high increase in our tax rate. Elisha will explain this in more detail later.", "Now, let me summarize the rest of the quarter. We are reporting strong gross orders growth in our Oncology Systems business with several major wins in North America and Europe and continued double-digit strength in emerging markets. Healthy order growth, but flat revenues in our Imaging Components business. Total company backlog, up 10% at $3.2 billion, including an 8% gain in our core businesses. Revenues of $812 million, up 5% from the year ago quarter. Gross margin is down on Oncology Systems and up in Imaging Components and continued investment in R&D and SG&A to support our product roadmap and global expansion.", "Oncology Systems gross orders grew 9% to $918 million for the quarter. Gross orders for oncology grew 11% in North America aided by multi-system network wins at several customers. We also saw one of the strongest ever quarters in Canada. Performance in North America was helped by the sale of integrated systems combining linear accelerator software and stereotactic radiotherapy and radiosurgery offerings. Our oncology gross orders grew 4% in EMEA during the quarter, with significant wins in the UK, Switzerland, France, Germany and Italy.", "We were particularly strong in the UK, where we were selected to supply 8 TrueBeams and a full suite of software to Guy\u2019s and St. Thomas Hospital in London. Just a year after the UK National Health System supply chain ordered 20 TrueBeams, we received an order for a further 10 TrueBeams demonstrating the strong demand for this system among the country\u2019s hospitals. We also saw orders for our first two Edge radiosurgery systems in the UK, which will be installed at the Clatterbridge Center for Oncology near Liverpool.", "Other highlights in our EMEA region included orders for our first 2 TrueBeams in Bulgaria and 12 TrueBeams ordered by a large customer in India. Our team in India generated strong gross order growth for the quarter and for the year. Total orders for BRICA territories including Brazil, Russia, India, China and Africa grew by about 35% during the quarter with particular strength in Brazil and India. BRICA orders were up by 25% for the year.", "In Brazil we booked more than $30 million of the major Brazilian Ministry of Health tender that we are awarded a year ago helping the Latin America region to grow by more than 60% during the quarter. Even without orders from the Brazil tender, gross orders from Latin America were up by 10%. We continued to make progress in China with strong unit volume growth and the mix shift towards lower cost units in hospitals that are striving for more cost efficient care. Our global oncology service business continued to see double-digit growth with gross orders increasing 11% for the quarter and 12% for the full year. Overall machine volume rose significantly during the quarter, which will expand our installed base and set the stage for continued growth.", "Service was 40% of the total oncology revenue for both the quarter and the year. It\u2019s been trending up as a percentage of total oncology business and we expect that this will continue. Software was the highlight of our exhibit this year at ASTRO in September where we featured new cloud based software and data analytics tools that we believe create the opportunity to double our software business over the next few years. We believe data analytics is the next frontier for our software business. Our customers are excited about the potential of mining their data for better decision-making and improved clinical outcomes. We had more than 900 attendees at our users meeting at ASTRO and there was tremendous interest in our new software tools. These products included full-scale cloud based oncology information system for remotely managing clinical information and treatment planning data with greater cost efficiency. We recorded more than $20 million in gross orders during the year with this product.", "InSightive analytics, our new interactive dashboard that enables clinicians to aggregate, organize and present data from their operations for more informed decision making. Customer interest in this product at ASTRO was tremendous. Velocity, for consolidating and compiling historical patient images and treatment data from numerous sources to guide clinicians in the next treatment decision for the patient. And RapidPlan, our knowledge-based treatment planning tool for enhancing the quality and efficiency of treatment planning, orders for this product were up sharply in the fourth quarter. Each of these products is priced at over $100,000.", "Let me turn now to our imaging components segment. Gross orders for this segment increased 16% to $234 million. This was driven mainly by a more than $40 million order for security and inspection products that we expect to deliver over the next two years. Orders for our X-ray tubes grew in mid-single digits in the quarter but were down for the year. We continued to push for the new OEM customers during quarter, while working to broaden the range of tubes we can offer as well as the markets we serve. Panel gross orders were up in low-double digits for the fiscal year, but down for the quarter versus the tough year ago comparison. During the quarter we made our first shipments of integrated panels and software for a veterinary imaging system.", "The company\u2019s other category which is comprised of the Varian Particle Therapy business and the Ginzton technology center recorded gross orders of $3 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year gross orders for this segment were $120 million, up substantially from the previous year. Customer financing at the Maryland Proton Project was not sufficiently completed to enable us to book an order for that project during the quarter. We expect to book this deal when customer financing is completed and we will announce it at the appropriate time. As of the end of the year our backlog included booked orders for proton therapy projects in Saudi Arabia, Russia, Cincinnati, Taiwan and the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland. The script installation San Diego was essentially complete and is now generating service revenue. In addition to Maryland proton contracts not yet financed or booked include proton centers in Atlanta and in Dallas.", "Now I will turn it over to Elisha.", "Elisha Finney - Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks Dow. Following Dow\u2019s lead, I am going to begin with a little more detail on the two significant items that impacted earnings in the quarter. As Dow mentioned we did not book an order for the Maryland Proton Therapy Center because our customer financing was not sufficiently completed by fiscal year end. Consequently we did not record an estimated $70 million in revenue for the project in the quarter, which would have added about $0.17 per share to our earnings. Earnings for the quarter were negatively impacted by about $0.09 per diluted share as a result of an increase in the annual effective tax rate.", "For the first three quarters of the fiscal year, our estimated annual tax rate was about 28%. We ended the year with a rate closer to 30% with the full impact of the change resulting in a 6 point increase in the fourth quarter tax rate. The increase in the tax rate was caused by two primary factors. First, the dollar strengthened significantly right at the end of September, which led to a currency fluctuation impact on our taxes of approximately $0.06 per diluted share. Secondly, taxes were also about $0.03 per diluted share higher than anticipated, because the Maryland project was not formed.", "With that, let me begin my normal walkthrough of the constant currency growth rate as well as the P&L and balance sheet for the quarter. Currency exchange rates had virtually no impact on overall gross orders and revenues versus the year ago quarter principally because the euro and yen offset each other. Oncology gross orders for the quarter increased 9% in both dollars and constant currency. Oncology\u2019s North American gross orders were up 11% in dollars and up 12% in constant currency. EMEA gross orders increased 4% in dollars and 2% in constant currency due to the strengthening of the euro quarter-over-quarter. Asia, where we followed slight weakening of the yen, was down 3% in dollars and down 1% in constant currency. Oncology gross orders in the small rest of world market grew by about 45% in dollars and constant currency.", "Turning to the P&L, fourth quarter revenues for the total company increased 5% in both dollars and constant currency. And for the full year, total company revenues were up 4% in both dollars and constant currency. Oncology Systems posted a 6% increase in revenues during the quarter, with revenues split roughly 47% in North America and 53% outside North America. For the full year, oncology revenues rose 4% to $2.3 billion with a similar geographic split. Service revenues rose 11% in the quarter and 9% for the year accounting for 40% of total oncology revenues.", "Imaging Components posted fourth quarter revenue equal to the year ago period, with 6% gains in flat panels offset by declines in the x-ray tube and security and inspection products. For the year, Imaging Components revenues increased 3%, with 9% growth in panels partially offset by declines in tubes and security and inspection products. And revenues in the other category increased by 30% to $22 million for the quarter. Annual revenues were $45 million, down 6% from the prior year. Total company gross margin for the quarter was 41.9%, down 79 basis points from the year ago quarter largely due to a higher mix of proton business.", "For the full year, total company gross margin was 42.7%, up 22 basis points from the last year. Oncology Systems fourth quarter gross margin was 42.6%, down 36 basis points from the year ago period due largely to product and geographic mix. For the full year, Oncology Systems gross margin was 43.6%, up 23 basis points from last fiscal year with favorable product mix.", "Imaging Components gross margin for the quarter was 43.7%, up 88 basis points from the year ago period due to higher panel volumes product cost reductions and improved cost of quality. For the full year, Imaging Components gross margin was 42.2%, up 43 basis points from last year, with a higher mix of panel shipments as well as productivity gains in tubes.", "Fourth quarter SG&A expenses were $122 million or 15% of revenues, up more than 0.5 point from the year ago quarter due to our continued investments to expand our global infrastructure. We also incurred higher sales and bonus incentives associated with the strong orders growth. For the year, SG&A expenses rose 1.5 points to 16% of revenues with about 1 point of the increase due to the University of Pittsburg patent litigation settlement and the impairment of a portion of our investment in Augmenix.", "First quarter R&D expenses were $59 million or 7% of revenues even as a percentage of revenue with the year ago quarter. For the full year R&D expenses were $235 million or 8% of revenue, up more 0.5 point as a percent of revenue as we continued to invest in our product roadmap. Fourth quarter operating earnings totaled $159 million or nearly 20% of revenues, down a little more than a point due to the lower gross margin and higher SG&A spending. For the full fiscal year, the operating margin was 19% of revenues, down 2 points from the previous year with 1 point due to the (indiscernible) and Augmenix charges. The other 1 point decline in operating margin for the year was due to higher spending in R&D and SG&A to support global growth consistent with our year of investment strategy.", "Depreciation and amortization totaled $18 million for the quarter and $64 million for the fiscal year. The effective tax rate for the fiscal year was 29.7%, which led to a 33.9% tax rate for the fourth quarter. Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased from the year ago quarter to 103.5 million due largely to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted EPS was $1.02 for the fourth quarter and $3.83 for the fiscal year including a $0.22 impact from the patent settlement and Augmenix impairments.", "Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $849 million, debt of $438 million and stockholders equity of $1.6 billion. DSO at 85 was equal to the year ago quarter and improved 10 days from the third quarter with strong collections and higher revenues. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was about $200 million significantly higher than net income due to working capital improvements. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was about $456 million. The primary use of cash was $210 million for the repurchase of 2.5 million shares of stock. At the end of the quarter we had 6 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2015.", "Now I will turn it back over to Dow for the outlook.", "Dow Wilson - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Elisha. Fiscal 2014 was the year of investments aimed to stimulate long-term top line growth for the company and we have made good progress. We are focusing now on restoring our more normal operating expense levels to maintain margins and improve earnings growth. In the first quarter of fiscal 2015 we expect to take a restructuring charge of an estimated $13 million or $0.09 per diluted share to realign and reduce our staff levels through programs including an enhanced retirement plan. For fiscal year 2015 we expect revenues for our Oncology Systems and Imaging Components businesses as well as proton orders currently in backlog to grow in the range of 5% to 6%. Included the $0.09 per diluted share restructuring charge, earnings for the company should be in a range of $4.15 and $4.26 per diluted share.", "Our guidance excludes contracted proton projects that are not yet financed or booked into backlog. If these projects are booked during the year, the potential upside in revenues and profits could be significant. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2015, we expect combined revenues from our Oncology Systems and Imaging Components businesses as well as proton orders currently in backlog to grow by zero to 2%. Earnings per diluted share for the total company including the expected $0.09 per diluted share restructuring charge should be in the range of $0.76 to $0.80.", "We are now ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Robert Baird. Please proceed with your question.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "Thank you. Good evening guys. How are you?", "Dow Wilson", "Yes.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "So we are 20 minutes into the call and you guide \u201915 \u2013 I don\u2019t know $0.50 below the street and I haven\u2019t really heard an explanation, I guess I\u2019m confused, very confused where the 2015 EPS guidance and maybe a bridge to that, Elisha, if I look at the street at $4.74 granted, maybe some of those included Maryland, my number included Maryland pushed to 2015. But even I give you $0.09 back on the restructuring and if I assume currency was a bit of a hit that may be we weren\u2019t modeling correctly, I still can\u2019t get anywhere close, and I guess the last thing I comment on there before I open it or give it back to you guys is, I know you talked about R&D finally being in 2015 at a point where you can get may be a little leverage offer or at least it doesn\u2019t grow faster than revenue. The revenue guidance looks okay if you take \u2013 if you make some adjustments around a couple of different factors, so it\u2019s all EPS and yet it\u2019s not going to be R&D, it\u2019s not going to be revenue, I\u2019m confused as to where the big miss is coming at the EPS line?", "Elisha Finney", "Right. So Jeff let me just start with Q4 and give you the loss from what we said last quarter to where we ended up this quarter and the guidance is to $1.14 to $1.29 with a $0.15 delta attributed to the Maryland Proton project as we talked about on the last call. So, if I start with the $1.02 that we are reporting, Maryland would have added $0.17 to the quarter and that\u2019s really because it\u2019s more profitable than we have thought. And I\u2019ve learned to kind of hedge my best with Proton deals and so when it was going to stay in, yes it was at the $0.15 level when it came out it was at the more profitable $0.17.", "The tax rate we had about a $0.06 impact from the euro moving literally the last two days of the fiscal year when our balance sheets translate and we had a huge hedging gain in the U.S. that was offset almost exactly by our subsidiary losses for a GAAP \u2013 for the P&L the pre-tax profit, but our hedging gains was taxable in the U.S. because our subsidiary hold their books from a statutory tax accounting in local currency, they did not have a loss with an offset in tax deduction. So a highly unusual event in my 15 years in this job, I do not recall having any impact anywhere close to that and it was just given a huge swing in the currency right at quarter \u2013 at year-end, which has to be reflected in the Q4 tax rates. And then $0.03 additional, we missed out on tax benefit associated with Maryland, where we have some NOLs in Germany that we could have taken credit for. So that\u2019s the guidance walk, I guess that there\u2019s (indiscernible) here, it\u2019s really Maryland with more than the $0.15 spread that we had put on the quarter, it ended up being the $0.17 of profit plus the additional $0.03 that we didn\u2019t get in the past.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "Yes. And Elisha, I guess that, I probably understand that and I think most of us are probably willing to say hey you guys would have been at the upper end if not the most the street numbers for the fourth quarter, I\u2019m talking 2015 guidance, where EPS is coming in some $0.50 below the street, and that\u2019s where I\u2019m so confused?", "Elisha Finney", "Okay. So let me kind of quickly walk you, I won\u2019t ask you to bear with me on the tax again, because it has the same impact for the year and the quarter, but if I start with our GAAP numbers.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "But not 2014, I\u2019m talking about your guidance for 2015, just to be clear.", "Elisha Finney", "Sorry Jeff, sorry. Okay. So let me just walk you through the various elements of the P&L from the guidance. Revenue of 5% to 6%, our oncology and ICB businesses together are in say to mid-single digits, and then our proton business, the core proton deals that are already in backlog should be somewhere between 60 million and 70 million, which is up about 40% year-over-year. I have to say I\u2019m a little nervous around exchange rates right now, we already know going into Q1, we are at a much different rate than we were in the year ago period. So we are hedging our best a little bit on the euro exchange rate on that revenue number.", "Gross margin should be 42% to 43% for the total company with oncology in their long-term range of 43% to 44%, ICB in the low 40%ish and then a single-digit gross margin rate for the proton deals that are in backlog. It\u2019s going to put our EBIT margin at around 19% to 20% and that\u2019s about even with fiscal year 2014 with more proton revenue. Tax, I\u2019m putting a little broader range on it, again to reflect the currency movement we saw at 28% to 30%, which gets me to what I call non-GAAP EPS of $4.25 to $4.35, significant upside potential from the proton deals, but they wanted to take the downside volatility out of the guidance, and I want to thank you and several others who gave us that suggestion to think about. And then we\u2019ve got the $0.09 restructuring charge that gets you to the $4.16 to the $4.26.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "Okay. We are going to \u2013 we\u2019ll just take this offline, I guess, because I\u2019m still $0.30 off from your number, even if I drop down that down at 20% EBIT margin and other stuff in your revenue guidance, so.", "Elisha Finney", "Jeff, you may be starting at the \u2013 you may be starting with the kind of a non-GAAP number for 2014, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m happy to walk you through it, but that\u2019s the detail. And then PT could add, if you just take Maryland its $0.17 plus the $0.03 and then Emory has about the same profitability. So that may be where your delta is as we are including nothing in Maryland or Emory in our guidance.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "Okay.", "Dow Wilson", "The lesson we learned here from 2014 Jeff is, if it\u2019s not financed on the proton side, the timing is just too unpredictable.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "Yes.", "Dow Wilson", "So, based on the feedback we received from a number of you, we have taken that out of our guidance, it does represent significant upside for us, but we\u2019ve \u2013 obviously we are not proud of this fourth quarter and not being in the fourth quarter earnings had a huge impact on us. We think Jeff, customer continues to move it along and were confidence is going to happen, but it has yet to happen, the timing is so difficult to predict that we have just taken it entirely out of game.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "Alright. Well, I have dominated the first few minutes here and I have a feeling there will be other questions on this. So I\u2019m just going to get back in queue and we will talk offline. Thanks, Elisha.", "", "Elisha Finney", "Thanks.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from the line of Amit Hazan from SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.", "Amit Hazan - SunTrust", "", "Thanks very much. Hey, good afternoon guys.", "Elisha Finney", "We are having a hard time hearing you, Amit.", "Amit Hazan - SunTrust", "", "Can you hear me any better now?", "Dow Wilson", "Yes.", "Elisha Finney", "Yes, that\u2019s better. Thanks.", "Amit Hazan - SunTrust", "Okay. Let me start just try to clarify around the 2015 guidance. Number one, just give us a sense of how much proton revenue there is may be theoretically or that could come in next year that\u2019s not in your guidance?", "Elisha Finney", "Okay. So, what is in my guidance is in the script is $60 million to $70 million. And those are Russia, Saudi, Cincinnati, all of the deals of that that we have booked into our backlog and we are starting to move forward on those deals. What is not in there is the $70 million that was as of the end of the fiscal year. Of course as we complete more on these projects, it\u2019s under the percentage of completion, but clearly we could have up to as much as $140 million of additional proton revenue stemming from the three deals that we have signed, but that has yet to get out the financing totally completed at this point.", "Amit Hazan - SunTrust", "Okay. And then kind of may be getting back to what I was expected to see for next year. It is really \u2013 talking about leverage, I mean, you have exclude I know your proton is going to grow a little bit, but you excluded a lot of your proton stuff from 2015 guidance. I think about your business, your North American oncology orders grew faster in the last year. And service is obviously growing very fast and that\u2019s a high margin. Why shouldn\u2019t we see leverage next year, you\u2019re taking a hit for some of the one-time offsetting you\u2019re planning to do in the first quarter. Shouldn\u2019t you be improving your operating margin in 2015 and why is that not happening?", "Elisha Finney", "Well, so the proton gross margin is going to be lower. So if all of that proton revenue materializes, it does have a downward impact on the gross margin for the total company. It absolutely gets us a great deal of leverage in the R&D, in the SG&A spending. So if I look at FY 2015, there\u2019s also a restructuring charge and I want to make sure that we have talked about that being in the first quarter. It\u2019s really the gross margin for the total company down a little bit, oncology should be right in the range that we\u2019ve talked about, ICB will be in the low 40s, but you have a proton business at a significantly lower gross margins with higher sales year-over-year.", "Dow Wilson", "Yes, I think the other thing I would add here is we are very gratified by the orders volume we saw in Q4 that was great. The first three quarters were lighter and so we have kind of got that flowing through the first half of the year, we have got some tough foreign exchange that we are looking at as they comes out of backlog and into sales. And then the other thing that we have got in the oncology business in 2015 is we will be taking our first Brazil units to the P&L, which has I think oncology is going to be fine overall, but kind of the better mix of the U.S. orders and software orders overall can be offset a little bit by the Brazil pressure we have that we deliver at the units down in Brazil.", "Elisha Finney", "If you do \u2013 if you take out the restructuring charge, the EBIT margin is right at about 20% in FY 2015.", "Amit Hazan - SunTrust", "Right. But is that actually I mean are you actually showing leverage in 2015, if you take out proton?", "Elisha Finney", "I\u2019ve not run it, but yes, I will run that very quickly for you Amit, but I think it would be \u2013 we would get some leverage. I have to back-off the proton revenue, back-off the gross margin, I haven\u2019t done that math right here in front of me, but we are growing R&D and SG&A slower than the top line next year for PT.", "Amit Hazan - SunTrust", "", "Okay. Let me get back to the top line for a second, as I understand what you\u2019re excluding and that totally make sense, but 5% to 6% top line growth, if I look at your backlog ending your fiscal year, right, you\u2019ve got oncology up 7% in backlog, Imaging Components up a lot more, service obviously not in there, but growing faster. It sounds like your order trends are pretty good and may be you can comment on how you\u2019re thinking about that going forward on the order side. But why the 5% to 6% guidance if everything that I\u2019m looking at in backlog is looking stronger than that?", "Elisha Finney", "Yes. Well, a lot of our growth in backlog came right at the end of the fiscal year, and so we need to make sure that all of that is going to deliver in FY 2015. Additionally, I\u2019m looking at exchange rates today that are vastly different than where we were in the year ago period. And to be conservative, we are using today\u2019s rate that could either work for us or it could work against us. But the dollar is pretty strong right now and that\u2019s what we are using as we are penciling out FY 2015.", "Amit Hazan - SunTrust", "Okay. So I mean, may be I will make my final question. What would be your constant currency guidance for top line growth for 2015?", "Elisha Finney", "I\u2019m not going to guide to that, I mean, it\u2019s at the $1.26 to $1.27 level, so you can make assumptions on the yen, the Canadian and the euro and try and back into a number, but obviously, it would be higher, because the currencies have moved significantly against us.", "Amit Hazan - SunTrust", "Okay. I will jump back in queue.", "Elisha Finney", "Probably at a point or so.", "Amit Hazan - SunTrust", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tycho W. Peterson from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Hey, first one on margins, specifically on oncology margins, you noted some (indiscernible) there, I know your guidance for next year is 43% to 44% for oncology, but as we think about more the business coming internationally why isn\u2019t the risk of further erosion within the oncology margins?", "Elisha Finney", "It\u2019s driven by the increase in service, which is in growing in double digits, which is in the low to mid-50% margin range. And we think we are going to get a resumption of software revenue moving into this year just given the very strong orders growth in software products that we had. So \u2013 and you\u2019re absolutely right with much of that could offset by the move to outside of North America. So net-net, if I look at oncology on the year, they came right in the middle of that 43% to 44% range, up 23 basis point and our goal is that we can continue for next year to keep oncology in that 43% to 44% range.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay. And then on proton, you saw the Indiana facility that gets shutdown obviously that wasn\u2019t yours, but maybe just talk about whether people are reevaluating the value proposition here and the returns on proton investment and is there a kind of a change in the landscape there?", "Dow Wilson", "No. I think there\u2019s a number of issues around proton. Clearly, one of the things driving proton is the inherent physics, the advantages of the Bragg Peak and the ability really to reduce dose to healthy tissue. One of the things that we identified when we acquired ACCEL seven years ago, was their technology for doing intensity modulated proton therapy was the best out there. And I think in large measure some of these older proton therapy systems do not have advanced capability for doing IMPT. And the analogy holds in radiation therapy if you don\u2019t have IMRT capability today you are no where. And so I think it was as much a technology reason as anything else. The Indiana, I haven\u2019t talked to them personally but it was one of the first proton centers in the U.S. It was older technology, generations behind, it\u2019s in a tough location, it\u2019s an hour outside Indianapolis plus outside Indianapolis not in a big location. It has a small catchment area. It did good work primarily research and if you had saw the report it was very costly for them to modernize in that location. So we feel very good about the partners that we are dealing with. Clearly the cost of protons is expensive and we have to work on that together to bring it down, but the clinical advantages of proton looks very, very positive.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay. And the last one on reimbursement, I mean you are obviously waiting for final reimbursement here with the assumption that bundling goes through it, that most people expect, what are you hearing from customers and was there some pent up demand potentially once the reimbursement gets put in place, how do you think about maybe the pacing of orders the next couple of quarters post the final reimbursement coming out?", "Dow Wilson", "Now, let me say this from the outset. For getting reimbursement for a second we are just looking at the North America market. North America market was up 11% in the fourth quarter, that\u2019s the best quarter we have had in North America in over two years, so we really like that. The market continues to be hospital market only. We see very little participation from the free-standing centers that\u2019s 90% plus of our market right now. I think what we are seeing in the proposal is that payments for the hospital market are going to remain okay. So we expect them to be up 1% to 2%. We like the fact that the bundled payment for single fraction SRS favors Varian Linux it\u2019s the same for any SRS SBRT treatment and there is no price advantage to any competitor in the marketplace.", "In the proposal the freestanding rates are going to get haircut again as proposed. The rationale behind that is CMS wants to move the vault from a direct to an indirect expense and exclude it from the cost calculation that gets to reimbursement. We have had a major effort with our customer partners with Congress to oppose those cuts. We won\u2019t know if those cuts get modified until November. We did have a huge chunk of the Senate and the House signed the letter. So I think we have made what argument we can. But at this point I would say in the proposal the freestanding centers are looking at another 5% plus cut. And is it going to impact us at this point is less than 10% of our market. We had a good fourth quarter and I would our funnel looks pretty good.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you for taking the questions. And I wanted maybe just to start with a little bit follow-up to the commentary you just made regarding the U.S. market and maybe sort of a little bit broader context. And I think you obviously have faced some headwinds whether it was reimbursement related or freeze in hospital CapEx spending, but as we look across the early data points you have gotten out of this quarter, the environment does seem better whether there was comments from some industrial players or out of the hospitals themselves, can you maybe just sort of talk about what the nature of the conversations you are having with customers today, are you sensing any unfreezing of environment relative to call it 12 or 24 months ago?", "Dow Wilson", "I would say some of the trends that we have talked about before remains. We are seeing the strongest, stronger and the good news is that they doubling down and investing. This last quarter we had multi-system wins at a number of places, they are betting on technology, they really see the future of SRS and SBRT and are making that bet. There is a lot of investment in software for oncology information systems. We think we have got a very good position there. Being clinically rich is very important. And that\u2019s an advantage we have coming from our space versus some of the enterprise players. So, I would say conversations with our hospital system partners remain very robust. They are looking at technology as a means of differentiation. They are looking at consolidation in their local regional markets and the purchases, I mean, the kind of downside of that is purchases are bigger and take a little longer, but I think we have done very well. On the freestanding side, this is very, very flat.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe on the imaging business that has been a very strong contributor to your overall top line growth over the past couple of years, can you maybe just give us some perspective on where you think we are in the sort of digital conversion and when \u2013 are we operating at a above normal long-term trend line right now or is that a business that it can continue to sustain the growth that it has over the past several periods?", "Dow Wilson", "I mean there is a number of segments kind of sub-segments in here. The flat panel business is really what\u2019s driving the digitization. We are up 13% on the year. We had a tough comp in Q4, but flat panel business is continuing to rock as we see that as very strong. Tube business is it participates in the digitization, but it also participates in the analog world. It\u2019s a little bit more of the replacement business. You are down slightly on the year. So, I think that\u2019s kind of following the broader trend in radiology. In the fourth quarter, we had a huge order in our security and inspection business, $40 million, that\u2019s going to make next year in this business tough to explain all year, kind of those lumps come and go, but I think as a continued trend, we will see if flat panel business continue to grow very strongly and tubes would be a little bit of flattish to slightly up scenario and then security will come and go with big customer purchases.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And then maybe just the last question on cash and I know you have been very explicit about share repurchases being pretty consistently a priority, but as you kind of look at what\u2019s going on over the past couple of years, a deceleration in the overall top line growth compression in your operating margin and some might argue a peaking in your return on capital metrics in the context of a large cash balance and why not look to get more aggressive on either the M&A front or other external investments that could restore the growth rate or give you some more flexibility from a diversification standpoint?", "Dow Wilson", "It\u2019s a good question, David and we are looking very hard at it. We have done a couple acquisitions this year that we are very excited about. They are pretty small frankly. We acquired Transpire and Velocity. They both help out our software business in oncology. We think that\u2019s a big opportunity that\u2019s the space we continue to look at. They were small acquisitions, but they are already contributing and the funnels. Transpire is a little more on margin rate side, was intellectual property that we acquired there and then Velocity, we had a terrific ASTRO with velocity. We have got a robust funnel of activity there. And \u2013 so I think we got some good execution on these two most recent acquisitions. We did the Calypso acquisition three years ago and I\u2019d say that\u2019s been slow, but now with SBRT starting to take off, we are seeing some nice growth kind of on the horizon of Calypso. More broadly, I would say from a 30,000 foot level, oncology software is one focused area for us and the other is strengthening our components business. We got a great business model, a great team in the components business and that will be another place that we look to enhance our portfolio.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs", "Got it. Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley", "Hi, good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. Just two quick ones on the model actually, Dow, I wonder if you could give us a sense for how big ASTRO was in the quarter as a driver of orders? I know in past years where ASTRO was moved from one quarter to the next or?", "Dow Wilson", "Steve, I think if anything ASTRO in our fourth quarter is a drag. So, I mean, I take my whole sales team and I park them in a convention center, the least productive phase in the world. And so, I think it\u2019s an indication of the momentum that\u2019s out there.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley", "So, could we see North American order momentum here into fiscal \u201815 remain close to this level?", "Dow Wilson", "All I can tell you is my funnel looks good.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then just circling back on proton, I appreciate the conservatism with the approach from proton for the fiscal \u201815 guidance and the specifics, Elisha on what the contribution could be to the top line? Could you give us a sense for how much proton could contribute for fiscal \u201815 on the bottom line if everything goes toward a best case scenario?", "Elisha Finney", "Well, and again it depends on how much of the project is completed that if I simply take Maryland which we just said were $0.17 at the pre-tax margin line and $0.03 in the tax and you double it for Emory, which is roughly the equivalent project. You can see that it could be significant, it\u2019s the timing and that is what is impossible for us to predict, but I don\u2019t think there is a chance that both Maryland and Emory would be totally complete within this fiscal year. Chances are Maryland could bring in maybe $0.20 and Emory could bring in perhaps half that and in this fiscal year and then the balance would be in a future fiscal year.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley", "And that would incremental to the guidance?", "Elisha Finney", "Yes.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley", "Great, perfect. Thanks so much, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from ISI Group. Please proceed with your question.", "Vijay Kumar - ISI Group", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So, maybe just to add on to that prior question on the guidance on proton, right, and I think I am looking at your sort of prepared remarks the guidance excludes the contracted proton projects that are not yet financed or booked into the backlog. I guess, just to give us a sense, I understand Maryland and Emory being $0.20 and $0.05, thanks for the color. Were there any other projects, I mean, if you have done the normal way that you would have guided, right, were there any other sort of proton projects that were contracted, but not yet financed and now that is being excluded?", "Dow Wilson", "We mentioned on the call, there is a project of course in Maryland, a project in Atlanta, and a project in Dallas. Those are the three projects, where we have been contacted, but the deals aren\u2019t yet financed. We have not booked them into our backlog until they are financed.", "Vijay Kumar - ISI Group", "I guess, Dow, I was asking on the EPS impact rate or there is a relative size?", "Dow Wilson", "Yes. And none of those are in our EPS guidance.", "Vijay Kumar - ISI Group", "I know they are not in the EPS guidance, but if I guess any magnitude and what the magnitude is or what\u2019s been put out on the guidance?", "Elisha Finney", "Yes. Well, as I just mentioned, I mean, if you assume Maryland at the $0.17 pre-tax, $0.03 of tax impact. Emory, I don\u2019t believe, will get as far this year. On completing that project, we are moving forward, but it\u2019s again, that project is just behind Maryland. And it could add maybe half that much. So, that\u2019s at the outset.", "Dow Wilson", "Yes. And I just want to underscore the big if here. We burned down this last year. So, we have taken it out of our guidance. We are confident our customer will get it done, but the timing is just impossible to predict. So, we are getting out of the timing business.", "Vijay Kumar - ISI Group", "Got it. Fair enough. And I guess maybe one bigger picture question on the environment of what you are seeing, you had some pretty good growth in the U.S., including double-digit growth, what\u2019s driving the growth out there? Is this new products and what\u2019s been the temporary response? And I guess as a corollary to that, when you look at the medium term outlook, how should we think about gross margins for oncology, right, with specifically given that at some point service growth, how long can that continue and offset the emerging markets sort of which is below the corporate margin levels?", "Dow Wilson", "Let me talk to the U.S. market thing here first. The \u2013 I think what\u2019s driving the U.S. market is new technology. People really want to take advantage of the new capabilities that the team is developing, especially for lung cancer and liver cancer. People want \u2013 hypo-fractionation continues to be a big trend. And as our customers go from a little bit of hypo-fractionation to a lot of hypo-fractionation, they need dedicated platforms to do it. And so I think hypo-fractionation is a big piece in the U.S. that\u2019s driving the growth. And our position with TrueBeam and Edge is terrific. The other thing is our \u2013 if you were at ASTRO I thought our software line up was just (gangbusters). And we got game in software.", "And I think that we had very good \u2013 when you look at the U.S. orders coming out of the fourth quarter that\u2019s very, very positive for us. So that was good. I will go to your third question and turn it over to Elisha for some of the margin rate stuff. But the \u2013 for the service business how long can it continue. We just had our best unit year ever. Our units were up about 12% year-over-year orders wise. So we continue to see good install base expansion outside of the U.S. U.S. is a replacement market, OUS is not, we think there is another 10,000 machines that are needed outside of the U.S. So I think that we have got a double digit scenario. We are struggling a little bit with FX as we look at \u2013 as we look at our service business for 2015. But as we look at service long-term I think it remains a double digit scenario for a long period and I will let Elisha comment on some of the international mix on margin rates.", "Elisha Finney", "Sure. So again for FY \u201915 we are assuming that oncology is going to be again in the 43% to 44% margin range. The growth in service which is at a significantly higher margin than the equipment and the growth in software we think is going to offset the move to outside of North America. And we expect we are going to begin shipping on our Brazil tender this fiscal year and that is at extremely lower gross margin rate as we talked about for a while. So that will be in there as well, but we have continued to think long-term that 43% to 44% range will hold. I will say Q1 just based on where we see the backlog and where we see shipment deliveries and it\u2019s probably closer to 43% level in Q1 and then as more software and service through the balance of the year we will see it start to pick up from there.", "Vijay Kumar - ISI Group", "Thanks guys. I will step back in the queue.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jason Wittes from Brean Capital. Please proceed with your question.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital", "Hi, thanks for taking the question.", "Dow Wilson", "Hi, Jason.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital", "Hi guys. Elisha I just want to follow-up there has been a lot of questions about proton it\u2019s obviously the big distinguishing factor this year, from what you said thus far it sounds like potentially Maryland didn\u2019t end, Atlanta potentially hit this year and then you are going to have to look at the percent of complete to see how much of it actually would hit the P&L and I think you said that\u2019s about assuming best case scenario about $0.30, it sounds to me like Dallas is too far is not yet \u2013 is not for long answer really have much of an impact whether or not you can close the financing, is that the right way to think about it?", "Elisha Finney", "I think that\u2019s fair and just to be clear it\u2019s our customers, who is getting the financing. They are making good progress. They are working with a very large institution I mean we had no reason to believe that this won\u2019t get done. In fact we are committed to stepping in as a minority lender in this facility, but until it\u2019s done it\u2019s just not done and I am black and blue from this proton deal all year along and we are taking the downside volatility out of this.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital", "You are assuming black and blue from Maryland I don\u2019t know are the other \u2013 the Dallas and Emory facility is also sort of somewhat unpredictable from the same line\u2026?", "Elisha Finney", "They have yet to be financed.", "Dow Wilson", "They are not quite so black and blue, but\u2026", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital", "Got it.", "Elisha Finney", "Maryland has been significant throughout this fiscal year and we are just now getting to the point where it can be significant in FY \u201915.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital", "Okay. Thank you. So then the other\u2026", "Dow Wilson", "Just to underscore Jason I mean again there is if on this and we are just taking ourselves out of the timing business on these.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital", "Fair enough.", "Dow Wilson", "There was 100% confidence they would be in our guidance.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital", "Got it. The other question is just to understand kind of how we should look at oncology, obviously you have got some pretty high expectations for software this year. I mean that\u2019s been growing at a very nice cliff, should we anticipate an acceleration and if I think about your oncology growth overall should we assume that product sales kind of remain in the low-single digits and we see some acceleration in service which is already kind of been in that sort of low to mid-teen range?", "Elisha Finney", "Well, maybe one way to look at this, let me take a stab at this, oncology, if I just look at where we ended the year on backlog, it was up about 7%. Now, again we think there is some FX risk in that, but that just gives you a flavor, because that obviously \u2013 that is only equipment and software, it does not include our service business, which is growing a little faster. So we are early in the year, much of this growth in backlog came in the Q3 and most of it in Q4, we need to make sure if it\u2019s going to deliver this fiscal year or next fiscal year, we\u2019re being conservative on the FX rate to the extent we can. But you are right, I mean with backlog being up 7%, if things were to start to moving in our favor, there could be potentially a little upside there. It\u2019s just too early to call at this point in the Year.", "Dow Wilson", "Just to put a final point, the software contract can deliver quicker than data product contracts from my understanding, in other words\u2026.", "Elisha Finney", "A lot of times they are.", " ", "Dow Wilson", "A lot of times they are green.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital", "Okay. And then just on x-ray and components. I suppose that this has been somewhat a rough year, what kind of expectations that we have for 2015 for that business?", "Dow Wilson", "I mean, I think, the it\u2019s been a double-digit business in panel, I think we will continue to see that. I think on the year we\u2019re probably looking at strong single-digit performance in the x-ray business.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital", "Okay, great, thanks. That\u2019s all I have.", "Dow Wilson", "We are going to have a little bit of this lumpiness, because of the big security order that we took in the fourth quarter this past year, but the core business is going to do fine.", "Elisha Finney", "And they sell mostly in dollars for what it\u2019s worth.", "Dow Wilson", "Yes, yes.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital", "Understood. Thanks a lot. I\u2019ll jump back in queue.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies", "Hi, thanks. Good afternoon, good evening.", "Dow Wilson", "Hi, Raj.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies", "I am wondering if I could just ask a little on the first quarter guidance, 0% to 2%, I think you\u2019re guiding to 5% to 6% per year, so I\u2019m sure up swing as you move through the year, but why so low in the first quarter the 0% to 2%?", "Elisha Finney", "Yes. So, well if I look back again, if I look back at where oncology was in the year ago Q1 and we have on average delivery about a year later, it was fairly low growth at that point with the backlog up in very low-single digits. So we expect that this is going to build as we go throughout the year. So I think both oncology and our imaging components businesses will be in the low single digits, some impact from FX when we look at the significant shift quarter-over-quarter and that\u2019s really where \u2013 that\u2019s really where that\u2019s coming from. And then our proton therapy business will be down, it looks like in Q1 assuming no it doesn\u2019t happen in the core projects just given the timing it will be down from the year ago period.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just it\u2019s my proton questions as well. This decision can move from not looking at \u2013 not considering projects for inclusion in your forecast unless they have financing. Is that any bearing on whether something actually goes into backlog or not or have you changed your criteria and how you assess your backlog at this point?", "Elisha Finney", "No, so none of our criteria on how things get into backlog have changed and again we\u2019ve got signed contracts, we have delivered the cyclotron, I mean that we have got a lot of things that are going on, but we will not book it into backlog until the financing contingency is listed. So, the only change here is how we select the fields and guidance just given the timing of when they are going to recur.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies", "Okay. So, that\u2019s the \u2013 if they can have a contingency around financing to go into backlog, but the financing does not necessarily have to be secured?", "Elisha Finney", "It doesn\u2019t have to be 100% complete, but it has to be sufficiently completed to where we are comfortable that we can take the revenue.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies", "Okay. And then just lastly on proton, I think it seems like you\u2019ve booked anything really in proton in the quarter and I guess I\u2019m curious about your views on this, because you now have a single room center and given the extreme cost of these systems, have you seen much of a change in perception in the marketplace of where your customers are looking now in terms proton?", "Dow Wilson", "I think the good news is, the funnel is robust and at this point we have a good funnel in both kind of smaller proton center market as well as bigger multi-room market and we have got capabilities in both segments. Last year, we booked three orders, we booked Cincinnati, Taiwan and Paul Scherrer Institute. So, we feel very good about getting those orders booked last year and the funnel looks pretty good for us.", "Elisha Finney", "Putting on a nice backlog in the proton business.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "There are no further questions. I would like to hand the call back over to management for closing comments.", "Dow Wilson - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks very much. Thank you all for participating.

We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this presentation and discussion, because of new information, future events, or otherwise.", "And now, here is Dow.", "Dow Wilson", "Good afternoon and welcome. We are reporting solid results for the first quarter of 2015 with healthy revenue, orders and earnings growth. In summary, we are reporting net earnings of $0.92 per diluted share including $0.07 restructuring charge. Revenues of $738 million up 4% or up 6% on a constant currency basis, expected oncology service revenues of $254 million and 81 basis points improvement in the company\u2019s gross margin of 44.3% of sales strong orders in our major businesses and 13% increase in our quarter ending backlog to $3.1 billion. Oncology Systems order totaled $562 million for the quarter up 5% or up 8% on a constant currency basis on a trailing 12 months basis worldwide reported Oncology orders grew by 5%. Consistent with recent geographic re-organization of the oncology systems business will consolidate the rest of world region into three geographic regions. The Americas, APAC and EMEA for comparison purposes the earnings release contains a table providing quarterly results for these regions for 2013 and 2014.", "In the first quarter of 2015 oncology orders grows 17% in APAC and 12% in EMEA while declining by 2% in the Americas. In North America orders sell by 3% versus strong 13% growth in the year ago quarter. Robust APAC order performance is driven mainly by China where orders grew by 42% with the help of a tender win with the CLA. Market in China appears to be returning to more typical investment levels on the period of delays and uncertainty. During the quarter, the SSDA ran an approval for Varian to supply our Edge radiosurgery systems to customer in China. This opens the door for Varian leading technology to address the growing lung cancer burden there. Looking as whole as BRICA of countries of Brazil, Russia, India, China and Africa we achieve first quarter order growth of 30%.", "BRICA again accounted for more than 15% of total oncology orders in the quarter. A strong performance in Africa where we booked more than $20 million in orders from project in Algeria, Egypt and South Africa helped our EMEA geographic region achieve orders growth of 12% or 18% on a constant currency basis. Elsewhere in EMEA we saw strong orders performance in France Turkey and Hungry. Turning to Latin America ongoing demand from the private market in Brazil was low as purchases in Columbia helped to drive order growth in the region. ", "As I mentioned at the outset, orders in North America decline slightly versus very strong first quarter performance last year with a consolidation in this market we\u2019ve seen great quarter to quarter variability. On a longer term trailing 12 months basis, North America oncology orders grew 4%. At this point the sales funnel looks good. Orders in our oncology service business were robust rising by 14% to $254 million representing 45% of the total oncology systems business during the quarter.", "This puts us on course to exceed our goal of reaching $1 billion of service revenue this year. We also made great progress in our software business during the quarter with double-digit growth in treatment planning and oncology information system. We hit a big clinical milestone during the quarter when rapid plan was used for the first time, to planning advance volume our key treatment for 76 year old prostate cancer patient in the UK. Rapid plan makes it easier and faster for clinicians to generate higher quality treatment plan. We\u2019re taking orders for more than 100 rapid plan installations to date.", "During the quarter we\u2019re pleased to see a promising new lung study showing improved survival rate using stereotactic body radiation therapy or SBRT in combination with the chemotherapy agent called erlotinib. The study by senior author Dr. Robert Timmerman of UT Southwestern Medical Center in Texas which was partially funded by Varian hit an overall survival times extending from historic six to nine months to 20 months. Result of this Phase II clinical trial involving 24 patients with stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer were published in the journal of clinical oncology of the American society of clinical oncology.", "Turning to our imaging component segment, orders rose by a robust 34% to $163 million versus the very week year ago period when orders declined. We saw specially strong growth in our panel business where orders rose by 65%. Among the highlights in our panel business was a big multi-million dollar win with the customer in Korea. We also started commercial shipments of our new customized veterinary and imaging package that includes both panels and workstations. You can see in our 2014 annual report, these wireless panels are being used in the sound echo and portable systems to image thoroughbred horses.", "At quarter end, we announced our intention to make an approximate 32 million euro public tender offer to acquire all the shares of MeVis Medical Solutions in Germany. The tender was formally launched yesterday, MeVis develops and supply image analysis software due to screen breast, lung, liver, prostate and colon cancer. We\u2019re about to complete the tender process early in our third quarter, this will be an important step in our strategy to expand the imaging component to software portfolio. The company\u2019s other category comprised of the Varian particle therapy business and the Ginzton technology center recorded orders of $1 million, the sales funnel continues to look good and we submitted five new proton tenders during the quarter.", "We made progress on our active proton projects generating $9 million of revenue, our customers financing of the Maryland proton project was not sufficiently completed to enable us to book it during the quarter. ", "Before I hand it over to Elisha, I\u2019m pleased to report that as the world economic forum in Davos last week, Varian was included in the global 100 ranking of the world\u2019s most sustainable companies. Varian is a top ranked healthcare equipment company included on the list, we\u2019re proud to be recognized for our commitment and sustainability. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over Elisha.", "Elisha Finney", "Thanks Dow and hello everyone. While Dow has already covered growth orders I want to talk further about the constant currency growth rate for the quarter. In comparing quarter-over-quarter exchange rates of euro and the yen weakened significantly against the dollar which reduced our total company order growth rate by about two points. Total oncology orders for the quarter increased 5% in dollars and 8% in constant currency. Oncology\u2019s EMEA orders include 12% in dollars and 18% in constant currency. Oncology APAC orders increased 17% in dollars and 23% in constant currency primarily due to the yen.", "There was no currency impact in the Americas. The company ended the quarter with a $3.1 billion backlog up 13%. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled to $34 million bringing net orders for the company to $692 million. First quarter revenues for the total company increased 4% in dollars and 6% in constant currency. Oncology posted a 4% gain in revenues during the quarter with significant shift for North America and services. North America constituted 52% of total oncology revenues versus 42% in the year ago quarter. Service revenues grew by 14% over the year ago quarter.", "Imaging component posted first quarter revenue growth of 3% with growth in panels and security and inspection products partially offset by declines into. The total company gross margin for the quarter was 44.3% up 81 basis points, oncology systems gross margin improved by 68 basis points to 45.6% due to favorable geographic and product mix. ", "While we\u2019re pleased with the margin performance in the quarter, we continue to believe that oncology can sustain long term gross margins in the 43% to 44% range. Imaging component gross margin for the quarter rose 85 basis points to 42.2% due to a higher mix of panels as well improved quality cost. First quarter SG&A expenses were 140 million including an $11 million restructuring charge to reduce headcount. This charge increased SG&A as a percentage of revenues by a 140 basis points in this quarter. SG&A was also impacted by a $5 million increase in our bad debt reserve in the quarter to reflect uncertainty and our ability to exchange our Venezuelan bolivar collections into dollars. First quarter R&D expenses were $57 million or 8% of revenues equal to the year ago quarter as a percentage of revenue.", "Moving down the income statement first quarter operating earnings totaled $130 million down from the year ago quarter due in large parts to the restructuring charge. Depreciation and amortization totaled $17 million for the quarter. The effective tax rate was 28.5% down almost three points from the year ago quarter due largely to the R&D tax credit extension granted in late December. We continue to expect that the tax rate will be 28% to 30% for the fiscal year.", "Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased almost 6 million from the year ago quarter to $101.6 million due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted EPS was $0.92 for the quarter including the $0.07 restructuring charge. ", "Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of 904 million, debt of 525 million and stockholders\u2019 equity of 1.6 billion. ", "DSO at 85 improved by nine days from the year ago quarter. First quarter cash flow from operations increased significantly from the year ago quarter to $79 million or 85% of net income. Primary usage of cash was $22 million for CapEx and a $126 million towards the repurchase of 1.5 million shares of stock. AT the end of quarter we had 4.75 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization at expensive calendar year 2015. ", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Dow for the outlook.", "Dow Wilson", "Thanks Elisha. The company got up to a good start in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 with revenues and earnings coming in ahead of expectations. Our outlook for the full fiscal year is heavily impacted by the recent dramatic swing in currency exchange rate which we believe will significantly reduce revenues and earnings in the balance of the year. We now believe the total company revenue for fiscal year 2015 will increase about 5%. ", "Given our earnings momentum in the first quarter, we believe that we can maintain our prior guidance of $4.16 to $4.26 per diluted share for the fiscal year despite significant currency headwinds. ", "Given current exchange rate and the expected timing of shipments in the year we believe total company revenues for the second quarter should increase by about 2% versus the year ago period. Net earnings per diluted share for the second quarter could be in the range of $0.98 or $1.02. ", "Our guidance excludes contracted proton projects that are not yet financed or booked into backlog. If these projects are booked during the year, the potential upside in revenues and profits could be significant. We\u2019re now ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Amit Hazan from SunTrust.", "Amit Hazan ", "Okay. Just a couple of questions I wanted to start with the guidance, if I think about adjusted EPS guidance 5% to 7% excluding the one-time of course that implies essentially negative leverage I think year-over-year giving your share buyback and if I think about how you describe last year is an investment year, why should we see that within the model this year.", "Elisha Finney", "So Amit when you go through the guidance we\u2019ll be at about sort of full fiscal year 19% operating margin including the $11 million restructuring charge. Once you exclude that we should get closer to about even where we were with the year ago period, understanding that our revenue is coming down significantly due to FX and we don\u2019t get the full offset. So that has something to do with it as well. But, excluding the effects of FX and the restructuring charge we would get leverage in the P&L this year. ", "Amit Hazan ", "Okay. And maybe let move to currency with sales guidance going essentially from the 5% to 6% growth last quarter, now you have 5%, little bit hard to tell what exactly the currency impacted versus a very nice outperformance, is that would have taken guidance higher, can you walk us through the dollar or the growth impact to expect from FX -- expected last quarter when you gave guidance what that dollar or growth impact is now on a top line, and can you then just to remind us how that goes through your P&L?", "Elisha Finney ", "Absolutely, so let me give you the walk from the prior guidance to the new guidance and let me preface by saying to simplify it out at start of the midpoint and the year ago guidance and take it to the midpoint in the quarter ago guidance and take you the midpoint today. Just the 50,000 foot level, we\u2019ve really had a double whammy a recently win the Yen and Euro where we have significant revenue in both of those currencies and we can buy 8% to 10%. Added to that, this Swiss franc strengthened by about 20% and we don\u2019t have much revenue in franc but we have a significant amount of expenses in Swiss franc.", "So when you put all together we start to support 21 which is the midpoint of the prior guidance and you assume we beat the midpoint by $0.14 in Q1 and then we have a negative $0.20 impact EPS for the balance of the year due to FX and come back and talk a little bit more about that. That gives you the 4.15 and then we believe as we lookout as the momentum that we had in quarter and the gross margin and the geographic mix and product mix along with the some cost controlled initiatives that we will be able to get an additional $0.06 or so for the balance of the year and that gets you back to the $4.21.", "So let me just say in a minute on how we get to the $0.20 impact from FX, the revenue for Q2 for Q4, we\u2019re estimating just based on what we\u2019re expecting shipments to be and where current exchange rates are to be down about $50 million. And we\u2019re roughly 50% naturally hedged, so we have a $25 million net impact from that loss of revenue and then on top of that our Swiss cost we\u2019re expecting are going to go up between $5 million to $7 million based on the stronger franc and when you tax effect that it gets you at a midpoint of $0.20 for the balance of the year.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Robert Baird. ", "Jeff Johnson", "Dow, maybe want start on the U.S. hospital FX environment, I obviously understand that you have the tough comp in American oncology orders this quarter and frankly I think you guys probably in the fiscal first quarter never pushing quick as hard as they\u2019re in the fiscal fourth quarter just on a yearend number standpoint. The number this quarter not overly surprising but maybe you talk about underlying trends that you\u2019re seeing in the U.S. it sure sounds like from a lot of companies we\u2019re talking the U.S. CapEx environment is getting better or do you feel that is true in some of the discussions you\u2019re having?", "Dow Wilson ", "I mean first at the back, North America orders were down 3% versus 13% growth a year ago quarter. They had a drift trailing 12 months is 4% growth. I not only believe too much less than 12 months orders trends that\u2019s when what we keep our eye on around here, but even when you short out six month it\u2019s north of the 4%. So I think we\u2019re seeing a small move in the market that\u2019s good. We still believe that North America is a low to mid-single digit market and our sales are going to look pretty good. We\u2019ve seen the same capital improved rate with everybody else. I think you know the surveys are usually ahead of where people actually send the money, but I would say our performance looks good.", "Jeff Johnson", "All right that\u2019s helpful and then at least maybe a question on SG&A even a high adjust for the restructuring charge just for the $5 million above our right off adjustment that you made, SG&A still up in your 17% of revenue and historically we haven\u2019t seen a 17% SG&A number until going back to 2007 or so and typically in the first quarter you\u2019re close to 15, 15.5, so what else is driving maybe that SG&A higher in the quarter?", "Elisha Finney ", "Yes, what really sets us because we had our reduction in headcount a bit at the end of the quarter, it will start to turnaround and should approximate closer to 15% as we go forward on Q2 through Q4. So here we just see effects of the investments that we made last year on a quarter-over-quarter basis. You\u2019ve mentioned the riff and the retirement plan as well as Venezuela. We will normalize going forward closer to 15% of revenue.", "Jeff Johnson", "All right that\u2019s great and then just my last question, we\u2019ll follow up on the detail maybe off line later tonight. But it sounds like the incremental FX headwind is around $0.20 and that\u2019s incremental since you last updated or not and we can talk about that offline, but if you\u2019re absorbing that in guidance, it seems like fundamentally the year is obviously coming in stronger already one quarter end you fundamentally feel better about the year, so when I first saw the stronger margins in the first quarter you talk about the positive revenue mix, it sounds like maybe that was just pulling into first quarter and out of the second quarter specially then second quarter guidance being little lighter than most model. But obviously fundamentally you must be feeling better and I am just trying to figure out fundamentally is it the strong growth you see in imaging as is it the software and services side of oncology just where fundamentally you\u2019re feeling better maybe today than you were there months when you first gave guidance?", "Elisha Finney ", "So Jeff, you\u2019re absolutely correct it\u2019s about the impact from the last guidance to today\u2019s guidance and is really helpful of course that we got the 14% lead in Q1, so largely it make up for that. First we do think just given the geographic mix and the margin performance and the service growth and these cost control initiatives that we took late in the calendar year that we will have a little bit more that we added to guidance for the balance of the year. If I could you mentioned the Q2 guidance, let me just do a very quick one, because at first it looks like it is very low relative to the year-ago period. And some of this is just timing about let\u2019s see the tax is going up about three points versus a year-ago quarter this is just the timing of the geographic mix of profits in the year that negatively impacted Q2 EPS by about $0.05 and then the FX impacts for Q2 is about $0.06. So if you were to strip out those events we would have high single-digit growth quarter-over-quarter for Q2. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. ", "David Roman ", "Good afternoon, thank you for taking the question. Elisha I just had a quick clarification on the guidance. I know that you are much more purist when it comes to reporting your numbers and don\u2019t have the adjustments that lot of your peers do. So, is the 416 to 426 guidance on a basis you did $0.92 in Q1 and $0.99 in Q1?", "Elisha Finney ", "On a GAAP basis which we report $0.92 if you were to exclude that restructure target it will be $0.99. So my 416 to 426 is GAAP that does include the $0.07 charge. ", "David Roman ", "Okay, got it, thank you. And then just on the emerging market side Dow in your prepared remarks as you discussed China, I think you made a reference to the market coming back to more normalized levels of demand, and I know you had a nice tender win there, but maybe could you just talk about the underlying operating dynamics in China specifically and maybe in the emerging markets more broadly. I think you are one of the first companies that reported as part of fairly strong numbers in those regions. So maybe just help us walk through what are the key underlying drivers there?", "Dow Wilson ", "I think across the emerging market, first of all from high-level a 15% oncology orders. We believe that we will continue to see double-digit growth in the emerging markets and quickly doing this claim China as we talked about last year that we are purchasing aberrations. So not a lot of volume coming from government, they retooled the purchasing processes. We are seeing those trading out which I think the good news is that means they are little pent-up demand there. So I think we will see that come. The Africa continues to be kind of a surprise for us I would say three years or four years ago it was really low number and we have a terrific year last year and we started out this year very good in Africa as well. ", "Maybe one other things that just going back to China one of the thing that we are seeing besides the kind of government trends, is we are seeing the emergence of a private market in China and I think that\u2019s something that other diagnostic imaging is going to around for long-time leases historically we have seen a little bit of that but not a lot. I think we are starting to see a little bit more of the private market emerge in China. Latin America the first quarter was okay, better in terms of growth but we still had a good growth in the first quarter, we grew 5% in the first quarter in Latin America that I think will keep growing there. We feel there is a lot of volatility and uncertainty with exchange rates and what\u2019s going on how does that impact Latin America but we haven\u2019t seen that yet in those markets. ", "The one market that\u2019s quite is Russia, that\u2019s we have not seen much there at all. India I would say on the year looks really good. ", "David Roman ", "Maybe speak little more here on the U.S. There obviously been a just a moving parts in the U.S. the past couple of years with consolidation among the freestanding clinics and potentially some pent-up replacement demand. Where do you think we are in sort of that handoff where a lot of that consolidation and freestanding clinics are going to cleaned up and we move more into the natural replacement cycle that you should be enjoying now?", "Dow Wilson ", "I think we are still going to see some more consolidation. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s over yet. The good news is I think the strong players looking at this an opportunity to grow and invest. So we are seeing some growth from some players on both the freestanding side and in hospital market. And I think last radiation oncology is valuated treating cancer. And I think from an overall point of view the trends that we are planning to really good uptake radiation of oncology over the few years in that cancer play.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Raj Denhoy from Jefferies.", "Raj Denhoy ", "What if could ask about proton. I think you mentioned at the Maryland facility is not yet progress to where you\u2019re ready to book again. But I am curious do you have any update or any I think you offer in terms of timing on that installation.", "Dow Wilson ", "The short version this isn\u2019t over and talked over. We\u2019re not going to book it and sell it and now we have seen some progress on the quarter and that could. But it\u2019s not done until it\u2019s done and Elisha do you want add anything.", "Elisha Finney ", "No I think that\u2019s it.", "Dow Wilson", "The short straight version.", "Raj Denhoy ", "Well in terms of, can you remind us again in a way it does happen. What sort of implications are in terms of revenue to get a release from that.", "Elisha Finney", "It will be a significant amount Raj it\u2019s probably North of $70 million or so given that the project has continued under percentage of completion to progress and as you recall when it did not refinance in the fourth quarter there was about $0.17 impact. And again as we progress on the installation it could be a little bit north of that wants this thing finally and we\u2019re confident that\u2019s going to get financed, it\u2019s just a matter of the timing which is impossible to predict. ", "Raj Denhoy ", "Okay and then just continuing on proton I believe you mentioned that there was five new tenders you completed for in the quarter anything you offer in terms of size of those installations where those might be in terms of.", "Dow Wilson ", "No I would say most of them are three and four room centers for a large center. Flight wise 50 days 75 configurations are all different each one of them. But I\u2019d say in a 50 to 75 range.", "Raj Denhoy ", "Okay and just lastly I think you ultimately comment around how service in the quarter was about 45% of oncology revenues. I\u2019m curious if you could put that number in perspective without percentage in perspective in terms of where you think that never ultimately go I know you guys targets a billion is in service but where we are in that past and then also if you could kind offset something similar in terms of where software are at this point will be helpful as well.", "Dow Wilson", "On service side we\u2019ve growing double digit for the last several year. This business is getting really big and hard to grow with double digit rate. But I\u2019d say we\u2019re going to be if not double digit really close to it. So it was all a bit stronger in the quarter then we usually see as another will 2014 and the service business but we should be in that double digit range. What is driving it is really everywhere it\u2019s forgetting installed based throughout any emerging market and so got product coming out warranty driving the emerging key market if got truly which we\u2019re actually celebrating our thousandth TrueBeam this next quarter. It is the most successful product in both the history of the product and the industry where four and half years get to a thousand in it. The capture rate on TrueBeam is higher and the price is little bit higher. So that\u2019s driving service content and then we move to lot of our kind of software as a service to the service business and for that part of the growth there, as well, which is a nice transition to our software business. Our software business has had two very good quarters in a row the business we\u2019re investing in aggressively both organically and inorganically with some of things that we did last year. The velocity is making a nice addition to our product line and we saw very good orders grow in our software business in both fourth quarter and the first quarter.", "Raj Denhoy ", "And if you said what percentage of revenue oncology revenue was this software at this point.", "Elisha Finney", "We could saw to $500 million business when you include both the licenses and software.", "Dow Wilson ", "On a pro forma basis it\u2019s about 500 million some of that equivalent come in the slide.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. ", "Tycho Peterson ", "Thank for taking the question. Wanted to kind of go back to one on the international market that I appreciate kind of walk you did earlier here on under different geographies thinking about the fact that a lot of value exposure I think 150% Brazilian rush to wind our commodity sensitive market. Can you just talk about how much you are taking in around macro issue which would be under control and you are thinking that lower oil and prices and things that potentially could have macro impact scenarios like Russia, Eastern Europe, Brazil, Venezuela.", "Dow Wilson", "We actually talked a lot about it this last week clearly some of growth we\u2019re seeing in Africa is from oil producing countries you haven\u2019t seen that slowdown so far? That\u2019s a reasonable question to ask. Some of the growth that we\u2019re seeing in Africa is we\u2019re seeing a lot of growth in Sub-Saharan Africa. And with the exception on Nigeria there is not of oil in the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa. So that\u2019s kind of good news on the rest of the African continent we did see some big volume in Eastern Europe, Russia in 12 to 18 months ago we take a big order in tons on and we maybe have seen that tail off a little bit as here recently but I think Russian we didn\u2019t much the good news is they need radiation oncology, they\u2019re still competitive, and they\u2019re pumping oil like crazy and we\u2019ve seen continued investment there, we haven\u2019t seen that tail off yet it will be interesting to watch Brazil, I think that market have remained strong and we\u2019ve got obviously the big tender we won year ago but we continue to see the private market which tends to buy a higher configuration but it will be interesting to see where the market goes there?", "Elisha Finney", "And Tycho, while it obviously impacts their ability to buy based on the foreign currency we feel in dollars in all of those countries.", "Tycho Peterson", "And actually two more question for Japan, I mean given that - one rate - and how do you think about the risk in that market for you guys this year?", "Dow Wilson", "I mean to some degree it\u2019s kind of in that in the P&L already. We had weak orders a year ago and we\u2019re seeing that flow through a little bit that\u2019s part of the weaker guidance you got for Q2 revenue that Elisha talked about. We did have a very good market share quarter in the first quarter but the market was down. So, we think some of its driven and there is macroeconomic issues but we also think that some of it is driven as well by consumption tax change that maybe had people pulling in some volume little more than a year ago.", "Tycho Peterson", "And then with the realignment of the reporting by geography obviously get better granularity on the revenue line, can you maybe just give us an update on cost structure, changes that you\u2019ve made U.S. versus OUS and where is your US versus OUS cost mix go two to three years in that?", "Dow Wilson", "I think the bottom line on this line is the intent that what we\u2019re trying to do is get our team closer to the customers. So we feel very good about that I think we\u2019re already seeing really good empowerment, really good ownership in the field, on the quarter we saw very good orders with revenue execution. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to get, from the cost point of view that side of it is really small. Last year most of the investments that we\u2019re making, there is a little bit of SG&A that most of the investments we\u2019re making on the R&D side as we look at some programs to drive some top line.", "Tycho Peterson", "Okay, and then two quick follow up. Elisha, I think did you gave the net order number and can you also just comment on annual translation.", "Elisha Finney ", "I did, given that order number 692, which was up 14% over the year ago period. So why don\u2019t you do the calculation, you will see the adjustments in the quarter were 34 million for the total backlog adjustment going from gross to net orders.", "Tycho Peterson", "And then last one for Dow, you talked about [indiscernible] data potentially driving a cycle around therapy capable machine, is that actually happening, are you seeing that drive dedicated equipment purchase?", "Dow Wilson ", "I\u2019m sorry, say that again Tycho, the first part of your question kind of broke up.", "Tycho Peterson", "Lung screening mandate.", "Dow Wilson ", "We think, I\u2019d say at this point we haven\u2019t really seen it flow through I think there is a lot of conversation about it I think that, that\u2019s happening for sure but I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019ve seen material increase yet. Well, I mean the increase is material but if on such a small base it\u2019s kind of hard to characterize but we continue to - I talked about the new [Tim Merman] paper, it\u2019s kind of small patient dataset but very encouraging results and just another example of the clinical research that\u2019s happening with really good news and more and more patients are having access to that and asking their physicians about it and that\u2019s what causing the change. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really kind of in the market yet but very encouraging progress.", "Tycho Peterson", "Okay, and then actually Elisha just to clarify that, net order I was looking for oncology not net?", "Elisha Finney ", "That was net orders overall. So, what you do Tycho, you start with the prior quarter ending backlog, add gross orders for the total company subtract revenue for the total company, that should be the ending backlog and any difference from what we report backlog as is the net adjustments. So that\u2019s total company of which about 30 million of that was related to oncology.", "Operator", "Thank you, our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from ISI Group.", "Vijay Kumar ", "Hey guys, congrats on the quarter. Maybe I just want to follow up on the guidance question and I apologize for asking this. The guidance we\u2019ve - on the revenue and EPS right, so basically the way I was looking at it was you had FX which went incrementally worse off. Does that mean that top line is coming in a lot better than expected or you expecting margin to be much better? What was the math behind the EPS guidance, if you will, and do you have any proton orders baked into that?", "Elisha Finney ", "No. So, Vijay as we mentioned just on FX alone we think we\u2019re going to lose close to around $50 million in top line Q2 through Q4 and so if the exchange rate has not changed we would be guiding closer to 6% top line growth the prior guidance was 5% to 6% we are now guiding closer to the 5% growth. We were able to maintain guidance where at the prior level largely because of the Q1, which offset that $0.20 impact as well as we do see some improvements from operations and cost controls and margin going forward into the balance of the year of about $0.06.", "Vijay Kumar ", "So basically you are saying incremental FX headwinds you\u2019re receiving in the model about 100 bps, right, from the time you gave the last guidance is that correct one.", "Elisha Finney ", "Correct. ", "Vijay Kumar ", "Actually, and maybe one in that gross margin clearly phenomenal pull-through on the gross margins, and obviously we don\u2019t have the segment details, is this all sort of coming in from -- sort service also on the oncology system side or sort of how the schedule is there I guess the gross margin pull through.", "Elisha Finney ", "Sure. So oncology I mean obviously we were very pleased with the 45.6% gross margin in the quarter which is well ahead of our long-term margin expectations for oncology and that was driven by product mix shift in service and software clearly driving that as well as a 10 point shift in revenues in North America. So we had kind of the perfect good stone for a change where both the products and the geographic mix that moved largely in that, in our favor. For the year what that means is based on that Q1 performance I think oncology will come closer to a 44% margin rate which means for the balance of the year we continue to think we\u2019ll be in that 43% to 44% range. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Wittes from Brean Capital.", "Jason Wittes ", "Hi, thanks. So, if you could remind us again what the proton assumption is for this year in the guidance you provided?", "Elisha Finney", "Sure. So the assumption is revenues are roughly 65 million so that does not include the Maryland or the Emory or UT Southwest potential deals that are not financed yet, but those are existing proton deals that we are working on with a growth profit of maybe high single digits very low double digit somewhere in that range.", "Jason Wittes ", "Okay. And you mentioned there is five tenders ongoing at the moment, are those potentially things will be here about in this fiscal year or are those something we\u2019ll hear more about or pushed into next fiscal year.", "Dow Wilson", "One you have to hear it when we award it and two you have to hear it when they\u2019re financed. So I think there is a good chance that we hear some news on most of those this year and if there is any financing continue to deal all -- before we\u2019re looking. I think the good news is most of these are outside of the U.S. so there is not financing continuity.", "Jason Wittes ", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And also about the Brazilian tender offer that starting to hit this year, is that a two year process that you fill those orders, how we think about that and how it flow through?", "Dow Wilson ", "No, it\u2019s probably and short version is three quarters of it is slightly over two years but we do think it will be three and maybe even for by the time there all done. We\u2019re beginning shifting in the second half of this year.", "Jason Wittes ", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. It also sounds like the other, the private side of Brazil is also doing well it sounds like is there way that happen at this point?", "Dow Wilson ", "Probably little less than half, that market as we\u2019ve said before pricing is maintaining and by configuration so it\u2019s a good market.", "Jason Wittes ", "And if I can just ask one on software I appreciate you broke out its roughly $500 million run rate for software right now, but you guys done a lot of investing in also -- in expanding our offering I think quite a bit last three years, is there any assumption that the general sort of package that a typical side will double or triple at some level over the next few years that part sort of built into your assumption and kind we\u2019d like to maintain double digit growth.", "Dow Wilson ", "I mean clearly we\u2019re bringing new offerings to the market so we do hope that with every socket there is more opportunity. So that\u2019s clearly a big piece of what we\u2019re driving. And I\u2019d say in the short term the single biggest opportunity is rapid plan and rapid plan we think is $200 million to $300 million over the next three years. It get a 100 orders so far I mentioned on the call we\u2019ve just done our first treatment, we really like that. One of the big investments we\u2019re making is into data analytics, that\u2019s our product called instigative and that\u2019s really good. I think the other kind of exciting thing is, lots of these products are relatively Greenfield outside of the U.S.", "So Asia and Europe have big opportunity and then of course in the U.S. at least for things like rapid plan, InSightive and our new QA product huge upgrade opportunity in those markets. So this continues to be a big focal area for us and I think a really good opportunity for the company strong double digit growth last few quarters and we want to keep going.", "Operator", "Thank you our last question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley.", "Steve Beuchaw ", "Good afternoon, thanks for let me speak on to the wire here. Elisha, lot of good granularity on the impact of currency, would you mind giving us the spot rates that you\u2019re using on the euro and the yen for your calculations of that incremental impact?", "Elisha Finney", "Sure, now and understand there is a kind of the midpoint so obviously we got so much volatility going on right now but our assumptions currently as of the euro that 1.14 began at 1.18 and the Swiss franc at 0.87. I think that was yesterday\u2019s rates were very close to ours.", "Steve Beuchaw ", "Perfect, thank you and then on the tax rate with the R&D tax credit in the original guidance for fiscal \u201915?", "Elisha Finney", "No, so that obviously until it happen we just didn\u2019t want to count on it. So that did help Q1 by about $0.02 to $0.03 and had a significant impact on Q1 because the entire affect have to be taken in that quarter, once you smooth that R&D tax credit over the fiscal year, it impacts the total tax rate - by about 40 basis points.", "Steve Beuchaw ", "Got it, and then a strategic one for Dow, I\u2019d agree with Jeff\u2019s view I mean the U.S. has been a really nice market for you guys likely so when I look at the numbers, my observation is really more that it\u2019s about market share not relative performance. It is really helpful to hear you reflect on the last 12 months or so, and what as you think you\u2019ve done that, that\u2019s really working as you drive in competitive situations in the U.S. and how you see that playing forward?", "Dow Wilson", "I think it starts first with that product out there to being one of the best product when we introduced it, we think the second best product in the market - and both products has just gotten better in last four years. So we are in terrific market position and high end of the market just if we\u2019ve had the number of customers here to Palo Alto and singing phrases of our TrueBeam product so I think we really have a terrific position on TrueBeam. One of the things that customers are looking at is total cost of ownership and on total cost of ownership isn\u2019t always about price. It\u2019s about throughput, it\u2019s about versatility, it\u2019s about volume, it\u2019s about brand and reputation in the market and then it\u2019s also by cost and we\u2019ve I think done a really nice job in our sales team of pushing the differentiation of the product from the total cost point of view. And on the software side, from our software products just keep getting better and better and I think we\u2019re really beginning to turn some heads, I think we\u2019ve been turning heads for a long time in treatment planning, our treatment plan with physician is terrific and I really think over the last 6 to 12 months in oncology information systems especially with the investments we\u2019ve made in our ARIA product and now these new expansions for QA and analytics really getting some traction there.", "Steve Beuchaw ", "Hospital consolidation it hasn\u2019t been a positive for you, do you have an incrementally stronger position do you think in the hospitals there are on the buyer side in those transaction?", "Dow Wilson", "I think we\u2019re equally strong on both sides. I don\u2019t have my market share in front of me but I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty close in both hospital and non-hospital.", "Operator", "Thank you, I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Spencer Sias for closing comments.", "Spencer Sias", "Thank you for participating. A replay of this call can be heard on the Varian investor Website at www.varian.com/investor, where it will be archived for a year.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Spencer Sias, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications for Varian Medical Systems. Thank you, Mr. Sias, you may now begin.", "Spencer Sias", "Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Varian Medical Systems conference call for the third quarter of fiscal year 2015.", "With me are Dow Wilson, President and CEO, Elisha Finney, CFO, and Clarence Verhoef, our Corporate Controller.", "Dow and Elisha will summarize our results, and we will take your questions following the presentation. To simplify our discussion unless, otherwise stated all references to the quarter or year are fiscal quarters and fiscal years. Quarterly comparisons are for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 versus the third quarter of fiscal 2014, references to financial results for orders are the gross orders unless otherwise indicated.", "Please be advised that this presentation and discussion contains forward-looking statements. Our use of words and phrases such as outlook, believe, expect, anticipate, could, should, will, promising and similar expressions are intended to identify those statements, which represent our current judgment on future performance or other future matters.", "While we believe them to be reasonable based on information currently available to us, these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of the important risks relating to our business are described in our third quarter earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this presentation and discussion, because of new information, future events or otherwise.", "Now, here is Dow.", "Dow Wilson", "Good afternoon and welcome. The third quarter was mixed with strong constant currency growth in Oncology Systems gross orders, significant challenges in Imaging Components and a strong performance in Particle Therapy. In summary, we are reporting net earnings of $1.13 per diluted share, revenues of $784 million, up 5% in dollars and 11% in constant currency, oncology gross orders of $635 million, up 2% in dollars and 10%, in constant currency.", "Significant declines in orders and revenues for our Imaging Components business, a big negative quarter-over-quarter impact from a strong U.S. dollar and with the booking of two more a multi-room proton orders as well as significant revenue from the Maryland installation.", "Turning to the operational highlights, Oncology gross orders totaled $635 million for the quarter, up 2% and 10% in constant currency. In the Americas, gross orders were up 4% both, in dollars and constant currency. In EMEA, gross orders were down 2%, but up 13% in constant currency. In APAC, orders rose 8% and were up 21% in constant currency.", "We are really pleased with the constant currency growth in this business. Let me give you some color on each of the geographies.", "Latin America drove the orders growth in the Americas offsetting a 2% decline in North Americas, year-to-date our orders were up 3% in North America and we believe we have gained market share.", "In North America, we booked $4 million of the $25 million long-term orders from a noble [ph] healthcare, which is standardizing on Varian equipment, software and services across its network.", "We also achieved nearly $30 million of competitive to takeouts in North America during the quarter replacing seven Siemens machines as well as 20 installation of software from competitors.", "Clinics in North America and around the world are seeking to standardize on fully integrated cost efficient versatile treatment systems. This is Varian strength.", "Strong demand in Brazil, Argentina and Colombia drove an 82% order increase across Latin America. In EMEA, we booked our largest several orders in Spain for $21 million to supply 10 linear accelerators, including three TrueBeam systems to five hospitals into Asia.", "This order also includes Varian's full suite of treatment planning and Oncology information management software, healthy demand in the U.K., Sweden and Italy as well as wins in Germany, where we capturing share added to the growth in EMEA.", "We completed the operational setup of a new strategic operating entity in Saudi Arabia to better support cancer patients and the medical community in the Middle East. Aramco in Saudi Arabia, placed an $8 million order in the quarter for advanced treatment systems and we also made a strong contribution during the quarter ordering two of our top of the line Edge radiosurgery systems.", "As you may have seen in an earlier press release, Yashoda Hospital in Hyderabad has just treated its 10,000th patients with RapidArc. This is quite achievement and we are pleased to see our fast and efficient systems, making cancer care more affordable and accessible to patients around the world.", "Our new VitalBeam product has now received FDA 510(k) and CE approvals making it marketable in many territories. We received our first VitalBeam order in India and we expect this affordable and upgradable linear accelerator for radiotherapy to be a winner, particularly in emerging markets.", "Overall, EMEA remains a healthy market with year-to-date constant currency orders growth of 6%. In APAC, China again led the way during the quarter with healthy growth in orders, including for the first two Edge radiosurgery systems.", "Stereotactic body radiotherapy was a topic of discussion at our recent users meeting in Beijing, which attracted about 500 customers. Australia also contributed to the growth in APAC, when Radiation Oncology Queensland placed an order to install TrueBeam systems and software at five sites.", "In Japan, we saw some promising developments with order for TrueBeam systems and service that led to strong constant currency growth. We also announced the software alliances with Flatiron Health to develop the next generation of cloud based oncology informatics products, leveraging Varian's expertise in radiation oncology and Flatiron expertise in medical oncology. The alliance will deliver software for our fully integrated powerful cloud-based oncology information product suit.", "Our oncology service business grew orders by 8% during the quarter and represented 42% of oncology systems orders for the period. We remain on track to hit the $1 billion service milestone this year notwithstanding currency headwinds.", "Subsequent to the close of the quarter, CMS published its proposals for 2016 Medicare reimbursement rates in the U.S. Under the proposal, hospitals which represent 90% of the U.S. market for equipment would receive a nearly 2% increase in reimbursement overall for radiation oncology services.", "In freestanding clinics, CMS is proposing an overall reduction of 9% for technical fees and a 3% reduction for physician fees. The impact of these proposed cuts will vary depending upon the mix of patients and treatment protocols.", "We are partnering with radiation oncology stakeholders to express our concern about the impact of the CMS proposals on our customers and on patients' access to cancer care.", "Let me turn now Imaging Components, which experienced another challenging quarter. Gross orders for Imaging Components fell by 25% to $122 million for the quarter and revenue shrank by 17% to $235 million. Security and inspection products revenues fell sharply during the quarter as the market for border protection systems has slowed significantly and customers, particularly in oil-based economies or war zones like Iraq are not moving forward with system deployment for tenders.", "Additionally, customers have put significant pressure on pricing from their suppliers. We expect annual revenues for this business to be off versus the previous year by about $35 million. For security and inspection products, the fourth quarter will also be challenging as the very tough orders comp with the prior year period.", "Severe pricing pressure and a product mix shift caused a significant decline in panel orders during the quarter. Year-to-date orders for the panel business were up 2% and revenues were down 6%. Competition in the radiographic portion of the panel market has intensified and put dollar-based products that are disadvantage.", "We are faced with the challenge of developing new products to meet tougher costs and performance expectations. A bright spot for our panel business is the recent House of Representatives passage of the 21st Century Cures Legislation that contained a provision supported by Varian to incentivize the transition to digital radiography. This bill increases reimbursement for digital radiography while cutting rates for older, less efficient technologies that now move to the Senate and we are hopeful that it sets the stage for more robust panel business in the future.", "Revenues in our Tube business have been relatively flat as improvements in product quality and tube life have softened demand for replacement tubes. While currency does not have a direct impact on the performance of the Imaging Components business, it is having a dramatic effect on customer behavior in all product lines. Customers are actively looking for lower cost alternatives to dollar-based products.", "In the short-term, we are managing this business to maintain our market share. Over the long-term, we are stepping up our imaging investments, including R&D to enhance our competitiveness.", "Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we announced an agreement to acquire Claymount, privately held Netherlands-based supplier of components and subsystems for X-ray imaging equipment manufacturers. Claymount is one of the world's leading suppliers of X-ray imaging components, including high-voltage connectors, generators and those control mechanisms used in medical X-ray imaging.", "With annual revenues of about \u20ac30 million, the company is a supplier to many global medical X-ray equipment manufacturers. This should give us good cross-selling opportunities and offer the added benefit of providing Varian's other businesses and internal source of lower cost components.", "Claymount's products complement and diversify our X-ray product offerings. This will further expand Varian's portfolio of components and subsystems that will enable X-ray OEMs to get their products to market faster and more efficiently.", "The company's other category comprised of the Varian Particle Therapy business and Ginzton Technology Center recorded gross orders of $131 million and generated $91 million in revenue. This was an outstanding quarter for our Particle Therapy business with a significant level of activity.", "We booked the Maryland deal, which resulted in the first profitable quarter ever for this business. We also booked an order for our four room system in the Netherlands. Subsequent to the close of the quarter, we finalized $150 million in contracts to equip and service a five-room center in Manhattan, the first proton facility in New York state also we finalized the two previously announced contracts in the U.K.", "With three centers treating patients using Varian equipment and 11 more projects in backlog, we are now seeing some real momentum in this business.", "Now, I will turn it over to Elisha.", "Elisha Finney", "Thanks, Dow, and hello everyone. Before I walk you through the P&L, let me touch on backlog. The company ended the quarter with $3.1 billion backlog, up 9% from year ago quarter.", "Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $60 million, bringing net orders for the company to $828 million. The backlog adjustment includes $17 million related to currency impact and a $12 million from the cancellation of an oncology order in Ukraine.", "Third quarter revenues for the total company increased 5% in dollars and 11% in constant currency. Total company revenues in the Americas were up 6% in both dollars and constant currency. EMEA revenues were down 1% in dollars and up 12% in constant currency. APAC, revenues were up 11% in dollars and up 20% in constant currency. Year-to-date, total company revenues were up 2% in dollar and up 6% in constant currency.", "Oncology systems posted a 3% decline in revenues during the quarter, bringing the revenue decline year-to-date to 1% in dollars. The vast majority of the FX impact occurred in our oncology business, where constant currency revenues were up mid single-digits for the quarter and year-to-date.", "Imaging Components posted the third quarter revenue decline of 17%, with significant declines in our flat panel and security inspection products and slight declines in our tube products. Year-to-date Imaging Components revenues were down 7% from year ago period, with slight declines in tubes, mid single-digit declines in panels and a nearly 30% decline in Security and Inspection products. As a reminder, Imaging Components sells primarily in U.S. dollars.", "Revenues for the other category increased significantly from the year ago quarter as we recorded nearly $80 million related to the University of Maryland, proton project.", "Total company gross margin for the quarter fell by approximately three points to 40%. Let me walk you through this. Oncology Systems gross margin decreased by about two percentage point from the year ago quarter to 41.9% due to an unfavorable and expected significant shift to lower margin geographies and negative currently impacts. Year-to-date, oncology's gross margin decreased 41 basis points to 43.5%, due largely to currency.", "The Imaging Components gross margin for the quarter fell by more than three percentage points to 38.9%, due to steep declines in revenues from our panel and Security and Inspection products. Year-to-date, Imaging Components gross margin was equal to the year ago period at 41.7%, due to the product cost reductions and improved quality costs that offset pricing pressures.", "The other category, including our proton business, which benefit from a weaker euro, had a 31% gross margin in the quarter, due largely to the Maryland Proton project. While the margin performance was terrific for this business, the higher proportion of proton revenues was dilutive to the overall gross margin for the company.", "Third quarter SG&A expenses were $111 million or 14% of revenues, an improvement 2.5 percentage points from the year ago quarter, when we booked an $8 million charge for the impairment of a portion of the company's investment in Augmenix.", "On an apples-to-apples basis, excluding the impairment in the year ago period, SG&A as a percentage of revenue improved 1.5 percentage points from the year ago quarter.", "Third quarter R&D expenses were $60 million or 8% of revenues, equal as a percentage of revenue with the year ago quarter.", "Moving down the income statement, third-quarter operating earnings totaled $144 million or 18.4% of revenues. Depreciation and amortization totaled $17 million for the quarter and $50 million year-to-date.", "The effective tax rate at 22.1% was down almost 3.5 points from year ago period, due largely to the geographic mix of profits and the use of German tax loss carryforwards that were applied to the proton profits.", "Given the ongoing geographic mix shift, the profits to outside North America and the German tax loss carryforwards, we now believe the tax rate for the full fiscal year will be about 27%. Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased from year ago quarter to 100.5 million, due largely to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted EPS was $1.13 for the third quarter.", "Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $951 million, debt of $495 million and stockholders' equity of $1.7 billion.", "DSO at 83, improved by five days from the second quarter and by 12 days from year ago quarter with the help of strong collections and higher proton revenues. Third quarter cash flow from operations was $184 million, significantly higher than net income, due primarily to working capital improvements.", "Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was $316 million, slightly more than net earnings for the period. Primary uses of cash were $92 million for the purchase of 1 million shares of stock.", "At the end of the quarter, we had 2.9 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2015.", "Before turning it over to Dow for the guidance, I would like to detail two more items. First, as you probably saw in recent press releases, in the third quarter, we extended $35 million in financing for the Maryland Proton project. Subsequent to quarter end, we extended $91 million in financing for the New York project. We will be able to fund these loans using international cash at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 10%. You can find additional details in our public filings.", "Second, given recent acquisitions, including Claymount as well as historical one-time activities that make quarter-over-quarter comparisons difficult, we will begin showing non-GAAP financials in the fourth quarter. We believe this will allow us to evaluate and measure the financial performance of acquisitions on a more appropriate operational basis, easily provide quarter-over-quarter comparisons, excluding unusual items enable better comparability among our peer group and provide additional transparency to the financial community.", "Now, I will turn it back to Dow for the outlook.", "Dow Wilson", "Thanks, Elisha. We expect that revenues for the full fiscal year will increase by about 2% in dollars and by about 6% in constant currency. We ended the second quarter with earnings guidance for fiscal 2015 in the range of $4.02 to $4.14 per diluted share. At the end of the third quarter, with the approximately $0.22 per diluted share for the booking of the Maryland Proton therapy system, partially offset by ongoing challenges in our Imaging Components business, we now believe that our earnings for fiscal 2015 could be in the range of $4.20 to $4.25 per diluted share.", "The company will begin showing non-GAAP results starting in its fiscal fourth quarter. Non-GAAP earnings for fiscal year 2015 should be higher than the GAAP range by approximately $0.16 per diluted share comprised of restructuring charges in the first half of the fiscal year 2015, acquisition-related costs and amortization of intangibles.", "We are now ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Johnson from Robert W. Baird.", "Jeff Johnson", "Thank you. Good afternoon guys. Can you hear me okay?", "Dow Wilson", "Hi, Jeff, I can.", "Elisha Finney", "Yup.", "Jeff Johnson", "Elisha, I just wanted to ask a couple of questions on the proton business to start. One, what are you thinking revenue now for the year. I think, you had been guiding to what, $50 million to $60 million before something. I can't remember plus Maryland, so should we just at those two together? Has the outlook for the year changed?", "Then as you go into next year, it seems like equipment is starting to ship to Emory. I know that hasn't been booked as an order, so that won't flow to P&L yet. It looks like equipment has starting to be delivered, you have got a couple of other projects here that are now starting to deliver, can '16 proton contribution to the P&L be as big or maybe even slightly bigger than it is now in '15 with Maryland in there.", "Elisha Finney", "For the year, Jeff, we are somewhere between, call it, $135 million or $140 million, somewhere in that neighborhood. It is always difficult to predict with precise accuracy, because of the percentage of completion method on when inventories arrive and that sort of thing, but around $140 million.", "Obviously, we are very excited given all of the recent quarter activities in this business. We are not prepared at this point to give any kind of guidance into FY'16. I do think that from the top-line perspective, we will be able to at least get to that number or exceed it by a little bit, not so sure on the profitability only because, Emory, we are we are not going to be including in any guidance as we get into FY'16 until the point where their financing is secured, so that would change our numbers pretty significantly, but stay tuned. We will give guidance next quarter on looking into FY'16.", "Dow Wilson", "Let me just add, we do feel good that we that we have no losses from last year, so the trend is certainly in the right direction. As we get to the end of next quarter, we will take a hard look at each of that each of the systems and where they land in 2016 along with the percent of completion as Elisha discussed. We will give you that guidance next quarter.", "Elisha Finney", "Jeff, just to clarify, Spencer said, he thinks you said that we are shipping to Emory. We are not. There is no equipment that has gone to Georgia at this point.", "Jeff Johnson", "Yes. I think, we got into the article that was boat or something like, maybe that incorrect or something, but that is fine.", "On the tax rate, Elisha, I just want to understand. We knew when Maryland book that there would be a tax rate benefit there as well. That is how there got to be a 22% benefit even though we could never get there and just kind of our normalized look at the P&L, so what would be your tax rate guidance for the year if it weren't for Maryland? Are you changing your ETR guidance for the year ex-Maryland or is the change in the ETR guidance simply because of Maryland, so your core tax rate guidance really is not changing.", "Elisha Finney", "It is kind of hard to parse it out for one deal. Let me just say that I believe even without Maryland, we would have had perhaps a one point reduction in our tax rate, because that is why you will see Q4 return to a more normalized 28% to 29% and it will get us to roughly 27% for the full fiscal year.", "Jeff Johnson", "Okay. Then my last question just, Dow, on the imaging business, obviously, two rough quarters here. I mean, is this something we should just think of as two, two-and-a-half more rough quarters. We kind of reset the base that this 20% lower level or is this something that could extend for a couple years of kind of gradual bleed down and just how to conceptually think about that. I will just leave it at that. Thanks.", "Dow Wilson", "It is a good question. I think there is two pieces of it. First of all, the security piece is very tough to call. As Elisha, as we said in the call, that business is down about $35 million year-over-year. It is a cyclical business, oil prices are at a historic low, and we just do not see that oil-based economy which has our largest customers about 75% of that business is outside of the U.S. and huge chunk of that is in the Middle East.", "The security board of protection side of that we see as kind of being very cyclical and I think that is going to remain soft for a while. We do not see that bouncing back right away. The flat-panel business, we talked about in the script some product mix issues as people are shifting to lower performance, lower cost products and we are seeing price pressure in that business that I think in part is related to the dollar denominated business, so it is kind of the one way of seeing the FX in that business.", "We are seeing our customers there press very hard for cost reductions for local suppliers and evaluating competitive alternatives, so I think we have got you know several quarters of kind of tough sweating here in that that business. Good news is that the two businesses seem pretty stable and we are pushing hard on the innovation front in this business.", "I think, as we look to next year, it will be helped by the acquisitions, clearly we are announcing Claymount today and that the MeVis acquisition that we announced earlier this year. I would say what are we, six months in, it looks very good and we are very pleased with where the MeVis acquisition is going for our components business.", "Jeff Johnson", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore.", "Dow Wilson", "Hi, Vijay.", "Vijay Kumar", "Hey, guys. How is it going? I had a two-part question, so maybe I will start one on the margin front right now. Just given everything that we have seen sort of on the competitive landscape, I know it sounds if FX and mix, but can you just walk us through sort of the some of the drivers, because I am not sure I understand that the gross margin now progressed here.", "Elisha Finney", "Sure. Let me just kind of walk you through Vijay, by business. I mean, oncology the good news there is year-to-date, they are right at 43.5%, right, smacking the middle of the long-term range that we are trying to get to a 43% to 44%, and that is despite the significant FX impacts that we have had.", "Our revenues for FY'15 on a constant currency basis are down about $125 million for total company, just due to direct CapEx and most of that hits our Oncology business, so they have done a very good job at maintaining margins.", "In the quarter, we expected that they had just a huge shift to international deliveries that was an eight point swing quarter-over-quarter and that was built into our guidance and when we talked about their margin last quarter, I believe we mentioned that, so I am quite pleased with how oncology has been able to maintain margins in a really tough FX environment.", "ICB, this is our Imaging Components. It is a volume business, so when we have significant declines in volume, it just flows through the gross margin, which is exactly what you saw in the third quarter. Again, year-to-date, kudos to the team, they have maintained gross margin even with a year ago period by going back to suppliers, by getting cost reductions by reducing costs every way they can, improving quality.", "I do think we are going to obviously have some pressures as we go into the balance of the year on the gross margin for the Imaging business, but again they have done a tremendous job so far this year on keeping it flat year-over-year.", "Then the total company will obviously impacted as well by proton, they had a terrific quarter, but it is still lower than the overall company gross margin, so it was dilutive to the company's gross margin, but a great performance by protons in the quarter.", "Vijay Kumar", "Thanks Elisha. That was helpful. Down, one big picture question for, all right? I know that you have got a lot of momentum on the proton side of the business, right? A couple of them the deal sort of you enter into some really, really attractive financing terms, right? I guess, some of the questions I got from investors was, by financing more of these deals is Varian taking on some sort of balance sheet for us over the longer-term right, all the mix when I am looking at the company 5 years or 10 years, so is there going to be balance sheet for us and I am just curious to hear your thoughts.", "Dow Wilson", "It is a really good question. I think, first of all, the process around this is very robust. It is reviewed with the audit committee of our board. We are really pleased that Maryland and New York, we are in with other smart money from investment banks, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, you know, so we are not doing this by ourselves by any stretch.", "We have contributed financing for Scrips Maryland and New York. We are not likely to increase our exposure to any other developer kind of deals. We consider financing small projects with other smart money in the right way and making sure that we have got great due diligence with outside reputable partners.", "We do evaluate this every quarter with our audit committee and we are pretty comfortable with the position we have at this point time. Elisha, would you add anything?", "Elisha Finney", "Yes. I would just add that with the exception of New York, which is unique in the consortium model, all of our recent quarter activity have been cash paying customers and clearly when you have got 10% interest on the debt, the economics to cash paying customers in these deals is much better.", "Early on, we have really had to do this in order to jumpstart our proton therapy business. Last thing I would say is we are generally speaking on the exact same commercial terms with the bulge banks so we are secured by the assets of the property.", "Dow Wilson", "I would say, maybe just to add, long-term, we are not here to be financing equipment. That is not our vision. This is the market development model as we bring this business up and we have got the balance sheet to do it, so we will do that in the short-term, but it is not something we view as a long-term play for the company.", "Vijay Kumar", "Got you. One quick one Elisha housekeeping, did you talk about the service versus product contribution to the oncology gross order growth?", "Elisha Finney", "We talked about the fact that service was up 8% in orders, in dollar. I do not have that broken out by constant currency, but it would be higher. It would clearly be in the double-digit. Yes.", "Vijay Kumar", "Great. Thank you guys.", "Dow Wilson", "Thanks, Vijay.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley", "Dow Wilson", "Hi, Steve.", "Steve Beuchaw", "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. First a strategic question for you, Dow, I wonder to what extent do you today, or longer-term, think about that the wins on the proton size drivers of Linac market share. I mean, I asked to ask the question, because there is a pretty high profile wins that you are getting here.", "Dow Wilson", "We like the fact that they are high profile wins. It certainly has not hurt. Having said that, our market share in our accelerated business is very high and we have been gaining share. I actually would say that the share I think we have gained in the last 18 months looks, the wins that we have had, there is may be - that you could count them on one hand number, the number of Linacs we have won.", "So far the markets share growth we have seen in the last 18 months is not directly attributable to any proton deals as there is some broader halo effect. I would say it certainly hasn't hurt us and it might help us a little bit.", "I would say that one of things that we really like is the fact that from a customer point of view, it is one treatment planning system, it is one oncology information system. You know if you are a patient and you are getting brachytherapy, radiation therapy, proton therapy, we have got you and that is one treatment plan that is integrated and that works really well.", "Then for our users, you know, we have brought the user interface together, so when you look at TrueBeam and ProBeam protons and photons, radiation therapy and photon therapy is very, very common and for customers that will be using both, that is a big advantage because they can leverage their resource across their therapy enterprise.", "Steve Beuchaw", "Okay. Thanks Dow. Elisha, just a couple of quick housekeeping items, so thanks for flagging the non-GAAP transition that is coming up. I wonder if you know off-hand what the delta between GAAP and non-GAAP would have been in 2014 just as we think about getting our models ready for the change.", "Then second question is, as you contemplate the outlook for the fourth quarter, do we see a bounce back in oncology gross margins? You commented on imaging, but I did not hear a comment there on oncology if you do not mind. Thanks so much.", "Elisha Finney", "Okay. I do not have FY'14 at this point, Steve. I would tell you that it was complicated, because if you remember you can basically pull out Augmenix and you can pull out [ph] in FY'14 and our amortization of intangibles run roughly $2 million a quarter, so that can kind of get you there. In terms of Q4, that maybe your follow-up question. Of that $0.16, roughly 2 pennies would be non-GAAP additive to our GAAP guidance for Q4. In terms of Oncology's margin, again for the full fiscal year, the lead will be somewhere about 43%, so that puts Q4 closer to the 42%. Again, just based on product mix and geographic mix that was seeing in the quarter.", "Steve Beuchaw", "Okay. Great. Thanks again, everyone.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from David Roman from Goldman Sachs.", "Kyle - Goldman Sachs", "Hi. This is actually Kyle filling in for David. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions.", "In your prepared remarks, you mentioned recent success on the software side of the business. I was hoping you could provide some specific parameters around the dollar revenue contribution from software in the quarter.", "Then perhaps briefly discuss the flat Flatiron partnership and how that stance enhance or transform your current services offering?", "Dow Wilson", "Sure. On the software side, I think all we have well we talked about is in fact that it is about $0.5 billion a year. We do not break it out as a quarter. We feel very good about its growth. In the last five, six quarters, it has been doing very well. I would say high single-digit kind of performance in oncology, the Velocity acquisition that we did last year is kind of idea of treatment plan, imaging data, informatics, demographics anywhere.", "Do you want to see it on your iPad, your iPhone, at home, in the office is really kind of what is driving that strategy and the Flatiron alliance is one more kind of brick in the wall here, where what we are looking at is we really do well in radiation oncology and we now want bring one of the leaders in medical oncology together with us to provide great informatics for the cancer patients, be it radiation or medical oncology, and that will be we think a really nice addition. The other thing it allows us to do is, pivot to the cloud and those would be cloud-based implementation. ", "There are some other products we introduced about a year ago that are part of the driver. We introduced InSightive, which is the informatics product for radiation oncology and we introduced Qumulate, which is not that expensive of the product, but turn out to be a big deal for our customers to really drive best practice sharing and quality in the areas of quality assurance for our customers.", "Kyle - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. Then just maybe one quick question for Elisha, when you speak about indirect FX headwinds, their impact on Imaging Components business and your intention to retain share ex-U.S., is the implication that you have done the same volumes abroad and have heavily discounted price or has share come under pressure there as well?", "Elisha Finney", "Let me make sure I understand your questions. On the FX indirect, I mean, the ICB revenues this year will be down roughly $50 million from last fiscal year, which as we said about $35 million of that is coming from our security and inspection product, so that is where we are seeing the bulk of the falloff. I think it close to 30% year-to-date. In the tube?", "Dow Wilson", "Maybe another way of saying that is, pretty much all of our business in Imaging Components is contracted in dollars, so you do not see an FX adjustment, because all the business is in dollars, but we are seeing customers put a lot of pricing pressure on us. As I said in the call, there are shop in alternatives in-sourcing or competitors to look at their cost position.", "Kyle - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thanks very much. That is helpful.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.", "Tycho Peterson", "Thanks. Elisha, just first on guidance, I do not know if you said whether Claymount is in guidance or not. Can you clarify?", "Elisha Finney", "Claymount is going to be immaterial to this fiscal year either on a GAAP or non-GAAP basis, so it is either direction. It is less than a penny impact. Just given that it won't close until the 1st of August.", "Tycho Peterson", "Okay. Then the only delta and proton is Maryland? Is that new in this quarter guidance versus last?", "Elisha Finney", "Maryland, which was a $0.22, I am not sure I am understanding your question, Tycho.", "Tycho Peterson", "I mean, I guess, nothing else different versus the prior guidance around proton?", "Elisha Finney", "No.", "Tycho Peterson", "Okay. I guess, Dow, on the reimbursement with 77418 going away, I mean you talked about lobbing and hoping to kind of get that overturned. Maybe just can you talk to the risk if that does not give overturned, what you think was with the down coding of procedures into the simple category?", "Dow Wilson", "Yes. I mean, clearly as we have talked about on the call before, the freestanding market is a very small piece of U.S. equipment market now, so probably it is somewhere between 5% and 10% of our global market, so the impact over several years of reimbursement reduction is kind of what has happened to the markets. 10 years ago, this market was a third of our business, but today it is 5% to 10% at the very most, so I think that the impact on equipment is very, very small.", "For our customers, this is a big deal and we have got to support them in this. Radiation therapy is still one of the highest value adding modalities for treating cancer and one of the lowest costs, so we have got to make sure that we are in there with the fight.", "Some of our customers have taken and a look at this. Those that have a little bit higher prostate mix are going to be impacted higher and those that aren't, we have one of our very large customers think that the impact will be pretty balanced for them.", "Now they have worked hard to bring new level of complexity and round out their product mix, so they are doing more SRS and SBRT and treating more lung liver and neck, breast kind of cancers, so I think for those kinds of customers the impact is quite overstated.", "Tycho Peterson", "Then I guess just lastly on Oncology, I mean given kind of what we are seeing an orders and some of the margin dynamics Elisha talked about earlier, are there additional things you can do on the supply chain side? I mean, you talked about your initiatives in the past to try to improve the margin on TrueBeam and some of the products, but are there additional levels you can pull from a supply chain perspective to credit tech?", "Dow Wilson", "Yes. We are going at it with a vengeance. The good news is our TrueBeam volume is growing dramatically and with VitalBeam kind of on that same platform more and more of our product is that platform, so we in fact have volumes synergies that we can offer our suppliers, we are going out and doing that. We are looking at a lot of low-cost country moves in our supply chain.", "I would say, historically, we probably averaged 2% or 3% variable cost productivity. In the last year or two, we are probably twice that. We would like to get even a little bit more, we just completed the summit of our global supply chain teams in all of our businesses, especially in this FX environment that we are in.", "We have got to leverage these costs. Frankly, in some way our supply chain is a little bit too high cost country base, so we have got some opportunity there and are going after it very hard.", "Tycho Peterson", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Wittes from Brean Capital.", "Jason Wittes", "Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. First, I wanted to get a tally on proton, I know there is 11 orders and backlog. Can you give us a sense of how many orders out there or not accounted for yet in backlog, but contracted for.", "Maybe on top of that a general sense in terms of whether you think the pace that we have seen in the first half of this year or sort of continue into the second half of the calendar year in terms of the proton wins that you have been seeing?", "Elisha Finney", "I will take the first part of that question. That is the easy part. I will get the - There is only two deals, Jason, that are off the street, if you will, but that we had not put into backlog. Those are both subject to financing and that is Emory, which is a developer projects and University of Texas South west also a developer projects, subject to financing.", "Jason Wittes", "Those were both in the $50 million to $60 million range?", "Elisha Finney", "Emory is a little bigger.", "Dow Wilson", "\u2026right between there and Emory is a little bit north of that. Yes.", "Jason Wittes", "Okay.", "Dow Wilson", "I would say in terms of the market, we are seeing two things. One outside of the U.S., we are seeing very good activity. You kind of see that in the backlog. I mean, the most recent deals, nice win in Denmark, nice win in Holland, two nice win in the U.K. I think we are still seeing very good market.", "Outside of the U.S., we are starting to see a fair amount of activity in China, so that part of the market is robust.", "I think that how the U.S. market is changing and the historically it has been just kind of multiple vault center and I think we are seeing U.S. market shift to a one and two room center market. We have a fair amount of activity going on there to see this market whether there single vaults, two vaults or five vaults, it is still slow from conversation to purchase order.", "I think the forecast what that is going to be like it is pretty tough, but I will say that we feel pretty good about the funnel in terms of the many conversations that are going on out there in the market.", "Jason Wittes", "You are competing on the one to two room right now or?", "Dow Wilson", "Absolutely.", "Jason Wittes", "Okay.", "Dow Wilson", "Yes. We launched about a year ago our ProBeam Compact and it is a terrific product with probably the highest throughput of anybody in a single room market, were a little bit more expensive, but what you get for that is no compromise in the quality of treatment and extremely high throughput.", "Jason Wittes", "Okay. That is helpful. I just wanted to ask you a quick follow-up to Elisha on the guidance. If I look at the top-line numbers that you are giving out now, I think you are saying 2%. That is with now $87 million I assume from Maryland, 80% which I think saw this quarter.", "It looks like you are going from saying 1% to 2% to 2%, which means there is about a 1% loss of growth in the core business. Can you kind of reconcile where that wealth came from? In addition, assuming you get $0.22 plus from the Maryland facility, it looks like we lose about a dime net-net if we look at the bottom-line guidance.", "Again, is that all imaging or is that a combination of imaging and oncology. Just I would like to kind of understand the moving pieces little better?", "Elisha Finney", "Yes. Let me take that second part and go through kind of a guidance walk for fiscal year '15. As at the last time we guided the net point was 408, you then add in the Maryland Proton deal at $0.22, you get to 430.", "We have about a $10 million pre-tax Q4 issue in our Imaging Components business, largely in SIP, but in flat panel as well, so that is where you loss that $0.07, if you will, to get back to the 423.", "Then of course moving to non-GAAP, we can add about $0.16 to that $1 to get to the new mid-point of 439.", "Jason Wittes", "Okay. Fair enough. Sorry to interrupt.", "Elisha Finney", "That is okay. Then of course because we have only quarter left, we narrowed the range from where we were previously and because FX at least for the moment seems to have kind of settled down in that 109 to 110 range on the euro.", "In terms of revenue, I should just say for total company, we have spent a lot time in the last quarter or two getting much more detail on our constant currency reporting. For fiscal year '15, the year-over-year impact to revenue is about $125 million, so it was huge just given the 20% decline in the euro and the yen.", "Yes we did come off from early on the oncology number. We have got oncology in for the full-year at about 1% in dollars, that we would clearly be mid-single digits if it were in constant currency.", "The bulk of we are continuing to see some declines is in our Imaging Components business and we did have to come off the revenue number a little bit in Q4 for that. Then you are right, the proton business now will be closer to around $140 million, which gets you to total company about 2% in dollars.", "Jason Wittes", "Okay. Just one quick follow-up for that and that is, it looks like that Imaging business declined further from the last quarter, which I think was somewhat anticipated, but do you have a sense of that is the normalized number that we are looking at now or should we anticipate further declines in that business for the next couple of quarters?", "Dow Wilson", "Yes. I mean as I said in the script, I think we have got some we talked about SIP. We think it is going to remain down for a while just where that market is, oil prices. 75% of that business is outside of the U.S. and a huge chunk of that is in the Middle East and they are just not just buying, so I do not see the SIP portion of this rebounding as Elisha said year-over-year. It is down about $35 million.", "Then in flat panel, we are seeing some pricing pressure. I think that is kind of how we see FX. It is one way of how are seeing FX in that business and we are seeing customers move their mix down market a little bit with the pricing environment that is out there and specking lower capability, lower priced product.", "I think, we have probably got a year of challenge in that business. Clearly, we will give you more guidance on that as we get to next quarter.", "Elisha Finney", "Of course, Jason, I do not know if you missed, but the Claymount and MeVis acquisitions will help offset that somewhere around $50 million of revenue on a combined basis.", "Jason Wittes", "Okay. Got it. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. We have time for one last question. Our last question comes from Toby Wann from Obsidian Research Group.", "Toby Wann", "Hey, good evening, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just kind of a quick update on how things are progressing, customer acceptance and uptake on RapidPlan as well as EDGE?", "Dow Wilson", "RaipdPlan, it can go fast enough. We love it, our customers love it. We have got a lot of installations planned for this next quarter. We are expanding the capabilities that the product has. I forgot to list it in the list of the exciting software activities that we have got going on across the business, but it is probably the single biggest driver that we have in the business right now and that is really good.", "We do have a significant release coming out of engineering early in August, so we have got lots of customers lined up to take that release. Just as a reminder for everybody on the call, the kind of efficiency and productivity we are seeing is 60 minutes to 90 minutes per plan, and that is huge for our customers and we are not talking about the quality piece of that, so it is at a minimum 6 to 90 minutes faster and we really believe as we have measured this in some places at some institutions, but we want to measure at more broadly as we get the product out there.", "We think that there will be a very significant quality improvement as well. Our vision behind this product is why cannot every planner in the world be as good as our best planner and that is kind of where we are going with the product.", "Anyway, I think fourth quarter would be an exciting quarter for us with lots of installations coming and with a little bit more of a clinical report for you next quarter.", "On EDGE, to the second part of your question, one of the things that we are seeing that we really like is, we are having conversations, and the galvanized market is a replacement market. Let us just start with that and what we are seeing is more and more of those customers as they come to a source refresh or our replacement decision, there having a Linac-based conversation with us.", "We know in stereotactic radiosurgery, the product is as good and then on top of that you get the capability for doing lung and liver, so the economics are wonderful, so we are having more and more action in that market, so we like to EDGE products position a lot and the see the momentum is growing and one of the places that we are seeing it grow is in this galvanized [ph] take out market.", "Toby Wann", "Okay. Thank you. That is helpful. Then just a quick one on pricing, people still behaving rationally or just kind of an update there on the oncology side.", "Dow Wilson", "I would say that the market is just crazy as ever. We are certainly not seeing any - I think the way the question - someone just asked have we seen any change and I would say no. That is kind of the same pricing market that we have had for a while.", "Clearly, our competitors had a leadership change and they have lost some share, so we continue to see them being aggressive. Things like EDGE and the things that we are doing at the top end of our product line are helping some of the places we have price pressure and I would say kind of overall, while it is aggressive, we have kind of maintained from the last quarter.", "Toby Wann", "Okay. Then just quickly thoughts about, more macro-oriented thoughts on China, you guys have put up some pretty phenomenal numbers there this quarter and we keep hearing that the Chinese economy is it going off the cliff chicken little, just kind of some thoughts there maybe to dispel some of the rumors out there?", "Dow Wilson", "Thanks for the question. I was just there and I do not see it stopping. Here is my macroeconomic indicator of the week. Like 3 miles from the airport to the airport hotel, I counted 39 trains. That is probably more trains than California [ph], and it is just when we had this users meeting over there, we had 500 customers and we have grown double-digit now there many quarters in a row.", "Speaking of EDGE, we sold to EDGE systems in China in the third quarter. Some of the conversations we have not had in China before, we are having now which are around software and protons. I mean I read the paper and read about some of the macroeconomic, but certainly as it comes to healthcare in our business in particular, we are not seeing at all.", "Toby Wann", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Spencer Sias for closing comments.", "Spencer Sias", "Thank you very much. Thanks all for participating.

Fourth Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Spencer Sias, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications for Varian Medical Systems. Thank you, sir, you may begin.", "Spencer Sias", "Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Varian Medical Systems' conference call for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. With me are Dow Wilson, President and CEO; Elisha Finney, CFO, and Clarence Verhoef, our Corporate Controller. Dow and Elisha will summarize our results, and we will take your questions following the presentation. To simplify our discussion, unless otherwise stated all references to the quarter or year are fiscal quarters and fiscal years. Quarterly comparisons are for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, references to financial results for orders are to gross orders unless otherwise indicated.", "Beginning this quarter, the company is recording non-GAAP results in order to provide quarter-over-quarter comparisons of operational performance excluding unusual items. Our reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure is included in our earnings release which can be accessed on our website. Please be advised in this presentation and discussion contains forward-looking statements. Our use of words and phrases such as outlook, believe, expect, anticipate, could, should, will, promising, and similar expressions are intended to identify those statements which represent our current judgment on future performance or other future matters. While we believe them to be reasonable based on information currently available to us, these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.", "Some of the important risks relating to our business are described in our fourth quarter earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this presentation and discussion because of new information, future events, or otherwise.", "Before turning it over to Dow, let me advise you that given our investor meeting at ASTRO last week, as well as the information we'll be providing on this call, we're cancelling our year-end meeting that was scheduled to take place in New York next week.", "And now, here is Dow.", "Dow Wilson", "Good afternoon and welcome. As you will have seen from the pre-release that we issued ahead of our investor meeting at ASTRO last week, the fourth quarter was marked by some earnings challenges, as well as orders successes in two of our three businesses.", "In summary, we are reporting non-GAAP net earnings of $1.04 per diluted share, up from $1.03 in the year ago quarter, revenues of $818 million, up 1% in dollars and 6% in constant currency, oncology gross order growth of 5% in constant currency, orders totaling more than $135 million for three proton therapy systems, and significant declines in orders and revenues for our Imaging Components business.", "Focusing on operational highlights in our oncology business, gross orders totaled $919 million for the quarter, equal in dollars, and up 5% in constant currency versus the strong year ago quarter. Orders for the fiscal year totaled $2.7 billion, equal with the prior year, but up 6% in constant currency in line with our long-term mid single-digit growth expectations for this business.", "Orders in the Americas for the quarter declined by 5% in dollars in constant currency versus the year ago period when we booked the large part of the Brazil tender. For the year, orders in the Americas were up 1% in dollars in constant currency. In North America, orders grew by 4% in the quarter, and 3% for the year. In EMEA, orders grew 13% in dollars, and a robust 25% in constant currency during the quarter. For the year, orders in EMEA were even with the year ago period in dollars, and up 12% in constant currency.", "Gross orders in APAC were down by 3% in dollars, but up 6% in constant currency for the quarter. Annual APAC orders were even with the prior year in dollars, and up 9% in constant currency. We gained share against the competition in all three regions of the world for the year. Our team in EMEA set a record by booking orders for over 100 accelerators with strength across the region. In the U.K., the National Health Service selected Varian to supply up to 20 TrueBeam systems. In Poland, we booked orders to supply 11 public radiotherapy centers with TrueBeam systems, and software replacing the older Siemens systems.", "In India, we booked the first tranche of a five-year 18 accelerator order, including an EDGE radiosurgery system. We will book the remaining tranches when their delivery dates come within our two-year booking window. In APAC, a customer in Japan placed an order for three TrueBeam systems together with our new RapidPlan and InSightive Analytics software products.", "In North America, our oncology team had several nice wins from customers, including Memorial Sloan Kettering, Alliance Oncology, and Cleveland Clinic. Competitive takeouts added to our orders for the quarter, and for the year. In North America alone, we estimate that we generated over $150 million in orders during the year to replace hardware and software products from our competitors. Over 40 sites switched from other suppliers to our Eclipse treatment planning software during the year. As you know, we have just returned from ASTRO in San Antonio. It was a great show for us with terrific customer response to our exhibit. Our booth was the busiest of the show, and we had over 800 attendees at our users meeting.", "During the show, we provided a glimpse of the next big breakthrough, high definition radiotherapy and radiosurgery. This is a new 4 Pi technique that will compress more dose into the tumor while protecting much more of the surrounding healthy tissue. Clinicians working with TrueBeam's unique developer mode are using simultaneous motions of the treatment gantry and patient couch to get a huge increase in the number of beam angles available for targeting the tumor. High definition radiotherapy is under trial at UCLA, and is not yet ready for broad commercialization.", "So we expect that high definition treatments, coupled with our multi-modality imaging capabilities at the treatment console will make a much bigger gain in the fight against cancer than is possible with an expensive hybrid device, combining MR imaging, and limited treatment delivery. And we also generated a lot of excitement in our booth at ASTRO.", "Varian's industry leading RapidPlan software, which has already been ordered at over 300 sites, was the hit of the show. As we pointed out at our investor meeting there, numerous independent clinical studies show impressive time savings and quality that is equal to or better than plans generated manually. At the University of Michigan, RapidPlan has enabled complex spine SBRT plans to be generated in 15 to 20 minutes, instead of the usual 60 to 90 minutes.", "At the Royal Surry Hospital in the U.K., the use of RapidPlan reduced treatment planning time by a factor of five, and resulted in plans that were deemed equivalent or better 90% of the time. With RapidPlan, a dosimetrist can help five times as many patients as could be done with conventional planning products. This is a product that could help new centers in emerging markets get up to speed with high quality planning very quickly.", "There are nearly 4,000 cancers centers worldwide using our Eclipse treatment planning software, and each of these is a potential candidate for RapidPlan. So we expect it to help drive significant growth in software sales. We've developed RapidPlan disease site models for a number of cancers, including prostate, head and neck, and lung, and there are more to come. To strengthen our treatment planning offerings, we acquired HyperDrive software technology during the quarter to improve the quality of prescriptions, and accelerate the planning process. Our new VitalBeam product received FDA 510(k), and CE Mark approvals during the quarter.", "We've received several VitalBeam orders, and early signs are this affordable extension of the TrueBeam platform will be a winner, particularly in emerging markets. TrueBeam now comprises more than 70% of our global accelerator orders, and 90% of our accelerator orders in the U.S. Before I leave Oncology Systems, I want to draw your attention to a groundbreaking study issued by the Lancet Oncology Commission, highlighting the global need for more radiotherapy equipment. According to this report, by 2035, there will be 25 million new cases of cancer diagnosed annually, and we will need to supply the world with more than 20,000 new machines to equip new centers, as well as replace aging infrastructure.", "The need is greatest in low and middle income countries. The report is recommending that, by 2020, 80% of these countries should establish national cancer plans, and make radiotherapy part of their universal health coverage. Over the next 10 years, the commission recommends investing $46 billion in these countries to expand radiotherapy capacity. This will require education and training of thousands of doctors, physicists, and therapists. Varian has established a market development team that is partnering with governments, financiers, clinicians [audio gap] and patient advocacy groups to support this effort.", "Let me now turn to proton therapy which drew a lot of customer attention at ASTRO. We have real momentum in this business. In the fourth quarter, we booked more than $135 million in orders for three multi-room systems, including two in the U.K., and one in New York. This brought the number of proton orders booked in the year to six systems, totaling more than $300 million.", "At this point, we have 11 projects in backlog, and we are currently working on more than six installations. Treatments are expected to commence at the University of Maryland early next year, which will bring the total number of centers treating patients with Varian proton technology to four. The key to making the proton therapy business profitable are continued success in the market, reducing product costs, and scaling up the service business. We feel like we have momentum in these areas. ", "Let me now turn to imaging components, where orders shrank by 30%, to $165 million for the quarter, resulting in a full year orders decline of 16% for this business. This was another challenging quarter in an exceedingly tough year, particularly in our security and inspection business. Orders for panels were down for the quarter, and for the year driven primarily by price. Unit volumes for these products were up slightly from the prior year. Our imaging components' competitors are largely European and Japanese, and they got about a 20% reduction in their cost structure due to foreign exchange movements. They're using this to grab market share.", "Customers are looking for lower priced alternatives, including insourcing. In fact, one customer has elected to insource, and the impacts of this loss in fiscal year 2016 will be about $50 million of revenue. The security and inspection products business was also down sharply, with annual orders off versus the previous year by about $60 million, representing a decline of more than 55%. The security business remains profitable, and we're looking at a lot of options for getting the business back on track.", "To address the ongoing challenges for the overall business, we have initiated numerous corrective actions to make our product lines and operations more cost competitive. These include a restructuring to right size the business, accelerating product developments, including our new low cost flat panel, and stepping up marketing efforts, particularly in Asia. We are opening a facility near Shanghai to support a rapidly expanding X-ray equipment manufacturing industry in China.", "On a positive note, we feel very good about two new acquisitions we have made to complement our Imaging Components business, MeVis and Claymount. In fiscal year 2016, we're looking for about $50 million of revenues from these products, and they are both off to a good start.", "Now, I'll turn it over to Elisha.", "Elisha Finney", "Thanks, Dow, and hello everyone. Before I walk you through the P&L, let me touch on the backlogs. The company ended the fiscal year with a $3.5 billion backlog, up 10% from the year ago period. Backlog adjustments during the year totaled 215 million, with approximately 50 million of that related to currency exchange rates. Just to clarify, my P&L walk is on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP versus non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our press release.", "In summary, fiscal year GAAP operating earnings were approximately 27 million lower than non-GAAP earnings due to restructuring, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition related costs, and certain litigation costs. Also for comparison purposes, we have provided in the press release a GAAP versus non-GAAP reconciliation for 2014 and 2015 by quarter.", "Before I walk you through the numbers, let me just say that exchange rates wreaked havoc on our 2015 results. We estimate that on a constant currency basis our reported results would've improved as follows. Orders would've been up by about 175 million. Revenues would've been up by about 140 million, and on the earnings front our operating margin would've been about one point higher. Let me point out that this FX impact was felt primarily in Oncology Systems. On top of this, as Dow explained, currency driven price erosion had a huge impact on our imaging components business, and that effect is incremental to the numbers that I just gave you.", "Now turning to the P&L, third quarter revenues for the total company increased 1% in dollars, and increased 6% in constant currency. Total company revenues in the Americas were down 1% in dollars, and flat in constant currency. EMEA revenues were up 5% in dollars, but up 18% in constant currency. And APAC revenues were down 2% in dollars, and up 5% in constant currency. For the year, total company revenues were up 2% in dollars, and up 6% in constant currency.", "Oncology Systems posted a 2% increase in revenues during the quarter, up 9% in constant currency. And for the year, oncology revenues were flat with the year ago period in dollars, and up 6% in constant currency.", "Imaging components posted a fourth quarter revenue decline of 8%, with a 5% increase in X-ray tubes, flat revenues in panel products, and a 57% decline in our securities and inspection products. For the year, imaging components revenues were down 7% from the year ago period, with tubes down 1%, flat panels down 4%, and security products down 37%. Revenues for the other category increase from the year ago quarter as we continue production and installation of several proton projects that are in our backlog.", "Total company gross margin fell by nearly three points to 38.9% for the quarter, and by more than a point to 41.4% for the year. Currency exchange rates, price erosion in imaging components, and a higher mix of lower margin proton revenue led to these declines. Oncology Systems gross margin decreased more than two points in the quarter and nearly one point for the year, due almost entirely to currency exchange rates. Given the ongoing strength of the dollar, we believe Oncology's growth margin will remain at about 43% for 2016.", "The imaging components gross margin for the quarter fell by nearly five percentage points, to 38.9% due largely to pricing and mix. For the year, imaging components' gross margin decreased by more than a point to 41% also due to pricing and mix. Given the pricing pressures we are experiencing, the 2016 gross margins for this business is likely to remain in the high 30s.", "Fourth quarter SG&A expenses were about 15% of revenues, down almost a point as a percentage of revenues from the year ago quarter. For the year, SG&A expenses were about even with the year ago period, at 15% of revenue. Fourth quarter R&D expenses were 69 million or 8% of revenues, up about one point as a percentage of revenue with the year ago quarter. And for the year, R&D expenses were about even as a percentage of revenue, at 8%.", "Moving down to income statement, fourth quarter operating earnings totaled 135 million or 17% of revenues. For the year, operating earnings totaled 576 million or 18.6% of revenues. On a constant currency basis, the operating margin was approximately one point higher. Depreciation and amortization totaled 19 million for the quarter, and 69 million for the year. The effective tax rate was 25% for the quarter, and 26% for the year. Both down significantly from the prior period due to geographic mix of products, the use of German tax loss carryforwards, and the unusually high 2014 rate.", "Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased from the year ago quarter, to 99 million shares, due largely to our ongoing share repurchase program. The diluted non-GAAP EPS was $1.04 for the fourth quarter, and $4.29 for the fiscal year. The strong U.S. dollar negatively impacted our non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.15 in the fourth quarter and approximately $0.40 for the fiscal year.", "Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of 845 million, debt at 496 million, and stockholders' equity of 1.7 billion. DSO at 90 [ph] was up five days from the year ago quarter. Cash flow from operations was 153 million for the quarter, and 470 million for the fiscal year. The primary uses of cash during the quarter were 128 million towards the repurchase of 1.5 million shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 1.4 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends from calendar year 2015.", "Now, I'll turn it back to Dow for the outlook.", "Dow Wilson", "Thanks Elisha. We believe that for our fiscal year 2016, total company non-GAAP earnings will be in the range of $4.45 to $4.55 per diluted share, and revenues were increased by about 4% to 5% on a reported basis versus fiscal year 2015.", "For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenues to be roughly even with the year ago quarter and dollars. With ongoing challenges experienced by Imaging Components in the second half of fiscal year 2015 as well as the effect of year-over-year changes in currency exchange rates, we expect non-GAAP earnings for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 to be in the range of $0.88 to $0.92 per diluted share.", "In summary, we believe that Oncology Systems is on the right track with continued steady profitable growth and that we have real momentum in our Particle Therapy business. We are focusing now on getting Imaging Components back on track.", "We are now ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.", "Vijay Kumar", "Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Dow, maybe first one I think you had some interesting commentary on the overall market in terms of the spectacular market share gains you guys have been seeing, right? I guess my question is ex the market share gains, what is the underlying radiotherapy market growing within North America, right? So, I am just trying to get a sense in how long should we think about these sustained market share gains sort of going forward?", "Dow Wilson", "Yes. I think on the quarter what we saw in the Americas, the Americas was up \u2013 I am sorry, the Americas in total was down 5%, North America was up 4%, Latin America was down very significantly, as you'll recall in the fourth quarter of 2014, we booked a large portion of the Brazil order. So, when you kind of peel the onion on it, we were very comfortable with where we saw the U.S. market at in the fourth quarter, and all year that was kind of \u2013 we did gain from shares or maybe half of the increment is share gain and half is market growth and also markets probably in 3%-ish range, and we were coming in at 5%-6% constant currency adjusted range.", "I think as you saw at ASTRO, we are very comfortable with our product portfolio and the position we have across the product line. I think it's strong as our product line has ever been. And we are very encouraged by the reception we had at ASTRO. So going into ASTRO, I have already said \u2013 and maybe we can maintain share after a pretty good share gain, but coming out of ASTRO we're more bullish than ever. So until we get a 100%, we are going to keep going after some more share gain.", "Vijay Kumar", "That was helpful. And maybe one on EPS guidance, Elisha, so I know that the guidance excludes $0.50 of potential contribution from Emory, right? So, I know last year when you gave the guidance, you had a similar issue with Maryland, right? And I think at that point installation was complete. It was just a question of financing being in place. Can you walk us through what are the sensitivities around the Emory recognition for this? Is this in a similar place or you've installed that, it's just a question of getting the financing in place? Thank you.", "Dow Wilson", "Yes. Let me make a comment, and Elisha can then add some color on the accounting. We have not shipped Emory yet. So that's very different than our position at Maryland. The building is nearly ready for installation, and the banks are working on financing. Now, Elisha can talk to the guidance impact.", "A - Elisha Finney", "Sure. And the reason it won't be quite as material as Maryland, because with Maryland we were much further along because we had actually shipped and begun the installation. So, under the percentage of completion, we anticipate depending on when this financing if and when it gets completed, but it could be as much as $0.15.", "The other impact in the guidance this year versus last year is also we are continuing to have some FX impact in our first half, and that's really concentrated in Q1 because the FX rates really didn't change that much until we got into our second quarter last year. So we are facing a Q1 headwind on FX. That should start to stabilize as we get further into the fiscal year, and we anticipate about $0.15 on the full fiscal year '16.", "Vijay Kumar", "Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.", "David Roman", "Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody.", "Dow Wilson", "Hi, David.", "David Roman", "How are you doing? Hey, Elisha. I know you gave a lot of detail with respect to the individual business operating lines on the call, but maybe Elisha you can help us maybe about the bridge from the first quarter earnings guidance through the balance of the year, particularly in light of the commentary that I think one of the explanations for the fourth quarter shortfall was a slippage of recognition revenue from Q4 into fiscal '16, and maybe just help us bridge the Q1 to the full year.", "A - Elisha Finney", "Sure. So, the full year remains as we talked about last week, it is a 445 to 455. For Q1, if I take that $0.90 at the [audio gap] of that $0.10 push out of Q4, and when you add that back, you'll see kind of that mid single-digit, if you were to do all of that math, mid single-digit EPS growth on an apples-to-apples basis. And I went back and look historically Q1 has always been right around 20% to 22% of our total year. That's exactly what this Q1 is. I think last year was bit of an anomaly where our Q1 given an unrealistic gross margin we had in oncology, it was a good thing that quarter, but it ended up being closer to 25% of our total fiscal year. So, it gives me confidence that we are kind of in that historical range at about 20% of our year.", "David Roman", "Okay. And then, maybe just coming back to the Imaging Component, and Dow, you talked about reinvesting to try to get the business back on track. At what point do you start thinking about other strategic alternatives for that franchise, particularly given some of the pressure that you've described sound more sort of structural in nature rather than cyclical?", "Dow Wilson", "Yes. Clearly, we are going to watch where the price goes this year. Historically, it's been a terrific business for us with very good growth and companywide best operating profit, and cash generation has also been very good. So, we still love the flat panel and tube part of the business. The security part of the business is very profitable. The profitability of that business hasn't changed, but it's very cyclical, and we get some big turns there.", "We like the fact that we're the leader in digital imaging technology. And so, we've got both a strong product portfolio as well as scale in the business. And there are synergies with our oncology business. The oncology is the second largest customer of that business. About 10%-12% of the product cost of our oncology business comes from our components business; over 1500 tubes and panels a year. So, there is some vertical integration that we look at.", "I think what's happened is this business experienced the FX change in a different way than the rest of the world experiencing it. Since more than 75% of the business is outside of the U.S. and largely Japan and Europe, and since it's almost entirely denominated in dollars, there was no FX constant currency adjustment to make into the business. And so, the way that was felt was in pricing, as I said in the script.", "So clearly, that's what we are going to be watching where this business goes. But we had one customer insource as I said on the call and we've been through the rest of our pipeline. We have got contracts with everybody else. We feel like the rest of the business is secure. We are working very hard on some new products that will drive some feature and benefit. They have a full chance to hit the price as well as give us some cost reduction. And you've seen some acquisitions from us in this space this year. Those acquisitions are enhancing the portfolio, giving us some scale, and they are executing ahead of our internal plans by a little bit. They are 150 [ph] million together, Claymount and MeVis. So it's not huge, but we like what they are doing for us.", "And I think the key for us to watch here in 2016 is where does this price go? It's pretty stable in the dynamic sections of the market. In the radiographic piece of the market, there is a lot of competitors, there is need for some consolidation in this market, and we are going to watching that over 2016.", "David Roman", "Okay, terrific. Thank you for all the perspective.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Wittes with Brean Capital. Please go ahead with your question.", "Jason Wittes", "Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Listen, clearly the oncology business is trending along very nicely. I think a lot of investors are obviously a little bit concerned about what's going on with the visibility on imaging, and I appreciate there has already been a few questions on this. But if you could just walk us through how you got to your assumptions for this year in terms of how you think this bad market will grow. You said there is about $50 million of revenues that are going away this year. I know you mentioned currency. I imagine there is some acquisition in there, but what other issues might drop and what else is baked into the assumptions that you put out there?", "Dow Wilson", "I mean, the pricing assumptions we kind of let's go through, we do have this one of our large customers coming out, that's worth about $50 million. I think Elisha can comment on margin rate. We do have the two acquisitions that are positive 50 million of revenue for us, and I think at a high level those are the assumptions we're looking at.", "A - Elisha Finney", "Yes. I think one difference this year versus last year, Jason, is when we had our security business fall off 56% in one year, that was unprecedented, and frankly a surprise to all of us. That business today \u2013 I don't think we can go a whole lot lower, because half of it today is service. So, I just don't think you are going to see the steep decline that we experienced last year in SIP. If you just look at tubes and panels last year how many orders, they were down in the single-digit on a combined basis. So, I think we could have weathered a good bit of that, but when our highest margin product line fell more than 50%, that was just something that was hard to get over.", "Dow Wilson", "And maybe we did say the business would be flat a few percent. So that's kind of \u2013 with the acquisitions in and out, that's kind of what we're looking at the high level. And the other thing that I mentioned in the script that we probably ought to highlight as well is that we have done a restricting in the business taking out about 10%-ish the headcount in the business.", "Jason Wittes", "Okay. And my understanding is that flat panels is clearly where there is a large increase in competition, what percentage of the imaging business is flat panel at this point?", "Dow Wilson", "It's about 50-50, flat panel and tubes. Yes\u2026", "Jason Wittes", "And the last one on security \u2013 thank you. And the last question on security, I know that the price of oil has impacted that business. In your understanding, how that business might shape up in 2015 or something is not right now?", "Dow Wilson", "We had forecasted it flat, so no improvement. It is lumpy. So, maybe there is a blue bird that happens in the year, but we have not forecasted. Markets remain \u2013 I mean most of this business is in oil-based economies. We've seen very little tender action. So, with the visibility we have is that there will be no improvement in that segment of the business in 2016. Coming back to the earlier question, this is the place that we will at a high level look at strategic options.", "Jason Wittes", "Very good, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.", "Steve Beuchaw", "Hi. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking\u2026", "Dow Wilson", "Hi, Steve.", "Steve Beuchaw", "Hey, Dow, I would like to follow-up on the commentary you made early about your reflections on ASTRO. You talked about the durability of share gain, I wonder if you could just spend another minute on it. What is that that you think in 2016 has the company still well positioned? Is it more about software or is it more about distribution? What do you think in '16 the key to the share gain storyline?", "Dow Wilson", "I mean, I think our strongest point at ASTRO was our treatment planning product, RapidPlan. You have to be able to plan the treatment, and there is nobody that does that better than we do. The efficiency \u2013 I think for me, the most exciting part about ASTRO was to see these papers coming out, documenting what we marketed the year before. So, we launched this last year. We felt very good about it. But to see these papers that I mentioned in the script come out documenting both the efficiency improvement as well as the quality improvement have been dynamite, and that's a big deal.", "Second, as we go into an environment that's uncertain from a reimbursement point of view, total cost to ownership is everything, and Varian advantage there is \u2013 there is nobody close to us with that. There will be some niche products out there that probably get some play in some segments, but I think people are still going to be looking at value for money and how to stretch their capital dollars. I think the strength of our product line from top to bottom on the hardware side is very good. And then, our software products are as good as ever. People really responded well to the insight of analytics and some of the population informatics \u2013 population health and informatics tools that we have. And then, coming back to where I started is I think our treatment planning is dynamite. That's how the treatment planning process starts. And given the advantages we have on the hardware side to be able to take advantage of it, you have to have a great treatment planning product, and that's what we do that nobody else is even close to.", "Jason Wittes", "And then maybe dovetailing with that lot of commentary, I wonder if you could talk about VitalBeam and how you see VitalBeam playing overall in the portfolio? You kind of little bit further than I originally anticipated in terms of geographic product registrations on VitalBeam, where do you see that's sitting in the portfolio over the next year or two?", "Dow Wilson", "I mean it's a product that we think of is great for emerging markets and is really going to help us expand the market. It's an entry point for value markets and a chance to sell up. One of the truly important roles in the portfolio is to price protect the high-end of the product line in those markets, and it's doing that very well, and we really like what we've seen. We have seen good price stability on the TrueBeam as VitalBeam is coming into these markets. And we're starting to get some pretty good uptick on product.", "Jason Wittes", "Okay. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.", "Tycho Peterson", "Hey, thanks. Dow, can you maybe just add a little bit more on the TrueBeam delays? I understand a lot of those have already come through, but I guess if we think about some of the larger deals, longer term deals you are signing, you had one back in 2Q you called out, should we expect maybe a little more lumpiness in order shipment?", "Dow Wilson", "I'll say first of all that none of the delays had to do with a large order. These were all one-offs. So, while \u2013 I am not going to deny the consolidation of the market on the revenue side of the business that we haven't seen any impact related to a consolidating market for our revenue. This is about site readiness and acceptance testing, and getting all the documentations on and kind of punching it through. I think as we said, we have $25 million in TrueBeam and related software slip out of the quarter, and those were all one at a time, and each one was very painful.", "Tycho Peterson", "Okay. Are there lessons learned from your perspective around understanding customers better or\u2026", "Dow Wilson", "A lot of lessons learned that \u2013 so we have looked at both some of the process things we do and we have made some pretty significant changes in our organization since the quarter to make sure that we are strengthening it and enhancing it, so that this doesn't happen again.", "Tycho Peterson", "Okay. And then outside the U.S., EMEA big quarter, maybe just talk to the sustainability of trends and other things that we should be keeping an eye on in some of the emerging markets that could maybe mix or some quarter-to-quarter volatility?", "Dow Wilson", "EMEA had a terrific quarter. So, we really liked what we saw there. It was broad based. In the script you heard me mention the U.K., Poland, and India. So that was very good. I would say that on an ongoing basis, there still is very significant opportunity in India, and we talked about Africa in the past. I would say in 2015, Africa was quiet-ish, and so there is a lot of \u2013 I would say the pipeline there looks pretty good, so maybe we'll see that market come back. There's still a lot in Eastern Europe. I'd say the funnel looks pretty good in Eastern Europe. The core markets of the Middle East were pretty good in 2014, a little quieter in 2015. I think the funnel there looks pretty good in 2016.", "China, it's still hanging in there. I mean, it's not \u2013 if we were growing close to 20-ish % in \u2013 fell 13, 14s \u2013 last year it was lower than that for sure. But we're not seeing a tank by any stretch. So, it's probably in the five to 10 range.", "Tycho Peterson", "Okay. And then last one on HDRT, it's still years away, but can you maybe help us think a little bit about the development costs. How should we think about R&D trending over the next couple of years? I know it was up kind of 1% here this quarter, but how do we think about this on a go-forward basis?", "Elisha Finney", "That's one operating expense, Tycho. I think you should just accept we will be about equal at the percentage of revenues. So we did a step-up to, I think it was years ago, from 7% to 8%. You should anticipate it should be roughly 8%. If we get a bolus of proton orders or sales in any given quarter it'll be a little lower, but all else equal, about 8% of revenue.", "Dow Wilson", "Yes, I think one of the things that really resonated with our customers at ASTRO was the overarching vision that we had around it. There wasn't product as that relates to products, and ref wreck, and income statement things, there's a variety of things that come this year. There are some things that'll come in '17, and a few things that'll come even after that. For example, this idea of any image you take you wanted the treatment console to help drive a hypofractionated treatment. We can do a lot of that with our Velocity product today. So part of the vision, we think we'll get some update by the way with our Velocity product. We've seen a very good reception to that product since we acquired it, 18 months ago or so.", "And it's made a nice role for itself in the product portfolio, and in the family. The image quality improvement for cone beam CT, we should see in the next year-ish. And I think people are very excited about that. And then the first phase of the 4 Pi we can actually do no existing hardware. So we're not going to have to introduce \u2013 and we've heard the stock since 2010, on the strength of the TrueBeam platform and the amazing capabilities, and especially the speed of those capabilities. These are all things that we designed in from the beginning. There is software work to be done, but a lot of this can be leveraged on \u2013 most of it can be leveraged on the existing hardware platform. So, that's the other thing, is it'll be a software capability that we can take back to our, now, 1200-ish units TrueBeam installed based.", "Tycho Peterson", "Understood, thank you.", "Dow Wilson", "And I should say this, that none of this stuff is a pipedream. A lot of this being already worked in the developer mode by our research customers worldwide.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.", "Anthony Petrone", "Thanks and good afternoon. Maybe a couple on proton and one strategy question for Dow. Just on protons, maybe you can give us a sense on the backlog for single-room systems, and maybe what's reflected in fiscal '16 guidance? Would additional orders for the contact system actually increase to what you're putting out there for guidance? And then as you work out, do you generally see, and the noise out of ASTRO, was that protons eventually could address 20% of the market needs. Do you see that happening, and if so, over what timeframe?", "Dow Wilson", "I'd say, I mean for the first part of the question, the answer is zero and zero. So we have nothing in our backlog, and we have nothing in our guidance because we're not going to put anything in the guidance that's not in our backlog. We've learned that lesson, as we've discussed already.", "Elisha Finney", "Let me clarify, would you have 350 million of proton backlogs just\u2026", "Dow Wilson", "That's right. Sorry, thank you. There was no single-rooms in our backlog. Having said that, we have a very active funnel of single-room systems, and I'd be surprised if we didn't see one or a few of those land in 2016. And as that happens we'll have some ref wreck upside maybe to report. But we have not put any of those in the backlog.", "As to what percent of cancer patients are indicated for proton therapy. I think since the minute we've been in this business, it was part of the first thing that we did is due diligence. We thought the number would be somewhere between 10% and 20% of all cancer patients would be indicated for proton therapy. So that number is consistent with what our assessment was in our due diligence getting in a few years ago.", "Elisha Finney", "And Anthony, let me just clarify one thing. Under this percentage of completion method in protons, it's a little different in that we get to essentially recognize the revenue kind of linearly over the project. So if we were to get a compact order in the year, as soon as we specify equipment for a particular customer, we buy parts, we start putting it together, and producing it. We start revenue at that point. So we don't have to wait until it's built and shipped before we get any revenue.", "Anthony Petrone", "That's helpful. And maybe just a strategy question in the follow-up is really on the timing of the shift to non-GAAP earnings from GAAP earnings. It seems to follow the Claymount acquisition, and I think that's valued at around EUR 52 million. So it doesn't seem like a lot of intangible creation. And so at the same time, Dow you mentioned, consolidation in imaging, and the cash balance is approaching around a billion as of the quarter end. So maybe just an update on the M&A strategy, is this sort of an indication that the company may be getting more acquisitive as time goes on?", "Dow Wilson", "We did a few acquisitions last year. We like them both a lot. One is a pure software play MeVis computer aided diagnosis for both breast and lung cancer. We think there's an opportunity, given our distribution channel to leverage that product globally. And we're seeing some very good development opportunities in the oncology business there with some of the image processing things that they do. So that's encouraging. Claymount is a little more hardware. It's largely a cable and connector business. It's very synergistic with our tube business. It has the same customer [audio gap] factoring costs in the Philippines. I think we \u2013 these are capabilities that we can leverage across the company.", "In terms of our broader M&A strategy, I think it's the same. We're always interested in things that we can do to strengthen our oncology business. On the hardware side, I don't see a lot there just because there's isn't much that's too close to us. But on the software side and the infomatic side maybe there are some things. And then we're going to continue to hunt as well the components base. We think scale matters there as the industry consolidates. It's been a rough year, but we've had terrific growth in this business. We've now \u2013 we believe that we're the largest manufacturer in the world of tubes and panels, even given some of the insourcing that the big radiology companies do.", "So we've got a strong strategic hand to play in that business. And we like, even despite some of the 2015 rocky roads that we've been through, we like the cards that we have. And think we've got a good strategic hand to play given our scale.", "Anthony Petrone", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird. Please go ahead with your question.", "Jeff Johnson", "Thank you, good afternoon guys.", "Dow Wilson", "Hi, Jeff.", "Jeff Johnson", "Hi, Dow. So let me start, I guess, with a couple just last final, hopefully, question on oncology here. As we go into a new fiscal year, these issues have been vetted in the past, but maybe just an update as we look forward to year here. One, just any update on the manufacturing side of oncology as you push costs out closer to where some of your revenues are recognized. I know you're going through the re-org in ICB, but are there still opportunities to push manufacturing costs down on the oncology side, number one.", "And number two, Colleen kind of alluded last week to some of those Brazil orders starting to come out into the P&L or maybe it was Elisha, sorry. Last week, those Brazilian orders starting to come out into the P&L in '16. How do we think about the gating at this point of those Brazil orders? Are we going to get a first bolus kind of in '16, and then a similar '17, similar '18 or is it going to build over the next few years?", "Elisha Finney", "It's going to build, Jeff. So we've built in one to two handfuls of Brazil shipments in the second half of the year, primarily. So, this is going to be something \u2013 it's going to take a number of years for this to all work through the P&L and the margin.", "Dow Wilson", "Yes. And then relative to your first question, we are looking very hard at our supply chain in oncology. I mean the cost in this business, our actual labor content is very, very small. We do final assembly and test, which testing is very, very important. You got to get that right. We are pointing radiation at patients. We want to make sure that's done in the highest-quality fashion. So, we always want to make sure that that part of the process is very robust. Today, I would say the vast majority of it's done here in Palo Alto, we have some capability in China, and we are building some capability in Brazil.", "So, China and Brazil will bring the cost per unit of that down, but we are still very significant here in Palo Alto, but the real cost opportunities on the supply chain side as we made very good progress on that in 2015, and that continues to be a focus area for us. I am very pretty pleased with the variable cost productivity we are getting in oncology. We're seeing at least mid single-digit kind of variable cost productivity in oncology.", "Jeff Johnson", "All right. That's helpful. Thank you. Then may be two follow-up questions on the proton business; one, Elisha, maybe can you talk about the gating of proton revenue and earnings recognition this year? Is it going to be pretty consistent on a quarterly basis throughout the year? Obviously, as you get into the third quarter, you have got to dig 23 \u2013 22, 23 bolus of Maryland hurt a little bit, but Dow, I think I remember at our healthcare conference, you talked about the proton earnings contribution this year is probably going to be similar if not higher in '16 over '15. So, just trying to figure out how that gates out the model?", "A - Elisha Finney", "Sure. So, the earnings contribution will be negative. I know it's verbally pretty similar to what we saw in FY'15 and FY'16. I am assuming that we are going to have roughly 20 million more proton revenue this year versus last year, just given what we are delivering on in the backlog. But remember the Maryland deal was pretty profitable because of the way it was a bolus of revenue, and because it was a very large center. So it should be about even with the year ago period in terms of the impact on the P&L, and of course the big wildcard being do we get Emory, and do we get any compact that we can book that are currently not in the backlog?", "Jeff Johnson", "All right. That's helpful. And then, last question on proton, just with regards to the Emory deal, does the UTSW issues that are happening down in Texas and bankruptcy filings down there and some legal hassling or legal wrangling I should say between kind of one of the donors there and then I think it's between him and ATP, does that impact Emory at all? And what does that do to the longer term potential of UTSW?", "A - Elisha Finney", "Sure. So, Jeff, from my knowledge, I mean these are all separate legal entities with separate investors and lenders and equity players, and so, one is insulated from the other. So I do not believe that it's going to have a big impact on Emory. I can tell you that we are still engaged with banks helping answer questions, so that APT can in fact get their financing put together. And longer term for UT Southwest, I do know that UT Southwest has indicated they are very interested in still having a proton center. And so hopefully, this litigation will get worked out and we can go to work for them and get it installed. But that's a ways off.", "Jeff Johnson", "Yes, fair enough. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toby Wann with Obsidian Research Group. Please go ahead with your question.", "Toby Wann", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Quickly on the oncology side of the business, can you maybe shed some light on the services side, how that was during the quarter, as well as the software side of the business?", "Dow Wilson", "Yes. I mean both were very strong in the quarter. Services were hit from a currency point of view, but constant currency basis, it was right where we expected it would be 9%-10%. Software is equally strong largely on the backs of RapidPlan.", "Toby Wann", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Spencer Sias for closing remarks.", "Spencer Sias", "Thank you. Thank you all for participating.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Spencer Sias, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications for Varian Medical Systems. Thank you, Mr. Sias. You may now begin.", "Spencer Sias", "Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Varian Medical Systems\u2019 conference call for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. With me are Dow Wilson, President and CEO; Elisha Finney, CFO, and Clarence Verhoef, our Corporate Controller. Dow and Elisha will summarize our results, and we will take your questions following the presentation.", "To simplify our discussion, unless otherwise stated all references to the quarter or year are fiscal quarters and fiscal years. Quarterly comparisons are for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 versus the first quarter of fiscal year 2015, references to financial results for orders are to gross orders unless otherwise indicated.", "This discussion includes non-GAAP financial measures in order to provide quarter-over-quarter comparisons of operational performance excluding unusual items.

We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this presentation and discussion, because of new information, future events, or otherwise.", "And now, here is Dow.", "Dow Wilson", "Good afternoon and welcome. Varian is reporting revenues and earnings above our expectations for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, while managing through some challenging conditions in our markets and we\u2019re raising our earnings guidance for the year.", "In summary, we are reporting non-GAAP net earnings of $0.99 per diluted share and $0.91 per diluted share on a GAAP basis. Revenues of $757 million, up 3% in dollars and 7% in constant currency. Soft orders in our Oncology Systems business, we expect the declines in Imaging Components orders and revenues and good news on the tax fronts with a permanent R&D tax credit and the suspension of the medical device excise tax.", "Focusing on operational highlights in our oncology business, gross orders totaled $533 million for the quarter, down 5% in dollars, and down 1% in constant currency. Gross orders in the Americas for the quarter increased by 3% in both dollars and constant currency with the fastest growth in Latin America. Gross orders in North America rose by 2% in dollars and constant currency.", "In EMEA, gross orders declined by 14% in dollars and 5% in constant currency. Gross orders in APAC declined by 12% in dollars and 7% in constant currency with continued market contraction in Japan and a modest decline in China.", "Global markets have been weakened by ongoing political unrest, weak oil prices, and economic uncertainty. In EMEA, for example, Russia announced further delays in its cancer plan, Germany scaled back investments, and the Middle East was negatively impacted by political unrest and falling oil prices.", "On a positive note in EMEA, we received an order from the UK\u2019s National Health Service for our further 10 TrueBeam systems during the quarter. The National Health System has now ordered more than 50 TrueBeams in the last few years for its cancer programs. Economic uncertainty was also a prime cause of weakness in Japan, which led to an overall orders decline in APAC.", "In China, gross orders declined slightly. As of the end of the first quarter, we continue to see hospitals in China aiming to invest in advanced radiotherapy and radio surgery systems for their cancer patients. We booked several orders for EDGE radiosurgery systems in China during the quarter.", "In the Americas, the multi-million dollar Siemens replacement project in Argentina and a key Ministry of Health in Chile drove the growth in Latin America, while North America continued to move forward with investments, and our new product platforms to replace aging systems.", "We\u2019re focused on global market development through our Access to Care Initiative. And educational program that\u2019s fixed the bridge the gap between the growing need for a modern radiotherapy treatment machines in developing countries and a lack of trained personnel to operate them. This program is already working in Africa and Vietnam, and we took steps during the quarter to initiate this program in India through an educational partnership with Apollo Hospitals Group. This program will train radiation technologist in India.", "We made good progress with our software business during the quarter. Licenses for RapidPlan, our tool for enhancing efficiency and quality in treatment planning has tripled since the end of the fiscal year and are now installed at over 50 sites. Clinical networks, including a healthcare system in Victoria Australia that took for licenses during a quarter are rebuilding treatment capabilities around RapidPlan.", "Turning to our Oncology Service business, orders were up 1% in dollars, but up 6% in constant currency compared with a strong year-ago quarter.", "Let me turn now to Imaging Components, where orders shrink by 22% to a $127 million for the quarter, and revenues fell by 150% to a $141 million. Again, in the second-half of last fiscal year, this business has been confronted with currency-related pricing pressures, weak market conditions for security and infection products, and enforcing at a major panel customer. These challenges together with excess tube inventory at a key customer contributed to the declines in this business during the quarter.", "Volumes for tubes were down in the quarter, while demand for our higher margin dynamics fluoroscopic panels increased and led to a sequential improvement in the gross margin for Imaging Components. Our recent acquisitions MeVis and Claymount gained momentum in the quarter and are performing well. As a remainder, we\u2019re aiming for about $50 million in revenue from these newly acquired businesses this fiscal year.", "Moving to protons, we make good progress with installations. During the quarter, we turned over the first room of the Maryland Proton Therapy Center for a clinical commissioning and first treatments are slated to begin next month.", "We have successfully extracted beam from the Cyclotron at Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital, where patient treatments are scheduled to begin before the end of the year. Installation is also underway at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland, and we are scheduled to begin installations at sites in Holland, Russia, and Saudi Arabia later this year. Proton order activity was quite in the quarter, but our prospects for booking several more systems this year continue to look good.", "Before I hand it over to Elisha, I would like to say how proud I\u2019m that Varian has been honored for its commitment to sustainability by being included for the second year in a row on the Corporate Knights Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations list, which compares to sustainability performance of some 4,600 companies globally. This was announced last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Elisha.", "Elisha Finney", "Thanks, Dow, and hello, everyone. Dow has already covered gross orders, so let me start with backlog. We ended the quarter at $3.3 billion, up 7% from the year-ago period. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $55 million, bringing net orders for the company to $617 million.", "Now, let me walk you through the P&L. First quarter revenues for the total company increased 3% in dollars and 7% in constant currency. Oncology posted a 5% gain in revenues during the quarter with a 9% gain in constant currency. So with a significant geographic mix shift towards international revenues, which grew 21% in dollars and 31% in constant currency versus a year ago quarter, while North American revenues declined by about 10%. International business constituted 55% total oncology revenues in the quarter.", "Imaging Components posted a first quarter revenue decline of 15% with decreases in tubes, panels and security, and inspection products. Our Particle Therapy business posted revenues of $27 million, up $18 million from the year ago quarter, as we continue to make progress on projects and backlog.", "The total company gross margin for this quarter was 41.1%, down as expected by a little more than 3 points. Oncology Systems gross margin also fell by about 3 points to 42.4% due to geographic and product mix shift, as well as minor currency effects. Imaging Components gross margin for the quarter fell by about 1.5 points to 30.7%, due largely to lower pricing and volumes.", "First quarter SG&A expenses were $124 million, or 16% of revenues, an improvement of about one point as a percentage of revenues with the year ago quarter. First quarter R&D expenses were $60 million, or 8% of revenues equals to the year ago quarter as a percentage of revenue.", "First quarter operating earnings totaled $128 million, or 17% of revenues, down about 2 points as a percentage of revenue from the year ago quarter and in line with our expectations for the quarter.", "Depreciation and amortization totaled $19 million for the quarter. The effective tax rate was 24.8%, down almost 4 points in the year ago quarter, due largely to the geographic mix of profits and the R&D tax credit that was reinstated in late December. We now expect that the tax rate will be about 26 to 27% for the year.", "Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased almost $4 million from the year ago quarter to $97.8 million, due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted EPS was $0.99 for the quarter.", "Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $953 million, debt of $728 million, and stockholders\u2019 equity of $1.6 billion. DSO at 99 days was up significantly from the year ago quarter, due to a lower mix of Imaging Components business, a higher mix of proton business, and the timing of collections and oncology.", "First quarter cash flow from operations fell slightly from the year ago period to $77 million. Primary uses of cash for $27 million for CapEx and a $192 million for the repurchase of 2.4 million shares of stock.", "At the end of the quarter, we had 7 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar 2016.", "Now, back to Dow for the outlook.", "Dow Wilson", "Thanks, Elisha. Including the effects of the R&D tax credit re-enactments and the suspension of the medical device excise tax in the U.S., we now believe that for fiscal year 2016 total company non-GAAP earnings will be in the range of $4.55 to $4.65 per diluted share. We continue to expect that revenues for fiscal year 2016 will increase by about 4 to 5% over fiscal year 2015.", "For the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, we expect revenues to be up 1 to 2% from the year ago quarter in dollars. We expect non-GAAP earnings for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 to be in the range of $1.06 to $1.10 per diluted share.", "We\u2019re now ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Johnson from Robert Baird.", "Jeffrey Johnson", "Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Can you hear me, okay?", "Dow Wilson", "Hi, Jeff, yes.", "Elisha Finney", "Hi, there?", "Jeffrey Johnson", "Hey, great. So, Dow, one question for you and one question for Elisha, and let me start off with the question for you, Dow. So it\u2019s not a little bit maybe more cautious on some of the European and given that the Middle East and your European number on your oncology side a little more cautious on Europe and APAC. Is that the right read here? And I guess, as I look back over the last several quarters, we\u2019ve seen oncology orders in both those markets in negative territory, I think three out of the last four quarters. Is that kind of where we should level set, I know you don\u2019t guide the orders. But just given your comments in terms of last several quarter trend line, is that kind of where we should be still hanging out with our thoughts for the year?", "Dow Wilson", "Let me say that maybe this is going to cast it in a broader view for a second, Jeff, and then kind of comes from the regional data\u2026", "Jeffrey Johnson", "Sure.", "Dow Wilson", "When you look at the last 12 months in oncology, in dollars, it\u2019s down 2%, in constant currency, it\u2019s up 4%. I mean in the first quarter, it\u2019s not the greatest growth that we have ever had. Our funnel remains very good. So, we like what we see.", "The fourth quarter was huge for us in Europe. Constant currency and dollar growth in Europe was outstanding in Q4. So, our Q4 was 12.5% constant currency growth last quarter. So, maybe there was a little bit of quarter-over-quarter balancing going on. So I think the 12 months trailing is kind of what we are seeing right now. Clearly, we are reading the papers like everybody and some of the macroeconomic weakness in Europe is real. I mean, we did have a light Q1.", "But I think we\u2019re \u2013 we still see markets growing in that low to mid single-digit range at this time. We haven\u2019t seen anything that would pull us off that. Japan has been the ongoing structural change in Japan. In China, we did have a win in the quarter that was protested.", "So, I mean, we\u2019re very close to flat in China. Our funnel remains very good in China. So I think Japan is probably going to be more of the same, that\u2019s been a pretty consistent story over the last few quarters. But I do think China will come back. The order that was protested was up a fairly large order. So, that was in our numbers that China would have been great. But anyway, I mean, those are the kinds of things that\u2019s happened around a quarter, I would say over the long haul within the last 12 months, we haven\u2019t seen anything that would at this time pull us off of market growth number in that kind of 3 to 5 range.", "Jeffrey Johnson", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And, yes, the 4% you cited is a trailing 12 months you\u2019re referring to that worldwide.", "Dow Wilson", "Yes.", "Jeffrey Johnson", "So kind of mixed wise we think North America a little bit stronger maybe than others going forward, is that fair?", "Dow Wilson", "Yes, last \u2013 when you look at it in pure dollars, Americas last 12 months is at 4.5%, and international was down 6.5% in dollars. Constant currency adjust the whole thing at 4% up. So that\u2019s kind of, I mean, last 12 months is that kind of the market that I think we feel \u2013 we\u2019re still feeling.", "Jeffrey Johnson", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then Elisha, the question now for you just around EPS guidance. Since you guided back in October, the euros kind of works a little bit more against you, I think a little bit stronger dollar against the euro since you guided some of the emerging market currency still go in the wrong way.", "So if I look at as a dime raised to guidance here, how much was net debt tax in R&D driving that dime raise? How much kind of in the guidance number is coming from those two things? How much of an incremental currency headwind was there, if any included in your guidance? And then maybe how are you thinking about the core underlying business? So just trying to bucket kind of those three areas on what contributed to the dime change in guidance?", "Elisha Finney", "Sure. So, Jeff, the simple answer is, if I take the R&D tax credit and the medical device excise tax together, it\u2019s a dime for the year. So and that\u2019s roughly even at about $0.05 each. So we got a benefit of $0.04 in Q1, so those two impacts. And what we\u2019re saying is the additional $0.06 is going to come from Q2 to Q4. So essentially we took the benefit from those two things impacted onto the prior guidance and got it to the 4.60 midpoint.", "Jeffrey Johnson", "Okay. Then underlying then kind of the core business, I\u2019m trying to figure out if currency I thought was an incremental headwind since you last guided. Does that imply that your core expectations have improved a little bit?", "Elisha Finney", "Well, I mean, in certainly Q1, we feel good about and in terms of what I would refer to as an operational bid if you take out the $0.04 related to the tax impact, we had about a nickel deep. And that was due to higher oncology revenue and frankly very good cost controls on SG&A little bit on share repurchase is a little bit more than we\u2019ve historically done, but in line with that 1 to 2 million shares per quarter.", "I think your next question is going to be why don\u2019t you get into that nickel? And I\u2019m still a little black and blue after Q4, frankly. And when we miss on that revenue number, it\u2019s very early in the year. And I think that just had to do with some timing and I think oncology did a fantastic job and probably pulled a little bit revenue forward from Q2 and Q3 to make sure we didn\u2019t have a repeat performance.", "But for the year, we \u2013 it still looks good with the revenue guidance and the EPS from where we stand today. Currency from when I last guided has been relatively stable. I mean, it may have heard us, I don\u2019t know, I think I was at 112 versus 109, but again we built some of that into the range for the guidance when we give it.", "Jeffrey Johnson", "All right. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Hazan from Citi.", "Amit Hazan", "Hey, good afternoon, guys. Can you hear me okay?", "Dow Wilson", "Yes, yes, good morning.", "Elisha Finney", "Yes.", "Amit Hazan", "So, good afternoon, so\u2026", "Dow Wilson", "Good afternoon, yes.", "Amit Hazan", "Start on the gross margin line maybe a question on oncology gross margin. So I was looking back just kind of taking a little bit several quarter view, and if I strip out service just kind of look at your product gross margin on the oncology side. It kind of implies a pretty big decline over the past year. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s about 36% in fiscal 2014 down to 31% in fiscal 2015.", "And as it\u2019s obviously just the product side, so I\u2019m wondering if you can share with us whether that trend continue this quarter first of all and what the drivers here might be outside of FX? But you kind of actually had a nice big shift in revenue towards the U.S. up until this quarter. And so I\u2019m wondering byproduct margins in oncology would be down as much as they were?", "Elisha Finney", "Yes. So Amit the biggest impact on Q1 was just the geographic mix shift. We had a 7 point shift international deliveries and particularly the Middle East and Eastern Europe, which are lower margin countries. I mean, I would just say some schedule delivery base. So we fully anticipated we were going to have margin declines in oncology and for the total company, and I think that was reflected in the guidance that we gave last quarter.", "So for the year, I still expect even with the \u2013 we still had some currency impact in Q1. We will have a little bit in Q2 and then it should anniversary. For the year, we still think Oncology is right in that 43% range, so holding in line with our long-term expectations. I would point out, so this was a bigger proportion in the year ago quarter and not as one of our highest margin product lines. So that impacted it as well. But I think Oncology is performing well at this point.", "Amit Hazan", "And just to reiterate nothing outside, anything outside of FX is hurting the product side of gross margin in oncology, that would seems to be down over the course of a year now?", "Dow Wilson", "It\u2019s a region mix.", "Elisha Finney", "Region, yes, the region mix, the geographic mix. Yes, so, international went from 48% of total revenue in the year ago period to 55% is just a very big geographic mix shift. But on an apples-to-apple basis, it\u2019s really just the geography that was impacting it. And again, less service as a percentage of the total.", "Amit Hazan", "Let me jump to Imaging, just a couple of questions on that. Number one, I\u2019m wondering if you are reiterating kind of the guidance you laid out in fiscal year was, I think it was about flat or so on Imaging revenues?", "And then secondly, specifically has your assessment of the risk around losing more business in flat panel and into \u2013 changed at all since the earnings call last quarter?", "Dow Wilson", "I think maybe the one difference we have here is, Toshiba announced during the quarter that they\u2019re selling their medical unit. Otherwise, I think it\u2019s very much consistent with what we guided a quarter ago. The challenges continue that the security and inspection business is stabilized \u2013 stabilizing currently at the lower revenue levels.", "The panel pricing decline should anniversary in the second-half. And we are still absorbing the loss of major \u2013 of a major customer that went insourcing on flat panel. That said, we\u2019re probably not going to \u2013 that\u2019s happening every quarter to us and then probably doesn\u2019t have anniversary until Q4ish.", "Toshiba\u2019s volume, the good news is most of that business is a service business. So that is going to continue to need to be replaced. But their ongoing forward production with the uncertainty around their sale and kind of who picks it up et cetera. We might see a little bit of volume adjustment there. As I did say in the script, they do have some inventory that they\u2019re working through as they kind of manage through this whole thing.", "The good news is that in order the medicine claim on acquisition seem to be performing for us. So we are looking for a return to growth. I think consistent with what we said before in 2017 and 2018.", "Amit Hazan", "All right. Thanks very much, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies.", "Anthony Petrone", "Thanks. Just a couple of questions, maybe on proton\u2026", "Dow Wilson", "Hey, Anthony, how are you.", "Anthony Petrone", "Good. A couple of questions on proton, I will begin with proton and then we can follow-up with some of the geographies as well on oncology. So maybe just an update on the potential to hit the $0.15 swing factor in proton specifically. So I think it hinged it on the Emory deal. And then in your prepared comments, Dow, you mentioned potentially an installation in Russia, but you\u2019ve also touched upon some dislocations in that marketplace. So maybe just proton overall, the potential to hit the $0.15, where Emory is and how Russia plays into that?", "Dow Wilson", "Sure. I mean, the sites I named were all in our guidance. So that their orders that we have and no mystery around those. We have not guided to Emory. It is not a books order yet, and until the financing is complete, we won\u2019t put it in the guidance. If that were to happen, it would be a nice upside for us.", "Elisha Finney", "Yes, we lived that problem\u2026", "Anthony Petrone", "Same guidance there.", "Elisha Finney", "We are not doing that. And it\u2019s just, it\u2019s our customer who was securing the financing. We all working with them, but it really is somewhat outside of Varian\u2019s control and we are monitoring it closely.", "Anthony Petrone", "Great. And then just on geographies that you touched on China a bit, but Brazil is also sort of in the headlines out there with struggles. And can you just update on that specific tender, I think, if you go back it was 50 linux [ph] several of which had already been sort of shipped and installed. Can you maybe just update on that specific tender?", "Dow Wilson", "We\u2019re seeing the Ministry of Health is continuing their program that, I mean, that obviously that order was placed with us a year ago. But we\u2019re completing first installation this year and it is going as expected. So from a backlog point of view, we haven\u2019t seen it a change in their approach on these, so that\u2019s good. Markets are a little bit quiet there, but it hasn\u2019t been bad.", "Anthony Petrone", "And then just the last one for me just on software specifically. So last year that really seem to be a driver particularly on share gains, I think both on information management and even treatment planning. So maybe, do you see that as still a share gain story for 2016? And maybe Dow an update on how many RapidPlan has served? How many eclipse users have migrated to RapidPlan at this point? Thanks.", "Dow Wilson", "Yes. The \u2013 I mean, first of all as the overall \u2013 for the overall soccer business, it continues to be very well. We just got news that couple weeks ago that both eclipse and Aria got top ranking from class. Classes the \u2013 Gartner of our industry, independent organization that evaluates products for customer.", "So we were very thrilled by that external validation. The \u2013 and then in terms of RapidPlan, as I said in the script, it\u2019s now installed over 50 sites. I would have to get you the exact number of orders, but it\u2019s well over 300 now. So the momentum continues there. I think from a overall differentiation point of view, our treatment planning position is terrific. I think we\u2019re way ahead with our knowledge base tools.", "And then in Aria, our workflow tools and our informatics are a very good differentiators for us. And we continue to see very strong competitive take out with both of those products.", "Anthony Petrone", "Thanks, again.", "Dow Wilson", "Okay.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Roman with Goldman Sachs.", "Dow Wilson", "Hey, David.", "David Roman", "Hey, guys, how are you? Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to start with a clarification on the proton. I understand that Emory is not in the guidance and with the historical context why you did that? But our Russia and Saudi Arabia, they talked about are, to what extent are those reflected in the forward guidance?", "Dow Wilson", "They\u2019re very small amounts. They are in the guidance.", "Elisha Finney", "So all of our \u2013 under the percentage of completion, all of our projects where we have actually identified material specific to our customer we\u2019re taking revenue on those projects. So\u2026", "David Roman", "Got it.", "Elisha Finney", "So Saudi and Russia would be included in that umbrella.", "David Roman", "Okay, understood. Thank you.", "Dow Wilson", "Our Saudi, for example, I know we already took film out last year.", "Elisha Finney", "We\u2019ve taken about $33 million in total and Russia about $25 million in total.", "David Roman", "Okay. And then maybe a more strategic question. Dow, obviously we focus a lot on a quarter-to-quarter order trends, and how you\u2019re doing by region? But as you kind of take a step back and think about your growth rate and how things have progressed the past several quarters versus where you kind of want them to be? How much of the forward outlook depends on factors over which do you have control and kind of invest to drive those versus being dependent on macro factors or sort of end market conditions?", "Dow Wilson", "I mean for the whole company, I think, the cancer business remains at a terrific business for us. Our constant currency growth last year of 5%, 6% in oncology, very strong fourth quarter, a little weak this quarter. But our funnel still looks good. And we think that the cancer business unfortunately whether it\u2019s economic downturns. I mean, people get cancer regardless of economics. And if you look back when economic times were bad, we weathered those storms pretty well.", "It\u2019s not to say that we might see something in our orders, if the economy really turns south. But there was this nice external validation of that last quarter with the global task force on the utilization of radiation oncology as published in the Lancet journal, that called for a thousands more machines, basically a 2.5 times in the installed base that we have today. And really asking the international organizations to help countries develop cancer plans.", "So, especially outside of the U.S. a huge focus on utilizing radiation therapy for cancer. I think one of our big challenges I mentioned in the script there is making sure the people side of that comes along with it, because we\u2019ve got to have the people to be able do the work. But I think, as you look at the long-term health of the oncology business, the franchise is in as good a product position as we\u2019ve ever had. And I think the market remains in the long-term very, very solid.", "Now, on the Imaging business, we\u2019re fairly going through a big storm right now. And we still like the fundamentals of the business. We do think it\u2019s an industry that has an consolidation opportunity and we\u2019ve got to \u2013 kind of got to figure out how to pay that hand a little bit. But the \u2013 as we get through the insourcing of this one customer is kind of short-term Toshiba probations and look for the long-term, the digitization of \u2013 but specially the radiographic market remains a huge opportunity and we like the long-term fundamental there.", "David Roman", "And then maybe just a last one maybe sort of a follow-up to that. As you\u2019re thinking about the opportunities that sit in front of you. What was sort of the thought process around and what to do with the medical device tax in million dollars, it\u2019s not all that material for you compared to some of the other companies in the group. But why not plow some of those savings back into the business and how should we think about your spending patterns on a go-forward basis to support some of that growth?", "Dow Wilson", "Yes, I mean at a high level let me take first crack at this and will have Elisha walk you through some of the detail. But at a high level, we have actually taken up our R&D and as a percent of sales over the last couple of years. So we\u2019re investing a lot in the business if we\u2019re going to make sure we get pop for that growth. So we\u2019re challenging the spend as we do it, as we want to see the growth kind of linking it to your previous question. But we have taken up the R&D investment as a percent of the total over the last couple of years. So we were never making R&D decision as a result of our tax impact. I mean, clearly, it would have been a little easier if we didn\u2019t have to pay that. But we\u2019re making that independent of the tag making that decision independent as a tax stuff.", "Elisha Finney", "And I would just add, I mean, our roadmap is kind of set for the year. We\u2019ve got the people, the projects. It maybe more disruptive to try and even accelerate some of those things at this point. And the last point is, when we increase R&D, it comes from people and that tends to be permanent in nature whereas this is only a reprieve for two years as drafted at this point.", "David Roman", "Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason Wittes from Brean capital.", "Jason Wittes", "Hi, thank you for taking the questions everybody.", "Dow Wilson", "Hi, Wittes.", "Jason Wittes", "Hey. But I just want to ask first off, in terms of the security business, I think you said about $25 million of the revenues related to security are service related?", "Dow Wilson", "That\u2019s right.", "Jason Wittes", "And that \u2013 is that most of the revenues we should expect this year, or should we also expect some orders on top of that?", "Dow Wilson", "No, I mean, that\u2019s that maybe not quite half, I mean, a little bit more than half of the total revenue we should have on the year.", "Elisha Finney", "Yes. That\u2019s about right.", "Jason Wittes", "Okay. And then just to understand Toshiba, they are looking to sell that business. I assume, they are one of your larger customers. And I assume they are still a decent percentage of the imaging business? Is that the right way to think about it?", "Dow Wilson", "Yes.", "Jason Wittes", "And I guess the presumption would be they are right now working down their inventories, but they will have to start reordering at some point whether or not that\u2019s after a sale or not, I guess is harder to determine?", "Dow Wilson", "I mean, here is what I can tell you. They are our largest customer, in fact, they are terrific customer. They account for about $150 million of our Imaging Components revenue. The split on that is $125 million to about $25 million in panel. We expect to continue supplying high-end CT tubes to whoever it is that buys Toshiba. We\u2019re designing future products for them having very good conversations. So, we think that I mean there\u2019s obviously kind of uncertainty as it go through that process, but we are well designed in and I think that that will continue whoever the new owner is.", "Jason Wittes", "Okay that\u2019s very helpful. And then maybe to switch to proton, I mean you mentioned sort of global turmoil impacting your core oncology business. Should we assume that the proton business should may also be impacted this year?", "Dow Wilson", "No I mean it\u2019s tough to say, when we look at our funnel, our funnel remains positive, we have had one or two fallout. I don\u2019t know how much of that some of that I think some of their own decisions. I don\u2019t know how much of that was kind of macro economy. We are competing on a number of compact units, and I do think we\u2019ll see our first compact orders this year, so we\u2019re encouraged about that.", "There remains to be a lot of customer interest I know and I guess I would say that versus in 2009, 2008 \u2013 2009 when we went through this, we were just selling big systems. So that market dried up. Now when you look at our funnel, our funnel has a lot of compact units, and customers were hanging in there, we are having a lot of conversations. And so funnel remains pretty good and our objective is to see if we can win few of those single room orders this year.", "Jason Wittes", "So Just to get clarification. The large centers, there\u2019s really not much of a market this year for them? It is mostly compact centers that people are looking at right now?", "Dow Wilson", "Well that was a comparison to 2008 \u2013 2009.", "Jason Wittes", "Fair enough. Sorry. Yes.", "Dow Wilson", "2008 \u2013 2009 that\u2019s what the market was, when you are looking at $50 million to $90 million of expense into that kind of recession that market just went away during 2008 \u2013 2009. We are not seeing that. There is still a good multi-room market out there, but we\u2019re also seeing a very good funnel of these compact rooms. We\u2019re competing on both, but just to say that in terms as it relates to kind of a global macroeconomic environment. I think these contract customers are hanging in there little more in terms of the funnel, the strength of the funnel.", "Jason Wittes", "Very helpful I\u2019ll jump back in queue.", "Dow Wilson", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.", "Tycho Peterson", "Hey. And maybe just a higher level strategic question on some of the emerging markets that you called out is being kind of problematic. I mean given that a lot of issues here are kind of structural rather than cyclical in some of these markets, does this change your thinking around how you address these markets, the resources you put to them? Any change in where you are placing incremental efforts internationally based on what we have seen the last couple of quarters?", "Dow Wilson", "Let me kind of underscore one of the things I had pointed out in the call weaken Japan, weaken Europe. The emerging markets weaken Russia for sure, but we had some Latin America activity that wasn\u2019t too bad. China as I mentioned was down. But we kind of have a timing issue with that fairly large protested orders. So we actually think China is going to be a okay.", "The long term is where we still think these markets are going to grow we\u2019ve built that market development team. We\u2019re investing in our access to care program to bring new, operators into the business and we are still bullish about the long term opportunities I mean to replace somebody that leaves as fast as maybe we used to, while we go through maybe some downturns, maybe not. But we were clearly looking at this very opportunistically and strategically for the long-term.", "Tycho Peterson", "And any hope on Japan turning, I mean I know you talked in the past about only 20%, 25% of patients receiving radiation there. So clearly, there is a clinical need?", "Dow Wilson", "Yes there\u2019s I mean a clinical need remains I just think between the currency movement their market restructure it\u2019s we are investing a little bit in government affairs they are to kind of get the government a little bit more supportive. But at least for kind of market outlook this year. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019ve seen anything that dramatically changes what we\u2019ve been seeing over the last few year anyway.", "Tycho Peterson", "And then you called out the Edge orders in China. Just, I mean, any thoughts on how the mix there evolves, TrueBeam, Edge, others?", "Elisha Finney", "I think it\u2019s been pretty consistent.", "Dow Wilson", "It\u2019s a bi-mobile market. There is a value market that\u2019s aggressive, where people are looking at entry level products. But there\u2019s also a high-end market. Edge is part of that. We\u2019re really glad to get those three Q1 Edge orders. And then one of the exciting piece of the news is that TrueBeam, the TrueBeam volume there still remains pretty good. It is a category A product.", "So puts it in a little more \u2013 a little bit more of a regulatory process to get through, but sort of limited licenses to that end of the market. But I\u2019d say our mix of products remains pretty consistent. And the high-end of that market remains a really important market for us. And we\u2019ve been expanding our share in China over the last 18 months. So we\u2019re doing that by winning in the value market.", "Tycho Peterson", "Backlog declined a bit this quarter. Was that just the order slippage from last quarter? And any thoughts on backlog stability, I guess, going forward?", "Elisha Finney", "So versus a year ago quarter backlog was up\u2026", "Tycho Peterson", "Sequentially.", "Elisha Finney", "Sequentially.", "Tycho Peterson", "Sequentially, yes.", "Elisha Finney", "Yes. So, I mean, we came in ahead \u2013 a little bit ahead on oncology revenues and the orders. So that\u2019s all it is.", "Tycho Peterson", "Okay. Two other quick ones, I guess, on kind of the software initiatives, Dow in the past you talked about a $300 million opportunity over the next couple of years. Can you just give us a sense of the magnitude of the growth you think you can capture from all the initiatives, RapidPlan and everything else you\u2019ve been highlighting over the last couple of quarters that you can capture this year?", "Dow Wilson", "Yes, and I think the RapidPlan is certainly our single biggest opportunity. We maybe talking about it in terms of units. If we have \u2013 if we\u2019ve taken 300 to 350 units, there\u2019s probably an installed base of 3,500 to 4,000. So we\u2019re just nicking that. And I think what encourages me is the early evidence both for clinical outcome and the productivity is outstanding. So I think it really helps us to make the economic case for people to invest. And the, of course, the ASPs, the selling prices and the margins there remain very good.", "Inside of analytics and our kind of the transition to coordinate and care on Aria is maybe not as far as advanced the product was released a little bit later. But we also really like the progress there, and we do think it\u2019s driving share. We\u2019d really like to see where it drives a little bit more volume.", "We are investing in some software sales resources outside of the U.S. to kind of help us attack the markets that we haven\u2019t maybe attack as aggressively on the software side. Much of our software business is still frankly U.S. based. So we\u2019re trying to drive that that piece as well. But I \u2013 we\u2019re still \u2013 we\u2019re very encouraged by what we see, and both in terms of kind of the market opportunity and the share opportunity by our software product.", "Tycho Peterson", "And just lastly, obviously there has been a lot of news earlier this year on the cancer Moon Shot program and a lot of developments in liquid biopsy. Does any of that change your view on the long-term outlook on the U.S. market in particular with better and earlier detection?", "Dow Wilson", "The short version is we love it. We do know that there has been some reach out to some of our customers in that radiation therapy is going to be part of that. So that\u2019s sort of frankly any other clarity beyond that is difficult. But we\u2019re encouraged that at least our thought leaders are at the table.", "Tycho Peterson", "Okay. Thanks.", "Dow Wilson", "Thanks, Tycho.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley.", "Steve Beuchaw", "Hi, good afternoon, and thanks for taking the questions.", "Dow Wilson", "Hi Steve.", "Steve Beuchaw", "Just a few housekeeping items from me at this point. I guess, first up for Mevis and Claymount, that do you have a sense of what the contribution was in the top line from those specifically for the quarter? I know we have the number for the year, I don\u2019t know that we have it for the quarter?", "Elisha Finney", "Yes, it\u2019s roughly $15 million.", "Steve Beuchaw", "$15 million, okay. And then on the protons financing, now you guys have a little bit more of that on the balance sheet. Do you have a sense of what the contribution was on the P&L in the quarter?", "Elisha Finney", "The total interest income was like $1.7 million, so or the $1.5 million maybe. I don\u2019t have that number right in front of me Steve, but that\u2019s close enough.", "Steve Beuchaw", "Got it, and then last one from me is, I\u2019m thinking back to the fourth quarter call. And the delivery slippages, I think Tycho, might have alluded to this.", "Elisha Finney", "Yes.", "Steve Beuchaw", "But there was a $0.10 impact from deliveries I believe that was predominantly TrueBeam\u2019s slipping from the fourth quarter. Did we recapture that in the first quarter? Is there more in the second quarter? How do we think about those layering in here?", "Elisha Finney", "Well, I think you should, just assume that was built into our guidance for FY16 and the bulk of that in Q1. So we took that into account when we set the guidance for Q1.", "Steve Beuchaw", "Perfect, and thanks so much all the guys again.", "Elisha Finney", "Thanks Steve.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Charley Jones from Dougherty Markets.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hey, good afternoon this is Jon.", "Dow Wilson", "Hey Jon", "Unidentified Analyst", "I want to go and put some numbers around some comments you made around software Dow. And then I had a questions around some comments that Elisha had around the guidance for the year end revenue. And so wondering if you could cheese out, what the growth, well I think this is kind of a $500 million service offer business.", "If you could kind of breakout how much of it is maybe just software only? And then particularly I\u2019m interested in trying to figure out the opportunity of this. I was guessing it was going to be international and I was curious Elisha if you could talk about the growth rates of service and software for 2015 kind of between international and U.S. and how that\u2019s going to change in 2016.", "Really trying to understand what this business can look like if we did get into a lower unit kind of environment? And that goes to my second question around the guidance of revenue. It seems like you are putting a lot in the fourth quarter if I\u2019m reading you right about pulling revenue out of the third quarter Elisha in the second quarter.", "So I am curious where does that come from? Is it more oncology or proton or x-ray? And I think Dow last quarter you said maybe we get a little bit of growth from x-ray as we went through the back half of the year. But I\u2019m curious if you have any better visibility on that as well? So those are my questions. Thanks.", "Elisha Finney", "Okay hope you like to remember all that\u2026", "Dow Wilson", "Let me start on that.", "Elisha Finney", "Sure.", "Dow Wilson", "After further thing I meant for logistic theground is our service business is about $1 billion business. Our software business is about $0.5 million business much of, which is equipment and much of, which is service. So, well it\u2019s kind of gets double counted if you look at it, because there is a software service agreement paid fees that goes into our service business.", "And then the upfront licenses that we sell as product the customer getting into the business there are ongoing equipment transactions as booked in our equipment business. So, did you know it as we have said that the service business historically has been a double-digit business. I think constant currency adjusted last year was 9%.", "Elisha Finney", "9%", "Dow Wilson", "9% and that it was constant currency adjusted growth in Q1\u2026", "Elisha Finney", "6%.", "Dow Wilson", "6% so I think on the year it\u2019s we clearly kind of see at high single-digit\u2026", "Elisha Finney", "Yes.", "Dow Wilson", "Kind of growth range and now if we stretch everything goes as far as it will be a double-digit business but that\u2019s that kind of overseeing on the software business and the service business. But software is a big piece of that growth in the service business and the software business itself has about $0.5 billion business call it 50-50, 50%ish equipment 50% ongoing service agreements with their service installed base.", "Last year that business grew a little faster than the average. So with the constant currency growth in oncology last year was 6% that was call it 7% or 8% and so we\u2019d love to stretch that business get double-digit growth that\u2019s what we love to see, I think it will be stretching to get there, but right now we\u2019d love to see it grow a little bit faster than the oncology average.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yes.", "Dow Wilson", "At least you can fix all that.", "Elisha Finney", "No, I\u2019m reluctant to get a whole lot of breakdown on our guidance. I mean, this is again, we\u2019re in Q1 we\u2019re looking out at the full-year. We\u2019re confident from where we sit today. I think you\u2019re correct that more growth is going to come in the second-half. But the reason for that is, we anniversary two really big effects of last year. The first thing effects, we\u2019ll still have a little bit at quarter-over-quarter impact in this second fiscal quarter that we\u2019re currently in. But as we assuming currency stay where they\u2019re today that impact gets reduced significantly if we go into Q3 and Q4. And so obviously, we expect the dollar growth rates are going to be higher in the second-half of the year.", "The other thing that we anniversary that was huge last year is the pricing impact on particularly the flat panel business. And all of the declines that we saw there, which again were late in second quarter and really large in Q3 and Q4. So, our hope is that we\u2019re going to get a little more linear in our \u2013 on our oncology business, as we go through this fiscal year. And if you look at the guidance for the third cap versus the full-year, it\u2019s right around at the midpoint 45% of the year and that is very common with historical performance having about 45% of our EPS in the first-half.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you very much. Maybe I can just follow-up, I guess, on the question around x-ray. You made comments last quarter, Dow, about maybe seeing some stabilization in x-ray. Obviously, you talked about Toshiba and there\u2019s an unknown there. But if you look at what\u2019s happened to your currency and some of these other Korean different suppliers into that business. Do you feel like your position is a little bit better and you\u2019ve got more visibility or stability, or are you still in this kind of unknown position there as you look forward?", "Dow Wilson", "I mean, I guess if kind of as I said [FIP] is stabilizing. The security business is stabilizing, we like that as Elisha said. Panel pricing probably anniversaries Q3ish. We\u2019re still absorbing a loss of a major customer that\u2019s going on. I think the only thing has changed from last quarter has been this Toshiba announcement and with that some readjustment of their inventory in order level, I think that\u2019s probably going to go on for a while as they adjust.", "So that would be the one piece of new news. We still think that it\u2019s a good business and look for its return to growth I think in terms of whether it\u2019s stabilizing or not where the numbers aren\u2019t great, we have at least made our internal goals for the business and we feel good about that.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you for the time.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Brandon Henry from RBC.", "Brandon Henry", "Yes. Thank you for taking my question. You guys have been reporting pretty strong order numbers in the EMEA in Asia Pacific regions over the last couple of quarters. But it looks like the gross order number for oncology systems in those two regions was a little weaker this quarter. So just help me understand how much of this is market related versus market share related? Have you seen any change in the competitive dynamics or pricing with Electra in either one of those markets?", "Dow Wilson", "I mean, I think as I talked a little bit about the market side last quarter, we were very gratified by the European volume we saw at the end of last year. And frankly, we\u2019d love the market to perform at that level all the time, as we look forward, we didn\u2019t think that kind of 12%.", "Elisha Finney", "The 25% on Q4 constant currency.", "Dow Wilson", "Yes, 25% constant currency growth, 12% that real dollar growth last quarter. That\u2019s just not going to continue it, probably is a mid single digitish market. So that\u2019s probably the European market. There was one other part of the question that my jet lag is not helping me remember.", "So, yes competitively I mean our share is up as we reported the last quarters, when you look at last 12 months, our share is up pretty significantly. So and it\u2019s worldwide, we\u2019re seeing share growth literally in every geography. So some of it has come from share growth. We obviously like that. We have seen Electra be a little more aggressive, especially at challenging tenders that are awarded. And also that maybe is a little bit different competitive practice than we\u2019ve seen in the past. And not quite sure why they\u2019re doing that. I think that hurts them with the customers frankly. But anyway, that might be the one competitive change that we\u2019re seeing a little bit.", "Brandon Henry", "Okay. And then on the Imaging Components side, can you talk about some of the strategies longer-term after we see some stabilization that you are looking to kind of reaccelerate this business? Is it something that can be done internally with the product pipeline, or will it require M&A? And also can you give us an update on kind of the strategic review process for the security inspection business? Is that a business that still fits for Varian?", "Dow Wilson", "Yes, sure. The \u2013 in terms of the strategy, it remains at a product development business. So I alluded to the fact that with Toshiba, we started some new product programs. This remains a very innovation driven segment. And especially in tubes, it\u2019s innovation driven. In flat panel, it\u2019s innovation and cost reduction driven. So one of the things that we\u2019ve got to come in, we\u2019ve just announced and it\u2019s being working to our customers the supply chain a new low-cost flat panel. I think that gives us both a margin opportunity as well as some share play. So we would like to see that come back.", "As I mentioned in last quarter in the call, the security business on the one hand we\u2019ve seen that the volume come down, its profitability still remains very, very good. So, even though we\u2019ve gone from $80 million, $85 million to $45 million, $50 million, it\u2019s still a 20% return on sales business. It\u2019s technology that we leverage throughout our product line both in imaging and in oncology. So that\u2019s, were continuing to look at it, but replacing that revenue and profit is not an easy thing.", "Brandon Henry", "Okay. And then one last question for me. On the service side for Oncology Systems, can you kind of talk about what the installed base for you guys? How quickly that\u2019s growing? And then in the medium term, how do you grow the services business? How do you continue to grow the service business high-single digits kind of above the growth in the installed base, just talk about that strategy?", "Dow Wilson", "Until now the short version is the installed base is growing. Our unit volume remains very good. As we\u2019ve said before, the U.S. market remains replacement market. But outside of the U.S., it\u2019s \u2013 we still get very good socket growth and the TrueBeam percentage is still quite high, I\u2019m sorry the TrueBeam percentage is so quite low. When you look at TrueBeam as a percentage of our overall installed base, I\u2019d say I\u2019m guessing now here, but call it maybe 20%, 15% to 20%.", "So the \u2013 and we get a big price adjustment as we go through that. So that\u2019s true in the U.S. and it\u2019s even more true outside of U.S. So between the installed base growth, the price growth and then the software opportunities that we get in the service, we think that high single-digit growth number constant currency is very doable.", "Brandon Henry", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time we have no further questions. I will turn the call back over to Spencer Sias for closing comments.", "Spencer Sias", "Thank you all for participating.

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Spencer Sias, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications for Varian Medical Systems. Thank you, Mr. Sias. You may now begin.", "Spencer Sias", "Thank you. First of all, quick apologies for the delay, we had to get the press release out, but we've got the gremlin solved. By now, I think you guys all have the material, and we're ready for the call.", "So good afternoon, and welcome to Varian Medical Systems conference call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. With me are Dow Wilson, President and CEO; Elisha Finney, CFO; and Clarence Verhoef, our Corporate Controller. Dow and Elisha will summarize our results, and we'll take your questions following the presentation.", "To simplify our discussion, unless otherwise stated all references to the quarter or year are fiscal quarters and fiscal years. Quarterly comparisons are for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 versus the second quarter of fiscal 2015. References to financial results for orders are gross orders, unless otherwise indicated.", "The discussion includes non-GAAP financial measures in order to provide quarter-over-quarter comparisons of operational performance excluding unusual items. A reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure is included in our earnings release, which can be accessed on our website.", "Please be advised that this discussion contains forward-looking statements. Our use of words and phrases such as outlook, believe, expect, anticipate, could, will, schedule, feels like and similar expressions are intended to identify those statements which represents our current judgment on future performance or other future matters. While we believe them to be reasonable based on information currently available to us, these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.", "Some of the important risks relating to our business are described in our second quarter earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements during this presentation and discussion, because of new information, future events or otherwise.", "And now, here is Dow.", "Dow Wilson", "Good afternoon and welcome. Varian is reporting solid results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, with strong order growth in our Oncology business, promising progress in our Particle Therapy business and expected weakness in our Imaging Components business.", "In summary, we are reporting non-GAAP net earnings of $1.09 per diluted share and $1.01 per diluted share on a GAAP basis. Revenue of $759 million, equal to the year ago quarter and dollars, and up 2% in constant currency. Strong orders in our Oncology business with growth and strategic wins in all three geographies, expected order and revenue declines in Imaging Components and good momentum in our Particle Therapy business with growing customer interest in our single-room system.", "Focusing on operational highlights. In our Oncology business, gross orders totaled $618 million for the quarter, up 6% in dollars and 8% in constant currency. Gross orders in the Americas for the quarter increased by 2% in dollars and 3% in constant currency, with 7% growth in North America offsetting a decline in Latin America.", "In EMEA, gross orders were up 19% in dollars and 23% in constant currency, helped by big wins in India and the Middle East. Gross orders in APAC rose 2% in dollars and 3% in constant currency, driven by a robust growth in China. Oncology experienced healthy global demand in the quarter with higher unit orders as well as gains in our service and software businesses.", "Looking at each of the regions in more detail, our gross order growth in North America was driven in part by demand for newer products, particularly our VitalBeam accelerator as well as our RapidPlan and InSightive analytics software for improving clinical efficiency.", "As you know, North America is largely a replacement market, and in this quarter we generated orders to replace several hardware and software products from competitors as well as our own units. As usual, there were some big wins in the quarter including a major order from MD Anderson for six TrueBeam systems. We also won couple of large deals in Canada.", "Orders in Latin America declined significant from the year-ago quarter, as a result of political uncertainty in Brazil and volatile currencies that slowed purchasing decisions. During the quarter, we broke ground on our new 50,000 square foot facility in Brazil that will be used for training and product demos as well as product assembly and warehousing. This summer we expect to complete the first few installations of the 80 machines handed by Brazil's Ministry of Health in 2014.", "Turning to EMEA, we had a very good quarter with several sizeable orders. The large of these came in India, where we received a multi-site order from the Apollo Hospital Group for 12 high-end linear accelerators and five brachytherapy systems. We also booked several orders in the Middle East, including systems for four new sites in Turkey.", "We had a terrific quarter in China, where more than 75% of the Varian linear accelerators ordered in the quarter were for new treatment vault. Elsewhere in APAC, Japan remains slow, but appear to be stabilizing. We also had a key win at a large teaching hospital in Indonesia that we believe will position us for further growth in that important market.", "We're pleased with the progress made in our software business during the quarter. Customer interest in RapidPlan continued to grow and it is now installed at nearly 170 sites around the world. We also received multiple orders in the quarter for InSightive analytics, bringing total orders since its introduction earlier this fiscal year to 80.", "We had another nice win at the Christie Hospital in Manchester, England, which ordered several software products, including Eclipse Treatment Planning for protons and our Velocity product that uses images to track tumor responses for treatment. Turning to our Oncology Service business, gross orders were up 11% in dollars and 12% in constant currency, with a help of higher capture rates, particularly in North America and China.", "Looking now at Imaging Components second performance versus the year-ago quarter, orders fell by 12% to $138 million and revenue fell by 8% to $144 million, largely in line with our expectations. Beginning in the second half of last fiscal year, this business has been confronted with currency related pricing pressures, weak market conditions for security and infection products, insourcing by a large panel customer and uncertainties related to the sale of a major tube customer.", "Could you believe, we have largely absorbed these challenges from the last four quarters and we feel that the business is beginning to stabilize at these new levels. Our new MeVis and Claymount businesses performed well in the quarter and we continue to believe they will generate about $50 million in revenue this fiscal year.", "During the quarter we opened a regional service center near Shanghai to support local x-ray equipment manufactures across China. With a growing number of imaging equipment manufactures in China this is going to be an important growth area for our components business.", "In our Particle Therapy business we continued to make good progress with installations and recorded $31 million in revenue during the quarter. It was great to see patient treatments commence at the Maryland Proton Therapy Center in February. We are proud to collaborate with the center to bring our advanced cancer fighting technology to patients in that region.", "In the quarter, we successfully extracted beam from the cyclotron at Cincinnati Children's Hospital, where patient treatments are scheduled to begin before the end of the year. We are also scheduled to begin installing equipment at sites in Holland, Russia and Saudi Arabia, later this year.", "Now, I'll turn it over to Elisha.", "Elisha Finney", "Thanks, Dow, and hello, everyone. Dow has already covered gross orders, so let me start with backlog. We ended the quarter at $3.3 billion, up 6% from the year-ago period. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $51 million, bringing net orders for the company to $707 million.", "Second quarter revenues for the total company were about equal with the year-ago period in dollars and up 2% in constant currency. For the first half, total company revenues were up 1% in dollars and up 4% in constant currency.", "Oncology posted a 1% decline in revenues and a 1% gain in constant currency during the second quarter. Imaging Components posted a second quarter revenue decline of 8%, with decreases in tubes, panels, and security and inspection products, partially offset by revenues from our new Claymount and MeVis businesses. Our Particle Therapy business posted second quarter revenues of $31 million, more than double the year-ago period, as we continue to make progress on projects and backlogs.", "The total company gross margin for the quarter was 42%, down as expected by 0.5 point due to lower volumes in Imaging Components and a higher mix of proton business. For the first half, total company gross margin was 41.6%, down almost 2 points from the year-ago period.", "Oncology Systems second quarter gross margin improved 73 basis points to 43.7%, due to product mix shift towards software and service, variable cost productivity and suspension of the medical device excise tax. Imaging Components second quarter gross margin fell by a little more 2 points to 41.4% due largely to lower volume.", "Second quarter SG&A expenses were $112 million or 15% of revenue and R&D were $62 million or about 8% of revenue, each equal as a percentage of revenue to the year-ago quarter. For the first half, SG&A expenses were 16% of revenue and R&D was 8% of revenue, both also equal to the year-ago period.", "Second quarter operating earnings totaled $145 million or 19.1% of revenue, down about 1 point as a percentage of revenue from the year-ago quarter and in line with our expectations. For the first half, operating margin at 18% of revenues was down about 1.5 points from the year-ago period.", "Depreciation and amortization totaled $20 million for the second quarter and $38 million for the first half. The effective tax rate was 28.1%, virtually equal to the year-ago quarter. We continue to expect that the tax rate will be about 26% to 27% for the year.", "Fully diluted shares outstanding of $96.2 million were almost $5 million lower than the year-ago quarter, due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted EPS was $1.09 for the quarter.", "Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $961 million, debt of $794 million and stockholders equity of $1.7 billion. DSO at 109 days was up significantly from the year-ago quarter, due to a lower mix of Imaging Components business, a higher mix of proton business, more extended payment term and slower collections for Oncology Systems.", "Second quarter cash flow from operations was $32 million, bringing the total cash flow from operations for the first half to $109 million. Primary uses of cash were $19 million for CapEx and $57 million for the repurchase of 725,000 shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 6 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2016.", "Now, I'll turn it back to Dow for the outlook.", "Dow Wilson", "Thanks, Elisha. Including the results of the second quarter, we continue to believe that total company non-GAAP earnings will be in the range of $4.55 to $4.65 per diluted share for fiscal year 2016. With expectations of a slower than anticipated recovery in our Imaging Components business due to high inventory levels at a major customer, we now believe revenues for fiscal year 2016 will increase by about 3% over fiscal year 2015.", "For the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, we expect non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $1.16 to $1.20 per diluted share. We expect third quarter revenues to be about equal to the year-ago period with growth in our core businesses offset by a decline in our proton business versus the year-ago quarter, when we booked a big University of Maryland project.", "We're now ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jason Wittes from Brean Capital.", "Jason Wittes", "So I guess, I'll start with, usually start with oncology, but I will start with imaging. You made some comments about the stability of the business. It seems like the only thing that's really sort of dragging and meeting to the lower outlook for the year is the destocking. I assume that's with the Toshiba transfer to I think Canon. Is there anything else out there? I mean, is that the main drag on the business at this point?", "Dow Wilson", "I mean, I think that is the main drag. I mean, I talked a little bit about the constant currency issues that are stabilizing, happy day. We've had some of the price issues that's going along with that, we see that stabilizing. We had a major flat panel customer in-source. We still have a little bit of impact to that and that should be largely anniversaried by Q4.", "And then it's really the sale that you mentioned that it's been going on has caused some short-term volume issues at Toshiba. Clearly they're managing for working capital in the short-term. I think when we look at the rest of our customer base, we're seeing very solid customer demand and we think that business will turnaround here in the second half.", "Jason Wittes", "Two related questions, and only because I think people want to get comfortable with the imaging business and that is, I think in the past you made comments that about half of the business, as it stand I think at yearend fiscal '15, was kind of commodity-like and somewhat at risk. It sounds to me like you feel like that that has stabilized in terms of the risk of that business. Is that the right way to think about it?", "Dow Wilson", "Well, I mean, the short version is, when you go customer-by-customer, our demand has really been very solid. I think this conversation came up in regards to some of the flat panel technology, and how easy or difficult it might be for people to switch suppliers and flat panel technology. In some areas they detect our business, that is a little bit easier to switch suppliers in the tube business that remains, as it can be done, but it still remains very difficult.", "Jason Wittes", "And then in terms of Toshiba moving to Canon or that business being bought by Canon, can you give an outlook in terms of discussions you've had and how that might change the outlook for that piece of the business?", "Dow Wilson", "Yes, absolutely. The sale to Canon is still closing, first of all. And what we hear is that Toshiba team is staying on. We have very good relationship with them and that gives us some optimism. And clearly there's going to be some cautious purchasing in inventory management in the short-term from a competitive product point of view. Our biggest business there by far is the tube business that we sell to Toshiba, and Canon doesn't make any tubes.", "Jason Wittes", "And last question, I just wanted, you mentioned on proton interest in your single-room offering. Can you just give us little more details around that in terms of what the pricing is and et cetera?", "Dow Wilson", "I mean, first of all, there is lots of interest, kind of our funnel of activity is very large. So that's good. In the quarter we did have three contract decisions. One of those in fact issued a press release, Delray, in Florida. The three of them all have a contingency of one form or another. Two are financing and one is some permitting. So with a little luck we'll clear those contingencies on one or two of them this year. And if everything goes our way, maybe we'll get all three.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This is [ph] Scott in for Vijay. I just had a question, in terms of when you're talking about building up a facility in China. I was curious, since you mentioned this is a growth area, what are you guys thinking in terms of where the growth is coming from? And what's the interest and drivers behind that?", "Dow Wilson", "I mean, there is a lot of activity in China in the radiology area. So there is some very large customers, I'd say, there is three or four emerging large manufactures of radiology equipment in China. And there is another list of 15 to 20 smaller suppliers and it's a very active radiology market for locally sourced products in China.", "So we are not -- we do support Toshiba's global effort in particular, but the big radiology companies at least in CT and kind of high-end X-ray, they manufacture their own tube. So we're not supplying them in that market. This is really development at the local Chinese markets. Our Chinese customers are looking for local service capability, fast turnaround on spares, and anyway it's a very active market.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And then, I guess, as a follow-up on the China market. We've seen for I guess other industries like diagnostics has being auditing on large capital equipment purchasing. Do you see this as any sort of headwind or is this not really been an issue for you guys?", "Dow Wilson", "I mean, that's been an issue for us for the last two, two-and-a-half years, I wouldn't say it's any worse. And in fact, in our oncology business this quarter in China we had a very, very good quarter, very strong double-digit growth in China. And what we were particularly pleased about is over three quarters of the units were in new valves, new bunkers. And our funnel in China looks really good. So we remain very bullish about China.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.", "Tycho Peterson", "Maybe just to start, I'm wondering if you can touch on competitive dynamics in the market. Accuray last night talked about a little bit more pricing pressure in the single and dual vault market in the U.S. I know you announced the MD Anderson order, but Elekta got in there as well. So I was just wondering to this degree that pricing is becoming more of an issue in the market, if you can touch on that dynamic?", "Dow Wilson", "I would say, for us, pricing was not all an issue in the market, especially here in the U.S. market our prices are up and our volume is very, very good. I mean, as you saw, we had 7% growth in U.S. and Canada on the quarter. That's got to be one of the best quarters we've had in the U.S. in a long time. And our pricing looks very, very good. So you may have heard me said, I think their product was way overpriced, so I'm not surprised that I got pricing problems.", "Tycho Peterson", "And then how about the challenged tenders that you called out last quarter. Are those still being challenged and you expect that we'll see more of this?", "Dow Wilson", "They are still being challenged. I'd say, we saw a little bit less this quarter than we had previously. And the good news is as we saw large percentage of them come to us. So that was good news on the quarter. And that was some of the China growth was catch-up on that from the previous quarter.", "Tycho Peterson", "And then for, Elisha, can you just breakout the FX component to the guidance. In other words, how much did organic guidance change if we back out the FX move?", "Elisha Finney", "For the first time, Tycho, you did not hear me say currency headwinds in the script, which felt really good. So in the second quarter, it was minimal, maybe a $0.01 or $0.02. As we move into Q3, the euro is exactly today where it was in the year-ago period. So it's going to be virtually non-existent in Q3 and Q4, assuming that rates hold where they are today.", "Tycho Peterson", "And then last one on Japan. Dow, I think you used the word slow, but stabilizing. Again, last night, Accuray, I think talked about a facility delays and new construction there. Are you seeing any slippage in terms of new facility build out?", "Dow Wilson", "I say, we're not seeing slippage, we have seen a contraction in the market. There is less government spending, but we're not seeing slippage. Maybe let's just come back to your first question, it's little bit on price. We did launch the VitalBeam product. And its priced right at or maybe even a hair north of where we thought it was landing. We are very excited to see its volume globally. Since the launch we've taken 45 orders with that product, and 36 of those came in the first half of this year.", "And it fills a mid-tier pricing market where frankly we haven't had coverage. But it's also enabled our TrueBeam pricing to move up a little bit, so we feel very good about where the product portfolio is and the pricing discipline that our team has. And frankly that product, I mean coming back to your Accuray comment that product is a little bit more aims at Elekta's than it is Accuray, so I'm not sure what -- you'll have to talk to Josh about its pricing challenges I guess.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Robert W. Baird.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This is actually [ph] Jason on for Jeff. Just wanted to start on Europe. You had some very good growth out of your European oncology business. It seemed to be extra one of the companies that are bucking the trend here in the quarter in the capital equipment side in Europe. So just wondering if you could discuss how you feel about the sustainability of the performance of that business, especially in light of what are some tougher comps that are going to be coming up against your next quarters?", "Dow Wilson", "I'd say the other quarter was terrific. We love that we did have a couple of large orders. First off all from the top our orders just to review, gross orders were up 19% in EMEA, 23% in constant currency. We did have a large multi-site order from the Apollo Group in India. And that was 11 TrueBeam's, one Edge and five Brachytherapy systems.", "We also had some major wins in the Middle East, which that was nice to see. I mean, I wouldn't that was anomalous, that market has been kind of a little bit down with people dealing with oil price impact on federal healthcare budgets. But that was nice to kind of see that come back.", "We had a very nice win in the U.K. And then I'd say all across Europe, we had a very good mix of product, a little bit richer hardware mix and very good engagement of our software business in Europe. So I'd say, we're not going to do 20% every quarter. That's probably a little bit too much to ask.", "As it comes to the total, when you look at the overall market, last 12 months, our estimate is that its 12 months constant currency growth rate of about 5%. And at least kind of in that really big picture, that's kind of what we see going forward. We've clearly gain some market share in the last two, three years. And we're seeing that we're able to maintain that share and get little price, which is kind of where our focus is right now.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And then just want to come back quickly on the FX side as it relates to guidance. We had expected actually a little bit of upside, maybe the guidance given what FX has done here in the recent months. So is it fair to think that all that FX upside basically has just been offset by the weakness on the ICB business?", "Elisha Finney", "Look, we are taking somewhere, call it, $35 million or so out of the topline for the year to come down by 1 point on the growth rate and maintaining EPS. And virtually the currency impact is very, very small. This is our businesses doing a fantastic job on cost control.", "The margin is coming in a little bit higher on the gross margin level than we were expecting, which is great news due to pricing, due to MeVis software and our Imaging Components business drove that up maybe 1 point more than we were expecting in the second quarter. So if we anniversary now, the currency is roughly neutral to us as we go into the second half of the year. And the business, we're just committed to offsetting that slight revenue mix by good cost controls across the board.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Amit Hazan from Citi.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This is actually [indiscernible] for Amit. A quick question about market share gains. You guys have been talking about this a little bit more recently. Just hoping you can give us what you think the drivers are that will drive incremental share right now versus where you guys stood competitively last year or over the last few years?", "Dow Wilson", "I think our product line has never been better at every price point. We've got Edge at the top. When you look at the ability to deliver dose to small volumes, the ability to have planned difficult treatments with an efficiency that nobody else can touch and the speed of delivery at the high end Gamma Knife or Cyberknife can't touch this. When you look at the mid-tier of the market, our TrueBeam product it is what everybody compares to. It is the gold standard of radiation therapy. And that's what we're seeing a rich mix on there.", "I think the other thing, at both the high-end and the mid-tier of the market is we've got the best total cost of ownership and the best throughput of anybody else out there. So that might be some of Accuray's problems, I don't know. And I think we are extremely competitive at a total cost of ownership, especially when you look at our throughput advantages, we have far than way the most efficient product out there in terms of throughput and reliability.", "And we've been focused very, very much the last few years on net promoter score. And we believe when we measure this through independent groups, we believe that we've got a significant lead in customer service. And then you add that with our VitalBeam launch that I just talked about, our Eclipse and ARIA product lines, recently both won the best-in-class award. So we had that for a while in Eclipse. This was a first time for us in our ARIA oncology information system product.", "So I just think the strength of the product line is very, very good. On top of that, some of the vision that we shared with Astro, the future around hardware and software is capturing the imagination of our customers for even better stereotactic body radiation therapy and data analytics.", "Maybe one of the thing to add there is that's kind of the product side of it, but at the same time you heard us talk 12, 15 months ago about a change to a new distribution organization and we regionalized our distribution team into -- took it from a global sales organization and cut it into three geographic structures. And I think that's really a nice difference. It's gotten us close to the customer. Decisions don't have to come to Palo Alto, they're made in the field, and it's made as part of this kind of improving net promoter score and customer satisfaction and customer response.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And then my follow-up is that we've been hearing some intuitive surgical -- they've been reporting a fairly big rebound in prostatectomy volume; it's been about double-digits with sideline patients possibly coming back post-2012 guideline changes. Has that been coming up on your radar at all in terms of helping those capacity or drive interest in new system?", "Dow Wilson", "I mean I'd say when watchful Waiting Guidelines went out in 2012, 2013, we did see -- our customers did see some drop-off in their prostate volumes. And I think is it back to where it was in 2012, I haven't seen any math that says that. But it's definitely back up for sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Roman from Goldman Sachs.", "Candice Tse", "This is Candice on for David. Just a quick question on the imaging side. Could you give a little more detail and dynamic around customer inventory levels and what's driving them to be elevated?", "Dow Wilson", "Yes. We were just speaking in particular our largest customer in that space, Toshiba has been up for sale. I think as part of that their customers have probably gotten conservative about seeing the transition happen. And so our demand is off there and their supply is up. So that's the driver. That will bounce back we think as the acquisition gets completed. They've obviously announced the sale to Canon. And I'd say, otherwise, this business is usual in that shop. It's just a one specific customer situation.", "Candice Tse", "So there is nothing further there and that's the only weakness, nothing beyond that consolidation?", "Dow Wilson", "Right. That's the incremental fees. We talked a little bit about some of the other issues that businesses has had the last year. But when you look at versus what we expected for this year that would be the one slight miss to the year has been volume in that business as they've gone through this change in strategy.", "Candice Tse", "And then I know that you guys have talked about the impact of FX, but I was just curious about the indirect impact that you had spoken about on past calls. Could you maybe just shed some light on what your reception internationally has been and if that's changed it all as the dollar has weakened?", "Dow Wilson", "I'd say, when you look at it over 18 months, it's had a pretty significant impact. Elisha, fix this, I want to say the yen was down 20% and euro was down 25%, is that about right?", "Elisha Finney", "That is about right.", "Dow Wilson", "And our competitors in the business are yen based and euro based and rather taking it to translation profits, they took the gift to pricing. So we've worked very hard to maintain our share and I think we have. We're seeing those prices stabilize, so that's good news.", "Elisha Finney", "And Candice, I would just add, I mean we've pricing stabilize and the Imaging Components business by product line. So we've largely anniversaried the impact particularly as we get into Q3. But we're actually going to see some growth in the Imaging Components business quarter-over-quarter, just not the level that we have first anticipated, because of the issues we've talked about.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley.", "Steve Beuchaw", "It's actually Steve in for Steve. So first question is, Elisha, on the seasonality in the model, the implied guide for the fourth quarter puts a little bit more weight on earnings in the fourth quarter than normal. What is it about the model this year that's a little different relative to last, I don't know, three years or so?", "Elisha Finney", "Yes, so couple of things. First of all FX, we're going to completely anniversary the effect of FX at today's level. So that takes some pressure off. And in oncology, we're going to see a more linear year. Last year Q3, actually sequentially was down for oncology. You're going to see that for our expectations this quarter. So what you're seeing is really some fluctuations mostly in our PT business.", "So if I look at Q3 guidance, oncology should do high single-digit. We're going to have our Imaging Component, somewhere around the mid-single digit. But we get a significant drop off in our proton business, because we booked Maryland in the year ago period, so that's why you get to a zero percent flat revenue.", "If you get into Q4, it's exactly the opposite and our proton business is going to grow significantly just based on the projects and the timing of revenue recognition under percentage of completion. So those are few of other things that are different versus a year ago period.", "Steve Beuchaw", "And then sorry if I missed this, but at this stage half way through the fiscal year, what would be for the full fiscal year, the impact in $0.01 I suppose of currency at the bottomline?", "Elisha Finney", "I would say, it probably -- I'm going to say about $0.05, $0.06. I don't have it exactly, Steve. It was a little more in Q1 than in Q2. Q2 was only about $0.02 or so. And again, Q3 it should be roughly zero at today's level.", "Steve Beuchaw", "It's a nice thing isn't it?", "Elisha Finney", "Yes. Sure.", "Steve Beuchaw", "And then, Dow, I just want to come back to your comments earlier on VitalBeam. Can you go into just a bit more detail on the strategy for deploying it in the U.S. it puts you in a position, where you're obviously high-tier with TrueBeam and now mid-tier provider with VitalBeam. How do you think about segmenting the market? And how much more aggressive can you get in the rollout of VitalBeam? How much more push is in the plan there?", "Dow Wilson", "I mean, we're very excited about the product. It's gone very well. I think the way the guys are using in a lot, the guys and girls are using it is really the sell up. So often versus our competitors, it starts out in the canal water from a pricing point of view. And what we really want to do is, we want to differentiate the TrueBeam and it has many, many significant advantages of everything else that's out there. We've trained very hard on that. And I think there's good discipline around it and we are seeing that in our numbers.", "From a product cost point of view, the team has also done a really great job getting the product cost out. So it's given us some flexibility to do that. So the margin dollars, margin percent at this point price points are still pretty good. So we like that part of it.", "I'd say it might be a little bit ahead of our expectations in terms of its impact in the U.S. We've thought have a little bit bigger impact outside of the U.S. and our team it's just playing that through. So I do think we'll see some upside from the product outside of the U.S. it typically takes us little longer to train and get it into budget cycles and things like that.", "But for this market, in particular, where we have an old install base that's looking to trade up and chances are they're not depreciating the old asset any more, it's been through its depreciation cycle and they're looking to, how can they swap out that old stuff and get something new and competitive at a good price point. This has worked out very, very well. And I think the proof is in the pudding, in North America, the whole business is up 7% on the quarter. And our funnel remains pretty good.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Toby Wann from Obsidian Research Group.", "Toby Wann", "Can you guys kind of talk quickly about the pipeline of the potential new Particle Therapy business out there, the big I guess, multi-room systems?", "Dow Wilson", "I never know what to say to this question. The short version is the pipeline of proton systems is gigantic. The pipeline for financing proton systems is significantly smaller. I guess, the good news is, as I mentioned, we've got three contracts that we signed for compact this last quarter, we think they're all financeable, but we don't book them until they are, in fact financed. And we've got a very good funnel that looks very strong. So we're optimistic about where it's going.", "And it's global. I'd say, it's just as much as outside of the U.S. as it is in the U.S. at this point. So we like the global nature of it. I would say that one of the other things that we like is we are seeing a little transition from a developer-driven market to more of a customer sovereign government, Ministry of Health kind of market, which is taking away some of these financing issues. And frankly other thing is happening as the market is moving smaller units, so last year we booked several four and five room systems; more of the market is in one, two, three market -- one or two, three treatment valves and I think a trend that will continue.", "Toby Wann", "So I guess, you haven't really seen, given kind of global economic conditions, unrest here, unrest there, any impact, any changes in terms of the velocity of kind of how people are thinking about [multiple speakers]?", "Dow Wilson", "I think given that one of the things that we really like is of the compact products on the market, ours is the only no compromise compact product. And a true scan beam, full rotational gantry, highest throughput, most clinical capability, to really leverage the physics advantage of proton therapy you need what we got and I think that's beginning to resonate with customers.", "Operator", "At this time we have no further questions. I will turn the call back over to our speakers for closing comments.", "End of Q&A", "Spencer Sias", "Thank you for participating.

Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC", "Jason H. Wittes - Brean Capital LLC", "Operator", "Greetings, and welcome to the Varian Medical Systems Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Spencer Sias, VP Investor Relations for Varian Medical. Thank you, Mr. Sias. You may now begin.", "Spencer R. Sias - VP-Corporate Communications & Investor Relations", "Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Varian Medical Systems conference call for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016.", "With me are Dow Wilson, President and CEO; Elisha Finney, CFO; and Clarence Verhoef, our Corporate Controller. Dow and Elisha will summarize our results and we'll take your questions following the presentation.", "To simplify our discussion, unless otherwise stated, all references to the quarter or year are fiscal quarters and fiscal years. Quarterly comparisons are for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 versus the third quarter of fiscal 2015. References to financial results for orders are to gross orders, unless otherwise indicated.", "This discussion includes some non-GAAP financial measures in order to provide quarter-over-quarter comparisons of operational performance, excluding unusual items. A reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure is included in our earnings release, which can be accessed on our website.", "Please be advised that this discussion contains forward-looking statements. Our use of words and phrases such as outlook, believe, expect, anticipate, could, will, scheduled, and similar expressions are intended to identify those statements, which represents our current judgment on future performance or other future matters. While we believe them to be reasonable based on information currently available to us, these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.", "Some of the important risks relating to our business are described in our third quarter earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this presentation and discussion, because of new information, future events or otherwise.", "And now, here is Dow.", "Dow R. Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good afternoon and welcome. Varian is reporting solid results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, with strong gross order and revenue growth in our Oncology Systems and Imaging Components business together with substantial improvements in gross and operating margins for both.", "In summary, the company is reporting GAAP net earnings of $1.04 per diluted share and $1.22 per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis. Revenues of $789 million, up 1% versus the year-ago quarter, a nearly four point improvement in the company's overall gross margin, and an order for a new multi-room Proton installation in China, our first Proton order there.", "Focusing on operational highlights, our Oncology business generated third quarter gross orders of $676 million, up 6% in both dollars and constant currency. Gross orders in the Americas rose by 8% during the quarter, with 15% growth in North America more than offsetting a greater than 40% decline in Latin America.", "Year-to-date gross order growth in North America is 8%, driven by a more stable reimbursement environment and in this replacement market, a transition to more advanced clinically efficient systems. Gross orders in APAC increased 19% in dollars and 17% in constant currency during the quarter, driven by robust growth in China and Australia. In EMEA, gross orders declined 3% in dollars and 4% in constant currency, reflecting weakness in Western European markets.", "Looking at each of the regions in more detail, our growth in North America was driven by demand for our TrueBeam platform, including Edge radiosurgery systems and our software offerings. Among the highlights for North America were several large multi-system orders from consolidated networks, as well as competitive take-outs. Order activity in Latin America continued to be weak due to macroeconomic factors. During the quarter, we shipped the first units for the large tender conducted by Brazil's Ministry of Health a couple of years ago.", "Turning to APAC, the Icon Group placed the largest Varian order ever in Australia for 10 TrueBeam systems, seven of which are going to new sites along with a full complement of our information management and treatment planning software. We had wins for several new accelerator installations in China, where we saw good orders growth. We also saw strong demand for our Edge radiosurgery system in this market where we continue to be the share leader. Elsewhere in APAC, we made good progress in Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia. Business was stable in Japan where we saw good service growth.", "Turning to EMEA, healthy gross order growth in emerging markets including Iran, Russia, Ethiopia, Burkina Faso and Libya was offset by weakness in Western Europe. Our third quarter business in Africa was outstanding, with more than $25 million in gross orders. Among other wins, we saw Ethiopia order its first modern linear accelerators for cancer treatment.", "I'm pleased to report that overall unit order volume was up in the quarter and year-to-date, and that average pricing is stable. We're winning with clinically efficient advanced technology that makes quality cancer care affordable and accessible. This was reflected during the quarter in strong orders for our RapidPlan and InSightive Analytics software. We booked our 500th order for RapidPlan, which is a game changer that enables clinics to improve the speed and quality of care for their patients. As of this quarter, treatment plans are now being shared among clinics to our OncoPeer web portal.", "As you all know, CMS has announced modest adjustment to reimbursements for 2017 for both hospitals and free standing clinics. We don't expect reimbursement to have a material impact on the radiation oncology markets in the U.S. next year. While we're on the topic of reimbursement, CMS did move forward with policies that will incentivize the adoption of digital x-ray imaging systems in place of film and computed radiography systems. And this should help to support growth in our Imaging Components business.", "Speaking of Imaging Components, the business return to growth during the quarter, orders grew by 13% to $138 million and revenues rose by 9% to $147 million. Improvements in margins were driven by productivity gains and a favorable product mix.", "Our Tube business saw a good growth in the quarter. We recently celebrated the 40th year of our relationship with Toshiba Medical Systems, and look forward to continuing this relationship when they become part of Canon.", "Our recently acquired software and x-ray accessories businesses also helped to drive growth. Touching on the Industrial Imaging business, orders for security products were up in the quarter, but we continue to have a cautious outlook in the face of ongoing customer consolidation. We continue to focus on generating growth in non-destructive testing and inspections.", "Let me update you on our progress towards the separation of the Imaging Components business into a new, independent, publicly traded company via a tax-free distribution to Variant stockholders. As you probably saw in the press release issued last week, the name of the new company will be Varex Imaging Corporation. We are now making good progress in the development of detailed plans and activities needed to execute the separation. We are on track to file an initial Form 10 with the SEC in the next several weeks, and we are currently on schedule to complete the separation at the end of the calendar year. We continue to be excited about the prospect of creating two great companies.", "Turning now to our Particle Therapy business, we booked an order during the quarter for a multi-room ProBeam installation at the new Hefei Ion Medical Center in China. This is China's first government funded Proton facility. Installation is slated to take place in late 2017, with patient treatments scheduled to begin in late 2018.", "Our installation at Cincinnati Children's Hospital is on track, with the first patient treatments scheduled to commence later this summer. We've now successfully commissioned a third room at the Maryland Proton Therapy Center, and installations are underway in Holland, Russia and Saudi Arabia. In total, we have 13 Proton projects generating revenue.", "As you probably saw from our 8-K filing with the SEC at the end of June, we sold our $73 million senior loan for the New York Proton Therapy Center to Deutsche Bank, freeing up capital to help finance other Proton projects. The Proton sales funnel continues to look good.", "And now, I'll turn it over to Elisha.", "Elisha W. Finney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Great. Thanks, Dow, and hello, everyone. Dow has already covered gross orders, so let me start with backlog.", "We ended the quarter at $3.3 billion, up 5% from the year-ago period. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $51 million, bringing net orders for the company to $814 million.", "Third quarter revenues for the total company were $789 million, up 1% in dollars and even with the year-ago period in constant currency. Year-to-date total company revenues were $2.3 billion, up 1% in dollars and up 3% in constant currency.", "Oncology posted a revenue gain of 8% both in dollars and in constant currency, driven by strength in our high-end equipment, as well as our software and service businesses. Imaging Components posted a third quarter revenue gain of 9%, driven by our newly acquired x-ray accessories business, as well as higher Tube sales. Our Particle Therapy business posted third quarter revenues of $37 million, down from the year-ago period when we booked $91 million of revenues, including a substantial amount for the ProBeam installation at the University of Maryland.", "Total company gross margin for the quarter was 43.9%, up by nearly four points with significant contributions from both Oncology and Imaging Components. Oncology Systems third quarter gross margin improved by more than four points to 46% with the help of a larger mix of TrueBeam's and software, as well as productivity gains. Imaging Components third quarter gross margin also rose by more than four points to 42.9% due largely to factory productivity gains and favorable product mix.", "R&D expenses were $65 million, or 8% of revenue, equal as a percentage of revenue to the year-ago quarter. On a GAAP basis, third quarter SG&A expenses were $151 million, or 19% of revenue. We had about $22 million of unusual expenses in SG&A for items including ongoing patent litigation and the recently announced initiative to separate the Imaging Components business into a new publicly traded company. Excluding these items, SG&A expenses on a non-GAAP basis for the quarter were $129 million, or 16% of revenue.", "GAAP operating earnings for the quarter were 16.5% of revenues and 19.5% of revenues on a non-GAAP basis, reflecting our solid gross margin performance in the quarter. Depreciation and amortization totaled $18 million for the quarter.", "The effective tax rate was 25.1%, up three points from the year-ago quarter when we benefited from a favorable geographic mix of profits and tax loss carry-forwards associated with the Proton business. We continue to expect that the tax rate will be about 26% to 27% for the year.", "Fully diluted shares outstanding were 95.4 million, more than 5 million lower than the year-ago quarter due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted EPS was $1.04 for the quarter on a GAAP basis, and was $1.22 on a non-GAAP basis.", "Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $836 million, debt of $701 million, and stockholders' equity of $1.7 billion. DSO at 101 days was up significantly from the year-ago quarter, but improved sequentially from the second quarter.", "Third quarter cash flow from operations was $95 million, bringing the total cash flow from operations year-to-date to $204 million. Primary uses of cash were $126 million for the repurchase of 1.5 million shares of stock, $95 million to reduce debt, and $15 million for capital expenditures. At the end of the quarter, we had 4.8 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2016.", "Now, I'll turn it back to Dow for the outlook.", "Dow R. Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Elisha. Including the results of the third quarter, we believe that total company non-GAAP earnings will be in the range of $4.62 to $4.66 per diluted share for fiscal year 2016. And we continue to believe revenues for fiscal year 2016 will increase by about 3% over fiscal year 2015.", "We're now ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, we will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Thank you. And our first question will come from the line of Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC", "Oh, great. Thanks and good afternoon. Congratulations on a good quarter.", "Dow R. Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Anthony.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC", "How are you, Dow? Maybe just start a little bit with just the North American order growth in Oncology there, which reached a multi-quarter high here. Maybe a little bit more in terms of the underlying drivers there. How much was market related, maybe even replacement-cycle related? And how much was it from share gains? And then a follow-up there would be on the product side, how much was driven by VitalBeam, which was a driver last quarter?", "Dow R. Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Good questions. I would start by saying our rolling four quarter growth in the Americas has been 7%. So we feel very good about kind of where that is. North America has certainly been the driver. And you're right, North America did hit a high this quarter, but it is kind of a sustained trend that we're seeing, which is good.", "We did have a couple multi-system orders including one with HCA. We also had very strong demand, as I mentioned in the call, for software products. And VitalBeam, I think a little more than half of our VitalBeams have been sold in the Americas. So that's \u2013 VitalBeam has been part of this story, but I think the overall story, though, is TrueBeam. When you clearly look at what's going on, TrueBeam is what's \u2013 it's what's driving both the Americas growth and the global growth, both in orders and revenues. I mean some of \u2013 on the revenue side, Elisha will talk about this later, but on the revenue side we had very good TrueBeam mix on the quarter as some of the margin uptick.", "But it's \u2013 from a kind of a market perspective, the U.S. is a replacement market. That's true. As I said in the call, we are seeing people trade out aggressively to try to get new capability, especially for advanced radiosurgery and body radiosurgery.", "I think reimbursement may have been a small factor, certainly not over the last year, but having that be calm in the quarter kind of shored up \u2013 shored things up a little bit. I think from a high level that's kind of the story, Anthony.", "I think \u2013 oh, the other thing I was going to mention is from a market share point of view, we think we've gained a little bit of share. But most of this is market.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC", "No. Very, very helpful, and maybe to shift gears, just to imaging and then one for Elisha. One of the headwinds for that business over the past couple quarters was destocking from several key customers, including Toshiba. I'm just wondering if that has reversed at this point, and specifically, with regards to Toshiba, are they back ordering at this point?", "Dow R. Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think Toshiba's back a little bit. I wouldn't say they're fully back yet. I mean we had an okay quarter from Toshiba. The Tube business was actually quite strong in the quarter, and some of that was Toshiba, but we also had very good Tube \u2013 performance from our other Tube customers on the quarter and it was as much on their backs that we drove this. So I'd say the best Toshiba days, frankly, are still ahead of us. We're not totally out of that headwind yet.", "Elisha W. Finney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And the acquisitions helped us also, Anthony.", "Dow R. Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Yeah.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC", "Sure. Sure. And then last just quick, I'll hop in queue is, Elisha, Oncology gross margin 46% you called out. That's beyond the normalized 44% level. Is this the new normal or do you expect it to moderate back down to that 44% level over time?", "Elisha W. Finney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, I would love to say yes, Anthony, but I'm \u2013 we just had a really favorable product mix in the quarter. And I just can't count on that every single quarter going forward. What I would say is Oncology has done a fantastic job on pricing, holding stable pricing and on product cost reduction and on productivity gains. And so the hope is, yes, that will last as we move forward, but again product mix drives our margin much more than any other factor. I do think for this fiscal year they should be at the high end of that 43% to 44% range that we've talked about and really helped by this last quarter.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amit Hazan with Citibank. Please proceed with your question.", "Leigh Pressman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi, it's Leigh Pressman for Amit. Couple of questions here, I'll start with margins. On the back of the gross margin question, is there anything stronger in gross margin that you would call out as more sustainable in as opposed to good mix in some of the other items you've already called out?", "Elisha W. Finney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, the product mix drives the margin first and foremost in Oncology, geographic mix secondly. The geographic mix was identical this quarter versus a year ago quarter so that had no impact. I would say the product cost reduction is real and we should continue to have the benefit of that going forward as there's much fewer C-series, our old legacy equipment, and many more TrueBeams at a higher margin. And so, we're starting to see that flow through.", "Leigh Pressman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then just on operating margin for this year, it looks like there have been two good quarters at or around the 19%. The implication for fourth quarter looks above that too. So is this the range we should be thinking about going forward here? It's a bit above your original guidance. Is this FX-related to some extent or are you seeing sustainability that makes you comfortable we've come off the bottom, and maybe see some further gains heading into 2017?", "Elisha W. Finney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, I don't want to guide it all into 2017, particularly right at the moment with the spin-off going on. There is a lot of work that we're going to have to do in terms of looking into upright 2017. You are correct, once you run this model through it's going to put us at close to a 19% operating margin for this year, which would be up about half a point versus a year ago period. Again, all businesses have been very focused on head count and on travel and on discretionary spending. And I think you're starting to see this flow through. But most of that improvement for this year is coming through the gross margin.", "Dow R. Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. And I'd just point out this is consistent with our goal over the next three, four years to get back to that higher return on sales. So it's kind of delivering on the track 50 basis points-ish a year that we were \u2013 kind of set as an overarching goal.", "Leigh Pressman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay, great. And if I could sneak in one more, if I could. Can you talk about maybe the adjustments to backlog this quarter? They were a little bit higher than trend, maybe you can give us some context as to what's going on there?", "Elisha W. Finney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Actually the backlog adjustments were lower, I believe, than the prior quarter and were pretty consistent with our average. So the $51 million is really what we would refer to \u2013 some cancellations in that number, maybe $20 million of it. The rest is what we call dormancy. When we review the backlog and when we feel like there's no longer a good, hot probability of the machine delivering within two years, we just take it out of our backlog until it fits that criteria. But a $51 million level is very consistent with historically, how it's been.", "Leigh Pressman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then sorry, one last quick one. If you can maybe give us a sense of why the DSO was up during the quarter?", "Elisha W. Finney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. So we had \u2013 we've seen this in the last couple of quarters. The good news is Q3, if you look at our cash flow from operations, returned back to a very strong level and was almost equal to net income. So I'm feeling very good that we're back on track in terms of cash flow. What happened is we moved our collections staff earlier in the fiscal year. We did a CRM implementation. I think those things just slowed down collections a little bit in the first half of the year. We've got some catching up to do. But in June and July, our collections have actually been very strong. So I think we're getting back on track.", "Dow R. Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. And 2Q to Q3 we had 10 days of shipped (23:11) improvement. So it's going in the right direction.", "Elisha W. Finney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes.", "Leigh Pressman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Brandon Henry with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.", "Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. First, just on the North American strength in gross orders. Can you just help provide some more details on how much of that performance was from better systems orders versus software and services?", "Dow R. Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I'd \u2013 one of the things that we liked about it was that it was broad based. It was both \u2013 it was hardware, it was software and it was service. So we saw it in all three categories. There wasn't one \u2013 you know as I mentioned from a product mix point of view, that market has largely \u2013 it's probably been a 90% TrueBeam market for the last 18 months, two years. And it was at the high end of that. So maybe a little bit of product mix from an orders point of view, but as I said in the call, we had a couple nice, large, strategic deals and we had a number of competitive take-outs in both the hardware and software areas. But it was broad based.", "Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. And did you guys give any growth rates in terms of software as a service this quarter? I might have missed that.", "Elisha W. Finney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "No, we haven't broken it out.", "Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. All right. And then separate question. Can you provide an update on what portion of Siemens Linacs have been traded out at this point? And how much of the acceleration in the North American Oncology Systems business can be attributed to an acceleration in Siemens' trade outs?", "Dow R. Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "You know I think it's a small and maybe even very small factor. It's not coming off the trend line. I think when we first did the relationship with them three years, four years ago there was probably a 2,000-ish unit installed base. And I'd say that's coming out 150-ish a year \u2013 or probably coming out. We haven't seen an acceleration or deceleration of that trend. It's been kind of steady, steady, steady as it goes. I mean it is a replacement market, whether it's Siemens or everybody else, and that's what we're seeing.", "Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. And then last question for me just on China. It looks like from the first-half 2016 results from GE and Phillips, it does look like Chinese tender activity and orders are picking up, at least in the diagnostic imaging part of the market. So can you speak to what trends you're seeing in China and if you're seeing a similar pick up in activity in the radiation oncology market in China? Thanks.", "Dow R. Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think that's very consistent. We had an okay first half, but we had a very good third quarter. Our third quarter was \u2013 China was up 13%. We had very strong demand, especially for high-end product, which \u2013 our Edge product, as I mentioned on the call, in the script, was very good. One of the things that we really like about the demand that we're seeing is it is almost 90% new vaults (26:33). So obviously, that's going to drive our long-term Service business and software, upgrade opportunities, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.", "So these are new vaults (26:47) going in. They're happening on schedule. We are seeing significant tender activity. We do continue to see some protest of that activity. It doesn't change that much who wins, it just kind of lengthens the process. And there are also, I mean coming back to your previous question, in China there is a large Siemens install base opportunity. That's one of the geographies where they did the best, frankly because of their price position as much as anything else. And so I think over the next couple years, we'll see maybe that install base change out a little more aggressively. So that's going to be one to watch.", "The other thing to watch in China, you know we've got this Hefei Proton order, as I mentioned. We see a reasonable funnel of Proton activity in China. So maybe this Hefei order will stimulate some Proton growth in China.", "Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Thank you. Good evening, guys. Can you hear me okay?", "Dow R. Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Jeff. We can hear loud and clear.", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Great, hey, Dow. So one question for you. I don't think anybody has asked on your western European comments at this point. It sounds like you mentioned that being soft this quarter. Last quarter, you guys put up a very strong EMEA number; this quarter the comp was a lot tougher. So have you really seen anything change or is it just comp driven? I know you had some big orders last year in this quarter in EMEA, so just trying to figure out if you're really seeing sequentially change in that market or how you'd describe market trends over in Western Europe right now?", "Dow R. Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "You know, we're watching Western Europe and Latin America. Those are the two light spots. Americas, we've talked about that a lot; it continues very strong. China looks good. Japan, flat, which it's been down, so flat's the new good in Japan for us. So that's okay. The two watch areas for us are frankly Western Europe and Latin America. Latin America was down more than 40% this quarter; that's macro economically driven. We do have \u2013 in Europe there is a tough comp on the quarter. We had a large order in the U.K. last year. So we've got a little bit of a comp issue going into Q4 as well. But I'd say we're watching Western Europe. It maybe hasn't been as strong as it has been over the last 18 months or so.", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah. All right. That's very helpful. And then, Elisha, maybe a few clarifying questions for you. One, I think somebody asked on the software and service side. You said you haven't given that, but could you give that? I think in past quarters you have given those trends; if you could just give us at least qualitatively where software and service was this quarter?", "Elisha W. Finney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Higher growth rate in software, then equipment, then service.", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Can we be any more specific there, double digits up or single digits? Let me frame it this way: I think you had been double digits for a long while; it slipped over the last couple quarters to upper single digits. Are we seeing any continuation of that trend or...sorry?", "Elisha W. Finney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So for year-to-date, let me just say, in constant currency services up in the high-single digits, so 7% to 8%. So, a little off the double-digit but not terribly so. Again, we still feel good. The units volume was up this quarter in orders, which bodes well for the service business going forward. So long-term really not coming off of our expectations for the service business at this point.", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "All right, that's helpful. And then last two clarifying, just on the EPS guide you took the low end up by a little over a nickel. Is there anything in there other than just operational at this point? A couple companies have been adopting ASU 2016. Anything like that or anything else we should think about that's impacting your guidance other than just pure operational factors?", "Elisha W. Finney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "It's purely operational, and we just took the midpoint and took it out by the $0.04 beat from the midpoint in Q3 and narrowed the range a little bit, given that we're down to the last quarter. But no, we are not adopting the new tax provision because of the spin. We're going to wait until we get through that.", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay.", "Elisha W. Finney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So nothing in there other than operational.", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Makes sense. And last question just on ICB. The orders up 13% and revs up 13% \u2013 or 19%, I'm sorry. How much of that was organic and how much was acquisition driven?", "Dow R. Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We're year-over-year with MeVis, so that's in the base now. So Claymount what's different, and it would have been 8% revenue growth.", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. So you only have one point of acquisitions?", "Dow R. Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Is that right? Did I get that number right?", "Elisha W. Finney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. That's correct.", "Dow R. Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "A little more than a percent.", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "All right. That's all I've got. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.", "Stephen C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hey, Dow.", "Dow R. Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Steve.", "Stephen C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "When you look across your business and you look at some of the trends in commodity or oil-sensitive countries and you look at the mid-stage funnel, what does it tell you about how things play out? I know we've had a couple of tough quarters here and there for obvious reasons, in places like Latin America. But we've seen commodity prices in a number of spots pick up. Is that a cause for optimism about 2017?", "Dow R. Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "You know I'd say \u2013 I wish I could look you in the eye and say that about Latin America. I think it's a little broader based than Latin America. And in the Middle East, maybe so. I think it's a good \u2013 you know I don't know that we've \u2013 it's kind of interesting on this quarter a lot of our Africa volume, and it's actually one of the things we really like, a lot of the Africa volume was in the non-oil-based countries. So it's great to \u2013 Ethiopia I mentioned in the call that, that's the first time we've had a Linac order from Ethiopia. And that's the kind of activity we're seeing in those markets. I would say the Middle East has been a little quieter this year, looking back 12 months, because of oil prices. And what are we today? $40, $45 a barrel? You know I think that might be enough to see some of that market come back next year.", "Stephen C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. And then on the Imaging spin, I wonder how the strategic conversations inside the company have been evolving since the Imaging spin? I mean has that opened any new doors for you in terms of collaborations, partnerships or other strategic activity? Thanks.", "Dow R. Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "You know, I mean, we're continuing to look at how we reinforce the strategy of each company as we spin. So we're looking at a broader Oncology front for our \u2013 for the remaining company. And looking for a broader components beachhead for our X-ray business. So the good news is it has been pretty active. I think it's accomplishing both strategically and we think long-term from a value point of view what we want to do, and kind of unleashing a lot of energy around those initiatives. Now frankly we're a little bit in head down mode to get the spin done, so that is consuming us pretty hard here for between now and the end of the year. But we're pushing very aggressive as well on kind of the strategy front in both businesses.", "Stephen C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "I appreciate all the color. Thanks much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey. First question, cancellation this quarter; were they about $42 million? And that's a big step down from what you had last quarter. So Elisha, I'm just wondering if you can talk as to what you think is the underlying trend here?", "Elisha W. Finney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "One of the big differences, Tycho, so it was $51 million in total on backlog adjustments. I believe the actual cancellation was closer to $20 million and the rest was dormancy, where it's just \u2013 it's not probable at this point that the machine will ship within the two-year period of time, so we take it out of our backlog. The big difference is we did not have a big FX impact this quarter, and we had a large one in some of the prior quarters, because as you know, our backlog is held at historical rates and so it gets trued-up every quarter based on the FX. And so that was very minimal this quarter.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe for Dow, on services, you've been outgrowing the market here for quite some time. Can you maybe just talk about the sustainability of that trend? How long you think you can outgrow the market from a service perspective, and do the attach rates vary meaningfully by geography for you guys on that front?", "Dow R. Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I mean we're very bullish about our Service business still. It's a little bit large number, because it's now a billion dollar business. I think on the quarter in Oncology it was 41%, 42% of the total. And it continued to be a juggernaut for us. I would say that it's one of the things we really like about the new socket growth that we're seeing in Latin America and Asia, in particular. That's going to help drive the growth. The software model going to more \u2013 more of a kind of SaaS-based model strengthens that business. And we are seeing lots of positives on the upside.", "On the \u2013 we are seeing in some markets, some of these emerging markets, we're seeing a little bit of wackiness from third-party competition. I wouldn't say that's the reason for the slowdown, I think the slowdown probably has more to do with large numbers and just kind of where we are but in some of these emerging markets we are seeing some growing presence, especially in the older install base, some third party competition, but I'd say we're still in that high-single-digit range, kind of what we're feeling about the long-term capability of our Service business.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And then, does having stability on the reimbursement front \u2013 I mean we got through this Physician Fee cycle relatively unscathed. The first two years of macro will be everybody gets a little bit of a bump. Does that free up the U.S. market a little bit over the next couple years do you think?", "Dow R. Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think it's too early to tell. But that would be \u2013 our gut would be consistent with that. Tycho, I think macro feels a little bit like some of the reimbursement incentives that there were on some of this early IT adoption, three years, four years ago. So I think it's probably a little bit of an upside.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And last one, you made a comment earlier on the China proton funnel. Any sense as to what \u2013 how big you think that market could be?", "Dow R. Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Every time I've forecasted this I've been wrong, so I'm not going to take the bait. The good news is these are government customers. So I think we had our first discussion with Hefei 15 months ago, so we went from first conversation to order in 15 months, and for that, for us that's a record in Proton Therapy. When you get in the private market, and where financing instrument is frankly the most difficult part of the transaction. These deals can take a really, really long time. So where it's sovereign finance, it can move pretty fast. We are having \u2013 I'd say there are three or four live conversations going on. Will they happen in the next 15 months, 18 months? Maybe. At least we have one now.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Understood. All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.", "Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC", "Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. So maybe Dow, a big picture question on \u2013 because now we'll have clean numbers in a few months on standalone Oncology. I was just wondering, can you just comment big picture, what's been the installed base over the last three years, right? Has it been flattish, has it been growing in North America? Because I just feel like that's an important question just given your really, really strong showing here in North America. And obviously that has a lot of implications to margin progression.", "Dow R. Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I'd say, starting at a very high level, we have about a 7,500 unit installed base. We have had positive unit growth, a percent or two, of the installed base. One of the things that we like about the O-U.S. growth, as I mentioned about China, is those are all new sockets. And we get some new installed base growth out of it. We did have very \u2013 in Q3 we had very good unit growth. So one of the best unit growth quarters we've had in a while. So that's going to help our Service business. So I don't know if I'm answering all your questions, Vijay. Elisha, do you have anything to add?", "Elisha W. Finney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Just that the U.S., as we said, Vijay, is largely a replacement market. So the installed base is not necessarily going up, but it is getting higher end equipment that does carry a higher level of service contract.", "Dow R. Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And when we make that trade-out, I'd say our contract capture rate of TrueBeam is 10 points to 15 points higher than our \u2013 than the historical product.", "Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC", "That was very helpful, guys. Maybe just one on software, because \u2013 this is the other question we get a lot. What kind of visibility do we have, right, on the software opportunity? Because I know at the Analyst Day, you guys put out the it's a half a billion opportunity, right, because the reason \u2013 when I look at your comments on the installed base, right, 1% to 2%, obviously you guys have done better on the share front that's showing up in the North America region from an orders perspective. But how much more software can you keep selling into the install base? Or am I thinking about this the right way? Or because I feel like having some clarity on that has a lot of implications in how people look at the company?", "Dow R. Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I mean there's some really simple math here. We've got an installed base of 7,500 units. We've sold \u2013 and we feel really good about it, 500 RapidPlans. We got 7,000 to go. We've got InSightive Analytics, what have we sold, 250, 200-ish? We've got 7,300 to go. So we're in the top half of the first inning, sorry, baseball analogy to my global friends. But we're \u2013 the software, it still has very significant upside for us. And what I'm liking is we're getting very good customer response on the software products. A decade ago it was oh, you ship me software and it works, but I don't love it. Now we're getting hey, it does what I like it to do. It's making me more productive in the workplace. I can do better care and take care of patients better. And we've had some external validation out of this with our class \u2013 the win we had (43:11) kind of the Gartner of Radiation Oncology, class rated as number one in Treatment Planning and in Oncology information systems, so we like that.", "So those were \u2013 RapidPlan and InSightive analytics are two examples. We do have \u2013 in the 7,500 unit Linac installed base, in that installed base we also have 3,400, 3,500 software installations. So those are opportunities for us to take Rapid \u2013 that's the low-hanging fruit of the RapidPlan and InSightive Analytics opportunity. So I think, Vijay, we've still got a lot of opportunity on the software side.", "Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC", "That was really helpful, Dow. If I may just retort to the baseball analogy, I think in a cricket parlance that would be hitting a six. So congratulations.", "Dow R. Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think I know what that means, which is a little scary.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Jason Wittes with Brean Capital. Please proceed with your question.", "Jason H. Wittes - Brean Capital LLC", "Hi guys, thanks for the questions. Just wanted to get an update. I know that things are still moving, but in terms of the numbers you put out when you first announced the spin-out, you noticed \u2013 you mentioned I think \u2013 believe $37 million in overhead dyssynergies. Is that still the number that we should be thinking about? And in terms of who absorbs what, is there any update there?", "Elisha W. Finney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "You know, Jason, at this point it was $20 million of dyssynergies at \u2013 that would be at remain co-Varian. And that number has not changed dramatically at this point. So I think it's still a good number to use. And again, with the goal of having that offset within two year, so that we can get back to the same margin point \u2013 operating margin point.", "Jason H. Wittes - Brean Capital LLC", "And I believe that you're going to give \u2013 the SpinCo will have cash on hand. I believe that was $50 million, but will that be cash taken from overseas or will that be cash that's been patriated in the U.S.?", "Elisha W. Finney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So there \u2013 no number has been determined. All we have said is they will not have debt at the time of the spin. And we are working with our advisors on the capital structure at this point, so stay tuned and we'll be talking about how much cash ends up going with SpinCo and how much of that is U.S. versus O-U.S.", "Jason H. Wittes - Brean Capital LLC", "Okay. And when do you anticipate giving us that update? Will that be when you report the fourth quarter or will that be more towards December?", "Elisha W. Finney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "It's going to be more towards when we're going on the road show.", "Jason H. Wittes - Brean Capital LLC", "Okay.", "Elisha W. Finney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Closer to the spin date.", "Dow R. Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah.", "Jason H. Wittes - Brean Capital LLC", "Okay, fair enough. And just on the Proton business, in terms of \u2013 you've also put out anticipation of reaching profitability. I assume that still goes, and what kind of revenue run rate do you need for that business to really breakeven and make a profit?", "Elisha W. Finney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. It's a little hard to say, Jason. What we really need is the installs to be completed and the Service business to become material to get a significant pop in the margins. But you know this year it's going to be around $150 million. $200 million \u2013 somewhere between $200 million and $225 million it starts looking very different.", "Dow R. Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "(46:37)", "Elisha W. Finney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "We're getting there.", "Dow R. Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "As you know, this is going to change with time, because the margin rates on the equipment \u2013 today they're high teen, mid-high teens. We hope to get that to the 20 to 30 range with time, but the margin rates on service are pretty good. So as the service contracts start to land, the geography of that profitability becomes a little easier with time. That's probably not next year.", "Jason H. Wittes - Brean Capital LLC", "Okay. That's helpful, and then the reimbursement was pretty benign, or actually I'd say positive, not benign; more optimistic than that. But in terms of \u2013 you did mention that they're going to try to start coaxing the market into being more efficient, I believe that's with MACRA and MIPS. There are centers out there who have adopted it. Have you noticed a change in their behavior in terms of what their \u2013 equipment they want, how they're doing they're procedures, things like that? Is there a shift towards more concentrated dosing in those centers, or is it just too early to say?", "Dow R. Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "You know I'd say if anything it might be an incentive for people to take our ARIA InSightive analytics and other ARIA features into the market. ARIA is MACRA compliant. One of the things that gets asked is a lot of metrics, a lot of portability; these are some of the things they're looking for and that's part of that product. So short-termish, as we were talking about in one of the other questions; it could be a little bit of upside maybe next year. I would say we haven't really seen a behavior change in terms of peoples' purchasing pattern one way or the other at this point.", "Jason H. Wittes - Brean Capital LLC", "And also related to that, do you have a sense of how much of the marketplace is actually ready to fully implement MACRA here? It has all of the software in place et cetera?", "Dow R. Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, I think the short version is people just got the standard, so zero. You know? And so \u2013 we looked at a hard look at it. We know that we've got a few product things to do, but that our product is pretty compliant. We're pretty comfortable with where our product is. It's not going to be like a major rewrite or something that we're going to have to do, but we do have to add a few features. And we're very well-positioned for MACRA implementation. So we like that.", "But I would say, if I can come back to the main thrust of the question, I would say we have not seen a purchasing difference with those customers. And with history, if anything, a lot of them tend to be \u2013 they want to be clinically advanced, and they want to be very productive, cost efficient. And sometimes it takes a little bit longer to convince them, but once they're convinced they tend to move faster because they've got the clinical data or the productivity data to make their business case.", "And they may take a little bit longer to convince them, but once they're convinced they \u2013 you know I \u2013 one of the examples I've used historically on this is RapidArc with Kaiser. It took us a while to convince them that RapidArc was really clinically advantageous and was going to give them a productivity pop. Once they were convinced, you know Kaiser North outfit every hospital in a year. It was just bang, they really moved. And I think that's typical from what we see from these kind of customers. They might take a little bit longer to convince them, but when they're convinced they go fast.", "Jason H. Wittes - Brean Capital LLC", "Okay. That's helpful and just a follow-on that. When that happens, which it's going to take some time, I think MACRA itself doesn't really have teeth until the next couple of years. But it does seem like there could be some required upgrades for software that could help you and help I guess your customers as well. But there is an upgrade cycle to be had when this really starts to take over.", "Dow R. Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Absolutely.", "Jason H. Wittes - Brean Capital LLC", "Is that a fair way to think about it?", "Dow R. Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yup. Absolutely. And that's the upside opportunity I've been referring to.", "Jason H. Wittes - Brean Capital LLC", "Yup. Got it. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC", "Oh, good. Thanks, just a couple of follow-ups actually on guidance and Imaging, in particular, and then one on the spin. So for guidance, I guess, the 3% reiteration here, you are baking in quite an acceleration in the fourth quarter. And I'm just wondering how much of that is Oncology-related versus maybe a rebound in Imaging. And then you also spoke quite a bit on Protons, so just trying to get a little bit more color on guidance.", "Elisha W. Finney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC", "And then I'll have the follow-ups. Thanks.", "Elisha W. Finney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So, Anthony, the guidance on Oncology, and I'm assuming you're talking revenue here, should be in the mid-single-digit growth. The Imaging Components business will be in the low-single-digit growth versus the year-ago quarter. And we're going to get $20 million to $25 million or so in additional Proton revenue versus the year-ago period. So a big bump in Proton gets you to around that 7% range in Q4.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC", "No. That's helpful, and then just Imaging Components, again, for the quarter. I know you mentioned in bookings the contribution from \u2013 or gross orders rather, from acquisitions. But I'm just wondering what the revenue contribution was in the quarter from Claymount and MeVis.", "Elisha W. Finney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "About $11 million, I believe, in total.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC", "Helpful. And then last, just on spin. Have you announced if it's a one-for-one share distribution? Or we're still (52:29)", "Elisha W. Finney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "No, we have not. We're working with JPMorgan on that.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC", "All right. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. There are no other questions in the queue at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for any closing comments.", "Spencer R. Sias - VP-Corporate Communications & Investor Relations", "Thank you.

Our company finished fiscal year 2016 on a positive note with healthy fourth quarter and revenue and significant margin improvement in both our Oncology and Imaging Components businesses. Orders in the Oncology and Proton businesses on the other hand were down during the quarter versus tough year ago comparisons in which we had record setting Oncology growth in Western Europe and in our Proton business.", "To summarize, our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2016 we are reporting, GAAP net earnings of the $1.24 per diluted share, up from $0.99 from the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP net earnings of the $1.38 per diluted share, up more than 30% from the $1.04 in the year ago quarter.", "A decline in Oncology orders due to weakness in Western Europe.

Fourth quarter Oncology orders in APAC rose by 8% in dollars and fell by 1% in constant currency. For the full-year, APAC orders rose by 5% in dollars and by 3% in constant currency.", "In EMEA, Oncology orders declined by 17% in dollars and in constant currency principally because of weakness in Western Europe where we had exceptional strong growth in a year ago quarter when we set a record by booking orders for more than a 100 escalators. For the year, orders in EMEA were down 6% in dollars and down 4% in constant currency driven by weakness in Western Europe.", "Comparing revenues on a trailing 12 months basis, we believe we gain market share versus our primary competition. Our average selling price rose with the help of higher mix of TrueBeam and VitalBeam orders. We generated solid order growth during the quarter in emerging markets including Brazil, Africa and in the Middle East.", "In Brazil, we booked nearly $30 million of new business including a big win at Grupo Oncoclinicas, where we will be installing 13 TrueBeam and VitalBeam accelerators as well as software to support clinical operations.", "These will be the first VitalBeam accelerators installed in Latin America.

Total orders in Latin America exceeded $60 million during the quarter, up more than 70% from the prior year period.", "Other emerging markets contributing to Oncology orders during the quarter included Africa was about $20 million and the Middle East where we booked more than $40 million and as an example of progress, we received $14 million order for a eight escalators at the Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad.", "In APAC emerging markets, we have generated healthy order growth in Indonesia, Korea and the Philippines, in those markets particularly Japan also contributed to the order growth in this region.", "Meanwhile, orders in greater China were down from a year ago period in part because of continuing tender protest, while we anniversary the effects of these multiple order and while we are retaining the book of the business that we won. We estimate that orders in China in a fiscal year could have been more than 15 million higher without this protest activity.", "Turning to North America, we established significant new three-year strategic agreement with McKesson Specialty Health to supply its U.S. Oncology Advantage Cancer Treatment networks with equipment software and services. In the first phase, we will be equipping centers with seven TrueBeam and five VitalBeam accelerators.", "We also will be working to establish in our interoperability with Varian\u2019s Information Management and McKesson\u2019s iKnowMed G2 clinical oncology sector. We see an opportunity here to support these networks with more of Eclipse, ARIA, Velocity and new 360 Oncology software. Overall, we had a very good year in North America, where we had in excess of $130 million in take out of more than 40 accelerators and nearly 100 software installations from competitors.", "As you now, we have just return from ASTRO in Boston, it was a great show for us with some 900 attendees at our users meeting numerous customers for emerging markets and very positive response to several major new products that we will be bringing to market this year.", "We introduce 360 Oncology a first of its kind of software tool that enable clinicians on tumor boards to more effectively coordinate patient care among the numerous specialist involved in cancer treatment.

Customer responses enthusiastic and we believe, we have winning product on our hands.", "We also showed our progress in the development of our HyperArc technology for automating and simplifying the delivery of stereotactic radiosurgery with more compact dose distributions and better protection of surrounding healthy tissue. We are aiming reduces important upgrade to our TrueBeam and Edge platform this year beginning with the module for treating head neck cancers.", "Oncology administrators were also very interested in our initiatives in which we will be enhancing the security embedded within Varian Software Systems. We believe, we have a leading position in the development of this important new capability and we expect it could generate an additional $80 million in revenues by the end of fiscal year 2018.", "We have continued to see a very positive market response to our rapid plan and insight of analytics software products that help to improve the speed, quality and cost efficiency treatments. We have taken more than 650 orders or rapid plans since its launch and more than 135 orders for our insight of software. Touching on the service business global revenues rose by 7% during the quarter with gains in all geographies.", "Turning now to our Particle Therapy business, we generated $38 million in orders during the fourth quarter bringing total orders for the year to $104 million. Orders were down significantly from fiscal 2015, when we had a total of fixed system orders including an $87 million order for our ProBeam System at University of Maryland.", "Revenues from 14 ongoing projects grew nicely reaching $68 million in the fourth quarter and bringing total revenues for the year to $163 million including about $10 million in annual service revenues.", "During the fourth quarter, we booked our first single room ProBeam compact order marketing important milestone for the business. This new system will be installed that the Advanced Medicine Training Center in Singapore, where Varian loss provide Eclipse treatment planning system. We also have a 10-year agreement to service the system.", "Also during the quarter, the UK University, Collage London Hospital placed an order for our fourth treatment gantry at the Proton Therapy Center that is currently under construction. Earlier this month, treatment commenced using our ProBeam System at Cincinnati Children's Hospital making it the fifth Varian equipped Proton center to treat clinically. At this point, the Proton sales funnel looks healthy and I\u2019m pleased by the progress we are making.", "Let me turn now to imaging components. Recovery in this business continued in the fourth quarter. Orders grew by 2% to $168 million fourth quarter resulting in 7% orders growth for the last six months. Orders for the year totaled $571 million down 6% from the prior year because of first half headwinds including significant purchasing slowdowns at two major customers. Revenues were up 7% for the fourth quarter and down 2% for the year.", "Our Memphis and Claymount acquisitions as well successful efforts to develop business with new customers contributed Imaging Components order and revenue growth during the quarter. Great cost control as well as a favorable product mix in tubes and fat panel Imaging detector and higher volumes in our security and inspection line enabled the Imaging business to achieve a significant gain in its gross margin for the quarter.", "Looking at operational highlights for the whole year. The Imaging Components business introduced 20 new products completed a 140,000 square foot expansion of this manufacturing facility and Salt Lake City. Opened a new facility in China to service drawing customer base there, successfully integrated and mobilized its Memphis and Claymount acquisitions added 12 new customers to offset slower purchasing from established customers and exceeded its profit targets.", "We are proud of this performance and we expect Imaging Components to be a great company that deliver solid returns on a separates from Varian and is established as Varex Imaging an independent publicly traded company. Work on the separation continues to go smoothly.", "Now, I'll turn it over to Elisha.", "Elisha Finney", "Thanks, Dow, and hello, everyone. Dow has already covered gross orders, so let me start with backlog.", "We ended the quarter at $3.5 billion, down 1% from the year-ago period with the gain in Oncology offset by declines in our Particle Therapy and Imaging Components backlog. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $47 million, bringing net orders for the company to $1.1 million.", "Fourth quarter revenue for the total company were $912 million, up 12% in dollars and up 11% in constant currency. For the year, total company revenues were $3.2 billion up 4$ in dollar and up 5% in constant currency.", "Oncology posted a fourth quarter revenue gain of 7% in dollars and 6% in constant currency.

Including the challenges in the first half, Imaging Components revenue declined 2% for the full year.", "Our Particle Therapy business posted fourth quarter revenue of $68 million bringing total revenues for the year to $163 million a 13% increase from the prior year. The total company growth margin for the quarter were 42.7% up by nearly four points with significant contributions from both Oncology and Imaging Component. Oncology Systems fourth quarter gross margin improved by about five points to 45.3% with the help of favorable product and geographic mix shift as well as product cost reductions.", "For the year, Oncology Systems gross margin improved by almost two points to 44.5%. Imaging Components fourth quarter gross margin rose by about three points to 42.1% due largely to favorable product mix, high volumes in Tubes and security product and lower more anti cost. For the year, Imaging Component gross margin improved by about one point to 41.9%.", "R&D expenses were 66 million, or 7% of revenue, down one point as a percentage of revenue from the year-ago quarter. For the year R&D expenses were 254 million or equal with the prior year as a percentage of revenue at 8%. On a GAAP basis, fourth quarter SG&A expenses were 152 million, or 17% of revenue.", "On a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter SG&A expenses were 134 million or 15% of revenue. The 19 million in non-GAAP adjustment primarily related to the plan separation at the Imaging Components business, ongoing pattern litigation and amortization are been tangible.", "Operating earnings for the quarter were 18.6% of revenue on a GAAP basis and 20.7% of revenue on a non-GAAP basis, reflecting our solid gross margin performance in the quarter. For the year our operating earnings were 17.1% of revenue on a GAAP and up 50 basis points from the prior year to 19.1% of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. Depreciation and amortization totaled 24 million for the fourth quarter and 80 million for the year.", "The fourth quarter effective tax rate was 31.1%, up from the year-ago quarter due to an unfavorable geographic mix of profits. For the year, the effective tax rate was 27.6%.", "Fully diluted shares outstanding for the fourth quarter were 94.5 million, down on a 5 million shares from the year ago period due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Fourth quarter diluted EPS was $1.24 for the quarter on a GAAP basis and the $1.38 on a non-GAAP basis. For the diluted EPS was $4.19 on a GAAP basis, on a non-GAAP basis diluted EPS rose 9% to $4.68.", "Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of 844 million, debt of 667 million, and stockholders' equity of 1.7 billion. DSO at 93 days was up from the year-ago quarter, but improved sequentially from the third quarter.", "Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was 152 million, bringing the total cash flow from operations for the year to 356 million. Primary uses of cash were 87 million for the repurchase of 1 million shares of stock, 43 million to reduce debt, and 20 million for capital expenditures. At the end of the quarter, we had 3.8 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization.", "Before I turn it over to Dow, as you may have seen in our release issued before this call, I intend to retire from Varian in fiscal 2017. I\u2019ll remain in my current role of CFO until a replacement is found and a fluid transition has been completed.", "I\u2019ll also continue leading the separation of our Imaging Components business. We have a tremendous financial team that will perform to this transition to a new CFO without missing a beat. It has been an honor to serve all the Varian's Investors and Analyst over the past 17.5 years. And it's been a privilege to be part of a tremendous growth story that has seen Varian become a global power in to fight against cancer.", "Thank you for being part of the story with me. And now here is Dow.", "Dow Wilson", "Thanks, Elisha. For our company and for our investors Elisha has been an Intelligent Trusted and Energetic leader that all of its count on to help little winning results. We are just counting it up, we think its 71 quarters. So bravo Elisha with help and guidance, we have achieve the sustain decades long record of growth and revenues and profitability. We have been fortunate to have Elisha on our management team, I\u2019m confident that we will make a smooth transition.", "Turning now to guidance, we believe that for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 non-GAAP earnings for the total company including the imaging components business and ramp up costs for a separation will be in the range of $1.3 to $1.7 per diluted share. And revenues will increase by about 1% to 2%.", "As we announced earlier, we will not give earnings guidance for the full fiscal year until after we have completed the separation of the imaging components business. For the full fiscal year 2017, we expect that Varian\u2019s revenues excluding the imaging components business will rise by 3% to 4%. We expect that imaging components revenues for the full fiscal year 2017 will also rise by 3% to 4%.", "We are now ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Jeff Johnson from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.", "Jeffrey Johnson", "Thank you. Good afternoon, guy. Can you hear me okay?", "Dow Wilson", "Hi Jeff. Loud and clear.", "Elisha Finney", "Hey Jeff.", "Jeffrey Johnson", "All right. Great. Elisha I\u2019m not going to touch the 71 quarter comment, I\u2019ll just leave that one alone. I guess, but it\u2019s been great working with you I said that every time, it\u2019s been great working with you for the last seven or eight years that I have covered the stock and I wish you to best in the future.", "Elisha Finney", "Thank you, Jeff.", "Jeffrey Johnson", "You are welcome. So two questions here, one I guess just on cash flow. So cash flow was down, I think on a year down about 25% looks like it\u2019s kind of lowest level we have seen since fiscal 2009 and I was going back. And if I add back some of the non-GAAP cash charges even if I add those back still down below $400 million and it looks like receivables were up, I think about $120 million year-on-year and even 50 million up sequentially. So just trying to figure out, it\u2019s a receivable issue, what is going on there or what is going on basically with your cash flow at this point?", "Elisha Finney", "Sure. So Jeff the oncology AR increased about 8% and that compares the year-to-date sales up 5%. As we have been talking all through this fiscal year early in the year. We moved our collection staff, we had a sales force IT implementation and I think that slowed down collections in the first half and we are continuing to feel that effect all that", "We are making good progress collections in Q3 and Q4 were very strong. But as we move into FY17 absolutely AR collection is going to be a big focus for the entire team. A little bit of it has to do with more extended terms and a zero interest rate environment, we can continue to win high margin business by offering terms.", "And then some of it also both inventory and AR up in the Proton business as we continue to grow that business. And with percentage of completion accounting, it gets a little funky in Proton, because a lot of times were taking revenue and creating an AR under the percentage of completion long before the bills are actually due by the customer. But it will be a big focus as we move into this year.", "Jeffrey Johnson", "Okay, and I know you don\u2019t guide the cash flow I mean on a consolidated basis, can we expect to get back above $400 million in a year we almost touching $500 million a couple of years ago and it seems like $350 million can we at least get back above $400 million, do you think over the next year too?", "Elisha Finney", "That is absolutely my goal this year, and also contracted [indiscernible] were down in the Proton business with orders being lower that drove about I think $40 million or bit so. But yes, our goal is what we did back on a consolidated basis to you know the $400 million level.", "Jeffrey Johnson", "Yes, all right and Dow from a guidance stand point. You know I think we all knew you work on a issue full year guidance from an EPS perspective and we understand the reasons why, but if I look at, if I look at first quarter guidance from an EPS perspective. You are guidance about 5% to 6% EPS growth on a year-over-year basis.", "Is it fair to think about that on kind of a core basis over the following few quarters, obviously we have to take into account that extra $20 million of revenue dyssynergies that will start to hit those to back three quarters. But outside of that issue, is kind your first quarter guidance a reasonable wait of think about kind of the core outlook for the rest of the year?", "Dow Wilson", "Let me talk to the market slight a bit and then I will let Elisha talk it to nothing goes on the guidance side. I think from market perspective, we had big comp in Europe here in the fourth quarter but fundamentally we had a very sound year in the U.S. we see that continuing next year. our funnel remains very good in the U.S. in Asia, China was a little bit off due to some of the structural issues we have seen there, but we think that that market remains robust and should kind of bounced back to double digit levels.", "And then the question for us all this year has been kind of Western Europe and where is it going to land. You know we have talked about on that on this call about it being soft all this year. As we close the year, I would say we feel pretty good about Europe for next year. So, just kind of rounding out the market and top-line side of it I think we feel pretty good about where the market is going to be globally next year with especially Western Europe bouncing back.", "Elisha Finney", "Yes, so for specifically re for Q1 of FY 2017 Jeff, that 1% to 2% on the revenue side, Varian Oncology and Proton is going to be flattish on revenue, but that's really because in the year-ago Q1, we had something like 9% constant currency revenue growth and then we looked at Q2 it was actually a percent.", "So this is just a matter of timing and I think to revenue will be split more evenly between one and Q1 and Q2. So again 3% to 4% for the full year for Oncology. Q1 for Varex the Imaging Component business should be up in the current low double digit range and that versus a very easy year-ago comp as their recovery continues.", "On EPS if you look at our range, it would be 4% to 8% EPS growth versus a year-ago quarter. but I need to stress that also includes $0.01 to $0.02 cost that we are building in the Imaging Components business today to prepare them for the stand. So for an example, they have hired to CIO, they have hired a manager of tax. As their building out their corporate function, those costs are duplicated in this quarter and so really you need to tack on an additional $0.01 to $0.02 to account for that to get to an apple-to-apple.", "Jeffrey Johnson", "Okay and I guess I\u2019ll just repeat the last part of my question which was, is it fair to think of that 4% to 8% EPS growth is kind of a core range we could think of for the rest of year before we then tack on that 20 million of the dyssynergies?", "Elisha Finney", "Okay so let me answer it this way, and this is a completely non-relevant a number, but I\u2019ll give it to you anyway, because we are going forward with this stand, but if we weren\u2019t spending I believe fiscal year 2017 on a consolidated basis we could grow EPS in the high-single-digit range.", "Jeffrey Johnson", "Okay, all right that\u2019s a good start. I appreciate it. Thanks Elisha.", "Operator", "Our next question today is coming from Amit Hazan from Citi. Please proceed with your question.", "Amit Hazan", "Good afternoon guys and let me just add, Elisha had been a great run and we will definitely miss you.", "Elisha Finney", "Thank you Amit.", "Amit Hazan", "Let me start with the guidance on the top-line that you guys talked about the 3% to 4% top-line growth. I just want to make sure we understand that the reported number and constant currency number first and then either way really is that kind of look at orders for Oncology and obviously now pretty much for last couple of years on a reported basis backlog kind of flattish. So maybe just help us Elisha kind of get to that 3% to 4% growth range versus the order in the backlog growth rate we have been seeing?", "Elisha Finney", "Yes, well that\u2019s assuming at today's exchange rate which fortunately have stabilized over the last several quarters. The euro has stabilized, the yen is obviously helping us, if yen weakened significantly that could be an impact, but look at where currency rates are today that 3% to 4% for Oncology and Proton combined, feels about right, that does compare to an Oncology backlog that\u2019s up 3% at the end of the fiscal year 2016. So that looks pretty achievable going into FY2017.", "Amit Hazan", "Okay. And let me just follow-up on the order side on Europe. I mean if I look at EMEA for the year down 4%, I think there is obviously some tough comps there, but are you actually seeing some issues that have been persistent in Europe that you would call out that you don\u2019t have great visibility to them ending other easy comps or. Maybe just a little bit more color on what is going in the issues that have seeing have been or continue to be persist, and what those are?", "Dow Wilson", "Sure, through the course of 2016, I mean I think we had weakness especially in UK, France and Germany and as I mentioned in my response to Jeff's question, we are seeing our funnels in those markets and the rest of Western Europe and the rest of our European map look pretty good as we look forward.", "So I think we are little more encourages about what we see forward than what we see backwards. So we also see some opportunity in Italy and Spain going forward. And then of course our map of Europe includes Africa, Middle East, India and those markets were good to us in Q4 and we see those as continue to strength from those markets.", "Amit Hazan", "And then last one from me just on the [indiscernible], maybe just give us a sense of when those units would actually be booked as orders, if haven't be booked already? And then you kind of talk about that is Phase I, to the extent if you can maybe just talk about they are obviously a big organization right on center perspective. Just the installed base, how much of it is yours and the expense kind of potentially for maybe I would two year how you see that develop beyond these first 14 units or so?", "Dow Wilson", "Yes. Although, we book so far is this first 14 units. So that\u2019s just this first phase, we feel very good about our relationship with McKesson U.S. Oncology Vantage. What we have booked so far is pretty much the hardware piece of the relationship. The contract does include software and service and that will be booked, some of it next year and beyond.", "So we feel very good about where that is headed, I think they are very much and think for what the software product have to do in terms of managing the clinic, providing the analytic tools, macro reimbursement tools, it will include some interoperability with the McKesson iKnowMed product, which was important for McKesson. And very excited about that whole relationship, but most of it is yet to be booked.", "Amit Hazan", "All right. Great. I\u2019ll let some others jump in. thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Tycho Peterson from JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.", "Tycho Peterson", "Thanks. I apologies I\u2019m going to ask another guidance question. But if you think about kind of the end markets values to talk about kind of 6% to 8% market growth then it was kind of mid-single-digits. You are talking 34% revenue growth with some share gains I guess embedded into. Can you maybe just talk about what you see as underlying market growth and in 3% to 4% revenue guidance, how much of that is software and services versus underlying growth in LinAcc?", "Dow Wilson", "I don\u2019t know if I can break that out at this point from a guidance point of view. But as to the overall markets, I mean if anything you might have been a little bit conservative here. I think as we look our funnels here at the beginning of the year, I think the market looks pretty good. We had a ton of activity in especially in the fourth quarter in Europe last year and as we look forward, we see pretty good strength.", "So I would say there are uncertainty around the course, but it\u2019s probably 3% to 3.5% to 6% market growth scenario. Chin is going to continue to do well. India is going to do well, We are growing in Africa. We had pretty good years this past year in Brazil, but we see continued strength in the Brazilian market and that\u2019s good news.", "And then in the U.S. market it\u2019s been as I mentioned in the scripts, it was 5% growth on the year and if anything that would a little bit ahead it kind of where we thought, it would be coming into the year as we look at 2017 funnels remain very strong in the U.S.", "Elisha Finney", "If I could just add to that Tycho, in terms of the top-line growth for oncology, the good news is pricing is holding globally and we have seen significant product cost reduction, we have basically obsoleted the C Series and moved everyone on to the TrueBeam platform. And I think this margin improvement, you have seen the last couple of quarters and oncology is sustainable going forward. So We are kind of moving them up to 44% to 45% gross margin level and so obviously even at the top-line is off a point or so, we make up a lot of that difference in the margin improvement that we are seeing there.", "Tycho Peterson", "Okay. That's good to hear, and then Dow may be could you help on macro the final rule where your thoughts on. As we think about that getting implemented how do we think about that may be driving more of a bias towards software and some of this.", "Dow Wilson", "Yes, no I think we are overall it's a good opportunity for our product line with our insight of analytics tools, our rapid plan and treatment planning and our 360 Oncology you know its connect trade and opportunity. For us to provide our customers with required reports they're going to need to comply.", "They have got a demonstrate certified the HER, Electronic Health Record. They have got to demonstrate improvement in care management and practices and they have a report on their quality metrics. So these tools all do that. So I think it\u2019s going to be pretty good news for us. The product line is about where we needed to be to comply we got few things to button down but we will be way ahead of the in the compliance requirements and we have got just our own installed base is about 18,000 sites that got to go and we are very excited about that.", "May be just on top of that this is a macro but the other keys from a market point of view that is a least as important as macro is the cyber security. And you know this at ASTRO we launched a very significant upgrade to our software products for cyber security and that product could be ready here in early spring and that should drive some upside for us too, so we are excited about that one.", "Tycho Peterson", "And then one last one, you know North America Oncology orders last quarter up 15%, they were up only 3% this quarter, were there some pull forward dynamic to CMS to kind of come out ahead time and said physician fee schedule wouldn't be [indiscernible]?", "Dow Wilson", "You know there is always from lumpiness quarter-to-quarter, I would say, in the second half the CMS had very little to do with this. You know it's just timing of some of the orders.", "Tycho Peterson", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question today come from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.", "Dow Wilson", "Hi Vijay.", "Vijay Kumar", "Hey guys, how it's going?", "Elisha Finney", "All right.", "Vijay Kumar", "So, Elisha maybe I'll start one with the a question for you just sort of fund of timing here, just on the decision to step aside, if you could just walk us through some the claiming mission I think that will be helpful context in the heading into the span?", "Elisha Finney", "Sure, well I started my CFO career with the span, I figured why not end it with a span. So, back in 1999 and as Dow said about 71 quarters , it just feels like to right timing Vijay. In terms of the exact timing that's to be determined, I am completely dedicated to getting us through to span of the Imaging Components business. We can now go out and conduct a research and want to find a world class finance leader who can come into describe organization and have time to transition and so it will be at some point in this fiscal year but the exact date is are not determined at this point.", "Vijay Kumar", "Got you, and may be just a couple of a quick one on the guidance question. So did I hear you correctly when you said the EPS was a high single off of the current year base and just does that number include the 20 million dyssynergies and you have the accounting rule change sort of baked in and just can you walk us through some moving parts there?", "Elisha Finney", "Yes, that was a hypothetical number that said if we weren\u2019t spending, we believe EPS would grow on a consolidated basis in the high-single-digits. The 20 million of dyssynergies, I have to say we are well underway of looking for cost reduction opportunities and we are absolutely committed to having $10 million of that out at a run rate by the end of fiscal year 2017 and the additional $10 million out by FY 2018. So lots of work already going on that.", "I will tell you that most of those dyssynergies for Varian are offset because we will have a lower tax rate, because Varex has a 35%, 36% tax rate. Unfortunately for my colleague [Clarence Verhoef] (Ph) his tax rate is going up versus the Varian average but a Varian\u2019s tax rate will come down a point or two and that largely offset the dyssynergies in you are wanting to.", "Vijay Kumar", "That was helpful. And maybe just a quick one on Q1. I mean if I look at the guidance commentary at the midpoint EPS, it looks like maybe margins would be somewhere around 17.5 maybe a few basis point above the 17.5. so that\u2019s a step down just from the Q4 levels, commentary on which is gross margin for Oncology, can you just walk us through why the margins were step down from Q4 to Q1? Thank you.", "Elisha Finney", "Yes, you always. Every year if you go back you see seasonality, I mean Q4 is always our largest quarter with the highest operating margin typically. So it's not uncommon for the operating margin to step down from Q4 to Q1. When you run your model through, I mean what I am showing at the mid-point is that we will increase our operating margin by about a point to 18% on a non-GAAP basis. Again, Oncology\u2019s gross margin will be between 44%, 45%, Imaging Components in the low 40s. So it's looks closer to an 18% operating margin.", "Vijay Kumar", "Thank you guys.", "Elisha Finney", "And again Vijay, that does include - I want to make sure everyone understands, it includes some duplicative cost and Varex as we are hiring people to gear up with the span, we cannot take those cost out to be non-GAAP and that\u2019s between $0.01 and $0.02 in Q1 for those duplicative cost.", "Vijay Kumar", "Very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thanks. Our next question today is coming from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.", "Anthony Petrone", "Thanks and congratulation Elisha, it was great working together over the years and good luck on the next phase.", "Elisha Finney", "Thank you.", "Anthony Petrone", "A couple of questions just I guess higher level, maybe exiting fiscal 2016 here will be helpful to get an update on the percentage of the installed base, the LinAcc installed base that really is now TrueBeam and VitalBeam. And really what I am getting out is what percentage of the installed base has stereotactic to capabilities and what percent is not truly in relation to Dr. Kuntia\u2019s presentation at ASTRO.", "The opportunities for SRS, SBRT going forward over the next 10 to 15 year. I am just trying to get a sense of what percentage of the base can migrate to having stereotactic capabilities in the next few years? And then I have a follow-up on software and margins.", "Dow Wilson", "That\u2019s a good question, I would say from a very high level we have got about 1,500 TrueBeams in the installed base of call it 7,500 machines. Now, when you look at some of the capabilities, the interesting thing, when you talk about HyperArc. HyperArc available on every one of those TrueBeams. So this is kind of first, we have had some other smaller upgrade that we offered on TrueBeam like some imaging improvements and some other things over the last few years.", "But the HyperArc for some of the stereotactic radiosurgery patients that Dr. Kuntia talked about at ASTRO will be available on the Edge and TrueBeam only. So very excited about that. I think that will probably drive some of the other installed based to trade out to TrueBeam as well.", "So very encouraged about that, I would say when you look at the past quarter Americas was almost virtually 100% TrueBeam, VitalBeam might have been one or two that weren\u2019t, but pretty much everything in the Americas, that well North America for sure was TrueBeam, VitalBeam.", "And I would say of those in terms of the capability that they had in the fourth quarter. Maybe half had SRS, SBRT capability. When you look at the install base big opportunity there. Most of them do not have that capability.", "And so I think, this bodes well for us next year in two ways, one it\u2019s an upgrade opportunity and two it\u2019s going to help us on pricing on TrueBeam. We are going to be able to maintain or grow price on TrueBeam and I think that\u2019s a little bit, We are doing very well on the cost side.", "Where is this margin rate improvement coming from are doing very well on the cost side the operational team has done a fabulous job getting cost down on TrueBeam. But then as well We are seeing a really nice mix of these advanced capabilities that are giving us some price support on the pricing side.", "Anthony Petrone", "And just a quick follow-up on that, that would be just. How do you see that transitioning, just when you think of the 2019 reimbursement changes when oncology may go bundled and then more focused on efficiencies and outcomes? Does it accelerate the demand for stereotactic within the installed base or do you think this sort of plays out pretty ratably over 12 to 15 years?", "Dow Wilson", "I mean, I think, if anything that will be a little faster, because some of the reimbursement pressure. Having said that, clinicians are going to want to make sure there is a really responsible clinical comparison done. So our customers are sensitive about that. I think one of the exciting things to us is in some applications the hypofractionation trend is going to bring more patients back to us.", "So for example, in prostate cancer over the last half dozen years, we have lost a little bit of share at robotic surgery. But I think now as those starts to go hypofractionated we get those, a lot of those patients back. Results are as good or better than surgery and that\u2019s well documented.", "And then as well, I think the other big opportunity from a clinical growth perspective here is metastatic disease, this capability really enables a very precise dose deposition. And we think that there are in the U.S. alone 300,000 patients that we get could have opportunity to go after with this capability and bring some new folks into the radiation therapy paradigm. So we are excited about the capabilities this opens up.", "Anthony Petrone", "And then just quickly on software margins may be just another high level. Where do we sit exiting fiscal 2016 when you look at software/services as a percent of the total for the [remain co] (Ph) and do you see a point where there is a higher mix of software. Say over the next three to five years and if we do have that scenario what do you think overall margins look like under that scenario? Thanks again.", "Elisha Finney", "Let me just say for you to date 2016 service was just low 40. There was about 42% of the total revenue for Oncology so call it 60/40. And clearly as of service and software grow faster than the hardware. It does have an upward bias on gross margin. In fact that has been helping us for last couple of quarters. Software is roughly 10% of total Oncology revenue.", "Anthony Petrone", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question today is coming from Brandon Henry with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.", "Brandon Henry", "Hey, thanks for taking my question. First of all can you just discuss how software and services performed in the quarter. These businesses continue growing combined kind of high-single-digits. And were there any change in growth rate this quarter versus last quarter?", "Dow Wilson", "Our revenue in service were up 7%, revenues in software were around the same. I think the as we look forward in the service funnel I would say it looks very good. We had a little bit of currency last year, we had a little bit of timing. I think on the year we would like to see that number be a little of north of 7% and that's kind of what we are stressing the team for, but service business continues to be solid growth for us.", "Software, we had the very good year in treatment planning. We talked about that in the script with all the rapid plan orders. I think this next year with the improvements that we have in our in insight of analytics and with our 360 Oncology product. It can be very exciting. We are curious little bit to see how that goes because 360 Oncology is going to be cloud based.", "So the financial impact is going to be a little more back end loaded as we accumulate sites, do to billing and collect the orders on that basis. I think it's going to be a little - it is a little bit of a transition as we go kind of from annual license model to a software-as-a-service model.", "So having said that, one of the really cool things about the 360 Oncology product is it can play not just in ARIA Varian side, it can play in every radiation Oncology site in the world and just a really a great opportunity for us to get some penetration, in fact we that we don\u2019t have today.", "Brandon Henry", "Okay and then separately can you guys talk about your expectation for free cash flow for fiscal year 2017 versus fiscal year 2016 and how should we think about the balance of M&A versus share repurchase is in the near-term and then what size deals and debt levels do you feel comfortable for each company going forward? Thanks.", "Elisha Finney", "I'll answer the first part of that to have question Brandon, as it has came up earlier on the call. Our cash flow from operations was down year-over-year we ended both Q3 and Q4 on a strong note, but we were kind of in a whole in that. The first half of the fiscal year on collections of AR for a couple of reasons moved this collection staff, we had at IT implementation et cetera.", "So we are very focused on cash flow particularly AR as we move into FY 2017 and on a consolidated basis our expectation would be that we could get back to around the $400 million level in cash flow from operations.", "CapEx has always been relatively stable. And then in terms of share repurchase versus M&A, I think we would always love to prioritize M&A if the right targets come along in that\u2019s the duty of our share repurchase program we can turn it on and off and at various levels depending on what activity in M&A that\u2019s there.", "Dow Wilson", "Yes, and just as a comment, it's can be strategically driven, how can we strengthen our Oncology franchise, I don\u2019t see us going way out on the edge and doing something for example maybe in chemotherapy to pick one. But other image guidance technologies, are there radiation technologies, are there software technology that can reinforce our core and give us some higher growth segments to participate in. That\u2019s what we will look at.", "Brandon Henry", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thanks. Our next question is coming from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.", "Anthony Petrone", "Just a quick housekeeping one, just kind of going to some queues here on the Kendall acquisition in Poland, maybe what is baked in there for fiscal 2017 and if any of that hit in the fiscal fourth quarter as well? Thanks again.", "Elisha Finney", "In terms of revenue?", "Anthony Petrone", "Yes, revenue contribution in the quarter and then\u2026", "Elisha Finney", "It would just be service revenue about $1 million or so this fall.", "Anthony Petrone", "In Q4 and I guess if we just annualize that in 2017 to get the contribution or\u2026", "Elisha Finney", "Yes. It's somewhere between annualized $14 million to $16 million market for us and it's a growing market, so we feel very good about Poland over the next several years. And one of the reason is the timing was right to make the acquisition and go direct.", "Anthony Petrone", "Okay. Thank you again.", "Operator", "Thank you. We have reached end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.", "Dow Wilson", "Thank you. Thank you all for participating. A replay of the call can be heard on the Varian\u2019s Investor website at www.varian.com/investor, where it will be archived for a year.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Mr. Spencer Sias, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications for Varian Medical Systems. Thank you, Mr. Sias. You may begin.", "Spencer R. Sias - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Varian Medical Systems conference call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. With me are Dow Wilson, President and CEO; Elisha Finney, CFO; and Magnus Momsen, our Controller. Dow and Elisha will summarize Varian results and we'll take your questions following the presentation.", "To simplify our discussion, unless otherwise stated, all references to the quarter or year are fiscal quarters and fiscal years. Quarterly comparisons are for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 versus the second quarter of fiscal 2016. References to financial results for orders are to gross orders, unless otherwise indicated.", "The company is reporting non-GAAP results in order to provide quarter-over-quarter comparisons of operational performance, excluding unusual items. Unless otherwise stated, all financial results are discussed from continuing operations on a non-GAAP basis.

So this is my 73rd and last call with all of you, which is probably enough for anybody. And it has been a pleasure to work with you, and I want to thank you for the support you have shown me and Varian for all these years. I'm as excited as ever about the future of this company, and I expect to continue being a Varian investor, like all of you, for many more years. Thanks again for your support.", "And now, here's Dow.", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Good afternoon. I'm pleased to report that our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 were at the high end of our earnings per share expectations. Highlights included solid growth in orders and revenues in our Oncology Systems business, a new system order in our Particle Therapy business, improved gross margins in our Oncology business and stepped-up investment in SG&A for market developments and new product introductions. Additionally, we successfully completed the spin-off of the Imaging Components business as Varex Imaging, which is off to a great start.", "To summarize Varian's second quarter results, we are reporting GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $0.74 per diluted share and non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $0. 89 per diluted share; companywide revenues of $655 million, up 6%; solid Oncology orders of $648 million, up 5% in dollars and 6% constant currency, bringing year-to-date orders growth to 7% in dollars and constant currency; and a $26 million equipment order for a single-room proton system in Delray, Florida.", "Focusing first on Oncology operations, we had a good quarter with solid order growth in emerging markets as well as healthy orders for software in North America and equipment in EMEA. Looking specifically at order growth rate in each region, oncology grew gross orders in the Americas by 3% in dollars and constant currency. Orders in North America were up by 3%, bringing the year-to-date order growth in this region to 5%.", "Looking at some highlights in the Americas, we took orders to replace 12 accelerators from competitors. We also took numerous software orders for replacement of competitive software for treatment planning and information management. Among the competitive conversions was a $20 million, 10-year software commitment from Orlando Health. They will install our full suite of software including Eclipse, ARIA and Velocity systems and our FullScale managed services package. We booked nearly $7 million of that order in the second quarter, and we'll book the rest as installations are scheduled.", "Elsewhere in North America, we booked 6 TrueBeam orders for installation at CHUL (5:19) in Qu\u00e9bec City and then another 3 TrueBeam orders for a Rhode Island Hospital in Providence. In Latin America, orders grew by nearly 10% versus a relatively small year-ago number, with order activity driven primarily by Brazil, where construction of our new Complexo for education and manufacturing is nearing completion. While the sales funnel across Latin America looks promising, activity is slow and we continue to be cautious about the rate of recovery in this market.", "Turning to EMEA, orders rose 6% in dollars and 10% in constant currency. Africa, the Middle East and Western Europe were the biggest growth drivers in this region. Business in Africa has more than doubled over the past year and has risen successfully, successively for the last four quarters. As you may have seen from our recent press release, we are now selling direct in South Africa.", "Among the highlights in Africa were orders for the first Edge Radiosurgery System in Morocco to serve the North Africa sub-region, and a low energy Linear Accelerator in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is the first modern Linear Accelerator in a country of more than 80 million people.", "We also generated notable orders in Tunisia as well as in Turkey and Israel. Spain and Portugal contributed strongly to EMEA's Western European growth during the quarter, placing orders for a total of eight accelerators including 4 TrueBeams, 2 VitalBeams and two Clinacs. In APAC, gross orders rose 8% in dollars and 7% in constant currency.", "Service grew in double-digits, but product sales also played a key role in this region. Orders in China rose by 8% and we believe we have the leading share in this market, particularly in the high-end segment with products like Trilogy, VitalBeam, TrueBeam and Edge. We are on track to top $225 million orders in China this year.", "We also saw good order performance in Korea and the Philippines. We also received our first order in Cambodia for an accelerator and brachytherapy unit for Cambodia's largest public hospital, Calmette.", "During the quarter, we hosted three users meetings in APAC including Beijing, Bangkok and Melbourne. We welcomed more than 1,000 customers at these terrific events where presentations focused on radiotherapy innovations , radiosurgery and the role of immunotherapy.", "Turning to our Global Service business, we grew orders by 8% in the quarter and 7% for the first half. This more than $1 billion annual business is continuing to grow faster than oncology's overall growth rate and contributing to margin expansion. On the hardware front, TrueBeam continued its momentum with more than 1,700 installations worldwide or about 20% of our global installed base.", "TrueBeam is a widely accepted product that addresses a clinical need in every region of the world. It is a versatile platform capable of delivering every type of treatment, from radiotherapy to radiosurgery with either electrons or photons and at multiple energy levels.", "We are continuing to add to TrueBeam's capability. And later this year, we expect to introduce the first version of our HyperArc module for high definition head and neck radiosurgery with ultra-precise doses that cannot be matched by any other system on the market.", "We're also making good progress with software. As of the end of the quarter, we had about 800 licenses ordered from more than 375 sites for our RapidPlan product that significantly enhances the quality and speed of treatment planning.", "The ramp-up of this product has been tremendous. We see more opportunity ahead as less than 10% of the treatment planning installed base has adopted this technology since its introduction 18 months ago.", "Our InSightive analytics software for identifying and removing bottlenecks in the clinical workflow has been ordered at more than 180 customer sites, who will use it to improve their clinical effectiveness and operational efficiency. We are building a robust pipeline of prospects for our 360 Oncology product.", "I will now turn to our Particle Therapy business, which generated $31 million in revenues during the quarter and recorded $28 million in orders, including the Delray project. This project is being financed in part by the sale of $81 million in bonds, including $11 million of subordinated bonds purchased by Varian. Several other centers in the U.S. are working on similar bond financing.", "In addition to the Delray order, Varian's ProBeam compact single room system has been selected as the equipment of choice for a center in Thailand. And we hope to book that order in the third quarter when the requisite paperwork is processed. Our proton sales funnel looks promising with another two to four projects that have the potential to be booked this year.", "Before turning it over to Elisha, I want to take a few moments to call your attention to some recent promising studies on the role of radiotherapy for prostate and bone cancer as well as some lung cancer studies. The New England Journal of Medicine has published two recent positive studies for radiotherapy. The first shows that untreated prostate patients had more disease progression and metastatic disease compared to treated patients.", "The study in the U.K. involved 1,600 patients who were randomized to either watchful waiting, radical prostatectomy, or 3D conformal radiotherapy over a 10-year period. The second study found no clinically significant difference in disease control between patients treated with either radiation or surgery.", "However, patient-reported quality of life outcome showed that surgery had the greatest negative effect on sexual function and urinary continence. In contrast, radiotherapy had little effect on urinary continence.", "Bowel toxicity was slightly worse with radiotherapy, but that largely cleared up after six months except for a minor increase in more frequent rectal bleeding. Today most radiotherapy for prostate cancer uses image-guided IMRT, a more precise method of dose delivery.", "Also, ASTRO recently just published guidelines for palliation of bone mets with radiation, which continues to be the gold standard for palliative care. While 88% of hospice professionals believe radiotherapy should be used for pain control, only 3% of hospice patients actually receive it. A study in Canada showed similar results. Combined, these studies suggest that not only is radiation for bone mets effective, it is also underutilized.", "Finally, two papers were presented recently at a Thoracic Cancer Meeting in San Francisco. The first was a multi-institutional study that analyzed patients over 80-years-old with early stage non-small cell lung cancer treated with radiosurgery. Despite their age, these patients tolerated radiation quite well with a 2-year local control of 84.5% and a cancer-specific survival of 73%, dispelling the myth that elderly patients cannot have curative radiation.", "Second, preliminary results were reported in an abstract looking at 27 lung cancer patients retreated with proton therapy at MD Anderson. These patients typically do poorly. But in this study, 78% of patients had their tumors controlled at one year and had an impressive median survival of 18 months. Though retrospective, this small study does suggest that proton therapy may be an important tool for recurrent, previously radiated tumors.", "Now, I'll turn it over to Elisha.", "Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Thanks, Dow, and hello, everyone. We have already covered orders and operations, so let me start with backlog. We ended the quarter at $3.1 billion, up 4% from the year-ago period including a 6% increase in the Oncology backlog to $2.9 billion. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $50 million, bringing net orders for the company to $625 million.", "Now, let me walk you through the P&L. Second quarter total company revenues from continuing operations were $655 million, up 6% in dollars and up 7% in constant currency. Oncology revenues totaled $624 million, up 7% in dollars and in constant currency versus the year-ago quarter. International revenues rose 10% and constituted 52% of Oncology revenues in the quarter. Year-to-date, Oncology revenues were up 3% in dollars and in constant currency.", "Our Particle Therapy business posted revenues of $31 million, up 1% from the year-ago quarter driven by ongoing progress on installations. Year-to-date, Particle Therapy revenues were up 7%. The total company gross margin for the quarter was 42.2%, up 7 basis points with a 1-point gain in Oncology largely offset by declines in the proton business.", "Oncology Systems gross margin increased by a point to 44.5%, due to a favorable product mix as well as product cost reductions. For the first half, Oncology gross margin is up almost 3 points to 45.6%.", "Proton therapy gross margin was a negative 3.6%, due largely to revised profitability estimates on two projects in the U.K. where the pound is at a historical low. For the first half, proton gross margin is down from the year-ago period to 6%. For the first half, total company gross margin was up more than 2 points to 43. 7%.", "Second quarter SG&A expenses were $118 million or 18% of revenues in line with our expectations as we accelerated investments in the introduction and commercialization of new products. Second quarter R&D expenses were $53 million or 8% of revenues, equal to the year-ago quarter as a percentage of revenue.", "Second quarter operating earnings totaled $106 million or 16% of revenue, down from the year-ago quarter due to lower proton gross margin and the increased investment in SG&A. Depreciation and amortization totaled 19 million for the quarter. The effective tax rate was 21.6% for the quarter, lower than expected due to a large revenue shift to EMEA where rates are relatively low. For the balance of the year, we believe Varian's tax rate will be about 24% to 25%.", "During the quarter, we spent $173 million to repurchase 2 million shares of stock. Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased 2.5 million from the year-ago quarter to 93.7 million due to our ongoing share repurchase program.", "Diluted GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.74 for the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.89. Year-to-date, non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.47 including the $0.34 impact from proton accounts receivable impairments in Q1 versus $1.67 for the same period last year.", "Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $706 million, debt of $547 million and stockholders' equity of $1.3 billion. DSO at 108 days was down nine days from the year-ago period due exclusively to significant improvements in our Oncology business, which is at 96 days.", "Cash flow from operations including discontinued operations was $32 million for the second quarter and $114 million for the first half. Primary uses of cash were $173 million toward the repurchase of 2 million shares of stock and $15 million for CapEx.", "As of today, we have 6 million shares remaining under our existing repurchase authorization. This is my last call as well, and I will be retiring as CFO on May 8. For me, it has been a tremendous pleasure to work with you. And I thank you for the support that you have shown me and this great company. Like Spencer, I will be a long-term Varian shareholder, and my blood will always run Varian Blue.", "And now, let me turn it back to Dow.", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Thanks, Elisha. We now believe that for the second through fourth quarters of fiscal 2017, total company revenues from continuing operations will grow in the range of 3% to 5%, depending on the timing of proton orders.", "For the full fiscal year, total company revenues from continuing operations should grow in the range of 2% to 4%. For the second through fourth quarters, we expect that earnings per diluted share from continuing operations will be in the range of $2.98 to $3.06. For the full fiscal year, earnings per share from continuing operations should be in the range of $3.56 to $3.64, including the $0.34 impairment of proton account receivables in the first quarter.", "For the third fiscal quarter, we believe Varian revenues from continuing operations will grow by about 3%. And we expect that non-GAAP earnings per diluted share will be in the range of $0.92 to $0.96.", "To summarize the second quarter, we had solid orders and revenue growth in Oncology systems, a new single-room proton order, a gain in our gross margin and earnings at the high end of our target range. We have stepped up our investment in market development as well as new product introductions that will drive continued growth around the globe.", "I want to remind you to attend our Investor Meeting next week at the New York Stock Exchange or via webcast. You can get details on our Investor Relations website. We're excited about the future, and we're looking forward to the rest of fiscal year 2017.", "Before turning it over to your questions, I'd like to acknowledge Elisha and Spencer for their many contributions to the company, 70-plus quarters together, what's the exact count?", "Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "73.", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "73 quarters together, that's more than imaginable. And we are so grateful for their contributions, for the advocacy they've had for our customers, for our shareholders, for our employees and for the communities that we live and operate in. They've been great business partners. And on behalf of myself and the company, we wish to thank them. We'll miss their leadership and we'll miss the blond hair flip and the voluble banter.", "So with that, we'll open up for questions. Thank you, Spencer and Elisha.", "Spencer R. Sias - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Hey, thank you very much, Dow. I just want to thank you for those comments. But I also want to just interject a quick correction. We talked about the Investor Meeting next week at the New York Stock Exchange. It is on May 10th, which is the week after next. And so the details are there. And not your fault. It's just my final error, I hope.", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "May 10th. And we'll now open for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson of Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Yes. Thank you. Good morning guys. Elisha and Spencer, congratulations on the retirements, and best of luck to you. And Elisha, how you survived 73 quarters with that man, I don't know.", "Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Thank you, Jeff.", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "And Spencer that was supposed to be a backhanded compliment to you as well. So congratulations", "Spencer R. Sias - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Yes, I got that. I got that, Jeff. Thank you", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "So a couple of questions, Dow, first just on guidance. You came in at revenue wise above kind of the three-quarter guidance that you've been providing. You came up above that from a revenue perspective this quarter. But you are lowering the low end of that three-quarter revenue guidance. So just trying to figure out the dynamics of a third, a second quarter that was kind of above expected, but now guidance is being trimmed at the bottom end. And what's driving that?", "And then a second guidance question, just it looks like tax rate guidance is now adding about $0.10 relative to what we were thinking going into this quarter for the rest of the year. And yet, you're not changing EPS guidance, so any color there would be helpful as well. Thank you.", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Yeah Elisha, go ahead.", "Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Yeah. Jeff, so let me take the tax first. So yes, it was lower than we expected in Q1. It ended up being roughly an exact offset to the reduction in the proton gross profit that we were expecting. So we hit the high end of the guidance range for the quarter, although the geography was a little different.", "For the balance of the year, we continue to believe that tax is going to be now we think in the 24% to 25% range, which will get you up to about call it 24% for the year. We had previously guided 25% to 26%. So we're getting about a 1-point improvement in the tax rate largely offset by the proton gross profit.", "And I think, we said last quarter, the biggest unknown in this whole \u2013 doing the discontinued operations and spinning out of Varex, the tax rate was kind of the cloudiest, if you will, for us to see.", "The good news is we were able to shave out a point. And again, we think the full year closer to 24%, which should be sustainable going forward. So in the guidance, again because we got an improvement in the tax rate, the gross profit for the year for protons, we're losing somewhere around $6 million or $7 million. So that tax is an offset to that.", "The gross profit for Oncology, right in line with what we were expecting in the call it the 44% to 45.5% range, SG&A, maybe $1 million or $2 million high, but within our expectations. So we simply raised the midpoint at this point in the quarter from $3.00 to $3.02 for the balance of the year and came off the low end of that guidance number. Does that answer your question?", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Yes, I think on the revenue side, really on the timing of protons...", "Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Yes...", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "...proton deals, that's the shoring up of the bottom end of the revenue guidance.", "Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Yes.", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And Dow, maybe one follow-up just on the proton side. So when I think back five, six years ago when you first announced the Scripps deal and the balance sheet risk with that, I think one of the explanations was you had to get a win on the board and if you had to put the balance sheet at risk to kind to get a win on the board that makes sense.", "Over the last few years, there's been a couple of other financing deals you guys have been involved with, but they've been big systems, they are multi-room systems. And we kind of thought as we go to single-room systems and you've got 16, now 17 orders out there, you didn't have to prove yourself anymore.", "On this new deal, single-room system, you still have to put the balance sheet at risk. So I guess, what is driving that need to continue to put the balance sheet at risk, now that you have plenty of orders out there, you've proven yourself. The orders are getting smaller. Yet you're still having to get involved to get these things over the finish line?", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "I think. I mean, first of all when you look at this deal, Delray, it's about $80 million of capitalization. We are $11 million of it. As I mentioned in the script, we think there's a few more like that.", "These are deals that look pretty good to us from a profitability point of view. It remains difficult to finance. Having said that, when you look at the risk, when you look at the ramp-up of centers, pretty much every center that we have and that we know about, as we've looked at that ramp-up on these single-room systems, they get to profitability pretty quickly.", "So the issue has been these three and four room centers have a lot of capital in them and the breakeven point is much, much higher. On these single-room systems, the breakeven point is much lower. We think they'll get to those volumes very quickly, should be able to be refinanced.", "And if we can help bootstrap that and get it going, we're very much into it. So we did view this segment as this compact segment as a distinct segment to the proton market. We will use our balance sheet selectively there. We are vetting the risks very carefully. So that we're in with others. We're looking very hard at the referral networks and patient volumes to make sure they can get to those levels. And if we do it, it's also a profitability case. The interest income is not negligible on these loans.", "Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Yes. If I could just add one thing to that, I mean this is a developer deal with Proton International. Everybody has some skin in game in this particular deal, Jeff. So the doctors have money in. Everybody came together to get this to happen and it was oversubscribed on the muni financing by a significant amount. So we took that as great news that there is a real market for financing these one-room centers.", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Thank you.", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Yeah. And maybe I'd just add, we're not going to go crazy on this. We might, if everything went our way, maybe two more of these in the next 6 to 12 months. I mean at the high end, three. So it's not going to be, we still got Maryland out there, I'm sorry, not Maryland, we've still got Emory out there that we've talked about and then supporting a few of these compact deals as well. Next question?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Amit Hazan of Citi. Please proceed with your question.", "Amit Hazan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Thanks good afternoon guys. And Elisha and Spence, thanks for all the help over the years and good luck in the next chapter.", "Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Spencer R. Sias - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Amit Hazan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "So let me just actually start with orders first and go to the U.S. environment. I mean, if I'm just kind of reading or understanding your comments correctly, it sounds like software was very strong, the implication being that hardware was maybe a little bit less strong. And so I'm just wondering in the U.S. market, did you see any changes in purchasing patterns with the uncertainty going on? Or has it been pretty much the same?", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "I'd say it's been pretty much the same. We feel very good about the first half orders performance in the U.S. So that's been, looking at the half, it's been strong. And frankly looking back five or six quarters, it's been very steady. One of the things that we liked this quarter was the software volume was up. So, I mean equipment bounces around a little bit it's a little bit lumpier. The software volume was up double-digit and we were very pleased about that. I'd say, no real difference in the U.S. market.", "Amit Hazan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. And then maybe let me jump to cash flow actually. So thinking about it in 2016, this came up a few times, free cash flow was down a lot, like 25% or so I think in 2016. Free cash flow conversion used to be really strong in the 80%s or so. Cash flow looked kind of weak again this quarter. Maybe give us some color on what's going on there, and what we should expect for the rest of the year.", "Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Sure. So Amit, again, just given the spin, let me clarify that cash flow from operations is not on a continuing operations basis. So you typically don't try and go back and parse the cash flow from operations from one entity to the other. So for the first half, and I always like to look at this more, I mean you're going to get quarterly fluctuations. For the first half, cash flow from operations was $114 million.", "We estimate, again this is not a number that will show up in a public filing, but we believe that about $94 million of that is attributable to Varian, with the rest being attributable to Varex. Remember, we've also had significant transaction expenses associated with the spin and on hiring people to get ready for the spin. So if you were to just add maybe, we still have some transaction expenses that have not been paid yet. But even if you add somewhere around $15 million, $17 million of that being in transaction, and the first half is usually about 40% of the full year, which gets you up around $275 million, $280 million for Varian standalone for the year. And what we've said is, our hope is that we were $400 million with Varex, and it would be probably closer to around $300 million. So I think we're somewhat in that. We're in that ballpark, as we speak.", "Amit Hazan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Let me just sneak one more and then I'll jump back in. So back to the operating margin just as a follow-up to the earlier question. So, I think in your pro forma numbers that you guys filed, it looked like your operating margin is kind of as Varian as a standalone post \u2013 without the spin or after the spin is about 18% in fiscal 2016.", "I think you're talking about 18% to 19% for this year. It sounds like this was a onetime type of item on the proton side this quarter, correct me if I'm wrong. But is the aspiration here for the rest of the year, is 18% or so is the right number for the rest of the year? Are you going to have lingering proton operating margin issues? How should we think about operating margin line for the rest of the year?", "Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "You're absolutely right. I mean, once you pencil this out, you will see pro forma continuing operations for all of last year, we were 18.1%. If you look at the guidance, Q2 to Q4, we will be right around 18%.", "What that means for the year \u2013 and again, I am excluding the impact of the proton AR write-off, so you guys can figure out how you want to reflect that. But for the full year, it puts us 17% to 18% operating margin, which is where we thought we were going to be this time last quarter. So we're not coming off that number.", "Amit Hazan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC", "Great. And congratulations again, Elisha and Dow (sic) [Spencer] (32:19). Thanks for all of the help through the years here. Just to stick on proton for a moment, just want to clarify what exactly is in guidance and what may be potentially still represents upside. And so if I'm hearing you correctly, Dow, the Delray order and the order in Thailand are now factored into guidance. And then there are several other orders, I guess two to four orders including Emory that represent upside to guidance. Is that sort of a fair statement?", "Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "So Anthony, just to clarify. We \u2013 when we start the beginning of the year, we have our backlog of what if you will, of proton orders that we believe we're going to book throughout the year. And as soon as we book an order, we start taking revenue under the percentage of completion. So the timing of those orders can impact revenue. And clearly, that's why we came down a little bit on the revenue forecast for the balance of the year.", "So the Delray deal, it was already in our forecast. So the only upside at this point is the Emory deal. We've been very transparent that it is because it is one of these very large five-room centers in the midst of getting their muni bond financing put together, we have not included that in our numbers because it has the potential to swing it very significantly.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC", "And just to clarify on the swing, I think from my notes last quarter, it was a $0.10 to $0.12 swing the earlier in the year it was finalized. I mean what is the update on that now, just considering the time on the calendar that has passed?", "Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Yes, it's still in that ballpark. I mean it would have more significance on the orders and the revenue because we will start to, we'll start taking earnings on that. But that will obviously flow all the way throughout the installation and acceptance of the equipment. So that will be several years.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC", "Great. And then just a follow-up on balance sheet utilization within proton and maybe across the business. Maybe just an update on, in aggregate, how many proton-related loans or loan products are held on the balance sheet? And in particular to the Scripps loan, is that completely written-off at this point? Thanks.", "Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "No. So currently, we have $60 million in the balance on the Scripps loan. That was after we sold $45 million to JPMorgan a number of years ago. Maryland, our loan amount is $35 million; New York just shy of $20 million; and then we add Delray. So what is that, about $125 million all-in at this point.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Dow I'm wondering if you could, and congrats to Elisha and Spencer. Dow I'm wondering if comment on pricing dynamics. You talked about the12 competitive wins in the U.S. As you go to kind of swap out some of these competitor vaults are you able to hold on the pricing?", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Our pricing dynamics continue to be okay, Elekta remains aggressive. I don't know that they are any more or less aggressive than they've been in the past and we've seen pretty good engagement. I will say that one of the things that was a little unique about the quarter is that the takeouts were broad-based across all our competitors. We had good takeouts against Accuray, good takeouts of old Siemens product as well as a few Elekta units. So it was pretty broad-based.", "And that's something that we've seen in the past. I don't know that that's, it might be a little bit more on the quarter, but not materially more. I think when you look at the last half, TrueBeam pricing remains pretty solid and clearly upselling with Edge and getting some positive mix. The U.S. market continues to be pretty good. Other America's activity, it can be aggressive from time to time. But in the U.S., the pricing environment has been pretty stable.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "I know you talked about the U.S holding up. I mean the data points from GE, Philips and some of the others has been a little more mixed. I mean is there any risk to you guys, because you guys are late cycle, there may be a little bit of a lag effect?", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Certainly not anything that we're seeing at this point.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay.", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "If anything, I think that the strength of the portfolio and the rumored product introduction in a couple of weeks, we've if anything, maybe we'll even see it pick up a little bit.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And I guess on that point, you talked about seeing strength in emerging markets with some of the higher-end systems. I mean can you maybe just directionally give us a sense of where you see a gap in the portfolio from a linac perspective?", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Yes. I mean first of all, I got the week wrong, but come to New York. We'll talk extensively about it in two weeks. And if you like opera, come to Vienna.", "We've \u2013 the European Society of Radiation Oncology meeting is in Vienna right before that. And we've \u2013 as we've kind of talked, what these emerging markets are looking for is really high-quality IMRT, they're looking for very fast high-quality imaging.", "They don't want to make any trade-off in the quality of care. And then they want to do both in patients. And that's kind of the, when you think of it in market needs, maybe the other thing I'd add is simplicity. They want a high level of automation. They want to go fast. They don't want the training burden that certainly the industry was a long time ago. And as we think about, as we think about the market needs, I think we've got some really exciting news coming and look forward to seeing you in a couple of weeks.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "All right. And then just last one maybe for Elisha on the revised profitability estimate on the U.K. project, that was all due to currency? Or were there any adjustments around utilization assumptions?", "Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "It's largely currency Tycho, just the pound being at a historical low.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Henry of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.", "Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. There's been a lot of concern from the investor base about the company's lengthening cash conversion cycle, particularly as it relates to inventories and receivables. So can you give any specifics there that can help us get more comfortable around what you guys are doing to improve these metrics?", "Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Yes. Well first of all, AR since the beginning of the fiscal year, is actually down 1% and while revenue is up 3%. So we are making considerable inroads into \u2013 we've had \u2013 we told you a year or so ago, we had a Salesforce.com implementation. We moved our collections staff.", "Collections continue to be quite robust. And the DSO for Oncology is down 10 days quarter-over-quarter to 96. So what's driving as proton grows, that will drive the DSO up just because of this percentage of completion accounting where revenue and earnings are taken in advance of when the actual payments are due from the customer.", "Inventory is only up very slightly from the beginning of the year just in line with revenue. So I think we're making good progress. Remember on this cash flow from operations, again significant transaction cost included in those numbers.", "Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay, and then a separate question. I think you guys have started to talk about a potential launch for a new linac later in fiscal year 2017. Are there any details you can give us regarding this product, what features or margin profile it may have and then what geographies you are going to target for this launch?", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "I mean (42:27), as I just said, we'll see you in Vienna or New York. We've got a very exciting product. I think we're confident it will be margin accretive. And come hear about it with the rest of our customers in two weeks. So I think it will be a very exciting launch.", "Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. And one last one for me. Can you give us an update on what kind of trends you're seeing in the Chinese radiation oncology market? And then can you give us any updated timing on when a Class A quota might be announced?", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Well, I think our China business has been very robust for a good strong period of time. We were up 10% this quarter. Our team is executing very well in that market. We've been double-digit-ish for many quarters in a row. We just had a users meeting in China. We had over 600 attendees. So very good reception.", "Our market share is a leadership position now in China. So we're comfortable that the share is going in the right direction. And the whole market \u2013 I wouldn't get \u2013 yeah, there are category A, category B issues. But we got to watch the whole market here, and the whole market is moving.", "And as I said in the script, we are well on our way to a $225 million business. We've got a great portfolio. And we think the news that you're going to see in a couple weeks, it's going to require \u2013 it'll probably require some regulatory approvals in China. But it's going to be very meaningful for that market as well.", "Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. And then are you aware of a new Class A quota or is that still kind of TBD?", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Not aware.", "Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Hi, Vijay.", "Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC", "Hey, guys. How is it going?", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Well.", "Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC", "Elisha, again, I wish you all the best for your next chapter, you too Spencer. And maybe, on, I guess, the guidance, so revenue is down by 100 bps and EPS up at the low end. Can you just, explain or walk me through on what changed between the revenue line and the EPS?", "Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Yeah. So the revenue line is exclusively due to proton and just some timing of orders, primarily, because as you know under percentage of completion, at the time we book an order, we start to recognize revenue over the life of that project completion. So timing of orders is driving that. Oncology continues to be right where we were at the last quarter.", "So EPS, again, it's just a little bit of difference in geography on the P&L. But the gross profit and decline versus what we were expecting in proton, almost an exact offset to the 1-point improvement for the year that we're expecting in the tax rate. And so that's why we were able to come off the mid-point, come up $0.02, come off the bottom of the EPS range.", "Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC", "Got you. And then the backlog, I guess, the way the accounting works is now, I'm assuming, you're pulling off some of the imaging components, maybe a couple of hundred million dollars. What's been the backlog growth for the last few quarters? Because, I guess I don't have the historical numbers here apart from the second quarter numbers, right, which just include the oncology piece and the proton piece. So can you give us a sense for what it's been over the last few quarters under the new reporting methodology?", "Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Sure. So you are correct that Varex came out of the backlog. So, as of Q1, let's see, before we carved it out for disc op it was, the backlog was $3.389 billion. We are now at $3.136 billion. So you're right, a couple of hundred million dollars came out for the Varex Group. As of Q1, Oncology, $2.9 billion, we're still $2.9 billion which was up 6% quarter over quarter. We do have a decline in the proton backlog because we did book Delray, but we have yet to book that Thailand order and we've been taking revenue over the course of this year. So Oncology backlog is strong up 6% at $2.9 billion.", "Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC", "I guess I was looking for some historical information. Is there, can you provide some historical information over the last \u2013 what it's been under the new reporting segments, either on the P&L and the backlog? I guess a part of the issue is, when I try to look back, what's happened over the last year, I guess the quarterly numbers it's hard for us to parse out under the new reporting methodology. So if you can have that information, I think that will be really helpful for us. Maybe one for you, Dow, big-picture question I think on the competitive side. Your competitor's making some noise about MR linac. And I know you have a certain view on this, but I'm just curious on what you're hearing about in the marketplace \u2013 and I am just curious about the timing of the new products that you guys are launching. Is this sort of in response to what competition is doing, or are these two things completely unrelated?", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "I mean, the short version is, there is, number one, we believe that MR imaging is important. That's been growing in importance in radiation oncology. And we use that imaging for treatment planning and guidance literally every day today. We're not convinced that MR in room is more than a small niche. And that remains to be seen how big a niche that's going to be. And at least in terms of as we think about our focus, we're looking at a product that can have a global impact. I like to think of this in terms of, today we're at 13,000 units in our installed base. The world needs, at a minimum, another 10,000 machines and it needs to replace another 13,000 machines.", "So how do we really grow the sockets that are doing radiation therapy? Many countries in the world have less than 10% of their cancer patients are getting radiation as part of their therapy. In the West, that number is around 50%. And there's just a huge opportunity there. So that's kind of how I view the global play. And then from a technology point of view, we do agree that adaptation is important. And that's one of the things that MR is bringing. But you can do adaption in lots of ways. It doesn't have to be with MR. So I think you will see us compete very aggressively for kind of the top technology space with ongoing coformality and adaptation kinds of plays, along with simplicity and automation. So I think we're, but when we look at the markets, I mean for us, it's how do we do 10,000 more machines?", "Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC", "Got you. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "We have a follow-up question from the line of Anthony Petrone. Please proceed with your follow-up.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks Dow. Maybe just on the regulatory pathway for the system and timing there, and if this is included in guidance at all. Thanks.", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "The short version is I'll talk to you in two weeks. I mean I think we've got a very exciting product. It's, from a guidance point of view, very minimal. It's, we are largely talking about ongoing impact and orders impact which, of course, we do not guide to. So but very excited about the product, and we can talk more about kind of the regulatory process when we see you in New York.", "Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "But Anthony, it's more of an FY 2018 on the revenue side...", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "On the P&L side.", "Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "On the P&L side. Yeah.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC", "Yeah. That helps. Thanks.", "Operator", "We have another follow-up question from the line of Jeff Johnson of Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Thanks. Elisha just quickly...", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Hey, Jeff.", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Hey, Dow, so just very quickly, is there a way can provide us with just accounts receivable number, maybe over the last couple of years in the first two quarters of this year, for just the Oncology business kind of ex-protons and obviously ex-Varex?", "Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "I don't have it now, Jeff. You're saying on a go forward basis?", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Yeah. On a go forward basis or maybe you could post at some point on the website.", "Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Sure.", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Yeah. Because I think a lot of the focus here recently on the working capital has been on the AR side. And the accounting for the proton stuff, I think obviously as you described, is one of the big impacts. But if we can see on the core business, the 90%, 95% of the business that is Oncology, those ARs are improving, that issue is solving itself, and maybe we'd feel incrementally better on that.", "Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Absolutely. And I think the first thing to make you feel good is, again, Oncology DSO down 10 days quarter-over-quarter and roughly flat with Q1. So I think we've started to stabilize.", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Yeah. It would be just be good if we could have those numbers and kind of play with them ourselves. But I appreciate it. Thank you.", "Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Yeah. Okay.", "Operator", "There are no further questions over the audio portion of the conference. I'd now like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks.", "Spencer R. Sias - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Thank you all for participating.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Neil Madle. Thank you, sir. You may begin.", "Neil Madle - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to Varian Medical Systems' conference call for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. With me are Dow Wilson, President and CEO; Gary Bischoping, CFO; and Magnus Momsen, our Controller.", "Dow will review highlights in the quarter in the context of our long-term strategy. Gary will review our financial results. And then we will open the call to Q&A. After Q&A, we'll come back to Dow for a few closing comments.", "To simplify our discussion, unless otherwise stated, all references to the quarter or year are fiscal quarters and fiscal years. Comparisons are year-over-year. And references to financial results for orders are gross orders.", "We report non-GAAP earnings to provide comparisons of operational performance, excluding unusual items.

The telephone replay will be available through 5 p.m. Pacific Time this Friday, July 28.", "And now, here's Dow.", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Thanks, Neil, and good day, everyone. I want to start by thanking Neil for jumping in for the recently retired Spencer Sias. We'll be replacing Spencer shortly, but thanks, Neil, for leading us through this process this quarter.", "Before I start, I want to introduce Gary Bischoping, our new Chief Financial Officer. Some of you have already had a chance to meet Gary. He joined us in early May. So he doesn't have a full quarter under his belt yet. But he's already making an impact, and we're delighted to have him on board. Welcome to the first of what I'm sure will be many quarterly earnings calls, Gary.", "Turning to the quarter, we delivered solid progress towards our long-term aspirational goal to touch 6 million cancer patients each year, more than double where we are today. This is predicated on our focused commitment to develop and deploy industry-leading capabilities in developed and emerging markets, while delivering balanced financial results.", "In the quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $1.04. Orders for Oncology were up 5% to $708 million in both dollars and in constant currency. Year-to-date, orders were up 6% in dollars and 7% in constant currency. Company-wide revenues were up 3% to $662 million.", "We received orders across 10 countries for our new Halcyon treatment system, which was introduced during the quarter. And we booked three orders in proton therapy; two orders for single-room systems, one in the U.S. and one in Thailand; and a multi-room project at the Georgia Proton Therapy Center, Atlanta.", "Turning to our Oncology operations, we had solid contributions from all three of our geographies. In the Americas, orders were up 3% in both dollars and constant currency. Highlights include 3% growth in North America, mainly driven by service and software, where we executed multiple competitive software takeouts, and we gained share.", "Also in North America, we struck a strategic deal with PetCure to deliver six Halcyon units for a veterinary oncology network. I'll go into more details about Halcyon a little bit later.", "In Latin America, orders declined due to challenging macro and political environments.", "Looking at EMEA, gross orders rose 2% in dollars and 5% in constant currency. Growth was particularly strong in India where orders more than doubled. We also had robust order growth in Eastern Europe. During the quarter, we booked a $14 million order with a private European medical center in Russia.", "In APAC, orders rose by 13% in dollars and in constant currency, with broad-based contributions across the region. In China, we achieved market-leading order growth of more than 30% as our team there continued to do an excellent job establishing Varian as a premier supplier in both the public and private sectors.", "In the broader APAC region, we also booked multimillion-dollar orders in Vietnam, South Korea, Thailand and the Philippines. In addition, in Australia, we received orders for five TrueBeam systems from GenesisCare, and for two Halcyon systems from the Icon Group.", "Now let me touch on our new product, Halcyon. As we shared with you during our midyear review in New York, Halcyon received a tremendous reception when we unveiled it at the ASTRO show in Vienna in May. We've designed Halcyon to expand the availability of high-quality cancer care to globally, helping to save the lives of millions more cancer patients.", "Halcyon is the result of a focused four-year development project to revolutionize clinical workflow by simplifying and enhancing virtually every aspect of image-guided volumetric intensity-modulated radiotherapy. This advanced industry-leading treatment system offers high-quality care, greater ease of use, enhanced patient comfort and lower total cost of ownership.", "Its smaller footprint means we now have a solution for older cobalt and tomotherapy bunkers, which are too small to accommodate our other linear accelerator products. We believe there are around 2,000 such bunkers as potential opportunities.", "We launched Halcyon with CE approval, which enabled us to immediately sell in Europe and other key markets. Early interest is high and, during the quarter, we booked several orders from countries where we have approval, including Australia, Belgium, India, Morocco, Romania, Russia, Turkey and the United Kingdom.", "Just before the close of the third quarter, we received 510(k) approval to market and sell Halcyon in the United States, resulting in several orders in the quarter. Regulatory approvals for China and Japan should follow within the next year. Halcyon is one of the largest new product introductions in our history. Early interest has been strong, and we'll start providing more color on the pacing and impact of the roll-out when we report our fourth quarter results.", "Also on the new product front, later this year we expect first patient treatments with our HyperArc module for high-definition brain radiosurgery. This upgrade provides ultra-precise doses that cannot be matched by any other system on the market and has the potential to make a meaningful difference in the fight against cancer.", "Turning to software, we ended the quarter with more than 930 RapidPlan licenses at about 440 customer locations. This knowledge-based treatment planning system is making a major contribution to improving the quality and efficiency of radiotherapy treatment planning globally, while also being accretive to our profitability.", "Other recent software introductions, such as our InSightive analytics and 360 Oncology systems, continued to gather momentum during the quarter as customers sought to improve workflow in their clinics.", "As we announced last week, radiation oncology professionals using Varian's Eclipse treatment planning software created the top-scoring head and neck cancer treatment plans at the 2017 International Radiotherapy Plan Competition. The treatment plan competition is part of the Radiation Knowledge initiative, a cloud-based platform for sharing best practices in the medical radiation field.", "The two highest scoring plans and seven of the top 10 plans at the competition were created using Eclipse and employed Volumetric Arc Therapy to target head and neck cancers. The competition attracted more than 460 dosimetrists from around the world, with the goal of sharing the best planning skills to improve radiotherapy plan quality.", "Before leaving Oncology Systems, let me call out our service business, which had a 7% increase in global orders in the quarter, supported by an 8% increase in North America. Service continues to be a significant growth driver for our company.", "Now let me turn to our Particle Therapy business, which delivered $122 million in orders in the quarter, up $71 million, and revenues of $68 million, up $31 million. Among these orders was the Georgia Proton Therapy Center. We delivered the cyclotron to site earlier this month. And the center plans to start treating patients in 2018.", "We also booked orders during the quarter for two ProBeam Compact systems at the University of Pennsylvania and at Thailand's first proton therapy center in Bangkok. Our proton business continues to gather momentum. There are now five proton therapy centers delivering clinical treatments using our equipment. And we're working on a further 14 projects. A number of these projects are due to begin clinical treatments in the next six months.", "In addition to the cyclotron installation at Georgia Proton Therapy Center, there were significant milestones at two other projects in June when cyclotrons were delivered to the National Centre for Particle Therapy in Aarhus, Denmark and the Christie Proton Therapy Center in Manchester, England.", "Now let me turn to guidance for this fiscal year. And as a reminder, this is non-GAAP and from continuing operations point of view. For the fourth quarter, we believe revenues will be flat to down slightly and for earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.23. For the second through the fourth quarter, we now expect total company revenues to grow in the range of 2% to 3% and for earnings per share to be in the range of $3.08 to $3.16.", "Before I turn it over to Gary, I think it's important for me to highlight that this was our first full quarter as a standalone cancer management company, following the successful spinoff of our Imaging Components business in January. Varian is now focused exclusively on expanding our position as the leader in systems and software for the treatment of cancer and other indications. We are increasing our efforts to make the treatment of cancer more effective, affordable and accessible for patients around the world.", "Now, I'll hand it over to Gary.", "Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Thanks, Dow, and hello, everyone. As Dow mentioned, this is my first earnings call for Varian and I'm delighted to be here. I've framed my comments today in the context of our long-term focus to drive balanced financial results including growth, profitability and liquidity.", "So let me start with growth. We ended the quarter with $3.25 billion in backlog, up 6%, including a 7% increase in Oncology. Backlog adjustments during the quarter were $49 million, bringing net orders for the company to $781 million.", "Total revenues were up 3% in dollars and 4% in constant currency. Growth in the quarter was impacted by the lumpiness of our revenues in our proton business. Excluding the revenue from the Georgia Proton deal, revenue was down 4%.", "Oncology revenues totaled $594 million, down 2% in dollars and 1% in constant currency. International revenues, which were 51% of Oncology revenues in the quarter, declined 7%.", "Oncology revenue growth in the quarter was negatively impacted by increased mix from emerging markets in our backlog. Given emerging markets orders typically take longer to deliver and install, this caused our backlog conversion cycle to lengthen. Year-to-date, Oncology revenues were up 1% in dollars and 2% in constant currency.", "Our Particle Therapy business posted revenues of $68 million, almost doubling from a year ago, as the Georgia Proton order contributed $46 million in revenue in the quarter. Year-to-date, revenues were up 37% to $130 million.", "Turning to profitability. Total company gross margin increased 18 basis points to 44.5% and year-to-date margins increased 138 basis points to 44%. The improvement in gross margins for both the quarter and year-to-date was supported by increased mix of services, consistent with our long-term strategy.", "Oncology Systems gross margin increased by nearly 200 basis points to 48.1% due to higher mix of services revenue as well as ongoing supply chain efficiencies. Year-to-date, Oncology gross margin was up over 200 basis points to 46.4%.", "Proton Therapy gross margin for the third quarter was 12.7%, or flat. Year-to-date, Proton gross margin was down nearly 400 basis points due to the ongoing impact of the bankruptcy at Scripps and currency headwinds on our two projects in the UK.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter were $117 million, up 2%, driven by investment in new product launches, and flat sequentially, which is 17.6% of revenues.", "In the quarter, we invested $55 million in R&D or about 8% of revenues. Operating earnings totaled $123 million or 18.5% of revenue, up 3%, driven by improved mix of services as well as supply chain efficiencies.", "Depreciation and amortization was $14.7 million, and $17.6 million on a GAAP basis. Our effective tax rate was 21.5%, reflecting a revenue mix shift to Europe region where tax rates are relatively low. For the fourth quarter, we believe Varian's tax rate will be about 25%.", "EPS in the quarter was $1.04, with the Georgia Proton order contributing $0.10 to this. Our diluted share count on the quarter was 92.4 million shares. Year-to-date EPS was $2.51, including the $0.34 impact from the Proton accounts receivable impairment in the first quarter.", "Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $658 million and debt of $364 million. Our increased focus on working capital discipline drove a four-day reduction in DSO year-over-year, supported by a significant decline in DSO in our Oncology business.", "The reduction in DSO contributed to the $155 million of cash flow from operations we delivered in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date cash flow from operations to $269 million, up $65 million.", "In addition to R&D, our other investments in the quarter included $47 million to repurchase 500,000 shares of our stock and $8 million in CapEx. As of the end of the quarter, we had 5.5 million shares remaining under our existing repurchase authorization.", "And now we'd like to turn the call over to questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from Anthony Petrone of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Hey, Anthony.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC", "Hi. Thanks. How are you, Dow? And welcome, Gary.", "Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Thanks.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks for taking the questions. Let me just start off a couple of revenue questions and Halcyon and then one for Gary specifically on margins. The fiscal fourth quarter guide is a little bit off from where we were expecting. And maybe, Dow, you can walk us through if there's any selling day impacts in there and what the read is for Oncology versus proton specifically in fourth quarter. And then, in terms of Halcyon, are you disclosing the specific order number in the quarters overall? And then maybe how is the funnel shaping up as you look out into the second half of the calendar year?", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Sure. And I'll tell you I'll start with the second one first, how's that? Talk Halcyon here.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC", "Yeah.", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Customers and our field team remain very excited. Response has been terrific. People love the features that we've talked about, the fast installation time, the new collimator, the precision that you can get, the lower operating costs, the lower bunker costs. And, as I mentioned in the script, the access to cobalt vaults and tomotherapy vaults. One of the things that we're seeing is the conversion cost from an old vault to a new vault. The cost of putting a Halcyon unit in is much lower than any other system on the market, and that's having a real impact.", "We're not disclosing the number on the quarter. We didn't have regulatory approval in the U.S. right to the very end. As I said, we did have orders from 10 countries, including some multi-unit orders. We're very confident about where we are. We feel very optimistic. And we will be disclosing that in Q4 and giving you more kind of unit color Q4.", "When we did this with TrueBeam, we had global regulatory approval and we were excited that we get to launch it here at ASTRO here in September. So, that'll be its U.S. \u2013 Americas launch and get to the global customer as well at ASTRO.", "But the Halcyon product is going very, very well. You see that a little bit in the order rate. The order rate was very good on the quarter. We're 5% on the quarter with good, strong growth in every one of our regions. And the amazing thing is China did really, really well without Halcyon. So, that'll be in that marketplace probably in about a year's time, as I said on the call.", "Yeah. In terms of kind of the revenue issues, I'll talk at a high level about these and Gary can jump in. I'd say we're seeing a couple of things. Number one, the emerging market, so this is BRIC plus everybody else, so this is Latin America, Eastern Europe, China, Southeast Asia, that part of our backlog has grown quite substantially. So, year-over-year, we think it is up 300 basis points year-over-year. And this part of the backlog, I'd say it's taken us three to six months more to convert those into sales. So we are seeing a little bit of that.", "I'd say, coming down the end of the quarter, we had a few slip-outs on some U.S. orders, a combination of some operational challenges, a little construction and installation, nothing that spooks us at all. There might be just a touch of folks kind of waiting to see what's happening with Halcyon in there, but I don't think that's the third in the list of three there. But I'd say those are kind of some of the revenue issues that we've got going on.", "We did see some of this when we called guidance. So we know we missed our revenue guidance. We thought we could execute through this and between some of the longer emerging market backlog timing, and some of the U.S. pushes to Q4 we had to miss. And we feel very good about where the order rate is landing, continue to feel very positive about the quality of the backlog, still committed to a long-term kind of 5%, 6% growth, and think that that's kind of where it'll land.", "In fact, we were looking at trailing 12 months \u2013 our trailing 12-month order and revenue performance is pretty close. Orders performance is 3.4%, revenue performance 2.7%, 2.8%. So those are tracking. We've got to get our heads around across the emerging market, make sure we got a little better visibility to that. We love the profitability that came in on the quarter, and you see that in guidance as well. So, that part was very strong.", "And with that, Gary, jump in and...", "Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Yeah. Thanks. So the thing I would add, Anthony, to your question on kind of OS and proton, we see Oncology on a revenue basis returning to growth in the fourth quarter, and we do face significant headwinds in the proton business from a year-over-year perspective.", "I think the other context I would give you with regard to the guidance is that last \u2013 so prior year, so Q4 2016, our Oncology sales or revenue growth year-on-year was 6%, and so had a good, solid execution there. So it's up against, I would say, a reasonable compare. And I think it's a pragmatic guidance relative to what we see here.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC", "And just a follow-up, Gary, and I'll let others hop in, just the Oncology gross margin number, a bit of a surprise to the upside this quarter. Maybe just some of the drivers there and your outlook as you look forward for Oncology gross margins and maybe overall gross operating margin goals for the company next several years. Thanks, again.", "Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Sure. Thanks, Anthony. We were very happy with the Oncology margin rate and, honestly, the operating execution inside of that business. And given what we saw on the top line, I think we did a good job of managing through and making the right trade-offs associated with where we're investing and how we drove profitability in the quarter. So I think our execution was very good there.", "As it relates to kind of what happened, the dynamics around it, there's about 0.6% of that 48.1% was driven by an excise tax refund. And so, that certainly was part of that over-delivery. And then the services mix increase was another 100 to 150 basis points of that. And so, you have to kind of carve those two things off.", "We think we can execute that Oncology gross margin rate in the 44% to 45% range and we think that makes sense relative to being able to then drive our EBIT from 18.5% to, say, 19% to 20% in the near term. So we think good, solid execution in pricing, our ability to get some operating leverage post the Varex spin really make that a realistic number as we think about profitability heading into the fourth quarter.", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Yeah. And our long-term goal remains, over the next three years, can we get us back to 22% return on sales. So, that remains our long-term goal.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Amit Hazan of Citi. Please proceed with your question.", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Hi, Amit.", "Amit Hazan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hey. Thanks, guys. And Gary, welcome. Let me maybe just start actually with longer-term fiscal year 2018 thoughts on the top line, just given some of these new mix issues you're talking about. Is the Oncology backlog growth a good way to still think about where fiscal 2018 growth might go for Oncology revenue? Or does this EM mix issue change kind of our thinking about that backlog being a good number to think about for growth in the next year?", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Short version is I think it still remains an outstanding indicator of where we're going to land next year. We do have a little bit of emerging market mix we got to think through and that might mean that the velocity of that portion of the backlog might be a little bit slower. But as an indication of where we're headed, I think it's still an outstanding indicator.", "Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Yeah. As Dow stated earlier, our trailing 12 months orders rate relative to our trailing 12 months revenue rate in the Oncology business track pretty much right on top of each other. So you may see some lumpiness in any given quarter, but our ability to execute through that emerging market increased mix, which is a great thing for growth and top line, we'll execute our way through that.", "Amit Hazan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. And just to clarify, that push out related to the emerging market mix, you didn't see anything in terms of its units adjusting out of backlog because of that? It's just pure delays in the recognition of revenues of those orders?", "Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Yeah. That's correct. And the adjustments we saw in backlog are well within historical norms.", "Amit Hazan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Yeah. And then just one question, Gary, just you coming on. Just asking the question about what you've seen so far at the company and in particular what your views are on things like capital allocation going forward? Share repurchases have been, obviously, a key to this company for a while now. How you view that? And generally, just balance sheet risk and taking on, for example, the financed proton deal, do you view these things similar to how they've gone or what's your take on some of that?", "Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "So, look, I've been really impressed with the board and our operators of this business. I think the board is engaged at the right level and helping us drive strategy forward. And the management team and its ability to execute and take advantage of the pure play cancer treatment platform that we have today is real. And so I'm excited to be part of the team with the fight against cancer and to take advantage of that opportunity I think we have in the marketplace.", "As it relates to capital allocation, I would tell you that we are going to balance the need for financial flexibility with returning excess cash to shareholders over time. I think that's prudent. And if you think about being in the capital allocation business we are in today and the strategic opportunities we have in front of us, financial flexibility is going to be valuable. And so we'll make sure we keep that balance in place as we move through time.", "Amit Hazan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "And the proton piece?", "Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Oh, yes. Sorry.", "Amit Hazan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "You financing that deal?", "Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Yeah. On the proton side, I come from Dell and they have a capital finance company. I think my view here early days in the proton business is we look very hard at the cash flows of that over a long period of time. It is a long duration business. That asset's going to be in place for a long time. And so you have to think about the risk of that asset over a very long period of time and look at those cash flows.", "And then we have to score that risk. And I think we do a pretty good job of scoring that risk and evaluating cash flows over time. Will it be lumpy from here to there? Yes, it will. I think it will. But, again, I think we do a nice job of scoring that risk and looking at long-term cash flows to evaluate go or no-go on those business decisions.", "Amit Hazan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks. I'll jump back in queue.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson of Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Thank you. Good afternoon, guys.", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Hi, Jeff.", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Hey, Dow and Gary. So, just wondering on, I guess, the proton business to start. One of your single-room European proton competitors recently had to lower their outlook and push out some timing of delivery on some deals in that. Have you guys recently scrubbed your proton backlog or anything from a delivery schedule standpoint we should be thinking about with your proton business?", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Yeah. The short version is we scrub it every day. And there's no change. I mean, these are big projects. You got to stay all over it. I think we've got an exceptional team doing that for us. And there are movements all the time, but we're not seeing anything systematic the way, I believe it was IBA, reported in their last call.", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Yeah.", "Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Sorry. The only thing I would add to that is, we have seen delivering on what we said we're going to do. We've delivered some cyclotrons here recently, as Dow just stated. We're happy with progress at Georgia Proton Therapy Center and our ability to compete in those smaller roll-outs. So I think we're executing well against the backlog we have in place.", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Yeah. Understood. And Gary, you quantified the Emory or the Georgia Proton at $0.10 in the quarter. Did some of that benefit get caught up in tax rate? I think that's how it flowed through last time with \u2013 I'm blanking on the other deal with the one in Baltimore. I just want to make sure I'm not double counting, because your tax rate came in a couple hundred basis points lower than we were expecting. But I think some of that might have been tied to the Emory deal. I just want to make sure I'm understanding your tax rate at 21.5% on the quarter.", "Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "The tax rate on that is very low. So, that $0.10 is obviously after taxes, and there was an immaterial amount of taxes on that revenue and profitability...", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "If not for Emory, your tax rate, your ETR probably would have been closer to what everyone on the Street was looking for at 23.5% or 23.5%?", "Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Correct. That's the correct way to think about it. Yes.", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. And then, Dow, as I think about your revenue guidance, I know Anthony asked this a little bit. But last quarter, you were guiding to 3% to 5%, now it's to 2% to 3%. You also got a couple hundred basis-point impact here from \u2013 benefit from Emory. Currency probably is working in your favor. So is it really just kind of the push out of these emerging market deliveries? Is that really \u2013 it just seems like there's a decent sized impact there that changed the guidance once we put Emory and currency in there. So, just wondering if there's anything else impacting timing on deliveries or anything else with revenue.", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Yeah. The good guy was Emory. The actual that we do have a difference on currency. We actually think that's a point to the bad for us, it doesn't. It's not a good guy for us. It's about a point the other way. And then the other two, maybe three that we got that I mentioned briefly on the call is this growth in our emerging market backlog and, as I said, that's about a three- to six-month longer cycle to revenue than, say, our U.S. backlog.", "Second, we did see in the quarter a little bit of U.S. backlog push out, just call it four, five units, at the end of the quarter. And then, this one is anecdotal and it's tough to quantify, but I do think we have a little bit of folks doing some look-see on Halcyon and what should I think, how did I play this. And the good news is the order rate is chugging along right where we'd like it to be, and we feel good about that. And we feel great about the Halcyon introduction and where it's going. And we might have a little bit of that kind of globally.", "So, having said that, it didn't pause anything in China for two seconds. They had a banner quarter and we feel really good about our China team and what they're doing. We're seeing success in both the public market and the private market, and just really establishing our leadership position in China.", "Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "And just to put a finer point on the currency side, currency in the quarter is probably $10 million, $12 million, $15 million of a revenue headwind, given our exposure in the euro, sterling and yen, broadly speaking.", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Yeah. And I guess my comment, I'm sorry, just to conclude, was the change in currency from maybe last time you updated guidance to this time, I think there's been a positive move since. But I agree, year-over-year in my model it's going to be negative in 4Q as well. So, no, I appreciate that. Thanks, guys.", "Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Yes.", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brandon Henry of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.", "Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to touch on this lengthening backlog to revenue conversion issue in emerging markets, because I've always thought that EM orders are taking longer to convert to revenue than U.S. orders. So is it just a mix issue in terms of you're seeing a higher EM mix, or are you actually seeing lengthening in the backlog to revenue conversion in emerging markets itself?", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "It's pure mix. Yeah, we're not seeing that. As I said, we're seeing about 300 basis point increase year-over-year in our emerging market portion of the backlog. And as that flows through \u2013 it's flowing through a little I guess just a bigger mix. We're not seeing any lengthening of the emerging market transition to revenue.", "Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. And then can you walk us through how we should be thinking about the ramp for the launch of Halcyon versus the previous TrueBeam launch? Is the TrueBeam a good proxy for Halcyon, kind of why or why not? And then also how do you think the Halcyon launch may impact this backlog to revenue conversion? Might it actually improve that for emerging markets?", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "What we like about Halcyon is it's going to improve it operationally. A site still has to be ready. Money's still got to be there. And in some of these emerging markets, that does take a little bit longer. But once the equipment's shipped, its installation today is six to eight weeks, three months sometimes in emerging markets, and we should go to two weeks with Halcyon. So, it's a little bit all over the map in these emerging markets. I'd say, on average, we're going to get a two, three week reduction in installation cycle time. So, that should help a lot.", "I think in terms of how to think about the overall ramp, we think that this is going to be very significant. TrueBeam was replacing a product line. So it got a lot of price. It got a lot of share. What's interesting about Halcyon is it doesn't just replace a product line. So we're really trying to drive incremental growth with it. We've talked about some of these markets, the cobalt replacement market, the old crusty linac market, whether it's other brands or our own, tomotherapy vaults that we can't fit in. This can go in every one of those.", "We're seeing a big uptick in the development of emerging market cancer plans. And so governments are getting together. And it's a little bit like the Brazil thing we saw three years ago. And governments are kind of saying, wow, how do we get 5 centers, 4 centers, 10 centers, 50 centers. I'd say we've got conversations like that happening in a number of places. And they love Halcyon because I think the thing that I didn't point out in the call that we should point to is the operator efficiency and the patient creature comforts are outstanding on this product, and the ability to implement it and execute quickly is really good.", "And then the other factor is these emerging market governments, they're looking at high-throughput cancer centers, and this product is designed with that in mind. The imaging portion alone is four times faster than historical. And you look at the kind of treatment times, we're easily going to be able to meet the kind of volume requirements for patients per day that these markets have. So, Brandon, we will give you a lot more visibility on that next quarter. We feel very good about where we are. The uptick has been nice. We're very optimistic about where things are going.", "I think TrueBeam as a comparison is a good one. Having said that, it's not perfect because one's a little more \u2013 Halcyon isn't replacing TrueBeam. We very much see TrueBeam in our market for people that want the most flexible, the best SBRT product in the world. TrueBeam is it for people that are looking for a little higher-throughput, bread-and-butter go, go, go. Halcyon is the game. We love the new collimator on the product, a much more precise product. And of course, the simplicity is really going to drive it.", "You asked about the funnel. I'd say the funnel is very robust. We're excited about that both from a market point of view and a share point of view. So I think we're optimistic about the Halcyon funnel.", "Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. And just one last question for me. ASTRO has recently released their proposal for episodic or kind of bundled payments. And in that proposal, they talk about eliminating the reimbursement differential for various modalities for radiation oncology. So can you talk about your expectations for the timing of that program to start? And then how are you thinking about a potential similar reimbursement for the different modalities? How will that impact Varian's business, and specifically, proton therapy, which I think has historically had a premium reimbursement? Thanks.", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "I think you've seen a month ago, four weeks ago, CMS published their guidelines for this next year. I'd say that had a very little change. So, at least as we see it executing for kind of fiscal year 2018, we don't see much change in the reimbursement scenario.", "Longer term, I think we've been pretty consistent about this. We think that there will be some bundling options that are put forth. It'll be interesting to see how those go. We have not had any negative feedback from customers in the U.S. as to the reimbursable model they're seeing from CMS here recently. So, at least as it's impacted our comp outlook here and over the next year we don't see much change.", "As to the long-term, how does value-based pricing impact radiation therapy? I'd just point out that that's how we compete in every other market in the world, and we compete on a very good basis. Radiation therapy remains one of the most cost-effective approaches to cancer care. The economics of radiation therapy are very favorable at that level.", "It is how we compete outside of the U.S. Change is always the hard part. And when that change comes, I have no doubt there will be some hesitation in the marketplace as people kind of figure out what the new models mean. But I think, in the long-term, it actually is a positive for radiation therapy.", "Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "And oh, by the way, the other factor in there is it will also \u2013 the trends to shorter fractionation, SBRT, SRS will continue. And that's a share opportunity for us because we're one of the best in that game.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey. Thanks. Maybe first on just the revenue outlook. Dow, I want to make sure you're not factoring any sort of change in sentiment on just the hospital CapEx front. I know on the relative pecking order of issues you called out that that wasn't really listed there, but any sort of change in behavior around ACA?", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "None whatsoever. Haven't seen or heard a whisper on that.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then, on the Halcyon front.", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Other than a lot of noise coming out of Washington. We could talk about that for a long time. But our customers are head down, plowing ahead.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then, on the Halcyon front, I know it's early days but any preliminary color you can give us on just cobalt swap outs versus older other linacs. And any thoughts on TrueBeam cannibalization at this point?", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "I'd say here early on, cobalt may be the couple. I'd say we're still very early. I'd say, when we look at our funnel, there's a whole bunch in the funnel. So we feel very good about that.", "We also have kind of the interesting thing here is we're working very hard with some international organizations, like the World Health Organization, the UN, the International Atomic Energy Agency. They have historically made recommendations for emerging markets about radiation therapy. Their historical recommendation in these really cost-constrained markets has been for cobalt.", "Well, there was a news article this last week. As Mosul slipped hands three or four times, there was a cobalt unit that could have been used for evil and fortunately wasn't. Anyway, we are seeing some increased, what should I call it, policy momentum in these organizations to move away from cobalts. And I think Halcyon is enabling that conversation, so we're excited about that.", "I think, in terms of TrueBeam cannibalization, I alluded to it, I think it's anecdotal at this point. I'd say we haven't \u2013 there might be a little bit of it going on out there as customers kind of evaluate, especially while they didn't have regulatory approval. The good news is, in Europe and in the U.S., we move very quickly to regulatory approval. But I think where we are, given the configuration mix in the U.S., we just want to sell more of both.", "And I think that's \u2013 the U.S. impact in the long-term should be negligible. Do we have a little bit of folks hesitating in the short-term? Maybe. Maybe that was a little bit some of our issue here in Q3. But I'm confident that this is really a nice play for us.", "The other thing that's kind of interesting in the U.S. market is there's a lot of single vault customers out there. And historically, these are older units. We've talked a lot about them on this call before. These are hard to change out because often times they don't have high volumes, call it 25 to 40 patients a day. And swapping out that equipment has meant two or three weeks of de-installation, five or six weeks of new equipment coming in. So a customer is looking at two to three months of transition time. Well, if I'm a private radiation oncologist, my patients have to go somewhere else, and do I get them back? So our customers have been very worried about making that transition.", "One of the things that Halcyon gives us is a capability for our customers to do that window and they can plan their treatments around it. So, all of a sudden they don't have this decision process to kind of think through oh, no, am I going to lose my patients. We can do it quickly enough that they can get the new equipment in, get re-commissioned, and back to treating patients without having to send their patients elsewhere.", "So I'd say we haven't seen that yet, so we've got a bunch of that in the funnel. So, that's some of the incremental opportunity that we'll be looking at as we roll forward here.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And then was the veterinary one-off? I mean that's not a channel we've thought about for you guys before with PetCure.", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "I don't think it's a one-off. I think there's more of it out there. I saw a number, I don't remember it, but there's like 600,000 pets in San Francisco and 60,000 children. And so, one population is growing more than the other. We're excited about this. It's the first six \u2013 this isn't going to be what drives our business, but I do think there's some incremental opportunity there. And we're very excited to be partners with PetCure. And it is interesting, the statistics. There's 180 million pets in the U.S., and 12 million diagnosed with cancer, which happens to be almost exactly the same number of patients that are diagnosed with cancer in the U.S.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And then you made the comment about commitment to 5% to 6% revenue growth before. Just in light of the commentary you also made on the order book, can you just help us get comfortable with that acceleration? Because that's a level you haven't really grown at on an annual basis since...", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "I did say it's aspirational. That's where we want to go. When you look at our 12 months trailing, what was it, Gary, 3.5%, 4%?", "Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "3%.", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "3% 12 months trailing. You look at the last three quarters, a little north of that, we've got new product. So, that's kind of what we're driving to. I think that we've got the usual clouds on the horizon in terms of reimbursement in the U.S. We talked about FXs. We've had other times when we've done really well but had to give a lot of it back in FX.", "So there's some risk. But, aspirationally, we've got \u2013 as we were in New York, we talked about our software opportunity, can we grow that over five years to a $900 million business. We've got good \u2013 our portfolio has never been broader, never been deeper. Halcyon opening up some new market that we think is incremental. It's going to take us a while to execute on that, but that's where we're driving to.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "All right. I'll leave it at that. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.", "Joel Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Hi, guys. It's actually Joel in for Isaac.", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Hey, Joel.", "Joel Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Hey. How's it going? Maybe one for Dow. Could we just talk about the additional channel reach you think is necessary to effectively market Halcyon, just given the geographic mix that you're targeting? And then maybe just if you could parse out that operational reach by region?", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "I think we're in really good shape. I mean we have over the last three, four years, we've made significant investments in China, in India, in Brazil. We've also invested very heavily in a market development resource and government affairs. A lot of these opportunities are government opportunities. So, as we look at these markets, one of the things we're encouraged by is, at least at this point, I don't think I have to go out and make a big sales investment. I think we've got pretty good coverage. And for where these markets are, we're in pretty good shape.", "Joel Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Great. And then maybe one for Gary. You've had a few months under the hood. And if we think about non-operational items, tax rate, hedging, are there any low-hanging fruit you could identify that you think are ripe for improvement? And then maybe how we should be thinking about the phasing of those initiatives?", "Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Yeah. I would tell you that it's working capital is the opportunity. And our ability to \u2013 thinking about capitalizing on Halcyon and the working capital benefit of time to value for our customers and our patients as well as in our balance sheet.", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Along with some just good old execution.", "Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "And that coupled with I think working our way through the right amount of detail and rigor as we think about interacting with our customers day-in and day-out to make it easier for them to take a bill from us and turn that into an actual payment. So it's good old fashioned execution on the working capital line I think is our biggest opportunity after I've been under the hood here for 90 days.", "Joel Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "And then maybe just a last one for me from a macro perspective. You made some comments that U.S. CapEx for your customers remains stable. Any color outside of U.S. in terms of CapEx demand?", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "I haven't seen any data, so this will be a little bit from the hip. I'd say we haven't seen \u2013 maybe a little bit of change in Japan. That market's been tough. And otherwise I'd say kind of Brazil \u2013 I don't know if that's a change. It's kind of been that way for the last three or four quarters, so I don't know that Brazil is a change. That market remains tough. But otherwise I'd say pretty stable.", "Joel Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sean Lavin of BTIG. Please proceed with your question.", "Ryan Zimmerman - BTIG LLC", "Great. This is actually Ryan Zimmerman on for Sean. Can you hear me okay?", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Hi, Ryan.", "Ryan Zimmerman - BTIG LLC", "Great. Just you called out China as an area of growth this quarter, but competitors that we've followed in the space have struggled I think to really gain orders in that market and it's delayed their growth in subsequent quarters. And I'm just curious if you can expand on what you're seeing in China. And you talked about it a little bit, but how sensitive are you to the tender process? And what the opportunity looks like going forward, given how large of an opportunity China could be just from an Oncology standpoint?", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "The market remains very good. I like to think of this at a very high level. And when you look at the percent of patients in China that are treated with radiation, it's less than 20%. In U.S. and Western Europe, it's between 50% and 60%. So, that's where I like to start. There's a huge need.", "And then when you start thinking about it in terms of kind of urban China versus rural China, that's a description of urban China and rural China hasn't even been touched yet. So we are optimistic of our position in all segments. We've worked very hard to kind of get a leading market share in both. We've historically been a leader in the private market and we're working very hard to be a leader in the public market. We're now established leadership in both markets. And we feel very good about that position.", "So, in terms of the market, I'd say the market and long-term trends are very positive. It is a market that every now and then, what, it was two, two-and-a-half years ago, we had this reform hiccup where they went quiet for a quarter or two while they retooled their purchasing processes due to some anti-kickback issues that they had had in other sectors in healthcare, not in radiation therapy. That impacted everybody, of course.", "Every now and then when political change happens and chairs rotate, we see a little bit of delay. But I'd say, when you kind of look at trailing 12 months, it's been strong double-digit growth and we feel pretty good about that as being the market. Might we have a quarter or two where things slow down, that could always happen, but our funnel remains very robust in China. We got a very good team over there and feel very good about where the team is, getting deeper and broader and I believe worked hard to establish share leadership in that market, and now have it and are looking to leverage it as that market builds out its cancer capability.", "And I think, oh by the way, this is worth a reminder. Halcyon is built in China. And we got to get through the regulatory process but we think that also sets us up very nicely for kind of the next inning of this game in that market.", "Ryan Zimmerman - BTIG LLC", "Appreciate the color there, Dow. And then just lastly for me and I'll hop back in queue. You had a multi-system order with Georgia Proton Center. And then you had two single-room orders. And just thinking ahead on terms of customer demand for proton, I mean how should we think about the balance between, say, single-room centers versus multi-room centers? And what customers prefer maybe on a broader basis for proton therapy centers would be helpful.", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Yeah. Market is clearly moving down-market. It's interesting. There are some sovereign governments, China, Western Europe. I think they have much more rationalized governmental health systems. And so, they'll do some of these big, large multi-room centers. But I think the U.S. market with maybe this Georgia exception and a few others, it's going to be one and two room treatment centers.", "Protons remains very interesting clinically. The benefit of the physics behind the proton remain very exciting for our customers and matters. There's some debate about in what percent of cancers does it matter in, but I think it's safe to say that somewhere between 15% and 20% of all cancers can really benefit from proton physics and we're going to see that kind of come into the marketplace.", "When you look at the financial modeling on these one and two room centers, it's so much easier. It is really difficult to financially pencil out these really, really large centers. And certainly, we've seen that in some of ours and in the broader market as well. So I think the U.S. market is clearly moving to one and two room centers, and we'll see a lot less of that in the future. And so we're excited about these.", "University of Pennsylvania, the order we booked this last quarter, one of the leaders in the world in proton therapy, to have them kind of give us a vote of confidence is a real boost to our position and talks about the credibility of our single room product. And then, to have this other one in Thailand talks about the scope and scale of Varian, the ability of us to deliver in those markets.", "Ryan Zimmerman - BTIG LLC", "Appreciate you taking the question. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.", "Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of quick questions here. Maybe on this proton therapy, the Georgia, Atlanta orders and revenue rec. I got a bunch of questions from people asking, did you recognize I guess the Atlanta Proton revenues in the Q? I guess the question was, it looks like the installation was completed in July, so was there any criteria in recognizing revenues in June? So there's some confusion. If you can clarify, I think that would be great.", "Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Sure. This is Gary. We are on a percent of completion basis accounting for our proton business. And based on the percentage of completion of that project, in the third quarter we booked $46 million in revenue and the associated costs with that.", "Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI", "That's helpful, Gary. And welcome to the earnings call.", "Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI", "Just maybe on, I guess, follow up to that question was gross margin strength in the quarter. I know when you do these installations, a lot of the costs are incurred up front. Did these revenues just slow down? Is that possible one as the explanation for this strength in gross margin being in the Q because there were no costs associated with it?", "Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "No. We recognize the cost and revenue on a percentage completion basis. And so there's the appropriate amount of costs booked relative to the revenue for the percentage completion of that project at that point in time. So, $46 million of revenue did not drop to the bottom line. There was associated cost with that.", "Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI", "I guess maybe continuing on with that, I guess what were the drivers on the gross margin strength? And I apologize if you answered this before. I just hopped on.", "Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Sure. In Oncology, I would say there's kind of a couple of things. So we've seen certainly benefits around our supply chain efficiencies. That's certainly a very favorable driver. And we've seen that kind of increase as you look throughout the year. That's been a steady increase in the Oncology business. And I think good, solid pricing discipline has been good.", "We did in the quarter get an excise tax refund that accounted for about 0.6 percentage points of that increase we saw in Oncology, up to 48.1%. And then we also saw favorability in our services mix as a percent of revenue. And that's about 100 to 150 basis points of that favorability we saw. So we're happy with progress and our ability to manage cost and good pricing discipline in the market as we move through the whole year in the Oncology business.", "Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI", "Got you. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Thanks, gentlemen. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Dow Wilson for closing remarks.", "Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.", "Yeah. Thanks, operator. I think there's four key takeaways that everybody should think about today. First and foremost, we're the market leader. We now have the strongest portfolio of product offerings in our history, evidenced by our successful launch of Halcyon. This positions us very well as we execute against our long-term aspirational goal to touch 6 million cancer patients each year, more than double where we are today.", "Second, Varian's focused with our successful spinoff of Varex this year. We're now focused exclusively on extending our position as a leader in systems and software for the treatment of cancer and other indications.", "Third, we're optimally positioned to grow in both developed and emerging markets, supported by our new product offerings and rapidly growing service and software businesses.", "And fourth, we have the discipline to drive profitable growth and improve liquidity, both of which strengthen our financial flexibility so that we can continue to invest in growth opportunities. Thanks for joining us today.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

(NYSE:VAR) Q4 2017 Results Earnings Conference Call October 25, 2017  5:00 PM ET", "Executives", "Michael Bruff - VP of Investor Relations", "Dow Wilson - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Gary Bischoping - Chief Financial Officer", "Analysts", "Jeff Johnson - Baird", "Amit Hazan - Citigroup", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs", "Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we will now get started. Just a reminder that a replay of this call can be heard on the Varian Investor website at www.varian.com/investor where it will be archived for one year. To hear a telephone replay, please dial 1-877-660 -6853 from inside the U.S. or 201-612-7415 from outside the U.S. and enter the confirmation code 13669524. The telephone replay will be available through Friday, October 27.", "At this time, I would like to turn the program over to Mr. Michael Bruff, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.", "Michael Bruff", "Thank you operator. Good afternoon and welcome to Varian's fourth quarter fiscal 2017 conference call. Joining me today on the call are Varian's President and Chief Executive Officer, Dow Wilson and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Bischoping. Dow will share his thoughts on our results and long-term strategy. And Gary will cover our operating and financial results in more detail.", "On the Varian Investor Relations website, you can find our fiscal fourth quarter press release and web deck which are intended to provide additional perspective and details. Included in these documents is a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. We report non-GAAP earnings to provide comparisons of operational performance excluding unusual items. Unless otherwise stated, all financial results discussed are non-GAAP and from continuing operations. All growth rates are year-on-year and any references to orders are gross orders. Also, note that we may provide growth rates in constant currency allowing assessment of the business excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations.", "As we noted in previous SEC filings, Varian, like other companies, is required to adopt revenue accounting standard and codification 606. We intend to implement this new standard in our first quarter of fiscal 2018. Our results for fiscal 2017 that we disclose today and any forward-looking statements, including guidance follow accounting standard codification 605. Once we adopt the new standard, we will hold a conference call to provide additional clarity on how the change will impact our reporting and guidance. At that time, we will also provide restated numbers for 2017.", "And finally, during this call many statements made may be considered forward-looking statements. Our use of words and phrases such as outlook, believe, expect, anticipate, could, should, will, promising and similar expressions are intended to identify those statements which represent our current judgment on future performance or other future matters. While we believe them to be reasonable based on information currently available to us, these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this presentation and discussion because of new information, future events or otherwise.", "Now with all that said, I will turn it over to Dow.", "Dow Wilson", "Thanks Mike and good afternoon everyone. Today I will devote most of my prepared comments to the key milestones we achieved this past year. And I also want to share with you our new strategic framework for driving sustainable long-term value creation.", "First let me touch on our fourth quarter results, which concludes a transformative year. Total company revenues declined 1%. Oncology revenue grew 1%, while the proton business declined 23% in the quarter. GAAP earnings per share was $0.89, down 10%. Non-GAAP earnings per share grew 5% to $1.09. Gary will provide more details on the drivers of these results during his discussion.", "Total orders for the company were $1 billion, growing 11%. Oncology orders were up 7% supported by the healthy ramp-up of new products. Halcyon, our new image guided IMRT treatment platform had 23 orders in the quarter, 12 orders in EMEA, 10 orders in North Africa and one in APAC. Additionally, orders growth was positively impacted by double-digit services growth and upgrades for hardware and software, including 40 orders for HyperArc, our high definition radiotherapy technology. BRIC markets grew 5% in the fourth quarter and 16% in the full year.", "Services revenue grew 9% with strong growth across all geographies. Our LinAcc installed base grew 4% over the year exiting the year at 7,833 installs globally. Orders of our software products and services grew double-digit in the quarter and for the year. We continue to see accelerated uptake of Varian software solutions building on the strength of our Eclipse treatment planning and ARIA oncology information systems. Newer applications such as RapidPlan and multi-criteria optimization, our InSightive analytics solution, our 360 Oncology cloud-based cancer operating platform and the Velocity longitudinal cancer imaging solution are fueling the enthusiasm for Varian software solutions.", "Since we acquired Velocity just three years ago, orders have nearly tripled and customer installations have more than doubled to 450 institutions worldwide managing over 50 million cancer patient images. We are very pleased with the customer uptake and demand for our software solutions and expect to see global installations continue to grow.", "In proton therapy, we booked two orders in the quarter including the Concord Medical Proton Center in Guangzhou, China for $52 million and HCG in India for $19 million. Orders growth was 94%.", "And one final thought on the fourth quarter, while Varian did not experience any material financial impact due to the hurricanes in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico or the wildfires in Northern California, we are very concerned about and have the deepest sympathy for the people in those areas. We continue to work closely with our customers in these regions to minimize disruption in their operations and want to say thank you to our Varian team members who went above and beyond in getting some of these facilities back to taking care of patients.", "Looking more broadly at fiscal 2017. We took meaningful actions to transform our company. In January, we successfully completed the spinoff of Varex which allows us to focus exclusively on cancer care solutions. In May, we introduced the Halcyon treatment platform, which is designed to extend the availability of high-quality cancer care globally. Since the introduction, we have received 50 orders across 15 countries. Installations are progressing well and the first patient was treated at the University of Pennsylvania on September 13. In August, HyperArc treated its first patients in Negrar, Italy after receiving the CE Mark that same month. FDA clearance followed in September. We finished the year with six new proton therapy orders, bringing the total number of proton customers to 21.", "Finally at ASTRO last month, we launched our new brand which defines the fresh focus for our company and is consistent with our long-term strategy. It expresses our Varian spirit, ambitions and mission to combine the ingenuity of people with the power of data and technology to achieve new victories against cancer. Our long-term growth and value creation strategy ensure that we have the right focus and capabilities to capitalize on industry trends. We intend to leverage our scale and financial strength to selectively broaden our capabilities as we transform our company to become the global leader in multidisciplinary integrated cancer care solutions.", "To achieve these long-term objectives, we are focused on three growth initiatives. First, strengthen our leadership in radiation therapy. We are committed to the development and deployment of high-quality industry-leading innovation in this space. As an example, the ServiceTrak Imaging 2017 report recently announced that radiation oncology professionals rank Varian the leader in eight categories, including overall manufacturer performance, overall system performance and overall service performance. The report also showed Varian with a net promoter score of 75, which is over two times higher than our nearest competitor. These results along with our recent launches of Halcyon, HyperArc and 360 Oncology reflect our commitment to deliver world-class solutions in the fight against cancer.", "Our second growth initiative is to extend our global footprint. Delivering world-class treatment platforms such as Halcyon with a lower total cost of ownership, faster installation times, smaller footprint requirements and the greater ease of operation enables us to touch more patients globally. And proton therapy too continues to expand its footprint. Through the end of this year, we have 21 customers in 13 different countries of which five are operational and 16 in varying stages of construction.", "Third, expand into other addressable markets. This includes other modalities, software and services as we continue to build a comprehensive cancer care ecosystem across the patient journey. A proof point here is our 360 Oncology SaaS solution, which reflects our recent entry into the oncology care coordination and clinical decision support market. This broader oncology focused platform enables better, more informed decisions across the multidisciplinary teams engaged in that patient's journey.", "We have also made select investments in companies such as Grail in the field of liquid biopsy and Fusion Pharmaceuticals in the field of radiotherapeutics. Investments such as these are important as we continue to innovate and look beyond our core market. We have the financial discipline and flexibility to continue investing in growth opportunities both organically and inorganically enabling us to expand into other markets over time.", "Based on our company estimates and reported results, Varian has 54% share of the $5.3 billion global radiation oncology market gaining one point of share for the trailing four quarters ending in our fiscal third quarter. We expect this market to grow at about 4% compounded annual growth rate to $6.3 billion over the next five years. Executing on our growth initiatives, we expect to grow share in addressable markets such as in cancer care coordination and operating information systems, which is an estimated $2 billion market today and is expected to grow at a double-digit growth rate to $6 billion over the next five years. Combining the core radiation oncology market with these addressable opportunities, Varian is operating in markets projected to be $12 billion in the next five years.", "Achieving our long-term strategy is a multi-year journey. As such, our targets for fiscal year 2018 support sustainable long-term value creation. Thus, we expect fiscal year 2018 results within the following ranges: Revenue growth from 2% to 4%; net earnings per diluted share from $4.20 to $4.32.", "I will turn it over to Gary now who will provide more context on the fourth quarter financials as well as the fiscal year 2018 guidance.", "Gary Bischoping", "Thanks Dow and hello everyone. I have framed my comments today in the context of our long-term growth and value creation strategy, which includes balancing growth, profitability and liquidity. So let me start with growth.", "Companywide revenue was $739 million in the fourth quarter, down 1% in dollars and down 2% in constant currency. For the full year, revenue of $2.7 billion was up 2% in both dollars and in constant currency. We ended the year with $3.5 billion in backlog, up 10%. For the fourth quarter, oncology revenue was $686 million, up 1% in both dollars and in constant currency. Orders were $964 million, up 7% in dollars and in constant currency.", "Taking a closer look at our oncology business results. In the Americas, fourth quarter revenue grew 2% in dollars and in constant currency. Orders were $489 million, up 1% in dollars and 2% in constant currency. North America orders grew 8% supported by key wins in the quarter including Barnes-Jewish Healthcare, which ordered one Halcyon system, four TrueBeams and software packages for five centers in their network. We continue to see strong multisystem orders from a variety of healthcare customers such as Spectrum Health, MultiCare, Trinity and Western Connecticut. A slight correction to Dow's opening comments. We had overall 10 Halcyon orders in North America during the quarter, not in North Africa.", "In Latin America, orders were down 46% due to several tenders pushing out, mainly from public-sector deals. However Brazil had solid performance highlighted by $9 million order with [indiscernible] and a $6 million order with the Clinic of Oncology and Radiotherapy of [indiscernible].", "Asia-Pacific revenue declined 5% in dollars and 4% in constant currency. Orders were $155 million, declining 10% in dollars and 9% in constant currency. Orders declined double digits in the Japan market primarily due to continued market softness which was offset by solid double digit growth in other countries. Our first Halcyon system in Korea was ordered by a non-hospital. In Australia, we received a treatment planning system order from Peter MacCallum Cancer Center in Melbourne worth $16 million over 10 years. Lastly in the region, in China we maintained our market leadership position with robust double digit growth.", "In our Europe, Middle East, India and Africa geography, revenue grew 3% and was flat in constant currency. Orders grew 32% in dollars and 29% in constant currency to $321 million in the fourth quarter. Growth was balanced across mature and emerging markets in the region. In Western Europe, an $18 million order at a network of clinics in France supported this 45% growth in the quarter. In India, strong double digit orders growth in the quarter was supported by a $15 million order from West Bengal for three TrueBeam and two VitalBeam systems. Across the geography, we booked 12 Halcyon orders in the quarter.", "Turning to full year results. Oncology revenue of $2.5 billion was up 1% in dollars and in constant currency. Orders were $2.9 billion, up 7% in dollars and in constant currency. And backlog grew 9% over the year ending at $3.2 billion. By geography, Americas orders grew 3% for the full year, driven by strong North America performance of 6%. APAC orders grew 7% and Europe orders grew 14% overall, increasing its geographical mix to 30%, up two points from last year. Overall, we are pleased with our full year performance and strength in our oncology business, as evidenced by our LinAcc installed base growing 4% for the full year with a strong distribution of new units installed across all three geographies.", "Our proton therapy business posted revenues of $52 million in the fourth quarter, down 23% from a year ago but in line with company expectations. We booked two orders during the quarter, bringing the total number of orders for the year to six, half of which were in international markets. For the full year, revenue was $182 million, up 12%. We ended the year with $323 million in backlog, up 18% year-on-year.", "Turning to profitability. Total company fourth quarter gross margin rate decreased 50 basis points to 42.3%. This included a $2 million or 30 basis point unfavorable adjustment to estimated project costs in our proton business. However for the full year, gross margin rate increased 87 basis points to 43.5%.", "Oncology fourth quarter gross margin increased $1.6 million, but the rate decreased 26 basis points to 45%. Strong services revenue mix within the quarter was offset by lower product gross margin rate in the quarter, primarily due to country and product mix. It is worth noting that at a country level average selling prices held relatively steady. Also, within the quarter, we recorded a $3 million customs duty related charge in Brazil. Full year oncology gross margin increased 161 basis points to 46%, primarily driven by increased service mix and realization of ongoing efforts to optimize the supply chain.", "Looking at proton therapy. Fourth quarter gross margin dollars were down $9 million, including the impact of the $2 million adjustment to estimated project costs. Full year gross margin dollars were down 36%. Fourth quarter SG&A expenses were $131 million, up $11 million or 9% and 18% of revenue. This included a $5 million bad debt expense. A quick reminder that the fourth quarter of 2016 included a favorable $4 million bad debt release. And since the first quarter of this year, we have consistently reduced SG&A costs as a percent of revenue but there is more work to do. On a GAAP basis, fourth quarter depreciation and amortization was $18 million and full year was $77 million.", "Investment will continue to be a driver of our long-term growth and value creation strategy. In the quarter, we invested $52 million in R&D or 7% of revenue. R&D expenses for the full year were $210 million, up 5% and representing 5% of revenue.", "Turning to earnings. Fourth quarter operating earnings results were $131 million or 18% of revenue, declining 11%. The decline is primarily driven by bad debt expense of $5 million, Brazil customs duty related charges of $3 million, the $2 million adjustment to estimated project costs in the proton business and lower proton business gross margin. EPS in the quarter was $1.09 and our diluted share count in the quarter was 92.6 million shares.", "For the full year, operating earnings of $437 million or 16.4% of revenue declined 8%. Our effective tax rate was 23.6% and EPS was $3.60. These results include the fourth quarter items I mentioned previously and the impact from the first quarter of $38 million accounts receivable reserve related to the proton therapy business. On a GAAP basis, Varian took a $13 million charge in the fourth quarter related to the California Proton Treatment Center or CPTC in San Diego because of a decrease in expected operating cash flows and an increase in incremental financing needs arising out of the transition of the center from Scripps to a white label regional center, which was an agreement executed in September.", "During the quarter, we performed a review of this new agreement, including expected EBITDA amounts, timing of the expected municipal bond financing and the amount of new senior debt required. In comparing that to the analysis performed in the first quarter of 2017, it was determined that the present value of cash flows expected to be collected by Varian was less than the carrying value of the CPTC loan balances. Thus we recorded an impairment charge in the fourth quarter.", "Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $716 million and debt of $350 million. Cash flow from operations was $130 million in the fourth quarter and $399 million for the full year. We are pleased to see continued improvement in DSO for our oncology business which was down one day from the prior quarter and down six days from our second quarter. We will continue to focus on operational discipline and the cash conversion cycle.", "In addition to R&D, other investments in the quarter included $18.7 million in CapEx and $25 million to repurchase 250,000 shares of our stock. As of the end of the fourth quarter, we had 5.25 million shares remaining under our existing repurchase authorization.", "Now let's talk about FY 2018. As Dow mentioned, we have a long-term growth and increase strategy supported by initiatives to strengthen our leadership in radiation therapy, extend our global footprint and expand into new addressable markets. We continue to invest in high quality, innovation and building new capabilities in software services and big data while driving operational efficiency and disciplined capital management. We will track key performance indicators to evaluate results but always in the context of progress towards our long-term value creation objectives.", "Therefore we are deploying a framework across the business to drive a culture of ownership in evaluating operational trade-offs, capital allocation and investment decisions. We will also incorporate this into our incentive design to achieve the desired outcomes over the long-term. Given the duration our sales, research and development and product cycles, we believe that a trailing four quarter view is a better indicator of our progress toward achieving our long-term strategy. Thus we are moving to annual guidance for fiscal 2018 and are aligning our financial practices accordingly.", "As Dow said earlier, for fiscal 2018 we expect revenue growth from 2% to 4% and net earnings per diluted share from $4.20 to $4.32. Going forward, we will also provide full year guidance on operating earnings, cash flow from operations, tax rate and share count. For fiscal year 2018, we see the following for these items. Operating earnings between 18% to 19% of revenue, cash flow from operations between $475 million and $550 million and a 23% tax rate for the year and no change to share count year-over-year.", "Thank you. And now let's go to the operator for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird. Please go ahead.", "Jeff Johnson", "Thank you. Good evening guys. Can you hear me okay?", "Dow Wilson", "Hi Jeff. Loud and clear.", "Jeff Johnson", "Great. So Gary or Dow, I guess for you, just looking at the revenue guidance, again with the 2% to 4%, you did have 7% oncology order growth this past year, 11% I think companywide with a strong year in proton. I typically think of service and software contributing a couple points to fiscal 2018 revenue growth. So why are hardware revenue, I guess, essentially being guided flat to maybe up only slightly this coming year, given how strong the order growth was in the past year?", "Dow Wilson", "Why don't I start and then Gary can clean up here a little bit. As we said on the call, we are guiding to 2% to 4%. When you look at 2016 and 2017, we had 1% growth in 2016 and 7% growth in 2017. We have had a good orders year in 2016. That was a good orders year. And you saw the results on the quarter were also positive. With the increased mix in our EMEA backlog and 15 to 18 months cycle time on the backlog we have taken a pretty pragmatic view on our growth guidance. And at the highest level, that's how we are kind of penciling it out.", "Gary, anything to add there?", "Gary Bischoping", "Yes. Look Jeff, we are coming out of a transitional year as well and the spin of Varex, new product launches with Halcyon and HyperArc, our new brand. We are going to continue to watch our conversion metrics as we go through the year. But like Dow said, this is a pragmatic approach to revenue guidance at 2% to 4% for the year.", "Jeff Johnson", "Okay. And Gary, I guess there are two follow up on that. One, is there any currency embedded in that? By my model, it's maybe 1% to 2% tailwind. I just want to confirm that. And then two, again it does seem to me the trailing 12 month order growth has been stronger. And maybe I am wondering if there is any chance with Halcyon out there, are any orders kind of sitting in backlog a little bit longer than usual, hospitals reevaluating, do they want to convert from one system to Halcyon instead? Or is there no extension going on in that kind of backlog exit timing?", "Dow Wilson", "Yes. We are not seeing extension in the backlog timing. We are seeing a little mix. So as we said last quarter, we are seeing a little mix to more vaults outside of our developed markets. And those, as people build new vaults that takes a little bit longer. So we might have a little bit of a geographic mix that way.", "Gary Bischoping", "Yes. Just to build on that a little bit and I will answer your currency question just thereafter. The market we just came out of for the trailing 12 months through the third quarter, market growth was 2.1%. And so we just guided to 2% to 4%. And then our orders growth over that same period of time is 3.4%. So again we feel like that guiding in 2% to 4% is a pragmatic approach to that number.", "And then to answer on the currency side is no. We assume no currency impact next year.", "Jeff Johnson", "Okay. Well, I will let others jump in. Thanks guys.", "Dow Wilson", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Hazan from Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Amit Hazan", "Thanks. Good afternoon guys.", "Dow Wilson", "Hi Amit", "Amit Hazan", "Let me start with you, Gary. And I think just given it's your first quarter out of the gate, people are going to want to know what surprised you causing the miss, given it's the first quarter and people are going to want to know why they should be confident in 2018 guidance range given this miss for the first quarter?", "Gary Bischoping", "Yes. Thanks for the question, Amit. From the overall revenue guidance perspective, we did make the revenue guidance in the quarter and felt good about the momentum exiting the quarter here in the second-half from an orders growth perspective. And so again we think 2% to 4% of revenue guidance is pragmatic. From an earnings per share perspective. I think the way to think about it is, as you look back on all of 2017 and you look back into the fourth quarter, there are things that impacted the business that was a result of good operational rigor that will continue.", "Those things in the fourth quarter would include the bad debt expense, it would include the Brazil's customs duty related expense and the adjustment of estimated proton business project costs. That's about $10 million there in cost that, again, good operational rigor that drove us to incur those cost in the period. But as we work our way through the operational rigor, I am sure we will continue to improve from a results perspective as we move forward. So $4.20 to $4.34 from an earnings per share guidance perspective feels about right given the operational excellence that I have seen in the business here in the last five or six months that I have been at Varian.", "Amit Hazan", "So let me just follow up on that. It's another guidance question on operating margin and shares. So the operating margin guidance actually doesn't show much of a benefit over the periods in fiscal 2017 that would be apples-to-apples. So I am just wondering if you can give us some puts and takes to think about for operating margin and why you are not able to show additional benefits in fiscal 2018? And then separately on the share count, just give us an idea of, this would be the first time Varian hasn't bought back shares as long as I can remember. So just what your thoughts are behind that lack of share purchase in fiscal 2018? Thanks.", "Gary Bischoping", "Sure. So as it relates to the operating earnings margin rates, look, we are looking for targeting and driving sustainable improvement in our supply chain and operating expenses. This range that we gave would infer 50 to maybe 70 or even 100 basis points to the top end of the range of operating margin improvement in FY 2018 over FY 2017, when you take a look at things on a apples-to-apples basis. We are still trying to achieve that 18% to 22% aspirational target that we have got in front of us. And we also want to be cognizant of the fact that we want to ensure the ability to invest in growth options organically that we see in front of us. So that's the nature of the guidance from an 18% to 19% perspective on operating earnings.", "As it relates to share repurchase, there will be share repurchase just like there was in the fourth quarter, right. We did $25 million to retire 250,000 shares. What I said in my guidance is that share count would be flat year-over-year. So there will be due to restricted shares and stock option exercises, there will be shares that come into the share count and we will endeavor to keep that flat year-over-year with our share repurchase activity in FY 2018. And again, the overall objective here from how we deploy capital is, one organically like I just said, two is look at inorganic options. We feel like we have good financial flexibility relative to our capitalizing on inorganic activities that are in front of us. And then third and only thereafter, we would execute on the share repurchase side.", "Amit Hazan", "All right. Thanks guys.", "Gary Bischoping", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Tycho Peterson", "Hi. Thanks. Dow, I have got one question on the software side, given that that's driving a lot of the growth in orders here. Can you just get us comfortable with the trajectory here that that's sustainable? It seems like most of your installed base has RapidPlan at this point. I know obviously you have got HyperArc and 360 Oncology now. So help us think about the sustainability of the software growth side?", "Dow Wilson", "Yes. We had very good quarter and a very good year. Both fourth quarter and the fiscal year had strong double-digit growth rates in software. Maybe a little color, RapidPlan, we have 1,200 licenses ordered to-date, about 500 customers. The treatment planning installed base is 5,000 to 6,000 systems. So we still got a long way to go there. InSightive, we have 250 customers ordered with about 100 in clinical use. Again, our ARIA install base is 4,500 to 5,000. So we have got big opportunity to go there.", "Velocity, while it's tripled it still is a pretty small business, but we very much like the trajectory of that business. So we have got I think 450 customers on Velocity now again an installed base of 7,800 machines. We have got a long way to go there. So our aspirational goal here is to see if we can drive this double-digit growth for the next four or five years and we think that this has moved off the historical lower growth and the trajectory is upward. So we like what we see on software side.", "Tycho Peterson", "And then I know you guys haven't given guidance on orders for Halcyon, But can you tell us how the 23 tracks relative to your expectations? And as we think about a lot of the emerging market customers and capital budgeting, when do you really think the product cycle could start to take off?", "Dow Wilson", "Sure. And apologies again for throwing in North Africa instead of North America in the call. Reception has been outstanding. It's ahead of our internal plans. We have taken 50 orders, as I mentioned in the call, since the introduction. We very much like what we are seeing. About half of them are for greenfield sites. So these are new vaults going in. We like that. So we have also had a handful of competitive takeouts. And we have also had a handful of units go in where vault fit has been a factor. As you know, this is kind of a stealth launch that we did in May. So people are still lining their budgets up. Our funnel looks terrific. Of the 50 orders we have taken, we have only taken three in Asia-Pacific. We do not have clearance yet in China or Japan and hope to have that into Q2, early Q3 next year. So we very much like what we see. The first treatments have been very successful. Our customers are very happy with what they are seeing out of the machine.", "Tycho Peterson", "Okay. And then on the longer term growth strategy you outlined, is the incremental spending starting to get baked in here in 2018? And what are your competitive advantages that you see in areas like diagnostic imaging and precision medicine? It seems a little bit far field relative to what you have historically done?", "Dow Wilson", "As Garry mentioned, it starts first with our core business. We have got bad terrific core business and we believe we have very significant opportunities to keep driving organic investment in R&D in our core business. Second, there are some inorganic opportunities out there. We see those in the first phase, maybe building off our software business, seeing how we can get more longitudinal with the patient through their cancer journey. And I would say, those are kind of the top two.", "Tycho Peterson", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Anthony Petrone", "Thanks. Maybe just back to Halcyon and HyperArc. Maybe on Halcyon where pricing has settled out, I know you had a range there of $2 million to $4 million. So how's that settling out? And is there a delta between U.S. pricing and oUS pricing to settle out? And then on the HyperArc, maybe with the margin contribution from a HyperArc upgrade isn't, what point do you see that benefiting the P&L? And then I have got a couple of follow-ups. Thanks.", "Dow Wilson", "Yes. I would say, on Halcyon on pricing is meeting our expectations. So we like that. It is very configuration dependent. I would say that our U.S. customers in general are ordering a richer mix, but our average selling price is ahead of our expectations and the overall margin of the product will be accretive to company margins.", "On HyperArc, Anthony, as I mentioned in the call, we have received 40 orders in Q4. So the uptake has been substantial. We have just got regulatory approval, CE Mark in August and 510(k) in September. We have done first treatments at three sites. And this version of the product is optimized for brain metastatic disease. We will have future releases for SBRT. I think the reception the product has been very good.", "In terms of how this flows to the P&L, you I think again margins here will be very good. I think Halcyon will move a little faster through the backlog into customers because of its installation time and where people build new vaults will be a little different. But we have Halcyon going in as replacement, that should flow very quickly. I think HyperArc will take a little bit longer as it flows into the P&L", "Anthony Petrone", "And so one of the follow ups would be just a little bit on, if you expect any cannibalization of the TrueBeam as it relates to halcyon? Or will that be offset by HyperArc? And then just revisit on Japan? A little bit more color on the weakness there? What's going on behind the pressure? And what's your outlook potentially for that to normalize out? Thanks.", "Dow Wilson", "Yes. We have maybe a little bit of movement from TrueBeam to Halcyon. I think it's going to be very small. We have been very pleased with the reception that HyperArc has received. So I think that will be very good. And then the second part of your question was --", "Anthony Petrone", "On Japan weakness.", "Dow Wilson", "Yes. Japan has had a rough year. I think good news is, we see that bottoming out. Our market share remains. We haven't lost any share there. So we feel good about that. But that market has been down pretty substantially this past year. And you saw a little of that more in the fourth quarter. Looking forward, I do think we are seeing that bottom out and the funnel looks pretty good.", "Anthony Petrone", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Isaac Ro", "Good afternoon guys. Thank you. I just want to confirm on the guidance comment you guys made that that topline growth outlook you gave, 2% to 4%, that is assuming zero impact from currency.", "Gary Bischoping", "Yes. That's correct.", "Isaac Ro", "Okay. And so just if I look at where you are coming from prior year, it does imply a bit of a deceleration even though you have a new product cycle in Halcyon. So just help us reconcile, is it the extent to what you have taken a lot of share in that part of the dynamic is flowing off? Why would you see a deceleration in topline growth as the new product cycle ramps? And then second to that, any commentary on emerging marked approvals for Halcyon would be great? Thank you.", "Gary Bischoping", "So just so we are on the same page, we grew 2% in oncology for the full year, right. And we see now and we are guiding now, I am sorry, 1% year-on-year in oncology and so we are guiding now %2 to 4% overall for 2018. So we don't see it as a deceleration in the growth rate. We kind of see it at or better than what we did here in 2017. Again, we will continue to keep a close eye on conversion rates and the opportunities we see in front of us. But we feel that that's pragmatic growth given the orders growth rate we have seen historically over the last 12 to 18 months.", "Dow Wilson", "And then for emerging market approvals, the biggest two, well one in that emerging market is Japan. We think both Japan and China, we should have approvals end of Q2, our fiscal Q2, end of Q3 next year, beginning of Q3.", "Let's start that over. End of Q2, beginning of Q3 next year we should have China and Japan. Those are the two largest approvals that are remaining.", "Isaac Ro", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Henry from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Brandon Henry", "Yes. Thanks for taking my question.", "Dow Wilson", "Hi Brandon.", "Brandon Henry", "Can you start out by talking about your expectations for free cash flow for fiscal year 2018 versus fiscal year 2017 and what's driving the expected improvement in operating cash flow for next year?", "Gary Bischoping", "Yes. I will certainly to cash flow from operations. And the way to think about that guidance is that the revenue and EBIT targets that we gave plus we are looking for our continued focus on the cash conversion cycle and our ability to operationally execute through improvements there. Those two combine. So working capital benefit along with the EBIT dollars trends you right into that range for FY 2018. As far as free cash flow, I am not going to comment on free cash flow today and get into CapEx and other elements of capital allocation process that we have got ahead of us. But from a cash flow from operations perspective, we feel good about that guidance that we have out there.", "Brandon Henry", "Okay. And then on the proton side, it looks like Varian booked another two proton therapy orders during the quarter. First half of the year, I think, was kind of a slow start but it picked up in the back half. So can you discuss your expectations for the proton market for fiscal year 2018? And is the company's bundling strategy with LinAcc and protons helping the company to win orders there?", "Dow Wilson", "Yes. I mean I would say, first on all on the year we booked six proton orders, so pretty good year for us. We did seven in 2015 and two in 2016. The funnel looks pretty good. So I would say, a pretty good funnel for what we are seeing. The strategy that we are going to market with is with an integrated commercial team and that is working out very well for us. And then maybe from a bit of broader product strategy. We are certainly leveraging the treatment planning and the information systems with proton therapy as well.", "Brandon Henry", "All right. And last question for me. You mentioned that the company is making investments in, I think, liquid biopsy and radiotherapeutics. Can you spend some time helping us understand how you are thinking about the size, the potential timing from some of these new opportunities?", "Dow Wilson", "Yes. For now what we really want is a seat at the table. These are small investments that we have made. We are very interested in integrating our information systems, our treatment planning. There is something very exciting emerging, who knows exactly when, but called radionics and the idea there is that patients would have a different radiation dose depending on their genetic profile. And as we look at these kind of opportunities, these would be things that we have built into our information systems and treatment planning. And so having a seat at the table is very important to us. It is a growth engine for our existing core business as well as some new business opportunities.", "Brandon Henry", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.", "Dow Wilson", "All right. Thank you operator. Let me leave with a few key takeaways. First, I am very excited about the opportunities for Varian. We are solely focused on cancer care solutions and well-positioned to capitalize on our strength and leadership in radiation therapy to grow market share and extend our global footprint in both mature and emerging markets. With that foundation and a long-term focus, we intend to invest in profitable growth, expand into other addressable markets and build multidisciplinary integrated cancer care solutions. We are focused on being operationally and financially disciplined, aligning our internal decision-making and incentive structure to our long-term strategy. And we have built financial flexibility to take advantage of appropriate investment opportunities. Finally and most importantly, Varian is well-positioned to positively influence the cancer care continuum for more and more patients globally every day. By bringing smarter and simpler solutions to healthcare providers, they can focus more time on what's important to all of us, their patients and together we can achieve a world without the fear of cancer. Thank you very much for joining us today.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our teleconference for today. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.

Just as a reminder that the replay of this call can be heard on the Varian Investor website at www.varian.com/investors where it will be archived for a year. To hear a telephone replay, please dial 1-877-660 -6853 from inside the U.S. or 1201-612-7415 from outside the U.S. and enter confirmation code 13674372. The telephone replay will be available through Friday, January 26.", "Now, I will turn it over to Michael Bruff, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Michael Bruff", "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to Varian\u2019s first quarter fiscal year 2018 conference call and webcast. Joining me today on the call are Varian\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, Dow Wilson and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Bischoping. Dow will share his thoughts on our results and long-term strategy and Gary will cover our operating and financial results in more detail.", "On the Varian Investor Relations website, you can find our fiscal first quarter press release and web deck which are intended to provide additional perspective and details. Included in these documents is the reconciliation of the differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. We report non-GAAP earnings to provide comparisons of operational performance, excluding unusual items. Unless otherwise stated, all financial results discussed are non-GAAP and from continuing operations. All growth rates are year-over-year and any references to orders are gross orders. All references to trailing 12 months refer to the trailing 12 months ending on the last day of our most recently completed first quarter. Also, note that we may provide growth rates in constant currency allowing assessment of the business excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations.", "And as a reminder, Varian adopted revenue accounting standard codification 606 at the beginning of fiscal year 2018. The results that we disclosed today including fiscal year 2017 results and any forward-looking statements including guidance reflect this new standard. And finally, during this call many statements made maybe considered forward-looking statements. Our use of the words and phrases such as outlook, believe, expect, anticipate, could, should, will, promising and similar expressions are intended to identify those statements which represent our current judgment on future performance and other future matters. While we believe them to be reasonable based on information currently available to us, these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this presentation and discussion because of new information, future events or otherwise.", "And with that, I will turn it over to Dow.", "Dow Wilson", "Thanks, Mike and good afternoon everyone. Today, I will share the key milestones we achieved this past quarter and how they contributed to our long-term strategy. First, let me touch on our first quarter results. Total company revenues of $679 million increased 13%. Oncology revenues grew 14% and the particle therapy business declined 4% in the quarter. Operating earnings of $126 million or 18.6% of revenue grew 84% in part due to the non-recurrence of an accounts receivable reserve taken in the prior year.", "GAAP earnings per share, was a loss of $1.22 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.06 grew 110%. Our earnings per share results reflect the impact from the new Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as Gary will discuss in more detail later. Cash flow from operations was $179 million, up 118%. Looking more long-term, we continue to make meaningful progress towards our long-term growth and value creation strategy across three initiatives: first, strengthening our leadership in radiation therapy. Based on company estimates, the radiation therapy market grew 4.5% on an orders basis over the trailing 12 months. Varian grew orders 7% over that time growing share and extending our market leadership.", "In our oncology business, orders grew 7% in the first quarter and our worldwide net installed base is now 7,876 units, up 3% over the trailing 12 months. Regarding Halcyon, we continue to be pleased with the order ramp with 62 total orders taken since the launch in May of last year, including 12 new orders in the first quarter. What\u2019s meaningful here is that of the 62 orders to-date more than half have been incremental and greater than 40% are for Greenfield sites. Looking forward, we expect solid demand over the coming quarters. The anticipated growth will be driven by new scaled configurations, optimized for different customer segments, more advanced capabilities such as kilovoltage Cone-beam CT imaging and the continued ramp up of public tenders as budgets are finalized for the new calendar year.", "HyperArc, our high definition radiotherapy technology, also continues to ramp nicely. With 19 new orders in the first quarter, we have now taken 57 orders since the launch in the fourth quarter of last year and greater than 60% of those orders are upgrades. We are excited about what HyperArc will mean for treating multiple metastases brain cancer cases as these sites are installed. We continue to see strong demand for our software solutions. The number of unique Varian software customers grew 4% in the quarter and we are very pleased to see the installed bases of RapidPlan Double and Velocity, grow strong double-digits. And services had another strong quarter posting revenue growth of 8% in the oncology business, which includes performance obligations for installation, training and warranty as per the new revenue standard ASC 606.", "In our particle therapy business, we booked two new proton orders in the quarter, one at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and one at the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami. Both orders are for ProBeam Compact single-room systems. Today, Varian has 23 customer sites with 70 rooms installed or under contract. In the first quarter, there were clinical room handovers at the Holland Proton Therapy Center and the proton therapy center in St. Petersburg, Russia. This brings the total operational sites to 7 globally with the remaining 16 in progress.", "Our second growth initiative is to extend our global footprint. Our global market share growth was driven by orders based share gains in both our EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. In the Americas, we held our market leading share position. We are very pleased with Halcyon\u2019s continued adoption outside North America. 2 months after the hospital ordered the system, the University Hospital Leuven in Belgium became the first to treat the cancer patient on Halcyon in Europe. In Australia, the radiation oncology center in Toowoomba became the first to treat a patient on Halcyon there. And now with regulatory approvals obtained in Brazil, Japan and Taiwan during the first quarter, more commissions around the world are learning about and have access to this new advanced cancer care technology. Of the 62 Halcyon orders taken since launch, almost 40% were from emerging markets and approximately 90% of the emerging market orders are for incremental units.", "Our software products are being with increased demand globally as well. In December, we announced that Peter MacCallum Cancer Center in Melbourne, Australia selected Varian\u2019s Eclipse treatment planning to replace its existing systems across all 5 of its sites. The full solution includes Varian\u2019s Velocity software for adaptive radiotherapy. Demonstrating our commitment in the fight against cancer in Latin America, we announced the opening of our new facility in Jundia\u00ed, Brazil, which extends Varian\u2019s global manufacturing and training footprint in the region. Partnering with the Brazilian Ministry of Health, we are bringing greater access to advanced radiotherapy treatment in that country and to greater Latin America.", "Our third growth initiative is to expand into other addressable markets. We continue to build momentum in oncology care coordination, which is part of a larger care coordination market that is expected to grow greater than 20% CAGR over the next 5 years. With ongoing feedback from customers who are using our 360 Oncology software to manage clinical workflow and digitize the multidisciplinary tumor board, we are enthusiastic about the potential of the product. We are expanding the platform\u2019s clinical decision support, imaging and analytics capabilities, building enterprise and SaaS channel capabilities and beginning to provide real world evidence for 360 Oncology applications. Overall, we are very pleased with the progress we have made through the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018 and we remain committed to long-term growth and value creation for the company and our employees, our customers and patients and our shareholders.", "With that, I will turn it over to Gary, who will provide more context on the first quarter financial results.", "Gary Bischoping", "Thanks, Dow. As always, I will consistently frame my comments in the context of our long-term growth and value creation strategy, which includes balancing growth, profitability and liquidity. So, let me start with growth.", "Companywide revenue was $679 million in the first quarter, up 13% in dollars and 11% in constant currency. In oncology, revenue was $649 million, up 14% in dollars and 12% in constant currency driven by increased linac shipments in mature markets. Orders were $620 million, up 7% in dollars and 6% in constant currency. We ended the quarter with $2.7 billion in backlog, up 7%.", "Taking a closer look at our oncology business results, in the Americas, revenue grew 16% in dollars and in constant currency. Orders were $300 million, up 2% in dollars and in constant currency. North America orders grew 2% supported by key wins in the quarter, including Norton Healthcare, which purchased 3 TrueBeam systems along with our ARIA, InSightive and Eclipse software solutions to deploy in their two sites. In Latin America, orders were down 3%, primarily due to Brazil. We did have 4 Halcyon orders in the region, 2 in Brazil, 1 each in Aruba and the Dominican Republic. Asia-Pacific revenue grew 15% in dollars and 17% in constant currency. Orders were $130 million increasing 6% in dollars and in constant currency. Orders in Japan and Greater China had solid growth in the quarter. In Greater China, we extended our market leadership with key wins in Qingdao Central Hospital, Fudan University, Zhuhai People\u2019s Hospital, all buying our Edge system.", "In Europe, Middle East, India and Africa geography, revenue grew 9% and 2% in constant currency. Orders grew 19% in dollars and 13% in constant currency to $190 million in the first quarter. We continue to see market penetration across the regions as illustrated by wins in Denmark for 15 total treatment machines, including both TrueBeam and Halcyon to be deployed in two hospitals in Copenhagen region and in Poland, where Varian won a public tender with the Ministry of Health for 1 Halcyon, 1 TrueBeam and 3 VitalBeam machines. Our particle therapy business posted revenues of $29 million in the first quarter, which is down 4%. And as Dow mentioned earlier, we booked two new orders both in the U.S.", "Turning to profitability, total company gross margin was $304 million, up 13% and 44.8% of revenues. Oncology gross margin of $302 million increased 15% and the rate was 46.5%, up 36 basis points. Looking at particle therapy, gross margin dollars were $2 million, down $3 million due to a mix of lower margin deals in the current period. Companywide SG&A expenses of $122 million or 18% of revenue were down $28 million or down 18%. The decline was primarily driven by the non-recurrence of prior year\u2019s $38 million accounts receivable reserve related to the proton business. Excluding this, SG&A increased $10 million or 9% driven by targeted investments in product management and sales headcounts.", "On a GAAP basis, depreciation and amortization was $19 million. Investment will continue to be a key driver of our long-term growth and value creation strategy. In the quarter, R&D was up 12% to $56 million investing 8% of revenue. Company operating earnings were $126 million or 19% of revenue increasing $57 million or 84%. Excluding the $38 million impact on the prior year\u2019s results related to the non-recurrence of accounts receivable reserve, operating earnings increased $19 million growing 18%.", "Turning to taxes, a major event in the quarter was the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into U.S. law on December 22. Two provisions with the new law had immediate impact. First, the U.S. corporate tax rate was reduced from 35% to 21%. In the long run, this will be favorable to Varian. However, in the recorder, it requires us to remeasure our deferred tax assets, which were originally recorded assuming a future tax benefit at the 35% rate. We estimate that the total impact of this remeasurement of deferred tax assets will be about $47 million. The impact to our first quarter is a charged income tax expense of $38 million. The remainder or about $9 million will be charged over the balance of the fiscal year.", "Second, as part of the transition to a new territorial system, the new law imposes tax in the unremitted foreign earnings of the U.S. company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries at reduced rates, specifically 15.5% to the degree the earnings are held in the form of liquid assets and 8% to the degree the earnings are held in the form of illiquid assets. We estimate the tax effect of this mandatory deemed repatriation to be $169 million. Companies may elect to pay this tax often called a toll charge over an 8-year period we intend to make that election. The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued guidance allowing companies a 1 year measurement period to refine their estimates of the tax impact of the new law. We fully expect that we, like many other companies, will true up our estimates of these tax impacts from the new tax legislation over the measurement period.", "Other provisions of the law will take effect over the next few years, thus after impacts of the new legislations provisions, our resulting GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 191.5%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22.5%, which excludes the tax expenses due to the repatriation of foreign earnings and lower corporate tax rates impact on our deferred tax assets. Similarly, our non-GAAP net earnings per diluted share also exclude these items. GAAP net loss per diluted share was $1.22. Our non-GAAP net earnings, was $1.06 with related diluted share count of 92.7 million shares in the quarter.", "Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $823 million and debt of $340 million. Cash flow from operations was $179 million. Due to the adoption of ASC 606, we restated oncology DSO in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from 95 days to 108 days. Oncology DSO in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 was 103 days improving 5 days year-over-year. In addition to R&D, other investments in the quarter included $9 million in CapEx and $57 million to repurchase shares of our stock. As of the end of the quarter, we had 4.7 million shares remaining under our existing repurchase authorization.", "I will now turn it back over to Dow who will discuss our fiscal year 2018 annual guidance.", "Dow Wilson", "Thanks, Gary. With respect to our annual guidance, we maintain the programmatic approach. There are three new factors we have taken into account regarding our fiscal year 2018 guidance. First, the global radiation therapy market growth increased from 2% growth over the trailing 12 months exiting our third quarter of last fiscal year to 4.5% growth over the trailing 12 months exiting our fourth quarter of last fiscal year; second, our growth and share gain in the faster growing market and our operational execution in the first quarter; and third, the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.", "After a careful consideration of these factors, we believe it is prudent to update and raise our fiscal year 2018 annual guidance to the following: revenue growth range of 4% to 7%, non-GAAP operating earnings as a percentage of revenue range of 18% to 19%, non-GAAP effective tax rate of 21%, weighted average diluted shares of 93 million, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $4.24 to $4.36 and cash flow from operations range of $470 million to $550 million. The updated non-GAAP earnings per share guidance reflects $0.11 related to tax rate reduction primarily related to the impact of the law change on fiscal year 2018 earnings. We intend to reinvest about half in R&D to drive organic growth. The remainder of the anticipated non-GAAP earnings per share increase is driven by our continued market share gains in a stronger market and through operating leverage.", "Thank you. And now, let\u2019s get to questions and answers. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jeff Johnson, Robert W. Baird & Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Jeff Johnson", "Thank you. Good evening, guys. Can you hear me, okay?", "Dow Wilson", "Good morning, Jeff. Jeff, it\u2019s loud and clear.", "Jeff Johnson", "Alright, great. Hi, Dow, I wanted to start on the oncology order side. The biggest upside versus my model anyway in APAC, that 6% constant currency growth came against the strong 29% comp, so just wondering what was going on there, what\u2019s driving the strong growth in APAC on top of that tough comp. And if I look at the Halcyon orders of 12, that\u2019s about half of what you bought in the prior quarter in fiscal Q4, so I am assuming it wasn\u2019t Halcyon the drove that and maybe you could touch on Halcyon and maybe thinking we are working to get a budget flush or maybe some upside on the Halcyon number that didn\u2019t seem to come through this quarter, so just what\u2019s going on there?", "Dow Wilson", "Sure. Yes. I mean just going around the horn geographically, first Jeff, we had a good quarter in Japan. As you know we didn\u2019t get Shonin approval in Japan until the quarter. So there is very good interest there. So we think longer term that the funnel looks very good, but we had a very good quarter in Japan, it was up significantly year-over-year. Southeast Asia was also up year-over-year, we had very good performance on a number of geographies in Southeast Asia. Australia was really the only one that was kind of go the other way. And then we had good double digit growth in China. So even on in tough comp, we had very good performance in China. And again in China, we also don\u2019t have Halcyon approval there yet. There \u2013 the from a product point of view it was all about our Edge product had very good up-tick of Edge, Gary mentioned in his remarks as well as on VitalBeam. The other thing that we are starting to see in Asia and especially in China is some very good up-tick in the software side of the business. So historically that\u2019s been a very, very small business for us. And with both the introduction of our ARIA Qin product and longer term development with \u2013 with Ping An and others like that, we think we have got a very good cycle. As it relates to Halcyon, we are very comfortable with where we are. It\u2019s the orders are incremental, they are in new sockets, it\u2019s growing our installed base, we did surprise the market with this product, our funnel remains very, very strong. I think what we are excited about is we have tiered the product and so we really think that we can get both more aggressive, but kind of lower end price points and with the coming of kilovoltage Cone-beam CT, higher price points in developed markets. So we are very excited about where this product goes. We are seeing some activity in the tender market. Those customers try to \u2013 trying to put themselves in line and develop budgets for the product. So I think it\u2019s very much in the budget development part of the market. And we like what we see very good funnel for the product.", "Jeff Johnson", "Alright, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And Gary, maybe one follow-up just on guidance, it looks like your revenue guidance update implies 1% to 5% reported growth over the balance of fiscal \u201818 over the next three quarters, I have got currency in my model adding probably 250 basis points over the next three quarters, so just trying to figure a kind of flattish organic revenue over each of the next three quarters is kind of \u2013 is that you guys being just over conservative at this point, is there something where first quarter took some out of the next few quarters, just how should we think about kind of your constant currency or your organic revenue expectations for the next few quarters?", "Gary Bischoping", "Yes. There is no real material change from our perspective Jeff in the currency market relative to our guidance. And so we will see what the markets do maybe you know better than I do as to where things are going, but our view is that currency really isn\u2019t impacted by the guidance update that we just gave, so no new news on currency. We like our backlog. I think the teams are doing a nice job of working through conversion. And we saw some of that benefit certainly in the first quarter as we moved more towards some mature markets that came through the revenue line from our recent orders. And so that certainly is helped. But overall not a big impact in guidance for us from what we had previously discussed from currency.", "Jeff Johnson", "Okay. So just I understand that then with the weakness we have seen in the U.S. dollar across so many currencies here over just the past four weeks, six weeks or so, you are essentially not putting any of that in the updated guidance?", "Gary Bischoping", "That\u2019s correct.", "Jeff Johnson", "Okay. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Amit Hazan, Citi. Please proceed with your question.", "Amit Hazan", "Hey, good afternoon. Let me stick with guidance for a second, you just asked about the cash flow guidance maybe that can help explain some of how the P&L changes are flowing through. You are not changing your cash flow guidance, so if the implication there is that the deep and the rate is kind of more of non-cash accounting related or is there some real pull-through here that somehow kind of offset somewhere else?", "Dow Wilson", "Yes. Amit good question and thanks for that. It\u2019s a pretty wide range right, $475 million to $550 million. When you look at trailing 12 months our cash flow, it\u2019s actually about $500 million right now on the trailing 12 months basis, so it\u2019s a pretty wide range. But know the update in guidance in the Q1 results are strong operating margin dollars, right, driven by the top line a little bit of margin rate expansion and some operating leverage. And then from the cash flow perspective as we talked about we saw good conversion from a DSO perspective in the oncology business and PT, the PT business had a good cash flow quarter as well, so kind of hitting all cylinders to deliver that $179 million, but there is no impact from ASC or any accounting changes that you have got running around in the revenue number that we have just guided to, right. We had a separate call just for that conversation and this update is based our performance in the market and the stronger market is head outlined.", "Amit Hazan", "Okay, that\u2019s very clear. And then I want to come back to health because I think that would be one question people ask tomorrow and so maybe a different way is asking the question, if we look at your orders I might get in about 5% of your oncology orders or something right now and I think what you are saying about it being more in budget development at the movement and so forth, but can you just maybe give us a sense of over the next year or 2 years how do you want to characterize it, where it should be as a percent of oncology orders, what you feel about that product if you can just ballpark something for us, so we get an idea of your confidence in it, I know it\u2019s early days but where that might go?", "Dow Wilson", "And I think that number one thing I had pointed too here is our total installed base growth. When you look at what we are trying to do we want to grow sockets, we want to go after those 12,000 incremental sockets that the Lancet report came out with a couple of years go. Clearly, that\u2019s what Halcyon is focused on. Having said that, we introduced two new products last year both that are in the 60 unit range, we feel very good about that. Both are driving installed base growth. We have been very pleased. For us here early on, we are looking at where they are going, so when you look at the 62 orders, first of all it\u2019s almost 20 countries \u2013 19 countries have placed orders, so we like the big broad base. We still have regulatory approvals to go in some key geographies, but we are seeing 60% of those in mature markets. Frankly, I think that will come down the kilovoltage Cone-beam CT will probably have an impact and we will see a little juice there. But I think long-term the big play here is going to be in the emerging market, so 40% here early on have gone into emerging markets. 40% of the 62 are in new sights, so these are folks had not gone radiation therapy before, so that\u2019s 25, 26 customers that are new in the business, that\u2019s huge for us, we can keep that up with the product that will be very significant, growth coming back to where I started grows our installed base gives us new opportunities for upgrade software and service. We also like the competitive trust here, about seven of them have been in competitive sockets and there has been a handful 4 or 5 that were in \u2013 where we wouldn\u2019t have been able to sit and evolve before. So I think we are very comfortable with where this is. We are not as we have kind of said before. We are not guiding on kind of Halcyon units, because its part of the whole portfolio with the family, it is not replacing an existing product, it is a new product on the market. And so that kind of test of what\u2019s incremental for us is really the game here. And we like what we are seeing there and we think in a developed world as we bring Cone-beam CT into the market and then exercise these new \u2013 these new price points in the value markets, we are going to get some more juice. Funnel remains very positive. And so that\u2019s the Halcyon story. And then you have got the HyperArc story to go with it. And HyperArc, we have placed 57 or we have 57 orders placed, that\u2019s very, very good on HyperArc, as I said on that in the text 60% of those are upgrade. People are really liking this product, the upgrade prices around depending on what they order some ins and outs, but it\u2019s about $1 million for the upgrade and north of 2.5 for new systems, but the we are \u2013 we are really liking what we see here on HyperArc.", "Amit Hazan", "Okay. Let me just sneak one quick one in for Gary and on the next quarter I know you guys you don\u2019t guide quarterly, but is there anything you want to tell us from a modeling perspective that this kind of help us keep numbers consistent given the volatility we saw in some of the accounting changes happen with last week changes?", "Gary Bischoping", "Yes. Nothing material, Amit, as we look through kind of the full year, again backlog is strong, the market is better than we thought, but kind of in line with what we expect for the long-term. We have been able to take share in that market. And we saw \u2013 we saw good hardware execution in the quarter. So nothing really new news with regard to Q2 versus where we land in Q1 and our ability to continue to convert that backlog in orders is key focus area and the teams are out there winning business competitively in the field. So in the long-term, we think that turns into that 4% to 7% revenue range that we gave.", "Amit Hazan", "Alright. Thanks very much, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Anthony Petrone, Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.", "Dow Wilson", "Hi, Anthony.", "Gary Bischoping", "You might be on mute Anthony.", "Anthony Petrone", "Sorry about that, can you hear me now?", "Dow Wilson", "We got you.", "Anthony Petrone", "Great. How is everybody doing? Thanks. Maybe just start on installation cycles and a backlog question, I think Gary you mentioned in your prepared comments just I think installations on Edge accelerated, to how much are you seeing a faster installation cycle benefit or come through to that 4% to 7% top line outlook. And then maybe just reconciling the order backlog, it grows orders down a little growth of $3 billion, I think with the accounting change you called out $3.1 billion, so how much of that was just installations coming out as opposed to maybe age outs and cancellations? And then I have a follow-up.", "GaryBischoping", "Yes, so thanks Anthony for the question. So first of all, just in the quarter the way to think about what was a robust revenue growth rate of 13%, is in our oncology business from a hardware perspective, we mix the hardware. And then inside of that we have really saw an acceleration of units that we kind of booked in orders over the last six months, is a higher percentage of our overall book than we had seen in the prior year, even all of last year. And so we attribute that to some good execution in the field, but also just kind of how the order book mixed out into revenue here early in the year. So, can we keep that up, that level of consistency, it\u2019s choppy, it\u2019s choppy out there, that\u2019s part of while we went to annual guidance we are trying to smooth out some of that choppiness that we see in any given quarter. So overall we are happy with execution. We like the book of business that we took on from an orders perspective, it\u2019s 7% in oncology. We think that translates into 4% to 7% kind of revenue growth over the year. As it relates to backlog, that the backlog for oncology is something that it wasn\u2019t impacted by ASC 606 first and foremost, okay, so there is no impact from ASC 606 adoption the backlog at all. We made a change in methodology right that we had talked about on the call and there were no abnormal amounts of dormancy that we saw in the quarter from what we would see normally with regard to a percent of the overall backlog total. So, we are not seeing anything at all to reiterate from ASC 606 in backlog and the overall oncology business backlog increased 10%, sorry, the overall the Varian backlog increased 10% year-on-year and oncology grew 7% year-on-year to $2.7 billion of backlog. So, good backlog growth should translate into that 4% to 7% revenue growth hasn\u2019t moved through the year.", "Anthony Petrone", "Yes. Maybe just a follow-up on revenue rec, just I mean is there any if we are under the prior model, I mean would there have been a notable difference in the revenue guidance or again is this just you are seeing whether it\u2019s better installations or just share gains whatever the case maybe, is that more reflective of the 4% to 7%?", "Dow Wilson", "Yes, just to be really clear right, we held the call earlier in the month and that call was a pure translation of ASC 605 to ASC 606, right. So, this current guidance going from 3% to 5% to 4% to 7% is purely two things in our mind, one is the markets better than we had thought as we exited Q3, right, actually the Q3 was growing about 2% and now we see the market growing 4.5% and two is our execution in that market. So, that\u2019s what\u2019s reflected in the increasing guidance purely our market growth, the overall market growth and our ability to execute in that market nothing to do with ASC 606 adoption.", "Anthony Petrone", "Very clear. And the last two for me real quick would be just a quick update on Siemens, the installed base there haven\u2019t heard about that in a while, just where that is and maybe where those bunkers are going? And then just on the M&A, I think out of the spin from Varex, there was some talk potentially of tuck-in acquisitions, the company\u2019s balance sheet continues to strengthen you are approaching $900 million, it looks like the debt is going to be paid off soon. So, there is room to lever back up, so just an update there? Thanks.", "Dow Wilson", "Yes, in terms of the Siemens installed base, it remains a good opportunity for us. It does continue to ramp down. We like the Halcyon play in that market a lot. So, it\u2019s where we are actually seeing in the Halcyon market with prospects. A lot of these customers that have been hanging on to old stuff are really interested in Halcyon. So, these were smaller systems that were sold. Often, we couldn\u2019t get a big TrueBeam in those vaults. With Halcyon, we got a real play. It is a value market and we see that opening up. I don\u2019t have the exact count for you on the installed base. I would say that it\u2019s come down from where it was 5, 6 years ago, but it is stickier than we thought. I think when we started this thing, it was like 2,200, 2,500 unit installed base and it\u2019s certainly less than that now. But when we kind of look at the whole thing at least for Halcyon as an opportunity that IEA counts about 2,100 cobalt units, there is a whole bunch of tomotherapy units and a whole bunch of Siemens units on top of that that we would kind of view that as the prime target market for Halcyon.", "And then the second part of the question was M&A, in terms of M&A as we have kind of said before, we are looking at extending our footprint in software. So first and foremost is we want to continue drive the organic investment in R&D. Second is really looking at what we can do to enhance kind of this ecosystem for cancer therapy. On the software side, we continue to value things that use radiation and is there a play for synergies with our treatment planning or oncology information system software. And then with that, we can make some other kind of capital allocation decisions as we go, but at least here as we look at the fiscal year we wanted to maintain our fire power and all the flexibility for those kind of plays as we move forward.", "Gary Bischoping", "The only thing I would add with regard to financial flexibility is that, over time, certainly the jobs \u2013 the tax and jobs act will give us some more financial flexibility as we work our way through getting that money to the U.S. and so but that you can\u2019t kind of do that, switch it that takes a few months to actually get the money.", "Anthony Petrone", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Brandon Henry, RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.", "Brandon Henry", "Yes. Thanks for taking my question.", "Dow Wilson", "Hi, Brandon.", "Brandon Henry", "Hi. So, fiscal year \u201818 guidance still assumes kind of wide range in terms of operating margins, can you talk about what your view is the main drivers of operating margin expansion for this year and the various factors that lead you to the top and the bottom end of that range?", "Dow Wilson", "Yes. I think you saw some of that in the current quarter. With that stronger top line we were able to still invest and grow our investment in R&D, but get a little bit of operating leverage out of that, I think it\u2019s 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis in the quarter. And then SG&A leverage right, we continue to invest on the sales side. We like how those investments are returning for example in the software folks in Asia, that makes lot of sense and that we are starting to see early returns from that. So you will see us continue to look to invest right in R&D or organic growth options as well as on the sales line and then get a little more operating leverage out of G&A. So some of what you saw on a year-over-year basis Q1 of \u201818 versus Q1 of \u201817 is what we think we will define the high end of the range and the lower end of the range, we are going to invest. And so we are looking, there is a whole host of organic options. Now we are a pure play cancer treatment company. We are focused on the software side that will also require organic investment. Kind of throttling that as we go through the year would help the final low end of the range.", "Brandon Henry", "Okay. And then separately, the ramp of 360 oncology has gone a bit more slowly than we expected, can you give us an update there and kind of talk about what Varian is doing to accelerate that option of this solution?", "Dow Wilson", "Yes. I know I think we are pleased with the products of getting very good reaction from early customers. I think the market very much wants to see evidence. And so we are kind of very much in the evidence building phase of that product. I think it\u2019s going to take this year to kind of be able to show people both the effectiveness impact as well as the efficiency productivity related impact. We have gotten very good relationships in the UK and with Cone Health, what our folks are working this. We have had other very good luminary orders on the quarter. But I think big impact is going to be after we really got the evidence. In the meantime we are working on increased functionality for broadening the capability of the product, bringing critical decision support, the incremental tumor board functionality and I think we have \u2013 I think we have got the right product. We have also retooled our sales force a little bit to make sure we are calling on the right people. And we are bullish about where it\u2019s going. But I think in full disclosure, we do think it\u2019s going to \u2013 it is an enterprise sale, it is a little more complex sale and I think our real impact is going to be after we kind of get the evidence accumulated and demonstrated to folks.", "Brandon Henry", "Alright. And then just last question for me if I can sneak one more in, can you give us an update on the current balance sheet exposure both on the receivables and loan for proton therapy, so I am just asking, because I remember the Munich, Germany facility I think, went bankrupt last year and is in proceedings right now. And then also if you can provide kind of an update on how the Maryland proton facility, how the uptake is going there? Thanks.", "Gary Bischoping", "Yes. Just from a balance sheet perspective, where I think is about $175 million on the balance sheet in terms of the investments that we have in those \u2013 in the loans related to that. Look, we continue to monitor that MPTC is showing pretty good results relative to the patient volume. They continued to work their way through driving those with multiple initiatives, maybe Dow can help chime in there here in the second, but that\u2019s a key to success. And we have seen very good markets with regard to the municipal bond market, right. The Georgia Proton Center kind of got that started. Delray kind of followed through, we have successful refinancing the CPT Center in San Diego that\u2019s now clinically moved over to a new operator as well. So, we do see strong capital markets for these assets and that combined with kind of steady to slightly rising patient counts should help us move our way through this.", "Dow Wilson", "Yes, I think just on Maryland, they are doing very well. Their patient count is around 100 patients a day. So, they are getting good volumes. They are doing very interesting work. I think the medical staff is very much on board with the program, have an outstanding team and are continuing to drive it forward.", "Brandon Henry", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Tycho Peterson, JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.", "Tycho Peterson", "Hey, thanks.", "Dow Wilson", "Hi, Tycho.", "Tycho Peterson", "Go back to guidance, you are guiding to 4% to 7% after doing 13% this quarter, maybe Gary, can you kind of address the question as to whether there was some pull forward this quarter or whether you are just being a little bit conservative on the rest of the year? And then can you clarify what the organic growth guidance is that there seem to be some confusion on that based on my amounts?", "Gary Bischoping", "Yes. So, I would say, again, we executed pretty well in the quarter. We did see more of a mix shift into mature markets on the hardware side. And as mature markets are shorter duration to get from orders to revenue that certainly helped that revenue growth, whether that continues or not over the rest of the quarter, probably not at that rate that we saw in Q1. As it relates to what\u2019s organic, what we gave is guidance 4% to 7% is organic growth rate, right and so currency, there is some benefit here that we have seen the short-term. We will see if that holds on. You saw a little bit here in Q1, but really what you are staring out there 4% to 7% is our organic growth guidance.", "Tycho Peterson", "Okay. And then I guess for Dow, did you \u2013 new rules around CapEx expensing for tax deductions change anything from your view from a customer perspective in terms of willingness to purchase?", "Dow Wilson", "I mean, I think we could intellectualize it a little bit, but we certainly haven\u2019t seen any change in behavior yet.", "Tycho Peterson", "Okay.", "Dow Wilson", "At least when we look at the funnels, I wouldn\u2019t say we have seen any change in behavior yet, Tycho.", "Tycho Peterson", "Okay. And one last one that\u2019s come up is GE this morning talked on their call I guess the SEC is looking into the revenue recognition around 606 you are one of the other few companies that have changed your numbers? Is there any risk to you guys that SEC could be looking into this for you?", "Gary Bischoping", "We have been transparent with investors and with our disclosure approach. And look, we are not at the SEC, but we are very comfortable with how we have gone through the implementation and in coordination with our accounting teams internally as well as PwC.", "Tycho Peterson", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Isaac Ro, Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.", "Isaac Ro", "Good afternoon, guys. Thank you.", "Dow Wilson", "Hey, Isaac.", "Isaac Ro", "Hey, Dow. First question is on Halcyon, no update on the prepared comments with regard to China, just curious if you still expect June or July approval timeline and if so what\u2019s baked into your expectations there, I am wondering if there is any pent-up demand that you can point to?", "Dow Wilson", "I mean, we have kind of said summer all along. So, I think we have had \u2013 we do have to go through a clinical trial and we are going through that clinical trial. It\u2019s accumulating slowly, but there might be a little bit of risk around that, but it\u2019s not more than that quarterish, but I would say we are still in the second half of the year. In terms of pent-up demand, what we have seen, we have seen a very good China market, double-digit again this quarter. So, we haven\u2019t seen anybody stalling plans. We do know that people are looking at the product and maybe there will be a few out there. So, we are bullish about the market and the play it\u2019s eventually going to have in the market, in part, why we have elected to manufacture it there and certainly excited about the long-term prospects of Halcyon in China.", "Isaac Ro", "Okay, thanks. And then maybe a second question on software, could you give us any color as to the percentage of your software that comes from planning related tools versus other applications? And the reason I ask is I am just trying to take through the path of doubling your software over the next few years for your long-term plan?", "Dow Wilson", "Yes, it\u2019s about 50:50. When you look at \u2013 when you look at treatment planning versus oncology information systems, the business has split about 50-50, so the treatment planning part is the significant portion of the business. The \u2013 we have good products coming out there, we also have exciting new products in our oncology information system, with new analytics capabilities, new informatics capabilities that the software that we are selling as part of a service agreement is growing nicely and remains a big opportunity there. One of the things that I mentioned briefly before in one of the Q&A is historically we have done very little in the oncology information system business in China. And you saw earlier this quarter we announced ARIA Qin, which is a new localized Chinese version of our oncology information system product and we announced this new memorandum of understanding with Ping An to kind of bring that product to those markets. So we are very excited about where China can go and at the same time some of the SG&A investment that you saw this last half has been for incremental sales people in Europe and APAC to go sell these new \u2013 these new software offerings. So we are \u2013 we remain very bullish about the software opportunity.", "Isaac Ro", "Thanks. Last question is for Gary, on the guidance, I just want to reconcile one more time, you guys raised revenue and EPS guidance today, but you didn\u2019t raised cash flow guidance and I am just not clear as to why that\u2019s the case, I am wondering if there is something with working capital that the factors into the guidance for cash flow?", "Gary Bischoping", "Got it, again appreciate the question, but it\u2019s a pretty wide range, like I had mentioned in earlier in the call $475 million to $550 million. We saw a good progress again year-over-year on oncology system\u2019s DSO. We will continue to drive our work through that progress. And then on the inventory front, we think we have opportunity as we go through the rest of the year. So I wouldn\u2019t read anything into that it\u2019s just again a wide range and we thought it was comfortable given the changes we had in revenue.", "DowWilson", "And with the huge increase over 2017.", "Gary Bischoping", "The only thing, I would point to that remember as we grow, we actually chew into working capital, right. So we raised the revenue growth was 3 to 5 to 4 to 7, so as you grow you actually eat working capital. So that\u2019s the other thing you keep in mind here is think about that $475 million to $550 million.", "Isaac Ro", "Okay. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar, Evercore. Please proceed with your question.", "Vijay Kumar", "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the nice quarter. So I had a few questions if maybe I will start with the Q1 revenue it really, really maybe strong, I guess my question is would \u2013 that 13% growth we saw in Q1, would that have still been 13% if this is the own accounting methodology, because there seems to be some confusion on what happened, what drove that 13%?", "Gary Bischoping", "The answer is yes, right. We restated Q1 for ASC 606 of last year and we use the same methodology in this year. So that growth rate is year-over-year, like-for-like with regard to accounting standard.", "Vijay Kumar", "Okay. And then what\u2019s the FX in the quarter, right, was if like couple of percentage points on the revenue so if organic is 11 in Q1 and that 4% to 7% organic that you mentioned for the guidance is that, so do we assume that there is no FX in that 4% to 7% guidance on the revenues?", "Gary Bischoping", "Yes. So in the quarter it was 1.5% impact on our growth rate and again to reiterate that growth we had guided to for the full year that\u2019s organic. And so if currency kind of stays where it is we will then chop that out as we get closer to realizing that.", "Vijay Kumar", "Okay and that\u2019s helpful, Gary. And then on the product side oncology, it was up 20% in 1Q, I can\u2019t remember last time products were up by 20%, right, so maybe some color on what happened, what drove products plus 20% because that implies in a services, which has certainly been stronger, that came in more like mid-singles?", "Gary Bischoping", "Yes. I referenced it a little bit earlier on the call, but it\u2019s growing into more mature markets that have shorter data going time slot going from orders into revenue. And so just for example in Q1 of \u201817 about 25% of our units came from \u2013 came from units that were the prior six months, whereas in Q1 of \u201818 that jumped up to about 35% of units. And so we saw \u2013 we saw an increase in a number of units that are growing into revenue from the prior six months of orders than we had in the prior year. So that\u2019s in large part of that mix of mature markets that we have talked about, but also some good execution by the team.", "Vijay Kumar", "That\u2019s helpful, Gary and that segues me into my next question, so North America, when you say mature, I am sort of thinking its North America, what was North America orders in Q1?", "Gary Bischoping", "North America orders in Q1 in oncology don\u2019t have it at my fingertips.", "DowWilson", "It was up 2%.", "Gary Bischoping", "Yes, 2%, yes, up 2%.", "Vijay Kumar", "Thank you, Dow. And then one last one, just on the quarterly EPS cadence, so if I historically, if I look back, so Q1 was the least and then usually, we have sequential step ups throughout the year, is that, but again when we look at the guidance for this year, just given the revenue strength, some of this quarterly cadence changes can you comment on the quarterly EPS progression?", "Gary Bischoping", "Yes. I am not going to comment on the quarterly EPS progression, we gave our annual guidance, we think $4.24 to $4.36 made sense given how we are operating and given the market we are operating in. As quarters go on, we will see trends kind of play out here, so no comment at this point.", "Vijay Kumar", "Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson, Robert W. Baird & Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Jeff Johnson", "Thank you, guys. I will be quick here and I don\u2019t want to belabor the point, but Gary, I just want to understand you are now guiding constant currency revenue, I have covered you guys I think 10 years, 11 years now and it\u2019s always been reported revenue is what the guidance is, so is this a formal change that we are now any guidance in the future is organic in our currency assumption go on top of that or should we just assume that you\u2019re just being conservative in the 4% to 7% and there is currency upside to that, I just want to know if this is formal from here on out, any \u2013 any revenue guidance you gave us is organic growth guidance? Thank you.", "GaryBischoping", "This is not formal, Jeff. So FX rates are basically the same as we saw at our initial budget, so there is we are not going to breakout currency here specifically, this is not formal though.", "Jeff Johnson", "Okay. And again not to belabor this, but I think the yen or the pound has moved like almost 10%, euro has moved 5%, the yen for 5% here in the last few weeks, so I am just trying to understand your comment that currency has it moved since, you put the budget together?", "GaryBischoping", "It\u2019s that is where it is Jeff at this point from a currency perspective and it\u2019s a guidance as it rolls out is like I said organic, it\u2019s not a formal change. You saw about 150 basis point impact in Q1 and we will see how that plays out over the year.", "Jeff Johnson", "Alright. Thanks guys.", "GaryBischoping", "Sure.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to Dow Wilson, for closing remarks.", "Dow Wilson", "Yes, I am very pleased with our first quarter performance.
