[Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded.", "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Chris Van Ens, Vice President. Thank you Mr. Van Ens, you may begin.", "Chris Van Ens", "Welcome to UDR\u2019s first quarter financial results conference call. Our first quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed yesterday afternoon and posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, ir.udr.com. In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements.", "I would like to note that statements made during this call which are not historical may constitute forward-looking statements.

Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered on the call.", "I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.", "Tom Toomey", "Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon everyone, and welcome to UDR\u2019s first quarter 2017 conference call. On the call with me today are Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Fisher, Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our results; as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe, Harry Alcock and Shawn Johnston, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. My comments today will be brief. UDR\u2019s business performed well in the first quarter. With our diversified portfolio and best in class operating platform continuing to deliver results and enhance our status as a full-cycle investment. The macro and demographic tailwind underpinning our strategic outlook presented in January remain in place and in line with expectations. As I look at the first quarter results, there are three key takeaways investors should be aware of; our continued operational success, the status of our developer capital program, and our path forward. ", "First, operation, in the first quarter, we produced a solid same-store revenue and NOI growth in the 4.5% to 5%. A level we expect again to be near the top of the peer group. Personal tip of the hat to our team in the field for a great execution. Blended lease rate growth in market that comprise 55% of our same-store NOI improved in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, supportive of our view that operations are stabilizing. And for our community and lease up, we continue to see strong leasing velocity and rental rates.", "Next our developer capital program, which includes the participating loan investment in feel Steele Creek and the West Coast development joint venture. This program is a key differentiator for UDR and demonstrates our ability to create value for shareholders and pivot our investment strategy as markets present opportunities. Specific to our option assets as you recall, a couple years ago we identified these types of investments as a good use of capital given their strong risk adjusted returns in conjunction with the value creation potential embedded in their fixed price option. The options provide us with the opportunity potentially by a high-quality new development at a discount to market or sell to third-party and realize upside first cost or employ some combination of buy/sell in effect self funding. As option windows open on the current pipeline of community over the coming quarters and years, we will be sure to keep you informed of our plan and we remain confident that Harry and team will be able to reload our developer capital program in the future given the financial constraints developers are facing today.", "Last, looking at the path ahead. It is still early in the year with prime leasing season just beginning. But we are running slightly ahead of expectations as of quarter-end and we like where our current momentum is trending. Our positive outlook for full-year 2017 is unchanged, which should put us in advantageous position going into 2018. Despite the uncertainties around governmental policies, we remain confident that we have the right portfolio platform and team in place to continue to effectively execute our strategic outlook which will generate strong earnings, NAV and dividend per share growth over the long term.", "With that I will turn it over to Jerry to address our operational success.", "Jerry Davis", "Thanks Tom and good afternoon everyone. We\u2019re pleased to announce another quarter of strong operating results. Year-over-year first quarter same-store revenue and NOI growth were 4.6%and 4.9% respectively. After including our JV communities that satisfy our same-store definition, revenue and NOI growth would have been 4.3% and 4.5% respectively, both relatively similar to our wholly owned results. As our MetLife and KFH joint venture properties represent only about 10% of our total NOI, their influence on all-in same-store growth whether positive or negative is relatively minimal. Our operating strategy during the quarter continue to focus on building and maintaining portfolio level occupancy. As a result, same-store occupancy increased by 50 basis points year-over-year to 96.8%, while annualized turnover declined by 100 basis points.", "Concessions for the first quarter as well as gift cards were flat compared to first quarter of 2016. New lease rate growth of 0.3% incrementally improved each month during the quarter and stabilized versus the fourth quarter of 2016. We expect to see typical seasonal improvement during the spring and summer leasing season. On the renewal front, rate growth remained strong at 4.9% as we continue to see minimal pressure from home purchase and affordability related move outs, which totaled 13% and 7% respectively during the first quarter. Net bad debt remains low and at levels consistent with previous quarters.", "Next, our other income which represents just over 9% of revenue grew 11% or $2 million year-over-year during the first quarter significantly higher than same-store revenue growth. Why does this matter, because the majority of the incremental income came directly from ongoing multi-year revenue generating operating initiatives that were implemented over the past year or two such as the suburban resident parking and package lockers installations. We often ask how we consistently generate strong same-store results and win our markets. Our initiates are a major reason why and will continue to be as we innovate and implement further improvements in the years ahead.", "Onto expenses, expense growth often plays second fiddle to revenue growth. But both contributes meaningful to NOI growth and drive our best in class operating platform. Today, I would like to highlight our success in containing controllable expenses. Controllable expenses include personnel costs, utilities, repairs and maintenance, and administrative and marketing cost. Over the five-year period from 2011 to 2016, our annual same-store expense growth averaged 2.9% versus only 1.0% for controllable expenses. Much of this 190 basis point annual difference is attributable to a multitude of operating efficiency initiatives we have implemented. This includes programs that reduce repairs and maintenance cost of technological solutions and moving the majority of our leasing online. I would like to thank all of our operating associates for continuing the focus on these line items as they create meaningful value over time.", "Onto a brief market update, making up 33% of our same-store NOI in the quarter, strong blended lease rate growth was evident in Dallas, Seattle, Orange County, Los Angeles, Monterey Peninsula and Orlando. While Baltimore, Richmond, San Francisco, Austin and Portland which comprised about 19% of our same-store NOI were challenged. While we have yet to enter the prime leasing season and the first quarter represents a relatively small sample of leases, we are encouraged to see stabilization in New York and San Francisco quarterly new lease growth rates, which combined represent 24% of our same-store NOI. Occupancy averaged 97.1% and 98.0% in San Francisco and New York in the first quarter, up 110 and 70 basis points year over year. Should the prime leasing season come out of the gate strong in these markets we are in an advantageous position to drive great growth.", "Lease rate growth in Washington DC which accounts for nearly 20% of our same-store NOI was a little wider than expected in the first quarter, but reasonable given our occupancy pick up of 110 basis points year-over-year year to 97.0%. We expect leasing to pick up as we head into May and June. Last, Seattle which accounts for 6% of our same store NOI has come on strong as of late. We realized incremental improvement and rate growth in each month during the first quarter and this is continued into April. We continue to believe that Seattle will produce above average results in 2017 despite elevated deliveries in the city proper. Finally, our development lease ups continue to perform well achieving rates in aggregate above original expectations and with leasing velocities generally ahead of the original forecast. The average value creation spread expected on our pipeline is at the top end of our targeted 150 to 200 basis point range.", "Highlighting Pacific City, our 516 home, $342 million development in Huntington Beach briefly, as of April 20, the community was 17% leased, 2% occupied at an average rate per square foot 12% above underwriting expectation despite units and amenities not even being opened in the first quarter. We are very excited about this asset and its prospects in the years ahead. Other community specific quarter-end lease up statistics are available on attachment nine of our supplement. Summing it up, first quarter was another good quarter for the company. We remain focused on maximizing revenue growth and constraining expense growth. Most importantly, we remain highly confident in our ability to execute in 2017.", "With that I'll turn it over to Joe.", "Joe Fisher", "Thanks Jerry, the topics I will cover today include our first quarter results, a transactions update, a balance sheet and capital Markets update, and our second quarter and full-year 2017 guidance. our first quarter earnings results came in at the midpoint of our previously provided guidance. FFO and FFO as adjusted were $0.45 and AFFO was $0.43, all of which were up approximately 5% year over year, driven by solid same-store growth. Next, transactions, as previously reported, in January we closed on our acquisition of CityLine, a 244 home West Coast development joint venture community located in Suburban Seattle. As a refresher, we purchased this community at roughly 10% to 15% discount to market value which equated to a 5.3% cash flow cap rate at the time of acquisition.", "In addition, during the first quarter, we invested 15.5 million into CityLine too, a development project adjacent to CityLine, with our partners in the West Coast development joint venture. CityLine too will contain one 155 homes as they go in valuation of 58.3 million, a fixed price purchase option and will earn a 6.5% preferred return on our investment. As it relates to future options on West Coast development joint venture communities or Steele Creek, current market pricing expectations tilt these towards being a source of capital. Some of the proceeds of which may be reinvested into similar types of value accretive structures within our developer capital program. For an overview of other transactions consummated during the quarter, please see attachment 13 of our 1Q supplement.", "Next balance sheet and capital markets, late in the quarter, we prepaid $98 million of L plus 190 debt, the majority of which was scheduled to mature in 2023, as the spread on this debt was well in excess of current market levels. The prepayment inclusive of 1% penalty was temporarily funded with a commercial paper facility priced at L plus 33 basis points as we continue to evaluate permanent funding options at a lower spread. With regard to our $500 million commercial paper facility, $220 million of debt was outstanding as of the end of the first quarter at a weighted average rate of 1.24%. We are pleased with the pricing we have garnered thus far on this facility. At quarter end, our liquidity as measured by cash and credit facility capacity, net of the commercial paper balance was $920 million. Our financial leverage was 32.9% on an underappreciated book value, 24.7% on enterprise value and 29.5% inclusive of joint ventures. Our net debt to EBITDA was 5.4 times and inclusive of joint ventures was 6.5 times.", "Timing will drive some variability in our quarterly credit metrics, but in total, they are tracking in line with our strategic outlook. I would now like to direct your attention to attachment 15 of our supplement where we have reaffirmed full year and provided second quarter guidance. Our full-year guidance ranges remain at $1.83 to $1.87 for FFO and FFO as adjusted and $1.68 to $1.72 for AFFO. Our full-year same-store guidance is unchanged at revenue growth of 3% to 4% and expense growth of 2.5% to 3.5% and NOI growth of 3.25% to 4.25% with average 2017 forecasted occupancy at 96.7%. As Tom mentioned earlier, we are running slightly ahead of plan thus far, but it is still too early in the year. While we have yet to see how the primary leasing season will unfold, our current read is that it will be difficult to reach the bottom end of our same-store guidance ranges. For the second quarter, our guidance ranges are $0.45 to $0.47 per FFO and FFO as adjusted and $0.41 to $0.43 for AFFO. Finally, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.31 in the first quarter or a $1.24 when annualized representing a yield of approximately 3.4% as of quarter end.", "With that I will open it up for Q&A. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi Group. Please proceed with your question.", "Nick Joseph", "Thanks and appreciate the color of how you're trending relative to expectations. Just wondering from a market perspective at 30 markets that are either outperforming or underperforming materially where you thought they would be at this point in the year. And then if there's any markets where you're seeing concessions increased.", "Jerry Davis", "Hey Nick, this is Jerry, there's a couple of markets that are probably doing a bit better than we would have expected. I\u2019ll tell you San Francisco probably is the first one that comes to mind. We have revenue growth that was comparable to what we reported in the fourth quarter. And as you look at really the trending if you will of new lease rate growth, it was negative I think five in the fourth quarter, it closed to negative one in the first quarter. And right now, through the first 24 days of April, it's positive 2.2%. When I was in San Francisco last week, we're feeling better across all of our sub markets there, we don't have any direct competition currently. So write now, San Francisco feels good and in addition to those rents that picked up, we had also seen in San Francisco about an 80 basis points improvement in occupancy year-over-year. So San Francisco is probably one of the ones. Dallas has performed well through the first quarter even though there is quite a bit a new supply hitting Dallas, most of our portfolio is up in Plano. Plano does not have a ton of new supply directly hitting it right now, but what it does have is about probably 8,000 to 15,000 jobs coming up to that sub market whether it's Toyota, Liberty Mutual, few other companies over the next three to six months. We feel good about that market.", "And then New York obviously when you look at it we put up a 4% revenue growth. We're very pleased with that. I think our team did exceptional work back in the fourth quarter to set us up for this kind of performance. We drove occupancy significantly up to about 98% as we entered the year and because we had such high occupancy, we didn't have to be as aggressive on competing for residents and lowering rate. And that allowed new lease rate growth in New York to be just a negative 0.4 in the first quarter. I would tell you that is one of the only properties that as we go from first quarter into April that shows a worsening of new lease rate growth is that negative 0.4%. And the reason I'm telling you this is I want you to see through the 4% that we reported in the first quarter, we don't expect that to trend for the remainder of the year, a large portion of that 4% again was made up of a pick-up in occupancy year over year that contributed about 70 basis points of the revenue growth. And we also had a good comp for bad debt that helped by about 40 basis points. So New York we still feel is going to come in probably below the bottom end of our full-year guidance. We give our two-year outlook, we state which markets are going to come in where, so we still don't see New York coming in above a 3% right now. But we're very happy with the work our team did in the first quarter there.", "Nick Joseph", "Are there any markets right now that you're seeing concessions increase?", "Jerry Davis", "I don't think they're going up much. New York has continued to be probably in most of the lease up properties they're given away two months in our particular properties. I mean stabilized properties, we saw concessions first quarter versus first quarter of last year remain fairly flat as did gift cards. But again on the lease up side, you're really seeing between four and eight weeks in a variety of markets, New York is probably the most concessionary market along with Austin that we're in and those are both probably pushing close to the two months free. Orange County where there is some new supply hitting in Huntington Beach as well as Irvine. We're only seen a month in those markets. Downtown LA is somewhere between one and two months. San Francisco seems to be fairly stable with lease up, so at about six weeks. And then when you get into Seattle, it's still about a month free there. And then I guess the last one I would close with or last two. Boston is right around a month and in DC it's probably right around a month, most of the new lease there in a either NoMa or the ballpark area.", "Nick Joseph", "And then just in terms of the West Coast JV, you expanded that relationship. Is there an opportunity to further expand that relationship? And then more broadly, are there - are you seeing additional opportunities to monitor Steele Creek or the West Coast JV for these kind of more creative structures.", "Jerry Davis", "Hey Nick, it\u2019s Jerry. It terms of back billing, we did close another Phase II in CityLine and Seattle with Wolff. As you can imagine, we continue to have dialogue with Wolff on other similar deals which may or may not happen. In general in the market, with the reduction in their change in sort of lending guidelines, reduction in proceeds, increase in pricing. This type of opportunity is going to continue to be available for us to build a small piece in the capital stack for developers. So we're continuing to have dialog and will let you know how those play out as the year goes on.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. Please proceed with your question.", "Austin Wurschmidt", "I noticed you guys included blended lease rate detail from last year in the [indiscernible] and it seems like that spread has narrowed in the last couple quarters after peaking out in the third quarter. And so I'm just wondering if you would expect the spread between blended lease rates versus a year ago continue to narrow over the next several quarters?", "Jerry Davis", "Yeah, and this is Jerry. We absolutely do expect that to happen. In fact, when you look at where April is today, it's narrowed from the blend down to about 1.8%. So it is a negative 1.8. So it\u2019s continued to get better. I think in the first quarter it was at negative 2.7 on a blended basis. As we look out, our expectation was you probably get to the point where it actually flips to positive sometime later this year, not sure on the timing at this point, it's really dependent on the continuation of job growth and new lease-ups having rational pricing. But we do see a point of time later this year where we would expect the blend and especially on the new side to be better than it was at same time last year.", "Austin Wurschmidt", "So it's fair to say I think last quarter you said you expected blended lease rate growth of 3% to 4%, you guys put up 2.5 in the first quarter, so that as well should accelerate through the year or I guess the spread between new and renewal lease rate should converge?", "Jerry Davis", "Absolutely, when you look at April for example and this is through the first 24 days. Our new lease rate growth was up to 2.2% compared to the 0.3 that we had for the first quarter and that's normal seasonality that's in play. And we would expect that 2.2 to continue to grow through at least the next four to six months. And then once we get to 4Q, you will have the seasonality kick in and take it back down a bit. Our renewal growth so far in April for the total same-store pool is it 5.3% compared to the 4.9% in the first quarter. You won't see a continuation most likely of renewal growth continuing to rise. Our expectation would be for the next three to six months that it's probably going to be in that five range, maybe high fours, but you should see the new continue to come up and if typical seasonality happens and I'm not saying it will because it definitely didn\u2019t last year, you typically get to a point, call it July and August where new comes fairly close to renewal.", "Austin Wurschmidt", "Could use round out and go ahead and give us occupancy I guess for April and then what you're asking for May on renewals.", "Jerry Davis", "Occupancy today is just under 97% call it 96.95 as a company and what we're sending out for May again is right around that but what we're achieving now is right around that 5 to 5.3 range, non-renewals.", "Austin Wurschmidt", "And then last one from me, you mentioned some starting to see stabilization in San Francisco. And I was wondering if you could just marry the recent slowdown we've seen in job growth across several of the West Coast markets with the demand or traffic that you're seeing across the market and in your property specifically?", "Jerry Davis", "Yeah, traffic has continued to be good in all of the West Coast markets. [indiscernible] right now is probably a bit slower and just a hair weaker than we would have hoped for especially down in Orange County, we're feeling it, I think that's more in the job side than the supply side. LA, where our same-store pool is, out Marina del Rey is doing fine, there's a lot of job growth out there on limited new supply downtown, is very difficult though. San Francisco, I\u2019ll tell you what I heard last week is, you're starting to see a few more - a little more activity from the start ups with some job growth, which is helping to stabilize Silicon Valley. Silicon Valley also this year is expected to have less new supply in most of it is going to hit in the first half, but today it doesn't feel that bad.", "And then the one I did mention it earlier when Nick asked, but the one that\u2019s really come on and I know it\u2019s a concern for a lot of people when we put out our update a few months ago is Seattle. Seattle is very strong today for us. We had new lease rate growth of 0.9% in the first quarter. So far in April it's over 6%. So you seen that market really accelerated throughout the first quarter especially starting in March and then it really jumped up this past month. So, I think Seattle is one that, while you have to keep your eye on new supply specially downtown, most of our portfolio is out in Bellevue, we actually have no same-store properties in Downtown Seattle, but we're pretty encouraged over there. And you're seeing job relocations going out to Bellevue whether it's Salesforce, Amazon, Apple has been looking out there. So we're pretty pumped on the east side.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Drew Babin from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.", "Drew Babin", "A question for Jerry, you mentioned that in San Francisco and New York you are not seeing much direct competition in your property so far this year. Do you anticipate that there will any at any point, any properties kind of delivering as the year goes on that might impact this?", "Jerry Davis", "Yeah, we actually, you know, we've really started looking at how much traffic is going to come out at us within a mile of our properties. And when you look at it you're going to have about 3,500 units that are within a mile of us in New York City. So a lot of that about half of it's going to hit us in the first half, half in the second half, but it's typically at a higher rent and higher price point for example in New York, you've got the Copper Building right next to View 34, but the rest they're asking are quite a bit higher than us and the size of the units it's quite a bit smaller. So while there is supply and we think it will affect us that's probably the most direct, they just started to lease up that property, gosh probably about three or four weeks ago. So we're going to have to see how that one plays out, but it probably won't help us. I think long term it will because it's going to bring more detail. And then in San Francisco, direct supply coming at us within a mile of our location is about 1,500 units this year. The good part about San Jose is most of it is going to deliver in the first half of the year and San Francisco about 40% comes in the first half of the year. So won't feel a little bit and again I just remember on both of those markets about 20% of our units reprice and while we're encouraged with how we\u2019ve done. There's still they can move quickly, but right now from what we're seeing, I probably feel more optimistic on San Francisco and a little more cautious on New York.", "Drew Babin", "And then on the MetLife JV, I was just curious, the year-over-year NOI growth of 60 bps in 1Q, is that sort of a rate that we should model consistently for the rest of year or do you expect that pick up some?", "Jerry Davis", "I think it\u2019s going to pick up some. I think if I remember correctly on the expense side, we have some real estate tax issues that hurt us on the expense side. But when you look at the revenue, which was up 1.7, it's quite a bit below our same-store 4.6 and that one it's probably going to improve somewhat but you do have very high end assets in a couple of sub-markets that are significantly impacted by new supply, whether it's the Upper West side of New York, Downtown Austin, places like that are helping to suppress that. So I think the revenue growth will improve and I think the expense growth will improve, but it's still going to have NOI growth that's less than our same store.", "Drew Babin", "And then finally, with the debt paydown in 1Q, I noticed kind of a proportionate pickup in your expectations for capital markets activity I think including dispositions. If you were to sell more properties, kind of what is that next tranche properties that you may look to sell, whether it would be by market or type of asset anyway which are classified.", "Jerry Davis", "Yeah Drew, just to clarify in terms of the increase in sources, so you're right we did pay down 98 million of secured debt. The increase in sources is not necessarily specifically related to dispositions, it's additional debt issuance dispositions and/or equity. So just to clarify on that and then Harry will take the rest of that in terms of where we'd be looking to sell from.", "Harry Alcock", "This is Harry, as Joe mentioned in this prepared remarks we've got three of these - three of these assets that are coming up for a capital event, one is Steele Creek in Denver, one is [indiscernible] Seattle which is a Wolff portfolio deal and one is property LA in Anaheim which is another Wolff deal. It's conceivable that will be and that source as Joe mentioned so that could potentially increase our sales for the year. In terms of other sales we haven't changed, our expectations for the amount of sales for the balance of the year normally, we sort of changed nor finalized really our other properties we intend to sell for the second half of the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower from Evercore. Please proceed with your question.", "Rich Hightower", "So I wanted to follow up on one of the earlier questions pertaining to the west coast, it doesn't really apply the whole portfolio. Just wondering if you materially any of the direction changed your assumptions on job growth or perhaps the cadence of supply growth and when deliveries happen across the different markets maybe that don't evidently show up in the fact that guidance wasn\u2019t changed.", "Jerry Davis", "Yeah. I don't think it's material. I think one thing we\u2019ve seen is from our third party data providers is a little bit of slippage from 1Q to 2Q on some of the deliveries. So it's a little more back half loaded than front half loaded. When you look at the job growth, we've built our forecast assuming between 150,000 and 200,000 jobs per month. Today, we're at about 180,000 so that seems to be fairly inline. But no, I think other than a little bit of slippage from 1Q to 2Q, that's about it.", "Rich Hightower", "All right. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just a little bit bigger picture question here, I mean as you look at multifamily NOI trend across different cycles, I think that the trough in many cases were lower than where it appears that the industry is going today, I mean, would you say that the industry generally or at least with the market that you guys are invested in, I mean would you say that the glide path is a lot smoother in terms of what the downturn could look like, just given that supply dynamic, that demand dynamic that you're currently forecasting, how do you think about it relative to history?", "Tom Toomey", "Rich, this is Toomey. From a lens perspective of time, I'd say, I've been at it since the 80s and the number one thing that usually kills off our revenue growth is supply. And even in a recessions, the Bs generally hold up in the face of economic downturn. So on the supply picture, what I've seen over the last decade is more transparency on information about individual markets, individual price points, lenders using that data and turning their spigot on and off and shutting off supply pretty darn quickly as well as the Fannie and Freddie shops looking at those same numbers and adjusting their spreads with respect to permanent financing. ", "So I think what's happened is we've finally moved to enough transparency that the threat of oversupply seems to be quickly shut down before it gained so much momentum that we go negative. And there's just recent example in DC, 09-010, it was a market that was, everybody was piling in to build on, it was generating jobs, it got oversupply. It never went negative and that's because they were able to cut it off quick enough on new supply to shut that down. So I would always think about this transparency has probably provided us and taken out a lot of those high volatile years that we've had in the past.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.", "Juan Sanabria", "Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Just a quick question with regards to supply to Rich\u2019s question, you mentioned some slippage from the first to the second quarter, could you give us any color as to what markets those are and does that change anything in terms of the trajectory of the better than expected results to date?", "Joe Fisher", "Yeah. Hey Juan, this is Joe. So just to clarify, first quarter to second quarter is actually first half to second half. So when we\u2019re originally looking at supply coming through this year, we had deliveries penciling in at about, call it 52%, 53% of full year coming in the first half. That's closer to about 46% on the numbers that we're seeing today. So you have seen a shift over to the second half, most of that being due to labor and I would say that the labor issue that we're seeing is really throughout the country. It is not necessarily market specific. So in terms of market specifics, as to where we're seeing that shift take place, there isn't one market that sticks out as being a more first half, more second half in terms of what our original expectations were. So no clear trend there.", "Juan Sanabria", "And just following up on that supply question, we've seen the national kind of permit numbers continue to be up 20 plus percent on a trailing 12-month basis, I mean, how should investors get comfort that supply isn\u2019t going to continue to be pretty elevated, just given the permitting data, is it just a question of just the buildings won\u2019t get built, because it won\u2019t get the financing necessary or how are you guys thinking about that?", "Joe Fisher", "Yeah. I think we've taken a look at it from two different perspectives. There's the quantitative aspect, some of what you alluded to and then the qualitative aspect. So from a quantitative perspective, you're correct that permits have remained stubbornly higher over the last six months. That said when we've gone back and looked at what the typical ratio is of deliveries to permits on a lag basis, it's about 85% and when we overlaid that with the availability of credit, that does oscillate a little bit. ", "So to Harry's comments earlier in terms of seeing credit become more constrained for developers, seeing proceeds come down, seeing cost go up and then difficulty in terms of getting labor in the market, we do think that there's going to be a reduction in that ratio from a historical perspective. The qualitative aspect comes into discussions that we're having with private developers in terms of the amount of sights that they're sitting on today, what their starts were last year versus their starts that they expect this year. That continues to tilt us towards the belief that starts activity will come down and not necessarily mirror the permit activity, but you're correct it has remained high and we're going to continue to keep an eye on it.", "Juan Sanabria", "Great. And just one last question for me. In terms of turnover, you guys have done a great job reducing that and kind of boosting occupancy, any ability to kind of maybe not be quite as conservative and pushing and not pushing rate and letting turnover climb up and driving pricing more aggressively or still kind of too tenuous to do that at this point in time.", "Jerry Davis", "This is Jerry. I guess I\u2019d start with, I think while our turnover come down and our occupancy has gone up, I don't think [indiscernible] I would just ask you as our competitors report just do a comparison. What we've done is create some teams here in our corporate office that have worked very hard over the last year to reach out to residents that have given notice to try to save them frequently, you have to -- you don\u2019t have to give them a reduced rate. Sometimes, you have to come down a little bit, but they've helped drive that turnover rate down more than anything. ", "And I think when you look at it too, when you look at the delta between when a renewal comes in at and a new lease comes in at, over a year, it's probably going to be at least 200 basis points if this year holds true for what's happened over the last five or six years. If you look at the first quarter, the delta was more like 500 basis point. So it's definitely advantageous on the revenue side plus on the NOI and AFFO because you're not having to turn the unit, you're not having to come up with recurring CapEx to save as many residents as you can. ", "And in addition to that, I can tell you we've put much more of a focus over the last two to three years on our customer satisfaction ratings and I think that's helped also. So I think it's a combination of all those things, but again I do not think we're sitting here making the trade of late for occupancy.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Hey, good afternoon. Just two questions. First, Joe, now that you\u2019ve been there for a few months, what are the things that\u2019s interesting about UDR as you guys have some top same-store metrics and yet, your earnings growth is sort of in line with peers? So to that end, do you think that you'll start to combine and just publish one same store metric that includes both the wholly owned and share of JVs, so that way, we get a better sense to a line the same store metrics with earnings growth. Or is there something now that you've been there for a few months that you see that in the P&L or somewhere that\u2019s causing that slippage between same store and earnings growth.", "Jerry Davis", "Thanks, Alex. So in response I guess to the JV, same store and whether or not we\u2019ll do a full pro forma same store, I think the approach that we've taken in the past is that we do not have complete operational control of those joint venture assets. We operate those in conjunction with MetLife. So until we have 100% control of those assets, the intent is not to put them in to same store. Clearly back in attachment 12a, we provide the detail as to what the same store impact is for those specific pools and then Jerry mentioned in his script in terms of what the impact overall is to the portfolio. ", "So I think we're providing quite a bit of transparency on that front. In terms of the translation of same store NOI down to the bottom line, there really hasn't been anything that I can speak to specifically. In the quarter, I think we had a couple of questions as to you guys looked pretty good on the same store rev and NOI line. We ended up at $0.45, in line with the midpoint of what we\u2019ve guided to in first quarter. It was really just due to a couple of things. ", "As you mentioned, the JV piece of the portfolio, Met coming in maybe a little bit below expectations. From a G&A perspective, it ran a little bit heavier than we expected, really just due to timing issues as it relates to payroll taxes and healthcare. And then the other piece probably, just from a development redev and earn-in, we would expect that to ramp throughout the year. So now what we did do very well on the same store side coming to the midpoint of FFO, I think I walked you through the disconnect there.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay. And then on the development side, there is the regulators came down in December 15 to say, hey, thanks to appearing back on multi-family and then we heard recently from speaking to some private developers that it really didn't have an impact until last summer, given deals that were already in the pipeline. Again as one of the earlier questions alluded to or said, we haven't really seen a drop in supply. So for all the talk that we give to banks curtailing construction lending and hasn\u2019t really seem to have an impact, so what do you think is the disconnect there? Do you think that banks aren\u2019t dialing back on their construction lending and therefore that\u2019s why supply hasn\u2019t come down or do you think that is just taking an incredibly long time and therefore now it\u2019s taking a hit where we will start to see supply come down?", "Harry Alcock", "Alex, this is Harry. I'll start and then Joe may want to fill in. He talked about this just a few minutes ago in the last answer that we're still seeing elevated permit activity. Well first of all, the deliveries that we're seeing in \u201918 are projects started at \u201916. So that has -- the sort of current financing environment was not in place two years ago when those assets started. Second as we look forward, while we see elevated permit activity with not just the sort of financing market that has become more difficult, but also these deals are getting a little bit harder to pencil. ", "We have decelerating revenue growth, you have increasing costs, you're just not -- you're simply not going to see as many deals penciled as you would have two or three or four years ago. So all of that leads us to believe that permit activity appears to be high today that the likely number of starts is going to tilt towards the lower end of the range relative to historical levels. So we do expect development pipelines to shrink and starts in 2017 to flow from levels of last two to three years.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.", "Rich Hill", "Hey, guys. Congrats on a good start to the year. Just had a couple of questions, at the outset of the Q&A, there was some discussion about jobs and specifically I think there was an example given how there has been some decent job growth in [indiscernible] which helped drive some of the performance in the Dallas area. Curious how are you thinking about job growth now, obviously I think job growth caught some people off-guard, heading into this time last year. Could you just give us some comments on job growth overall and maybe some markets where you're seeing more job growth more than others? I know you mentioned a couple previously.", "Joe Fisher", "Yeah. Hey, Rich. This is Joe. So I wouldn't say that our expectations or forecast for job growth has materially changed from what we put out when we put out the three year plan a couple of months ago. At that point in time, we were looking for that 150,000 to 200,000 type of range. In terms of the segmentation of that, the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic were going to be a little bit lower. So there's a little bit more de-sell there. Sunbelt, both Southeast and Southwest were expected to be higher, however, I\u2019d say the deceleration there is probably a little bit more on a relative basis than what we've seen, but they're coming off a very high March, meaning the Orlandos, Tampas, Dallass, up in the high threes, low fours, on year-over-year growth. ", "They're coming off of very high levels at this point. So I don't think there's really been a material change in expectations. We continue to be positively biased towards taking place from a tax reform deregulation perspective, but we haven't taken that into our underwriting. We don't see it on the ground necessarily today, but the improved consumer confidence, business confidence, CEO confidence gives us some positive bias towards the future in terms of sustaining job growth.", "Tom Toomey", "Rich, I might add. You've got to stop from a length of time and think that we've gone through eight plus years of kind of a heavy regulatory environment that really if you will, business was retarded and developing and expanding and now you're arriving at, you had an incomplete legislative agenda around taxes, infrastructure and pulling back that regulatory envelope. And so the question you've got to just ask is we did pretty damn good in eight years of good steady growth, and yet, it was done in the face of those challenges, what will the next four plus years hold if you start pulling back some of those type of [Technical Difficulty]. ", "So while the numbers are averaging out right in our range, I'm kind of optimistic, but I do live with kind of a glass half full and believe that when we finally get some legislative action, we'll see some more robust numbers starting to be produced across the entire spectrum, but what matters to us is our markets, our price point of our individual communities and how they interact with that job number. So the global -- overall US number is one thing, the global number is another. But we're really trying to run our business community by community and look at the impact and we feel pretty damn good about it.", "Rich Hill", "Yeah. Of course. And what I was trying to get at really for the most part was what's driving what seems to be some pretty impressive growth in the fourth and the first quarter and what seems to be some optimism, whether it's shops or supply and it seems like jobs are remaining steady and it\u2019s really just the supply coming down, which I think we've all been expecting. Is that fair?", "Joe Fisher", "Yeah. I think that's a good summary.", "Rich Hill", "Good. And then going hand-in-hand with that, I'm just curious, obviously first quarter was good and your commentary seems to be pretty optimistic. What would give you guys the comfort to actually take that formal step and maybe increase guidance. Is it really getting through the spring and summer time and making sure that the strong leasing seasons aren\u2019t back strong.", "Joe Fisher", "Absolutely. In our prepared remarks, we said we had good momentum. We were just looking for a little bit more progress into the prime leasing season to see some traction.", "Rich Hill", "Got it. Helpful. And then one final thing from me. On the lenders side, are you seeing any of alternative lenders, especially finance companies become more active in the multi-family space. I obviously keep hearing about banks crawling back, but I am hearing more and more about alternative lenders getting involved. So I was curious if you're seeing that on the ground.", "Tom Toomey", "This is Toomey. Certainly, we are, Rich. When there is a need there, market price is that opportunity, but what we're finding is that's pricing pretty expensively compared to traditional normal lending patterns. And as a result as Harry alluded to, that's causing everybody to have to repent so their deals and it's scraping some of them off the to-do list and they're not going to get done. But there is capital out there at the price. There always will be. The price is so deep that it's really putting a lid on it and I always expect the markets to work that way.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Neil Malkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.", "Neil Malkin", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. First, Jerry, you talked about the blended spread kind of getting back in line or even possibly above last year's numbers later in the year. I guess, what gives you confidence in that, because the numbers we\u2019re looking at for supply actually, we see it accelerating into the back half of the year and then still remaining elevated in to the first half of next year. So I mean is it, are you thinking deliveries will keep getting pushed off or jobs will start to pick up once more regulatory legislation is enacted. What gives you confidence in that?", "Joe Fisher", "Well, I think it is the expectation that job growth continues to come in at the levels, well, I just think it's naturally going to grow to that level. I don't see people pointing to single family home. But yeah, I think it is predominately what you said. You really just have easy comps as you get to the back half of this year that I think are very beatable and when we look at inflate rates today and the expectation of where we're going to reprice unit the year progresses, it just looks to us like that's the direction it's going.", "Tom Toomey", "Neil, this is Toomey. I\u2019d also add, you have to look at where that aggregate number of supply is coming. It's shifted out of the urban corridors and has moved more predominately to the Sunbelt markets where the number of doors built for the relative cost per home can be expanded, but you're going to see markets like Phoenix, Dallas, Austin, Florida markets start to elevate their supply pictures and that's away from the urban cores that we have a lot of exposure to today. So we're getting talking about the supply picture as it relates to our portfolio and not so much on the aggregates because that\u2019s shifting away from our competitive set.", "Neil Malkin", "Okay. Thanks for the color guys. And then also next would be LA. I know that you guys last year had a large development leasing that was hindering your performance there and I guess the first quarter started off I guess a little bit weaker than I thought, just given that competition. Is that something that\u2019s really going to pick up more in the second half of the year or I guess we\u2019ll see more in the peak leasing season of 2Q and 3Q, how should we kind of look at that?", "Tom Toomey", "Yeah. That\u2019s a good point. You\u2019re right. We did it by competition in play of Vista last year, because most of our portfolio was in Marina Del Rey. It kind of subsided, but when you really look at it, my new lease rate growth in the first quarter was 2.1% in LA compared to 0.3% for the entire company. So it was way above the company average. When you look at the revenue growth, I just remember revenue growth is based on the rate growth you\u2019ve got over the past four quarters as well as any change in occupancy and when I look back to the first, second and third quarter of last year, I was going to head to head against that lease up and I had pretty minimal new and renewal rate growth. ", "So now that that's behind me, you should see an acceleration of new and renewal rate growth and I can tell you, even as I look in the month of April, we're at 2.8% on new compared to 2.1 and my renewal growth in April is 5.6 and it was 4.6 in the first quarter. But you should see as each quarter marches on this year that my year-over-year revenue growth should continue to improve from where it is today.", "Neil Malkin", "Okay, great. I appreciate that. And then I guess last from me is, can you guys quantify the remaining amount of 421a tax abatement burnoff left to go?", "Joe Fisher", "Hey, Neil. This is Joe. So as we footnote on attachment 6, you can see down there at the bottom in the first quarter, we had $233,000 impact on a year-over-year basis. It\u2019s about 130 basis point impact on real estate taxes. Overall, the expense impact around 40 basis points in terms of NOI impact fairly de minimis, I\u2019d call 15 to 20 basis points. For all of 2017, we think the impact is going to be about 1.2 million or 160 basis points of real estate tax increase. If you look at NOI, again it's only about 20 basis points impact for the full year. ", "So fairly de minimis, we continue to provide the disclosure on it just because we get questions on it, but as when we went through the two year outlook, we then provide the guidance on that, given the size and nature of it and so probably don't intend to provide any additional guidance in terms of 18 and beyond at this point, but it is a fairly minimal amount overall.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.", "John Pawlowski", "Thanks. A follow up on the developer capital program. Between preferred equity and participating loans, the total portfolio size and total pipeline size is just under 700 million. Over the next two years, is that number, does the size of that portfolio go down meaningfully stable or trend higher?", "Joe Fisher", "Hey, John. It\u2019s Joe. Developer capital program, we kind of look at it in conjunction with overall capital uses. So there's a couple of constraints that we place on ourselves related to that. One is we and the board take a look at three year capital plans in terms of as worst case scenario, what's going to happen if capital sources drive completely, do we have the ability to fund the committed development pipeline, committed developer capital program and debt maturities. So we have that constraint. ", "In terms of annual usage of capital, we\u2019ve typically talked to $300 million to $400 million per year of development spend. That's what we think we can efficiently raise through free cash flow and dispositions. So we have that constraint as well and then developer capital could basically end up competing with development. Harry\u2019s team takes a look at where they can find the best the best risk adjusted returns and they\u2019ll place the capital there. So it's not a goal of increasing developer capital program, it's really having two different pieces of the business compete with each other. ", "We're going to continue to look for developments going forward, but it does look like that pipeline is going to be reduced slightly over the near term. And then you look at developer capital, we mentioned that we are going to tilt toward sources in terms of the upcoming options that we have. I think you should expect that we're going to continue to look for ways to reinvest that into similar types of structures. So the goal is not to necessarily grow that pipeline to a certain size or to have too much earnings exposure to one piece of the business, but I think that piece of the business today probably is an outsized returns relative to the risk. So it probably grows incrementally over the next couple of quarters.", "John Pawlowski", "Okay. Thanks. And then Harry, it's been about a year or so after you've closed on the Home DC acquisition and I believe you underwrote a 5.2% year one cap rate. Can you give some color on how revenue and expenses have trended on the acquired properties and how actual performance compares as a 5.2% underwritten?", "Jerry Davis", "Yeah, John. This is Jerry. I'll go and answer that. We came in very close to that 5.3, I think we're in a 5.25, 5.3, so it\u2019s right about there. Probably, we\u2019re a bit behind on the revenue, but we were ahead on the expenses. Really we found more efficiency on the operating side.", "John Pawlowski", "Okay. As you\u2019re said the miss or the slight miss on the revenue was market rent growth or just less juice to squeeze on the home properties?", "Jerry Davis", "It was probably a bit on the market rent growth. I don't think it was the juice and the other thing is when you take over a portfolio of that size, you've got to culturally get that entire team to buy into your way of doing things and over that first year, we probably transitioned out 50% to 60% of the associates there. So there was a bit of a churn on the people side. So I would expect you'll continue to see some of the juice come from that deal over the next year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.", "John Kim", "Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow up on the disparity between your owned and JV same store growth. I think Joe alluded to not having full control of the MetLife JV. And I'm just wondering if you actually manage the leasing process differently in the joint venture, for instance on your own assets that you trade wafer occupancy and I\u2019m wondering if you do the same for the MetLife JV?", "Jerry Davis", "Yeah. This is Jerry. We actually manage them very similarly. It's really -- we do get input from our partners on it, but when you look at the occupancy rate on the Met deals versus the whole-owned, they run probably 50 basis points lower than the wholly-owned and when you look at the delta between what occupancy was same time this year versus last year, that is actually up 80 bps year over year compared to 50 bps for the same store. The biggest difference in addition to having some input on whether it's revenue enhancing spend or a few other operational thing, it's really the quality and the location of those assets. ", "Those are A plus deals typically. Very frequently in urban locations that are competing more head to head against new supply and again when I think about where they\u2019re at, it\u2019s downtown LA, it\u2019s downtown Seattle, it's downtown Austin, it\u2019s Upper West Side of New York. So it's really more of a competition versus new supply and it's all a product. When you look at our same store pool, our same store is 50-50 AB, Bs continue to outperform As. It\u2019s compressing, right now but it's still probably 80 basis points. So I would say it's more those factors.", "Joe Fisher", "John, this is Joe. Maybe just one follow-up related to that just to kind of put our same store in perspective because we do get some question on this. Same store overall for us represents about 80% of our total NOI and so we took a look at where we kind of stacked up versus peers and we actually found as of 4Q, the peers on averaged at about 79%. So while we get questions on what's in same store, what's not in same store as well as the MetLife is we do have a same store pool that is very commensurate with the peers at today.", "John Kim", "Thanks. Can you remind us how often your future same store pool?", "Jerry Davis", "We do it quarterly. Property has to have been in the same store or we've got a definition of it in supplement, on page 16 of our supplement, but we do update it quarterly, but the guidance we give is based on the properties that are in the same store pool as of the first quarter of each year. And the only addition to the same store pool throughout the year, so you\u2019ll have a different pool in quarterly metrics versus full year. We have one addition that\u2019s coming in in the second quarter and that is the sixth asset of the home portfolio that we bought.", "John Kim", "Okay. And then can I ask what your official view is on Airbnb. I know how some of your competitors feel about it, but as far as whether or not you encourage within your portfolio.", "Jerry Davis", "We do not encourage it. We attempt to deter it when we find out Airbnb is happening in our properties, we serve the resident notice, it is a lease violation. We feel strongly that the majority of residents want full time renters as their neighbors and they'd like that we do a criminal background check on everybody that lives in our properties.", "John Kim", "Do you have an estimate as to what percentage of your residents use Airbnb?", "Jerry Davis", "No. I mean it's very minimal and again when we find out about it, whether it's from us looking or their neighbors telling them, it's minimal. ", "Operator", "There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back over to Mr. Toomey for closing comments.", "Tom Toomey", "Well, thanks for all of you and your time today and we certainly are happy with our position and our momentum and look forward to seeing many of you in May or in June. Take care.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded, July 30, 2013.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Chris Van Ens. Please go ahead.", "Christopher G. Van Ens", "Thank you for joining us for UDR's Second Quarter Financial Results Conference Call.", "Our second quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed earlier today and posted to our website, www.udr.com. In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements.", "I would like to note that statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met.", "A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in this morning's press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.", "[Operator Instructions] Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered on the call.", "I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to UDR's second quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Tom Herzog, Chief Financial Officer; and Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our results; as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available to answer questions during the Q&A portion of the call.", "I will cover 4 topics today: first, our quarterly performance and recent guidance grade; second, multifamily fundamentals; third, our expanding relationship with MetLife; and lastly, the continued execution of our 3-year strategic plan.", "The second quarter was strong across all aspects of our business. Both earnings per share and operations outperformed versus our expectations, as well as we completed a number of transactions and finances. As a result, we raised earnings per share and same-store guidance into late June. Herzog and Jerry will provide more details on their prepared remarks on the quarter and the recent guidance increase. All in, we were very pleased with the first half of 2013 and the way it played out and look forward to more of the same for the balance of 2013.", "Nationally, multifamily fundamentals remain healthy. Demand continues to be driven by improving employment and positive demographics. New multifamily supply have increased from the trough as expected, but permitting trends now appear to be leveling off. In the vast majority of UDR's markets, demand and supply dynamics appear favorable, with 21 of our 23 markets expected to create at least 5 jobs for every new apartment home over the next 3 years.", "The national single-family market has also improved from its recessionary lows, albeit with some support from institutional investors. UDR's markets remain more sheltered than most from this improvement given the relative unaffordability and higher-propensity rent. In our coastal markets, the recent increase in interest rates in conjunction with the rising single-family home prices has significantly increased down payment requirements and monthly mortgage payments. As a result, our move-out to home purchases remain favorable at 13.4% in the quarter, still well below UDR's 15% long-term average.", "Given the recent rise in interest rates, numerous market participants have asked us how the potential future increases might impact apartment values. First, there remains significant investor interest in multifamily space, especially on the coast for high-quality assets. NOI continues to grow at an above-average rate, both good signs for near-term stability and valuations. Offsetting this, in part, is the recent rise in interest rates, which could negatively impact cap rates. Higher quality urban assets are less likely to be affected, but there have not been enough trades to form a definitive conclusion.", "Under the assumption that any further increase in interest rates is driven by a strengthening economy, apartment cash flows and related values prove resilient over the long term and fare better than most of the property sectors given: A, their short-term lease duration; and B, the related impact of homeownership cost increases.", "So does the evolving interest rate landscape change our capital deployment strategy? The short answer is no. We anticipated that rates would increase in our 3-year plan, and we continue to see good opportunities in our targeted submarkets and above-average profit margins for development and redevelopment. Should this change, we will revisit our strategy.", "Next, a few comments on our expanding relationship with MetLife. In late June, we announced 2 separate transactions. First, the formation of an operating development partnership for a significant portion of our Vitruvian Park master plan communities located in North Dallas. And second, a swapping of ownership interest in certain UDR/MetLife I JV assets that increased our ownership to 50% in 2 high-quality, high-rise communities located in Denver and San Diego.", "We are excited to be expanding our relationship with MetLife. They're a partner we are very familiar with, and they are committed to the multifamily space and can co-invest in all aspects of the apartment business.", "Finally, an update on our 3-year strategic plan. Feedback from market participants continues to be universally positive. Now 2 quarters in, operating and cash flow growth are ahead of plan, and we continue to expect significant growth and value accretion from our development and redevelopment platforms.", "Herzog and Jerry will provide you with more details on these transactions and activities in their prepared remarks. Our team remains highly focused on executing the 3-year strategic plan, which we continue to believe will drive strong NAV and cash flow per share growth in the future", "With that, I will pass the call over to Tom Herzog.", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Thanks, Tom. There are a number of topics I will cover today. First, our second quarter results; second, a balance sheet update; third, an overview of our recently announced transactions with MetLife; fourth, an update on insurance recoveries from Hurricane Sandy; fifth, a reiteration of how we look at development yields; and lastly, our third quarter and full year 2013 guidance. I'll begin with our second quarter results.", "FFO per share was $0.37. After deducting a $0.01 benefit from Hurricane Sandy insurance recoveries and taking into account the effects of rounding, FFO as adjusted per share was $0.35. The $0.01 of upside versus the midpoint of our previous FFO as adjusted guidance was primarily driven from better-than-expected same-store and non-same-store operations. Second quarter AFFO per share was $0.31 and benefited from a lower amount of CapEx spend anticipated during the quarter, which again was due to timing. We continue to target $1,020 in maintenance CapEx per home in 2013.", "Turning now to the balance sheet. At quarter end, our financial leverage on a historical cost basis was 39%. On a fair value basis, it was 29%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 6.9x following the recent closing of the Vitruvian Park transaction with MetLife. And we anticipate that it will remain near this level through year-end 2013 as non-income earning assets come online. As of the end of the second quarter, we had no remaining outstanding debt maturities in 2013.", "Our improving balance sheet has not gone unnoticed. Recently, Moody's affirmed the company's credit rating of Baa2 and changed its outlook from stable to positive. We ended the quarter with $769 million of available liquidity through a combination of cash and undrawn capacity on our credit facilities.", "Next, as Tom highlighted in his opening remarks, in late June, we announced 2 separate transactions with MetLife. The Vitruvian Park transaction included the formation of an operating partnership, which comprises of Savoye, Savoye II and Fiori communities, and a development partnership made up of 28.4 acres of land in the Vitruvian master plan. The operating partnership transacted at a weighted average NOI cap rate of approximately 5% and total transaction proceeds of approximately $200 million. Note that the 997 legacy Vitruvian Park homes, 13 million of its developable land and the freestanding commercial real estate on the site were not included in the partnership transaction.", "The second MetLife transaction involved exchange of ownership interest in certain UDR/MetLife I joint venture communities. We increased our ownership interest in 2 high-rise -- 2 high-quality high-rises located in Denver and San Diego from 15% to 50%. Both of which are in underallocated core markets. Now we relinquished our 10% ownership interest in 4 communities. Further details for both MetLife transactions are available on our second quarter earnings release filed this morning and in the transaction press release filed on June 25.", "Moving on, an update on our insurance recoveries from Hurricane Sandy. Our original damage estimate of $28 million to $32 million remains intact. To date, we have recovered $20 million of the $24 million we have submitted for hurricane damages and business interruption losses.", "Next, we expect to deliver approximately 39% of our development pipeline in the second half of 2013.", "As we have had a few questions on how we calculate stabilized yields on development, I wanted to take a moment to explain the computation. Expected stabilized yields on development are calculated as: projected stabilized NOI, including the charge for management fees, divided by construction cost. The stabilization period for development projects is defined as: the full 12-month NOI commencing 1 year following the delivery of the final home of the project.", "You may note that these definitions in Attachment 16 of our supplement have been enhanced but for clarification purposes only. The way in which we calculate such estimated yields remains unchanged. On a trended basis, the weighted average yield for our pipeline continues to be in the range of 6% to 6.5%.", "On to 2013 guidance. In our release this morning, we increased our full year FFO per share guidance for $1.40 to $1.44 from a previous $1.39 to $1.43, so it reflects a $0.01 benefit from recently received Hurricane Sandy insurance recoveries in excess of previously established receivables. As a reminder, we previously increased full year FFO per share, FFO as adjusted per share, AFFO per share and same-store guidance at the same time as our announcement of the MetLife transactions in late June. Our full year FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance estimates remain unchanged from our June increase, at $1.36 to $1.40 and $1.20 to $1.24, respectively. Our same-store guidance also remains unchanged from our June update with full year revenue expected to go at 4.5% to 5%, expenses at 2.75% to 3.25% and NOI at 5.25% to 6%. Other changes to various guidance assumptions can be found on Attachment 15 or Page 27 of our supplement.", "For the third quarter of 2013, we are providing guidance for both FFO and FFO as adjusted of $0.33 to $0.35 per share. AFFO guidance is $0.28 to $0.30 per share. Lastly, during the quarter, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.235 per share or $0.94 when annualized, our 163rd consecutive quarterly common dividend paid.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Jerry.", "Jerry A. Davis", "Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks, I'll cover the following topics: second quarter operating results; I will also provide an update on our development lease-ups and redevelopment projects.", "We are pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. In the second quarter, same-store net operating income grew 6.8%, driven by a 5.2% year-over-year increase in revenue against a 1.6% increase in expenses. Real estate tax increases of almost 9% were offset by a reduction in repairs and maintenance expense, as well as lower marketing costs. Same-store revenue per occupied home increased by 5% year-over-year to $1,472 per month, while same-store occupancy of 96.1% was 20 basis points higher year-over-year. On a total portfolio basis, including our pro rata share of joint ventures, our revenue per occupied home was $1,602 per month. Sequentially, second quarter net operating income increased by 2.7%, representing typical seasonality. This was driven by a 2% increase in revenue against expense growth of 40 basis points.", "Turning to new and renewal lease rates. In the second quarter, effective rental rate increases on new leases at our same-store communities increased by 4.3% on average, and renewal rate growth remains strong at 5.4%. Specifically in New York, our communities that were impacted by Hurricane Sandy are fully back on track.", "Annualized turnover in the second quarter decreased by 230 basis points year-over-year to 55.4%. I'll remind everyone that turnover is highly seasonal and peaks in the second and third quarters during the spring and summer leasing seasons. Rent as a percentage of our tenants' income held steady at roughly 17%, similar to where it has been over the past several -- past few years.", "Next, our development and redevelopment programs, along with our same-store will drive our anticipated cash flow growth over the coming years. During the quarter, we've spent $133 million on development and redevelopment projects. I am pleased to report that our development lease-ups remain on plan and our redevelopments continue to command the rental rate increases we anticipated.", "Some lease-up specifics. Our recently completed 255-home, $126 million Capitol View on 14th community in Washington, D.C., is currently 91% leased and 90% occupied. The project is on schedule, on budget and leasing up on plan. Until the past month or so, we had experienced negligible impact from impending new supply in the U Street Corridor of D.C. However, competing product did begin to pre-lease during the quarter.", "As Herzog indicated in his prepared remarks, Fiori at Vitruvian Park is now owned 50-50 in a partnership with MetLife. This 391-unit, $98 million project in North Dallas is currently 27% leased and 17% occupied.", "Our 467-home, $150 million residences at Bella Terra development in Huntington Beach, California, is currently 50% leased and 31% occupied. The project is on budget, on schedule and leasing up well ahead of plan. To date, we have not had to offer any concessions on any of the leases.", "Lastly, our 256-home, $65 million Domain College Park development, located across the street from the University of Maryland's business school, is currently 39% leased and 13% occupied. The project is on schedule, on budget and leasing up on plan.", "Turning to our redevelopments. First, a recently completed 583-home, $36 million Westerly on Lincoln redevelopment in Marina del Rey, California. The renovated homes at this project averaged a 20% rental rate increase over pre-renovation rent over the life of the property, and demand remains strong for our upgrades. Currently, the property is 98% leased and 96% physically occupied.", "Second, our 706-home, $60 million Rivergate redevelopment in Manhattan. As of quarter end, we have completed the redevelopment of 288 homes. On these homes, we have averaged a 13% rental rate increase. The property is currently 95% leased and 93% occupied.", "Lastly, our 964-home, $75 million, 27 Seventy Five Mesa Verde redevelopment is in Costa Mesa, California. As of quarter end, we have completed the redevelopment of 356 homes and we'd also built a 12,000-square-foot amenity building and a resort-style pool. On these homes, we have averaged a 25% rental rate increase. For those of you that have toured 27 Seventy Five, you understand that it's truly a transformational project.", "With that, I'll open up the call to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Jerry, I was wondering if you can follow-up on the expenses in the quarter and particularly we saw a pretty good decrease in R&M. I was curious if that was just kind of led to timing of items last year or if you're starting to see some of your technology initiatives take hold?", "Jerry A. Davis", "It's really a little of both. A little bit's timing from last year, but most of it is the technology and other initiatives we've been doing to make our service teams more efficient in the way they do their business. And by making them more efficient, they're then able to bring more of the third-party services that we've historically vended out in-house. Those include automation, we've given all of our service guys a handheld device now that they can receive service requests without having to come into the office. And secondly, they're able to do their timekeeping online instead of having to walk all the way back to the office to punch in and out for breaks and for lunch. Lastly, I would tell you we've really started managing our people to labor standards, comparing different people, telling them what the expectation is of how long each task should take and that's helped make them more efficient, too. So it's predominantly that.", "Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And just turning over to San Diego, you had some very impressive rent growth in the quarter there. I was just wondering if you're finally starting to see those job gains help apartment demand or is something else is going on during the quarter?", "Jerry A. Davis", "I think San Diego is picking up a bit, but our numbers are really inflated. We only have 2 properties on our same-store pool there, it's only about 300 units. But one of the properties on Oceanside is -- it has a tax-exempt bond that expired about 1.5 year on it. You have to wait 1 year after that to increase the rent on the 20% of the residents that really benefited from below-market rate units. So after we waited that 1-year period really to bring those 20% up to market, that's probably driven the outsize growth a little bit more than improvement in the market. But the market has...", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup.", "Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "What are you seeing in terms all-in rates for unsecured debt and how has that changed over the past few months with the increasing rates?", "Warren L. Troupe", "Nick, this is Warren. I think our all-in rates on our -- on the tenure, we're looking right about kind of a 4.2% to 4.4% range. Spreads have tightened a little bit. We're in the 160 to -- 150 to 160 range, and obviously the tenure has gone up and down over the last month or so.", "Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then, I guess a bigger-picture question. How do you balance the attractiveness of JV capital against the additional complexities associated with the partnerships?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Well, I mean, when we think about joint venture capital, there are a variety of different benefits. For one, at times it could be trading at a price that's different from your NAV. And that provides an opportunity for bringing in funds at a cost-effective rate. Another is, it gives you the opportunity to tackle bigger deals by bringing -- and I'm assuming you're talking specifically about us, the deals that we did with MetLife. And with them we've got a long-term investor that is interested in multifamily. They like development. We have a long history with them. They prefer lower leverage. From our perspective, it also provides a good source of fees. So as I think about the size of the program and at what point it becomes too big, certainly, at a $500-or-so million equity investment in JVs, and call that $1 billion or so of real estate, against the $13 billion asset base for the company, we think it's still relatively very much in line and not too large at all. We consider it a net plus.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald.", "David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "I just have a couple of general questions. Tom, in particular when you talk about the focus on urban concentrations I kind of understand the -- why they're compelling from a rank-growth perspective and sort of a -- in a kind of defensive positioning. Do you grow concerned that at some point there can be a liability on the urban locations relative to move-out rates because of the particulars of demographics you're targeting?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "It's a fair question. I guess, time will yield an answer that we can look back on. Our view would be is that the urban setting, if you look at most demographic studies, this is where that 20- to 35-year-old age cohort is moving to the secured jobs and be around that lifestyle that they want. And I suspect that they're going to be renters for a longer period of time in that urban setting. If you specifically look at our market mix, you can see we've diversified across both coasts on an urban platform, if you will; trying to insulate against economic's ups and downs, but focusing on submarkets with a higher propensity to rent and a higher income bracket. We think that combination of characteristics over the long term will enable us to grow cash flow, grow NAV and deliver better returns that are available in the marketplace or what would be available in a boom-bust-type portfolio in a suburban setting.", "David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Given that focus, and I know you -- this has been a particular strategy for the company for some time, do you guys experiment at all with adding services to those particular sites where you have that target demographic and concentration? Outside of the sort of standard cable and whatnot, is there a way to sort of package a real sort of secondary fee stream for these tenants given the preferences of that demographic?", "Jerry A. Davis", "Yes, David, this is Jerry. We've looked a little bit into that. Most of these properties will have concierge-type services, a doorman, at several of the properties especially the ones we have in the MetLife joint venture. We have valet parking services. We have started to experiment a bit with offering other types of concierge-type services to better accommodate our resident base and really sell them time that we can do some of their personal errands for them. We're really in the beginning stages of that. But we are finding with that higher-end demographic, probably not some of those urban guys that are more working class, but at the higher end, I think they do value their time and have excess funds and they would appreciate that. So we are looking into it.", "David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then my last question, and I apologize if I missed this, but did you guys talk about the specifics to the Texas market today? Seems to be growing concerns about supply. Some of the numbers look a little softer on a year-over-year basis. What are your views on the Texas markets for the next 6 to 12 months?", "Jerry A. Davis", "Well, this is Jerry again. Texas right now is holding up. It decelerated slightly from 1Q to 2Q. We operate in Dallas, both in up to North Dallas, Plano, as well as Addison and in uptown. And right now, supply is becoming an issue especially in uptown, a little bit up north, but job growth to date has been able to offset it. As we look over the next couple of years, we do anticipate job growth of at least 5:1 to new developments. So it probably won't be able to sustain the 7% to 10% year-over-year [indiscernible] in the last year or 2, but I still think it's going to be strong. I don't see it getting overbuilt. I think Austin, you're also seeing very high job growth, especially in the tech sectors. Apple's doubling their workforce, Samsung has built a $4 billion plant expansion there. There is a lot of new supply, as everybody knows, coming into Austin. Most of our properties are in the direct line of it. When you really go tour that downtown area, a lot of it is -- a lot of the new supplies coming up down on the South Lamar Street corridor. But when you're downtown, where our joint venture with MetLife at Ashton Austin is. We probably have the nicest product in town and we're not seeing a lot of competition there. And our other product in Dallas is more the B, B+ grade, and we're not competing directly with the new product.", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Yes, it's Tom Toomey. I might add that just -- I think it's your typical cycle in Texas, which is you've got a very good run up in rents. There was not much supply. And what's happened recently is move-out of homeownership is going to kick in a little bit and supply. But for us, in our view in the long-term basis, Dallas and Austin are both great cities for job machines. There is where the economy is going to continue to prosper across many different employment basis. And so I think it's still a very good long-term market. It's just going through one of those minor adjustment periods and we'll probably see a good '14 out of it, too.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.", "Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research", "While we're on Texas, can you remind us when does the window for the debt repayment on the Texas JV open up? And what's the current thinking about what you guys are going to do with that?", "Warren L. Troupe", "This is Warren. The window, it opens in December 2014. I think we would discuss that with our partner both [indiscernible].", "Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then, Tom. What's the thought on the development pipeline now in terms of new starts? I mean, you're sitting here the 6, 6.5 yield on the current pipeline. When you take a look at the next projects in the queue, where are the -- given rising construction costs and financing costs, et cetera, where's the return sort of penciling out if you guys wanted to start those today? And what do you think you're starting between now and the end of the year?", "Harry G. Alcock", "Rob, this is Harry. We don't expect any additional starts in 2013. And if you look on Attachment 11, you can see that we have several land sites in our portfolio, both wholly-owned and in MetLife, many of which will be used to backdoor existing pipeline. We're actively working for the design and approval processes and would expect to start number of new projects in 2014. But remember costs are rising, but rents are also rising. We won't start a project unless we achieve a meaningful spread over market cap rates, at least 100 basis points on an untrended basis. So it's really -- it's asset-specific. The -- and the spread between the expected yield versus the expected market cap rate is something we look at closely. Today's spreads are relatively high. We think we have a little bit of cushion, but we will underwrite each of these assets before we start construction.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Just a few quick questions here. First, and maybe I'm just not really good at math and maybe I'm just missing a few things, but if you -- if we look at the MetLife JV, its $290 million is gross. And it looks like if you stabilize the -- forgive my pronunciation, Fiori deal? It looks like there's about $8.6 million of NOI coming off of that on an annualized basis, which would imply sort of a 3 cap. But if we used the 5 cap that's cited, that says that the development portion of that JV was valued at about $120 million. So $172 million for the 3 assets and $120 million for the development. Can you just walk through like what I may be missing in these calculations, or is that, in fact, the right way to look at it?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "This is Herzog. Alex, your math -- there are a lot of numbers flying around there. But I do get your point, is that you're looking at what the cap rate was in the MetLife I transaction when we completed it and what does it look like today based on some of the transactions that are taking place. I guess I would describe it this way. The transactions that have been taking place have been swapped transactions, so that we and our MetLife partner could both increase our ownership and assets that fit our individual portfolio needs. And it really -- the whole transaction was more than a collection of assets. It really involved more the relationship, the options that were in place, development potential, et cetera. So as we look at the overall transaction, there's a lot more going on than just that. But as to the specific detail of what you're looking at on the cap rate, I'd have to look at the detail to see what you're referencing.", "Warren L. Troupe", "This is Warren. I think when you look at that deal, that deal was structured as a portfolio trade rather than disposition of individual assets. And they have their own specific allocation requirements and we are pretty much ambivalent. So when we look at it, it was just a $290 million trade.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Right, but you guys cited a 5 cap. So I'm just curious, the 5 cap would imply the part of the Vitruvian, those 3 assets, were value at $172 million. I just want to make sure, is that math right or am I missing something?", "Harry G. Alcock", "Alex, this is Harry. I'd have to look at your math, but Fiori is still a lease up. So my guess is you're looking in a non-stabilized revenue stream with a -- and applying a cap rate to that. If you apply a stabilized NOI to Fiori you'll get a number that's meaningfully higher than that.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. We can go offline. I was using a stabilized, but we can go offline. The second thing is just looking at the back half of the guidance, you guys have done 6.4% year-to-date, but your full year NOI guidance is 5% to 6%. So where in the portfolio are you expecting more of the slowdown that's going to bring the NOI down for the back half the year?", "Jerry A. Davis", "Yes. I'll take that, Alex, this is Jerry. Really let's look at it in 2 pieces. First, revenue. Through the first half the year, we've had results of 5.2% growth. So to get to the midpoint -- or the high point of our guidance, which is 5%, that means the second half would need to come in at about 4.8%. I can tell you based on what we're seeing today, what we expect to see the rest of the year, we're comfortable with that guidance. Our expectation is revenue will be near the high end. When you look at the expense side, year-to-date through June, we're at 2.6%. And to get to the midpoint of 3%, we need to average 3.4% in the second half of the year. I'd say we have 2 factors that could get us there. One, real estate taxes continue to be somewhat of an unknown. We've gotten valuations in on about half of our portfolio, but we still don't have them in for California or Florida, which make up 40% to 50%. And the second is we had a pretty favorable -- difficult comps in the second half of last year to compare to. So when you really see what could drive it, the biggest unknown right now is still real estate taxes.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "But isn't -- California is Prop 13, so why would the real estate tax be unknown?", "Jerry A. Davis", "It is Prop 13 but there's still the potential that some of our Prop 8 adjustments that we had in prior years haven't totally been factored in.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. So if I heard you correctly, the downside to NOI in the back half is more expense related not revenue related?", "Jerry A. Davis", "Yes, I think so.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.", "Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Just given that we're halfway through the year, can you give us an update on where you stand with the remaining dispositions in your guidance?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Yes, we've got about $100 million of dispositions remaining. So that's where we're at in the second half. We have the $145 million or so with the Tribune [ph] transaction and then there's another $100 million on top of that.", "Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Are those actively being marketed or...", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Yes, we're in progress on a number of fronts and feel good about that number.", "Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "So that would be like a fourth quarter closing and kind of expected?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Yes, that's probably either late third or probably early fourth quarter.", "Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then my second question for Jerry, did you give July leasing trends? And also in previous calls you've given a loss -- a gain or loss lease statistic. Can you give us where that is for the portfolio? And then curious where the D.C. market is on that?", "Jerry A. Davis", "Yes, I can give you parts of that. I'll probably get the D.C. part later, I don't have that with me but in a follow-up, I'll give you that offline. Loss to lease as of the end of the quarter was about 4% for the portfolio. And as far as leasing trends through today, for the month of July, new leases are up about 4.3% to 4.4%. Reno [ph] was up probably right at that 5%, 6% level. And as of today, our physical occupancy in the same-store portfolio is 96.3%.", "Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Just a follow-up to that, if I may. Also on the guidance, if you look at the run rate for the first half of the year in G&A versus the back half, seems like there's a pretty substantial increase in G&A in the back half of the year. Could you talk about what's going to drive that?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Yes, there were a couple of different things, Mike. Part of it is just timing items such as personnel, health care, legal costs, costs associated with software development, et cetera. And the other part of it is due to timing on incentive comp-type programs, just based on the way that the accounting works. Because the program was set up in February, there's no expense in the first month, for instance. And then certain components of it will be more heavily loaded in the second half of the year. So from a G&A perspective, it's still relatively just timing.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "So, Jerry, I guess just a quick follow-up question on expenses. Can you talk about the 9% year-over-year real estate tax growth? How did that compare expectations? And where do you see the most pressure across your portfolio for conversations that are underway today outside of -- was it California and Florida?", "Jerry A. Davis", "It's roughly at expectations. We were right up around that 9% level in our budgets this year, so no huge changes yet. But like I said, we still haven't heard about California and Florida. I think Florida probably is where most of the conversation will come. We've already talked to Texas, Virginia, places like that. But I think most of it's going to come in Florida.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "All right. And another one for Warren or Tom. On the new MetLife Vitruvian JV, the one with the Savoye and Fiori assets, can you discuss generally the nature and scope of fees from the JV? And also the long-term return required to hit and to promote there?", "Warren L. Troupe", "Yes, Haendel, this is Warren. In terms of the fees, it's structured pretty much like our existing one on MetLife II. There's a property management fee, there's a financing fee or pretty much market. As we do development, there will be development asset management fees. In terms of promote, there's not a promote structure in that. It's a 50-50 JV.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Great. And one more related to that. Can you discuss timing early thoughts for the other -- in the press release, the other 2,500 homes and 50,000 square feet of retails you plan to build out?", "Warren L. Troupe", "I'll start and let Harry really address that. We're in active discussions right now with MetLife over the future development of Vitruvian. And I will tell you they're very excited about developing that and making our master plan come fruition.", "Harry G. Alcock", "Yes. Haendel, this is Harry. In addition to talking to MetLife, we are beginning the design and planning process for the next phase. When that comes to fruition, I don't know. It'll be our first development deal with Met, so we're sort of testing each other out a little bit as we work through the planning process.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of David Bragg with Green Street Advisors.", "David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "So just comparing your guidance for the year to the 3-year plan that you had laid out. It appears as though with the stock trading at a discounted NAV, you've been able to remove your equity needs for 2013, and in doing so, have increased dispositions, cut back a little bit on development spending and redev spending. If the discount persists into 2014 and '15, is this the playbook that we should look for you to follow in terms of a deviation from the 3-year plan?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "As far as the adjustment to the guidance as a result of the Vitruvian transaction, we did bring enough cash to remove the equity issuance that we had previously included. If our price went back up above NAV, we still could raise some of that equity. As far as cutting the development or redevelopment though, that had nothing to do with the current conditions. That's just been the timing of the spend that we've had within the programs. So as I look forward into 2014 and 2015, there's really nothing that's changed in our plan relative to the Vitruvian or market conditions at this point.", "David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Right. But, Tom, if you go through 2014 and '15 and the stock's at a discount over that time frame, looking at the, I think, would be $350 million to $450 million of equity issuance in your 3-year plan, what are the levers -- could you just talk through the levers that you'd pull to offset that?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Well, one of the big ones is we still have about $400 million of non-core assets that could be utilized to create some funding. We have some warehouse assets of a much larger size that could be utilized, that we're in no hurry to liquidate, but that stands as a possibility. So again, as we look forward, we've got a number of different sources of funding that could be brought in. Equity, it could be debt, it could be joint ventures, and of course, the sales of noncore-type assets. So -- and on top of that, we've got, not that we would intend to use it, but in a shorter term, we still do have a sizable amount of capacity on our revolver. So there's a lot of different funding that we could use as we go forward.", "Operator", "Thank you. I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. Please continue with any closing comments.", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Well, thank you, all of you for taking the time this morning or this afternoon. And certainly, we feel good about the business, feel good about our 3-year strategic plan and the execution of it. And we're seeing good, strong fundamentals in the business. And we see that continuing for some long period of time and are enjoying the benefits of it, and you'll see us continue to focus on execution. And with that, we'll see you shortly.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference for today.

Baird & Co.", "Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets", "Operator", "Good morning ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the UDR Investors' Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Conference call is being recorded today, Wednesday January 30, 2008.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Larry Thede, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.", "Larry D. Thede - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us for today's conference call. We will cover our fourth quarter financial results and discuss yesterday's announcement that we have entered into a contract to sell 25,684 apartment homes for $1.7 billion.", "The press releases, the supplemental financial disclosure package, and a set of PowerPoint slides were distributed yesterday afternoon, and are available on our website, at www.udr.com. For the PowerPoint slides, which we will review during this call, click on the Corporate tab on the upper right of the page which will then take you to the page with the links for those slides. The link is labeled 1.7 Billion Portfolio Sale Supplemental Materials.", "In the fourth quarter supplement we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements.", "We'll begin the call with comments from management and then open the call to your questions.", "I would like to note that the statements made during the call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those implied in forward-looking statements is detailed in yesterday's press releases and are included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.", "Let me now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Larry, and again welcome to this call. Joining me on the call today is Mark Wallis, Mike Ernst and Jerry Davis.", "I have some prepared remarks and then we'll open up the call to questions-and-answers. Again I want to highlight that we have a PowerPoint presentation which I will use in my comments and I encourage you to pull that up it is at udr.com, under the Corporate tab, and I encourage you to get that while I prepare... give you my prepared remarks.", "As Larry stated, we issued three press releases last night: one, dealing with the $1.7 billion portfolio sale; the second, the fourth quarter and full year financial results; and the third was our share repurchase program which has been expanded.", "We will cover all three on today's call in detail, but before I get into individual ones, let me talk about the fourth quarter operating results, which, first, were inline with our expectation at $0.43 before one-time charge of $0.03 for restructuring, a lot of that related to just a bulk of portfolio sale and a corporate wide review of the organization.", "We did not record any gains on sale in our RE3, I think everyone is quite aware that the fourth quarter was a turbulent financial time and liquidity was not available, so a number of transactions did not occur.", "And what I consider the highlight of the quarter is NOI growth of 8% on a healthy near 5% revenue line, and achieving an operating margin of nearly 70%.", "So, in summary, I thought it was a very good quarter, Jerry and his team did a number of great things in our marketplaces, and the Company did well.", "So, let me now turn my comments to the portfolio sale, and before I turn to the PowerPoint, I would like to just give you what I feel is probably hard to pick up from the press releases which is why did we do this, what we are really looking at, and how did we think about the portfolio sale? And I think there are three things that were overriding in our thought process about this transaction.", "First, was to take advantage of the public versus private valuation arbitrage. I mean, clearly we sold a handpicked portfolio of assets that we would classify below average compared to the remaining portfolio out of 6.5 cap rate, and we can certainly talk about how to calculate cap rate. When the stock was trading at a grater than 7% cap rate, I think, that is capturing that public to private evaluation was critical to us.", "The second was in a period of time that we have today where liquidity is tough to come by. Financial flexibility was critical in our view and so we wanted to create more financial flexibility for our future, in particular to acquire assets, complete our development and redevelopment efforts, and certainly repurchase shares.", "And the third, focus the Company. And focus the Company was important in our long-term view in executing our strategies. So with that, why don't I to the PowerPoint, and I hope by now all of you have it.", "First on the cover, clearly the topics, we have six to cover today. First off, is the portfolio sale, I will go through the detail of that transaction including the benefits. Second is the talk about new UDR and the characteristics of our portfolio. The third: our development activities and pipeline. Fourth is the redevelopment effort. Fifth is the corporate realignment and related charges. And our outlook for 2008.", "Page number two, certainly where I choose the title Transformation for Growth, because I think in the end when you get done with this presentation you are going to realize we have transformed UDR. And I think we're very excited about that future and look forward to it. But the transaction, first we are selling a little over 25,000 apartment homes for $1.7 billion. The buyer is DRA, and they are partnering with Steven D. Bell to run the assets. They are expected to close on March 3, which is less... pretty close to 30 days, that's a tight close. We are comfortable that they will get there. We'll talk about how much money they have up and the likelihood of closing, but we are very confident they will close.", "What will they close on? First, the portfolio that has an average rent of $744 a month. We calculate the cap rate at 6.56 that's trailing NOI that $650 a month in CapEx... 650 a door per CapEx... and a 2.75 management fee. Clearly, we believe these assets have historically consumed more than 650 a door and will get into... I am certain on this call, a little bit more about cap rate conversation. The average age was 24 years, this represents a selling price of $67,000 per door.", "What will we receive in win? On March 3 we expect to receive 1.5 billion in cash and a note receivable with a fixed rate of 7.5% with a maturity of six years locked out for pre-payment for 14 months. Certainly the 7.5 is the higher coupon than could be obtained in the mortgage market, so we expect to be paid off 14 months.", "What will we do with the capital, first acquisitions, we have got $500 million to $600 million that we are targeting of which $320 million is already under contract in targeted market and expected to close the first week of April. We expect to payoff debt $500 million to $600 million, leaving out cash between $300 million and $500 million and closing at a note receivable $200 million. The benefits of this transaction certainly a stronger portfolio for growth that we will have a little over 44,000 apartment homes in ten states with an average rent in the fourth quarter of $1,163 a month which we expect to grow past $1,200 a month with an average age of 15.", "We believe that this portfolio has less capital requirement than the prior enterprise, and certainly has better exposure to the right demographics and job growth. Again the other benefits we see, capturing the arbitrage between public and private, generating the ability to buy back our shares on an accretive basis, reducing our debt and creating further financial flexibility, and I would have note that we expect to continue to maintain or grow the current dividend and certainly the ability of our development and redevelopment will have a greater impact on a smaller enterprise.", "And lastly, we have completed the right-sizing on this organization and it will not be lingering thought or effort on our side. It is done.", "Let me now turn to page 3. The characteristics of the portfolio contrasting it where it was as of December 31st, where what is sold and certainly what the new UDR looks like. Highlights in my view is an operating margin of nearly 70% and an average monthly rent of |$1,200 a month and you can see how that compares with an old and a new UDR to our peers. And I would highlight in the bottom the recurring capital expenditures as a percentage of the NOI. And you can see, certainly the assets that we sold had a disproportionate amount of capital that was being spent on them.", "Page 4 highlights the portfolio, on 4, what assets are sold by state, and there is a detailed list now our website of every community that is being sold, the details related to them. And certainly the new UDR, certainly a focus that I think will get into in the Q&A is California, now representing 41% of our 2008 NOI forecast, Florida at 19%, and Virginia, DC, and Maryland combined are nearly 25%.", "So, when I back up I look at the enterprise and say that nearly 90% of the enterprise is California, the DC corridor or Florida where we see long-term growth, job formation all in positive territory. And certainly we can understand where Florida is today, and we will discuss our view on that later in this call. This is a... if you will... a handpicked portfolio. We look at every asset from a perspective of its rent, its margin, its exposure to its submarkets, its exposure to competition, its future capital requirements and we chose this portfolio. We are very excited about what it does for us both in the short-term and its long-term potential.", "Moving to page 5, now I want to discuss, I think, we continue to read a lot about development and how people view it, we have always had a cautious stance on development, and we do have a planned $2.6 billion program with our targeted being $400 million to $500 million annually. The targeted returns are 6.5% to 7.0%.", "I think it's important as we're in what I would call a transitional part of the cycle to understand what your exposure is to development. And we measure exposure in terms of how much is leasing up, where its leasing up, how much is under-construction and certainly how much of its generating NOI and how much is making dirt? And we provided that detail, you can certainly see that, one, we feel very comfortable that our pipeline is being delivered into the right markets, at the right time.", "With the current 400 million be coming online in 08, 80% of that is being delivered in Southern California, Texas or DC. And looking at 09, 80% coming on in Texas, Southern California and Seattle. So we think we are delivering the right pipeline at the right time and we will be... Mark will give you an update in terms of how the lease ups are going.", "Moving onto page 6, our redevelopment efforts, and we feel this is one of our strengths, certainly one of our better value creators with targeted returns of 8% to 10%, a lot of our efforts in the Florida, Virginia, Tennessee, and Maryland, Texas markets are coming online in '08 and will help our earnings. And certainly we are now more focused on the West Coast where we believe we have an active pipeline under review, and you'll see us starting delivering results out there in '08 and '09.", "Going to page 7, in connection with both the portfolio of sale, we really completed a top-down review of the organization as well as the bottom-up it looked as if we were starting over where will we go, and how would we align our resources, what areas did we not have enough resources and literally took the enterprise apart, and concluded that first and foremost we needed to change the corporate office to Denver that in fact it had been here but we just needed to recognize that, and second that we needed to realign a lot of our resources around our key drivers and our business leaders.", "Dallas is now about 80 individuals and represents the core of our developmental effort. Richmond is our focus for redevelopment and some backroom support functions. It has approximately 80 people as well. And then you have Denver with about 80 dealing with corporate, IT and finance and financial reporting.", "In connection I read from the fourth quarter, we took a $30.6 million charge which we would believe generates a $2 million annual savings, but becomes, creates a more efficient and effective UDR. The table at the bottom, I think, shows that we are pretty sensitive to our G&A as a percentage of our revenue and very comfortable with it relative to our peers.", "Page 8, certainly we look back in November 5th and gave guidance in a core of our portfolio as well as our RE3 gains, and as you can see without the restructuring we were right at the target level for our core but no RE3 gains, and certainly post restructuring we're $0.40 for the quarter.", "What else would I say, I think you look at the operating results by region and you can see that on revenue line the Southeast continues as is primarily Florida to be weak, but the rest of our regions are very strong on revenue growth, and Jerry will probably comment later in the call about how is January '08 outlook are?", "So, I thought again it was a good fourth quarter, performed where we expected, certainly the market threw, all of us a curveball, as it relates to capital and liquidity.", "Page 9, let me tell you, we have got a lot of moving parts which make it extremely difficult at this time for us to provide '08 guidance. First, we'd like to get the closing of the sales done. Second, we've got some acquisitions under contract as well as others that we're underwriting. We would like to have firmer grip on that. Share repurchase, certainly we have the authorization and the financial firepower to do so. And then the potential for a special dividend, connection with this transaction we have got $840 million tax gain. We believe we can cover a lot of that in a number of ways, but there is a potential for a special dividend.", "So, we provided, overall, guidance as it relates to our same-store sales outlook, and other key assumptions on our CapEx per door and G&A, and certainly you can see our market outlooks. There is number of what I would call very solid markets, some extraordinarily hot markets, and again we think Orlando and Tampa probably will have a negative for '08.", "One other highlight about the outlook for '08. Given this capital environment, we do not believe that giving guidance on RE3 gains is practical, that's not to say that it is not a good effort, but we have always entered into that effort saying that if someone paid us the right price, we would sell an asset. We think it's very difficult in this capital environment for us to see some of those gains. So, if we do lock-in on a few, we'll tell you about them. But we are not providing any guidance in that area.", "So with that I think what you will see is the transaction fits our strategies, in terms of strength in our portfolio, expanding our RE3 capability, implementing an operations platform which we call 2.0 and sourcing low cost of capital. And the transaction fits all of those strategies and helps us move forward as an enterprise. I think you will find the rest of us are extremely excited about completing this, and that it is an opportunity to create a new UDR and we are excited about that UDR. So with that, I will now open it up to questions and appreciate your time. Let's go.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dustin Pizzo with Banc of America. Please go ahead.", "Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America", "Hey, good morning. Tom, just first on the portfolio transaction, I mean, how much of a spread do you think that there is between the assets that you are selling and the remaining portfolio on a capital basis? And then also, if you could just comment, given the changes in the capital market, I mean, where do you think these assets would have traded six to nine months ago?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, the spread between what we sold and what we think we have left for balance and our roll-out, all that market, I think, it's probably a 150 basis points, maybe 170.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "I would say 170.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I mean, I think the portfolio post, if you look, at 41%, California; 25%, DC. I can't find anything in that market that would trade north of a 5.", "Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America", "Okay.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think Florida representing 20% of the enterprise is probably in a market that probably trading 5-7 range, do the math you probably at about 4-8, 4-9 range.", "Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America", "Okay, and then just --", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Where were they traded?", "Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America", "With.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Where were they traded six months a year ago?", "Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America", "Yes.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think the couple of things, six months ago this portfolio doesn't trade, because there was frankly no lending, no capital available, and so zero is your answer, wouldn't have traded at all.", "Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America", "All right, we will call it 9 to 12 months ago, then.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Prior to that my view is probably trades at about where it is. I think what you got, is you got NOI that improves in this portfolio probably 5% over that time horizon, capital cost, Fannie-Freddie lending practices are about a 5% at 75% - 80% loan-to-value on this portfolio. You do this spread it probably trades at about 6.5, these asset moved a lot over that timeframe. I think it went way down and then it's come back up, Mark do you got a viewpoint?", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "No, I think that's right. And I think there is somewhat of uniqueness in that trading this as a large portfolio that we got a good option. On that we might not have gotten nine months ago, I don't believe we would have, so I think certainly it's the same but not slightly better.", "Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America", "Okay, and then with respect to DRA, it sounds like they are funding it through Fannie and Freddie about 80% leverage, 5% or?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I don't want speak for them, but our understanding of their financial structure is something along the line, 75%, 80%; Fannie financing at 5 or less on a six to seven year piece of paper and they have our beds in their and they have now rate-locked with Fannie and have part money up with them. And by Friday of this week they will have 25 million on part with us. So, we are comfortable that they are going to close. And for a company that uses a lot of leverage, we think they've got a good deal. And they hit the market, I think, at about the right hour almost, in terms of their rate-locks and their finance, so.", "Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America", "Okay and then.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good deal for them as well. One of those few transactions you back up and look and say, both parties won, they got something out of it they wanted. We are excited about it. We think they are good operators and I know a lot of our people are on the call, and I'll tell you we picked them. I think they are good operator: Mr. Bell and his team.", "Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America", "Fair enough, and then just turning over to the same-store guidance real quick. I mean, not to say you have any better cost side capabilities [ph] than anyone else, but what kind of broader economic assumptions you bake in there for job growth and GDP growth, and maybe you could just elaborate on how you kind of view the world right now?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it's kind of asking me to pour the Mississippi river into a tea cup and try to explain; I'm not much of an economist. And so I've always kind of been a person that says when you throw a blanket over big numbers like job growth of a million next year, what you really have to realize is somewhere in the US 2 million jobs are beings generated and million jobs are being lost. Where I want to be is where the 2 million jobs are being generated.", "And so we are very encouraged about our particular, for example, Southern California portfolio, because a lot of it's right up within two to three miles of the beach. And so that's where people want to live. We are very encouraged about the DC portfolio, primarily because we are inside the beltway or we are on transportation node. Florida, we understand that it is a weak market today, but over the long-term given it's taxes, it's job growth and diversity of the economy it is going to be a booming state, and we felt that it was important to hold our presence there and we sold what we thought we had extracted all the value out of.", "So a lot of it, I know it'd be great if I could say, gosh, we think it's a GDP of 1.5, I couldn't tell you how the 1.5 or 1.7 would drive down in the market. What I can tell you from the bottom-up, which is how we run our business, looking at individual assets, our exposure to jobs, our exposure to the long-term aspects of investment. We are very excited about the markets that we are in, and we think we've picked up not just for the short-term but the long-term, and picked... hand-picked the assets. I think that's what was important about this transaction to us. And I think out there, if you back up and say how do I view the world, one, it's an election year. And people need to realize election years you see it all the time, politicians want to make you feel like you need change, and so they talk down everything. And that's to drive you to vote for them because then they are making it all better.", "The second element is I am encouraged by the Feds and a lot of other people taking action or even the government, stimulus package, cutting rates, trying to get this economy going again.", "Third, I can't identify a lot of employers or industries that are, frankly, softening that we have exposure to. So, I don't worry much about it. The financial markets we certainly see lenders coming back to the market just slowly and at higher prices. So, I think the lock jam is broke it's just going to take time to start moving capital freely. So, I am more of an optimist than a pessimist about the future, but I don't want to keep getting too much of that I said it's like pouring the Mississippi river into the tea cup, it's too hard to do, why don't we move on.", "Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America", "Sure and then just the last question, I just want to follow-up on Southern California, since you mentioned it. I mean, would you attribute kind of what appears to be somewhat more aggressive guidance than your peers out there who have also given guidance to the better locations as you alluded to or?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I will let Jerry speak, and as you know Jerry ran that operation out there for three years, was number one in its markets for three consecutive years. So, first I'd tell you Tim... Dustin, but I'll let him add to that.", "Jerry A. Davis - Senior Vice President, Property Operations", "Yeah, I agree with what Tom says about our geography. We have 4,100 units in Orange County. The bulk of it is located in Newport Beach, Huntington Beach and Costa Mesa, a few miles within each other. So, we have good concentration, we have great people, and like Tom said, we are near some jobs but we're really located where people want to live. So, I think we did a great job years ago buying these fields and that's what makes the difference between our portfolio and everybody else.", "Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America", "Okay, thanks, guys.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Dustin.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Litt with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi it's Greg Miles [ph] here with John.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Greg, how are you doing?", "Unidentified Analyst", "Pretty good.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Glad to hear it.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I've got a question on the debt you are looking to repay in the deal the $500 million to $600 million, on what type of rate do you expect that to be take on at?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well you have $200 million of bonds that are coming due in March that are about 4.5%. You have our line of credit which currently is about at 4%. And then we have a couple of other pieces of debt that are at considerably higher rates in the fixes that don't add up to huge numbers but probably $100 million of debt that will be in those fixes.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And in terms of the cap rates on the deals you are currently looking at, or the ones you are under contract, how are they shaping up?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "The ones we have in our current contract today are average of five-five cap, and we are looking in West Coast from Southern California, Seattle, concentrate on Metro DC. Those cap rates were in the 5s, probably low 5s in those markets. Southern California, as Tom mentioned, is going to be sub-5, and we see, we have one opportunity we are looking at in the North Dallas market, it will be EDS corridor, very and that's high-end multiuse project, and that's about a 5A capital network, so that's the range we are looking at.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And Tom you mentioned that the... on the DRA assets, those assets you think would be at the similar price to 9 or 12 months ago, but on these assets you are looking to acquire, have you seen any movement in pricing over the last 9 or 12 months that made you say this is the time to buy rather than either buyback more stock or pay a special dividend?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Well, I mean, I think, we have seen some movement in cap ratio. Now, these are new asset, in-field locations, there is still competition for these, but I think it's 20 to 25 basis point improvement is there today, we will just see how that plays out as we go forward but there is not a rapid increase in cap rate, certainly in California, they still remain low. A slight improvement in the DC market, and the rest of the West Coast is still pretty competitive.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I think, Greg, I'd also add that a lot of the acquisitions we are looking at... in fact, all of them are 1031s.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Right.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So, anyway the drive behind that is not... and we're holding to our discipline, it's not just to go out and say lock up a bunch of assets, it's really to be focused around whether our investments wants to be in a follow through on that. And so we've known this transaction has been in the works, and frankly for six months have been shopping which has been entertaining, because there is very few people in the market. And feel like we've negotiated pretty strong pricing on assets, but we've found good values.", "And we think this announcement strengthens that. I think the only asset that we would say, that are probably mis-priced in the market today are probably assets and lease ups, and while they might be short-term and dilutive, the reason they're mis-priced is because Fannie and Freddie won't lend on a lease-up. And so those assets probably represent the best value buys and we'll keep hammering away and looking for that type of opportunity.", "Unidentified Analyst", "What type of financing would Fannie and Freddie give on lower cap rate assets, which is a 5-5 cap rate, would it be lower to some of the cash flow from the assets compared to the ?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "You know what's interesting is Fannie generally is not an asset quality driver, what they are is a coverage cash flow driver of their lending practices. And they are kind of a gradient lender in terms of you could borrow 60% or up to 80% and you are going to pay at different points on that curve and different charges. But we think, for example, and we will let DRA speak for themselves, but we think they hit at the right time and that was one of the things for us was the treasury market went weak there for four days. We accelerated the pressure on the bidders and said you guys need to all come up because this is not going to last.", "And so we think they got it done under 5, at 80% loan to value or 80% loan to purchase price for six year, that's a descent piece of paper. Where would that be today? Probably more at 5.25 or better. So, as long as Fannie is lending at those levels, those rates. And I think all this talk about cap rates is just certainly a bad number. The fact is we demonstrated a transaction and it was financed, and there is a lot more of these to come, not from us but in the marketplace.", "Unidentified Analyst", "No, our question is just on the NOI growth guidance, the 5 to 5.5. If you wouldn't have sold these assets, how would that have looks, can you give the sense of the difference in the NOI growth expectations for that what you're selling versus ?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I would have saved a 100 basis points off of it, that I would have told you we probably be more at the 4 or 4.5 range on the NOI lines, that's probably my view. Jerry, you got", "Jerry A. Davis - Senior Vice President, Property Operations", "Let me get back here. I think the rent growth is a little lower.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Greg.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question comes from Christine O'Connor with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Christine O'Connor - Morgan Stanley", "Hi, thanks. Good morning. A question on the $200 million note receivables. Will the transaction had been feasible without you guys issuing that note, and how did you arrive at the 7.5% interest rates?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "The 7.5% was just the negotiated rate. The transaction certainly would have been feasible without the note, having the note was helpful to us in terms of the tax structuring and being able to manage the very large gain that Tom referred to earlier. One thing about the note is that it has re-coursed to a very substantial entity, as well as security in the partnership interest of all these properties. So, we feel that it is a very secure note. And as Tom mentioned earlier, we fully expect that be repaid in 14 months.", "Christine O'Connor - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And on the $2 million of cost savings from the restructuring, should we expect that to appear in the G&A line or in the operating margin line?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "That's really G&A right there.", "Christine O'Connor - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And last question on the same-store expense guidance for next year, 3% to 3.5%. It seems like the last few years you have been in the 1% to 2% range. So, just wondering what's driving the acceleration there?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Jerry.", "Jerry A. Davis - Senior Vice President, Property Operations", "I can tell you a big part of it is... the past couple of years our insurance expense has been down just because we've had good experience. We are self insured and we haven't had that many claims and they haven't been that extensive. So, those are up a little. Our utilities, this past year, were virtually flat. Some of that was because of gas rates were down 3.5%, we expect gas is going to go up about 3% going forward.", "Personnel expense this year was slightly down. Again a lot of that is related to our healthcare and workers' compensation expense which is also self-insured and we had good experience. We are hopeful that it will happen again next year, but we can't count on it. So, where it was flat last year to slightly down, we are budgeting for personnel to be up 3.5% to 4% in 2008. And our admin and marketing in 2007 was down about 7.5%, we think in 2008 the decline is going to be more moderate, we... over the last two to three years have been getting out of print publications and we are virtually out of all of those. So it's hard to keep cutting.", "Christine O'Connor - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, thank you.", "Jerry A. Davis - Senior Vice President, Property Operations", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Mark Biffert with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Mark Biffert - Goldman Sachs", "Hey guys.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hello Mark.", "Mark Biffert - Goldman Sachs", "How are you?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Great.", "Mark Biffert - Goldman Sachs", "Good. In relations to the joint venture that you guys have, you still have another $300 million on that, and when you look at your acquisitions over say the next six months as you try to reinvest the proceeds. I mean, how do you decide whether it goes into ?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "The joint venture has a first look opportunity in any properties that are in Texas. Outside of the state of Texas, we can show them things, I think in the short-term while we were trying to get these 1031s covered, we probably will not show them that many things outside of Texas. But certainly anything in Texas will get first look at. You got another question Mark?", "Operator", "We are going to move on. Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Hi, thanks, and good morning, congratulation to you.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Rich.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "I guess we sort of screwed this up a little bit in our note, but I mean, when you talk about NAD creation and sort of the cap rate calculation and you know backing back in management fees, CapEx and all that, looking at an apples-to-apples type of cap rate on this transaction. Can you quantify or take a stab at what type of NAD creation you think this transaction in and of itself does day one before you sort of consider the growth potential the remaining portfolio?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, Rich, I mean, it's hard to say that the transaction by itself creates NAD, I mean, we sold them at a market price. I think where the NAD creation really comes in is the opportunity to buy the shares back at where we perceive to be a significant discount to NAD.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. So, but I mean when you look at the sort of on an apples-to-apples cap rate, would you say it's in line with your implied... where your stock is trading on an apples-to-apples basis?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "No way. I mean, if we do an internal NAD calculation, and we don't discuss our number with people, and we are not going to that here, but if you look at the implied cap rate at last nights closing price based on our NAV model for the stabilized portfolio, it's north of a 7% using the same methodology of taking the $650 door out and taking the 2.75% management fees. So, for the whole Company we are north of a 7% at the stock price today. We sold what is sort of the bottom tier of the assets for 6.56%. I mean I think it is, as us said in your note, the math works.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "And the market realizing that we're shopping the market hard, in these targeted markets that we now have our Company concentrated in, and Hugh and Harris [ph] mentioned a whole hell a lot about fixed caps or any debit, it's a low, it's between a 4.5 and 5 kind of cap rate for this portfolio on a go forward basis.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. In terms of use of proceeds, it looks like maybe you have like $500 million after the acquisitions and the debt pay down, and most of 500 that you have deal with and maybe you'll buyback stock you'll acquire more or you'll have a special dividend. It's interesting to me that $500 million divided by $22 a share is 22 million shares which is the amount of buyback opportunity you now have. Is that a coincidence and the question is --", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Rick, you are good.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "The question is how much of that buyback can you actually do and sort of in a comfort level from a leverage standpoint.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well this transaction provides us the opportunity to do a lot of buybacks that we choose to. Now, will we go out and do $500 million of buybacks. If the stock goes to $18, we might, but I don't know that we would do that level certainly quickly but it does, we would have the capacity to do that.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, so a special dividend to the extent you do it probably something in the $200 million to $250 million range something like that?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think that would be... I am doing the math of the top of my head here, but that will be the high side.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. You mentioned, Mark, I think, about the auction process, can you just sort of characterize how big of a process it was beyond DRA and their partner, how many other players were involved in this process?", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "Well I am going to let Tom could probably weigh on this too, but we started with a select group of over a dozen players, probably close to 15, as I recall. And they all look at the portfolio then we narrowed that group down to about half a dozen, and then in the last 30 days, I think, probably would say about four emerged strong players, and then got it down to two. And so the auction was really run from that four down to two. And then as the... I think we anticipate this probably taking little longer, probably another 20-25 days out, but when the debt markets started moving favorably, we accelerated the auction process and add several one to the really step up and see what they can do. Tom, can add to that.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Rich, here is some color that I think would help some people. First, I mean, Mark got it right in terms of number of players, but let's talk about competition. In the final four, we are down to two foreign capital and one pension fund advisor and one levered buyer. We really tried to create a marketplace for this transaction. So, what we did five months ago with Fannie's help is we started underwriting each individual asset with them on what would be their loan and getting in and in fact funding the dollars to have them do the physical survey, the title work, so that we would present to this auction group a pre-packaged, here's your loan, here's your pricing grid, with Fannie. And in essence put them on equal footing, because they had locked up all... they in essence knew where they could get their financing.", "And in today's market you talk about people buying and selling without the financing, no deals are going to get done. So we took that approach, it came down to four. At the end, I would tell you we had pricing power. We were running up against each other, and then we picked the group that we thought A) highest degree of certainty, good price and we went for that and feel good about the process. Certainly we used Marty Chico and his team and felt that Marty helped us keep it quite as long as we could and effectively was a good conduit of communication. And I am proud of the process. I thought it worked very well for us and I am grateful for Fannie and its patience in helping this transaction.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. And then just a last question on the internal growth prospects for 2008 with this new portfolio 5% plus. I'm just curious is that sort of a number that I mean, is that what you see now, or is that sort of maybe not haircut or sandbag or anything like that, but sort of taking into account some sort of what could happen in terms of a recession, I'm asking because your peer Essex, who is almost entirely California is in that same range. And so I was just wondering if you can reconcile your thought process for internal growth for 2008?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "You know Keith and I haven't gotten together and compare notes by assets, so I can't really speak to his guidance. What I can tell you is that year-in and year-out, I look back at our guidance range on operations and then I look at how Jerry or the operating team has delivered it. And I recall last year people looked at it and said you gave 6 to 8 and we ended up at 7.2. I am very comfortable with this team, it knows how to run its real estate and is comfortable enough not to sand bag me but push and get the results.", "So I think that's it. Providing the markets, you can certainly see that everyone would say Portland, Seattle, and San Francisco are going to be north at 10. And I think they would all agree. I think the disparity will probably be Southern California where we've discussed in detail where we think we have a better located portfolio. And I think the surprises next year are going to be Dallas. Texas is going to be a strong market next year or this year, excuse me.", "The negatives, I think we are all anticipating Orlando and Tampa to be negative this next year. So, if we were to take out the bottom 20% which would be the Orlando, Tampa the Florida exposure you'd probably find us another 100 basis points up from this.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Got it.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I don't think that's optimist. I think it's a realist built up from the bottom up and the assumptions utilized. And I think we got one month already in the year, we're doing better than our budget already.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "And you have that Florida, Tennessee, and Arizona markets like that because with a longer term perspective, you know that the short-term may be doesn't look so great.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "That, as well as we looked at what the redevelopment potentials were for a number of our assets; its specific locations. It was a nice opportunity to just go through and handpick everything and say this is what we really think we can do something with in the future. And I can't stress that enough, it was a top, we looked at every asset in that vein. And we've really have a plan by asset for the next five years about how to bring out some value out of them. Anything you could add, Jerry.", "Jerry A. Davis - Senior Vice President, Property Operations", "I agree with your comments about those locations, you know in Phoenix, three, four years ago we owned 3,500 units there. We paired that portfolio down for last couple. We have three extremely well located assets right now.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, sounds good. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Demler with UBS [ph]. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi guys, I just wanted to get a little more clarification on those receivable. You said it was a 14-year expected payoff, is that a hard maturity?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "That's 14 months.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Outside 14 months.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "There is a hard maturity that is got to terming this would be underlying debt which has a six-year term. But there is incentives, and we have every reason to believe that when it becomes open to prepayment in 14 months it will get paid off.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, and then, you said there was an unsecured note?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "It was secured by a partnership interest in all the real estate here plus a guarantee.", "Unidentified Analyst", "So, you have direct title to the real-estate?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we don't have a direct title. We have a security interest and the partnership interest that owns all the real-estate.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And my follow-up is, in terms of sales transaction today versus 12 months ago, what if, if no receivable have been 12 months ago, it would have been bridge equity, it would have been mezzanine debt? I mean how would these deals have been financed?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "This note receivable is really not comparable in a lot of ways to what you would typically think of as a mezz note because of the recourse aspect. I mean, you have a fun with a 1.2 billion of equity that is fully liable for the note. And we think we would be comfortable within a totally unsecured, if we had narrowed that way but we have sort of the security interest is grading [ph]. So you know a typical mezzanine note is not non-recourse, so it's very hard to compare.", "Unidentified Analyst", "The only reason I asked is just, it's the first time we have seen a note receivable as part of a transaction proceeds in quite some time.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Michael, here is all the time, we used to live on these things. They wanted the tax strategy too, it's a capital. Mike and I and Mark looked down the road and say 200 million bucks coming in 14 months from now. We like our chances to redeploy that, and again it might be short-term earnings dilutive but in the long scheme of things 200 million bucks of firepower 14 months from now has got a lot of optionality for it.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, thank you.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question comes from David Bragg of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "David Bragg - Merrill Lynch", "Hey good morning. Just back to that revenue growth guidance question again. Does that include an impact of the Yield Star, expected?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Not really. We would expect to get those earnings with our without Yield Star.", "David Bragg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, and Jerry what's your take on operation so far this year, specifically in Orange County and Central Florida?", "Jerry A. Davis - Senior Vice President, Property Operations", "I can tell you so far this year, and you know with January kind of in the bag, we are performing at our budgeted plan, revenues in the 5% to 6% range. Central Florida it's struggling as you would expect with roughly flat revenue growth.", "David Bragg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay and we know that you dropped a redevelopment project I believe in Tampa is that just indicative of how tough that market is?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "It was part of the 1.7 sale.", "David Bragg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks, and...", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We would have drop it, right [ph].", "David Bragg - Merrill Lynch", "Sorry.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "It was a quick to drop them, we sold it.", "David Bragg - Merrill Lynch", "Yeah, that's easy. Okay, and then just a last question for Mark, could you just touch on your lease ups right here in this environment and on your future developments in Southern California, what are your target yields?", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "I think we've had the targeted yield in our supplement on Southern California it's a high-five range. What's going on lease up right now is the product we're delivering in Texas, first of all, and it's been very strong, I mean, we typically budget on lease ups, 20 homes a month in lease up and we are running at 30 down there. And we are meaningful formal rents, those look very strong.", "We have a presale in Orlando, traffic's good, activity's good, but concessions are higher than we projected two years ago. But we like that long-term asset and the replacement cost due to the impact piece, Orlando and those kind of things are going to be higher in features, so we are very comfortable with that property. But Texas looks very strong, our Southern California project, we turn the clubhouse open in the March-April timeframe, and we expect very good result there, in that submarket.", "David Bragg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jeff Miller with JMG Capital. Please go ahead.", "Jeff Miller - JMG Capital", "Hi, I just wanted to get a pro forma combined, kind of, outstanding debt and your kind of average mine interest rate going forward, assuming the transaction closes?", "Jerry A. Davis - Senior Vice President, Property Operations", "Well, if you look at the numbers, I don't have that pro forma interest rate going forward, but if you look the numbers I talked about earlier. I mean we are probably paying down debt that has an average coupon in the high 4s with the $500 million to $600 million that we are going to be paying off as part of this transaction. So, if you factor that into the debt numbers in our supplemental package you can get to that number. And we'll be paying down, as we indicated, $500 million to $600 million right away with the proceeds.", "Jeff Miller - JMG Capital", "Right, okay. So you can't give me that, also just the, parking out of 40% of your portfolio, you can't give me that update, of that number at this time? Not contemplating the $500 million to $600 million of debt pay down. Just trying to get an idea of what kind of portfolio you have now going forward, what kind of leverage you'll have?", "Jerry A. Davis - Senior Vice President, Property Operations", "Okay, what kind of leverage, okay. There is a million different ways to look at leverage, but when we think about it, we generally think about debt relative to what we believe the private market value of the assets are, pre-transaction you are kind of in the mid-40s, post transaction you are right under 40% debt to private market value of the assets.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think you got a fixed charge is kind of how we also look at it on a pro forma basis, we are about 2-3 to 2-3-5, moreover 2.5.", "Jeff Miller - JMG Capital", "Something like that. That's great.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "One, clearly, we continue to be committed to maintaining the rating and believe that this transaction on the back side of it strengthens that rating. And you think having access to the London secured market when they come back will be important part of our strategy. So we are not throwing in the towel, we are not brunt by any measure.", "Jeff Miller - JMG Capital", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Thanks. Our next question from Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Hi, good morning. Just a couple of quick ones. Are you guys out marketing anything in RE3 today?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "This is more interesting question. There are assets that we are not currently marketing today, we do have one asset that's development site in Southern California that we have talked to people about, but it's not formally listed. We will have certain assets in the development pipeline. And we expect once get stabilized, we will be approached about, and so I don't anticipate us widely, having to widely market those. As Tom said, usually we are approached by people offerings us a price, and then we see if we can create a small, quite auction on those assets, but nothing other than that one asset is being in a marketed place today, just to tell us where the market is.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay. Next question. Am I correct to assume that it sounds like your strategy on reinvestment of the proceeds is to minimize the special dividend piece, if necessary? And under what scenario will you guys be forced to pay the special dividend, what level of acquisitions?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, Karen, as usual you asked a very insightful and thoughtful question, and is one matter that we will take up with our Board. As we said today, clearly in the case of what we identify as 1031s, we have got $500 million to $600 million as a target, that would covert $340 to $400 million of gain, that pulling the dividends forward we would cover another $200 million. And with the note, we defer a 100. So, all that being said is, and it's similar to Rich's number.", "On the outside, if we were to just to execute that plan you are looking at $200 million of uncovered gain. We would like to be thoughtful about what we buy, and we see that as the outside number, we will keep shopping it. As you know 1031 windows, you've got 45 days to identify and you've got 180 to close. So, we are not going have a definitive number for sometime.", "Our strategy is not to try to focus on minimizing it, it is try to focus on the strategic advantage and opportunities in the market. And if we are not able to adequately deploy the money in a prudent, thoughtful way then special dividend is irrelevant and important thing to recognize that discipline. We are just not, at this point, comfortable with that range, and we like some time to execute. And we will tell you exactly how we are coming out, to give you updates first when this transaction closes about where we stand. So, we will be back on this call about a month from now and tell you about the transaction closing, and where we stand there. So, I would think that's all I could really tell you right now, but again I think it's a very thoughtful question.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay, thanks. Final question, do you care to estimate what the impact this transaction is going to have on your payout ratio?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So first, we started out with one of the lowest payout ratios in the industry, and that gives us comfort being able to make the statement that we see no scenario in which we would cut the current dividend. And exactly where we come out, we are not going to drive it down to 100% or anything like that. We think you should have prudent coverage. Where that ultimately comes out is again a matter that we will take up with our Board, and be able to give more clarity on in the near future.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "One other note on that, Karen, is that the portfolio that was sold, to reiterate, had a much higher percentage of capital expenditures. So, when you look at the impact on AFFO it will be much less significant than it will be on any potential impact on FFO.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Just to give you the back of the envelope numbers there, because I think if you look at $650 a door and 65,000 doors, into a 125 million share count, you're about $0.29 charge. We currently look at basically the future and say you got 40,000 doors, 44,000 doors at $650 on a different share count that's $0.20 a share. So you are picking up $0.09 in AFFO coverage.", "And to also emphasize I think one of the question probably haven't covered is, the CapEx on this portfolio that we are selling last year ran over $1,100 a door. So, it was disproportionate in terms of what we were spending on it to the remaining portfolio. We are comfortable at $650 going forward, primarily because you look at the age of the portfolio it's now down to 15 years. And probably we will continue to get a little bit younger as Mark's development pipeline and our redevelopment pipeline get executed.", "So I think we are maintaining a good discipline in that area, in fact have completed five-year capital plans for all of the assets and feel comfortable with that level. So, you should be able to pickup $0.09 in the AFFO fall in our opinion which when you run that through your models you are going to see that dividend coverage is probably pretty adequate.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "It's very helpful. Thanks.", "Operator", "And your next question is a follow-up from the line of Mark Biffert. Please go ahead.", "Mark Biffert - Goldman Sachs", "Hey guys, sorry about that.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, you are back.", "Mark Biffert - Goldman Sachs", "Yes, page 5, in the supplement there... I guess not the supplement but the release that you went through.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "To our point, yes.", "Mark Biffert - Goldman Sachs", "Yes, you guys talked about your potential increase in NAV and you kind of give a sensitivity analysis there. And then when you look at your target returns as you go up on your sensitivity analysis. I mean it really cramps your spread there, and I am just wondering how do you look at development, when does it become unattractive given the risk premium that you should, most developers put on to development?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Well, I think we talked about this rule of thumb in the past, and of course they have never hard to pass, still deal-by-deal submarket-by-submarket. But you like to see, if you are looking at specific market, 150 basis points going in premium for the risk factor. And I think that's pretty well how everyone looks at that. And one thing about development further we're able to deliver is known products in a mix we want, the design we want, the quality we want, in the long-term durability of the product and that's a factor in there too. There is some risk on the acquisition side when you buy an asset and you do all your due-diligence, everyone knows and there is some risk in setting those budgets too and what you thought that you'll... we pay good results there but there is also that you weigh in all those risk factors.", "So I think it's generally, it's 150 basis points what's your submarket, what's your long-term growth in some of those markets? Obviously, some markets like Southern California and DC, tighter yields because of the rate growth, and the land itself cannot be replaced, and that land inflates in value and that drives some of those spreads higher.", "Mark Biffert - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. That was my only question, everything else was answered. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thanks. Our next question comes from Alex Goldfarb with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS Securities LLC", "Good morning. Just a quick question on the portfolio repositioning. Are you guys now complete with repositioning the portfolio? And also is there any further changes in corporate restructuring like relocating the offices or are both of those items complete now?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "With respect our restructuring, I believe we are done. We really have taken our time, took six months really looking at it, and said this is the best way to run our enterprise in the future where we want to go. In terms of asset sales in the future, we will certainly not be out marketing assets, but if we get an offer that an out of body experience, I am always glad to hit that, but we probably won't be marketing assets for some time. We think we're very comfortable with this portfolio and its prospects, but that's... you won't always be disciplined in this area, and if there is a chance to cash in on value, we would gladly take it as well.", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And with regards to special dividend, have you given a thought whether it could be a stock special or cash special?", "Jerry A. Davis - Senior Vice President, Property Operations", "We are considering that. I would not say we made any decisions. As Tom said, we need to talk to the Board. I want to understand better the option of doing the stock dividend and the impact of that. So, it's not out of the question, but it's certainly not given that we would do a stock component to it.", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And then my final question just relates to Fannie and Freddie. Certainly they have gotten a lot of attention as lenders for multi-family these days and given that spreads from other lenders are higher, do you see any chance that Fannie or Freddie may start to take advantage of their position in the market and increase the rates that they are charging for lending?", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "Well, they have already increased their spread a lot. I think the great rates we are seeing is really because of the treasuries dropping, but their spreads are probably 175-ish. I mean, they are... so they have already widened out quite a bit. I don't know whether they will widen more. I think they take their mandate to provide financing and liquidity for housing pretty seriously. So I doubt they would ever be in a position where they are trying to squeeze the last nickel out of the market.", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS Securities LLC", "So, with like other lenders like life companies et cetera charging more like 300 over from what I hear, do you think that those lenders will come down or you think that they will just be that big 100 basis point plus gap between borrowers?", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "There has always been a huge gap between Fannie and Freddie and the other sources of financing out there. I mean, they are... Fannie and Freddie are very tough to compete with for the right kind of product. I think there are certain things, as Tom alluded to earlier, lease ups and maybe the very high end of the market where they are less competitive, where the portfolio lenders and CMBS guys can play more. But for the sort of mainstream kind of stuff that we do and then most of our peers do, there is nobody that we can really compete with them.", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paula Poskon with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.", "Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Thank you. Just one question. Could you characterize the assets that you are seeking to acquire and particularly the ones already under contract in terms of they are being either fully positioned in their markets, redevelopment opportunities, lease up opportunities, et cetera?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, the ones we currently have, we have two really newer products, one is three years old, the other is two years old and this would be structured parking, four-storey kind of product. We have one product that's high-rise that could either do... we could either do a moderate renovation on or looking at maybe doing... there is actually three towers. We might do one tower a little bit more extensive renovation in the future. So... and the other product that we are also looking at is generally product that's similar in-fill with a structured parking four-storey kind of product. And we are looking at some of that in the California markets. So the answer to your question is generally newer product, in-fill locations, and what we call the Texas rapid rise.", "Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets", "Good morning, guys. More quickly, could you provide us with an update on your condo business? I noticed the page there, the supplemental is not there this quarter?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "This is Toomey. It has just become an insignificant part of the enterprise and certainly at this point we have got three communities, one in Tampa, one in Arizona, and one in Southern California. And what we are seeing is good interest in Arizona and Southern California, Tampa is a little slow right now. What you have to realize is all three of those were operating apartments that we've leased the apartments and then what we do is we pull off ten a month and if we sell them, then we pull off another 10. But it's really an insignificant part of the enterprise on go forward basis on a go-forward basis, and I think that's prudent capital and time management on our part.", "Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, that's fair. And then real quickly on your outlook for '08, you provided kind of acquisitions and dispositions there. Could you talk about your plans on the development front in terms of spending?", "Jerry A. Davis - Senior Vice President, Property Operations", "-- spending, well, you've got $400 million coming up out of the ground on an annual basis. That's pretty much the number I would put in there, is $400 million and then on the redevelopment I would putting another $75 million on that front.", "Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I think those are good gross numbers. I think on the development side there is probably 100 or so of that that will end up being funded through venture partners. So the actual dollars out to us will be a little bit less than that.", "Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, thanks guys.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Michael.", "Operator", "Thank you. And management, there are no further questions. I will turn it back to you for closing comments.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, operator and all of you for certainly your time today. I know it's a big day in the market, with seeing where the feds go. What I can tell you is that I am very excited. The entire team is excited about where we're headed. I mean, this is a great portfolio. This is a company that has financial flexibility and it has the skills to use that financial flexibility in terms of development, redevelopment, acquisitions. So I think you're getting the best of everything you can get in this marketplace with UDR. An experienced team with the financial fire power, the opportunities identified and stuff that we know how to do. And I think this transaction is a combination of really seven years of effort in putting this portfolio and this company in the right place with the right value creators and the right team.", "And with that I'd say I am grateful for this teams that were operating the assets that are sold. We are not across the goal line, I'm grateful for their efforts and for everyone else that was dealing with the organizational restructure, as well their sale. It's been a very, very busy period of time, but I think what we feel is very positive about where we're headed and we're relieved to get this done. And with that there is lot more to communicate as we go forward. I think you'll find us, as always, very forthright in what we see, what we're trying to and why. And with that, I always encourage you to just pick up the phone or call us and we can only help you make a better decision. We're excited about it, and again thank you for you time today and all of you, good luck.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's teleconference.

Following the presentation the conference will be opened for questions. [Operator Instructions]. This conference is the recorded Tuesday, May 6, 2008.", "I would now like turn to conference over to Larry Thede, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Larry Thede - ice President of Investor Relations", "Thank you. And thank you for joining us for UDR's first quarter financial results conference call. Our first quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed yesterday afternoon. In this supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements. Our press release and supplement is posted to our website www.udr.com.", "We will begin the call with brief comments from management and then open the call to your questions. I would like to note that statements made during the call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met.

The tour will conclude prior to the noon allowing guests time to travel to New York for the NAREIT Conference. To register for the event, please go to the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Let me now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you Larry, and welcome to our call. Joining me on the call today is Mark Wallis, our Senior Executive Vice President responsible for investments and development, Mike Ernst, our CFO, David Messenger, our Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, Jerry Davis, our Senior Vice President of Operations. We have a new member to the executive team on the call today. Let me introduce Warren Troupe. We announced in February that Warren has joined us as Senior Executive Vice President and General Counsel. But frankly he may have been had one of the longest interviews on record at nearly seven years. You see Warren has been our outside General Counsel since 2001 and has been involved in all our transactions over the years.", "Topics to cover on the conference call today is operating results, Jerry, will focus on fundamentals in his prepared remarks and will respond to specific market questions. Investment activities including an update on development, redevelopment and acquisitions will be Mark Wallis. And the status of the portfolio sale, use of proceeds and guidance for the year will be Mike.", "Let me begin with our view of the economy. It certainly seems like we have been in a recession rather you measure it by GDP or business sentiment. Who knows when it started and when it will end but over the last 60 years, we've seen 10 recessions lasting 8 to 16 months each. While they are never the same, they usually are focused around specific sectors or geographies. We believe this is true with this recession specifically the financial and homebuilding sectors leading the downturn. We believe this recession will be below average in duration for a variety of reasons.", "History will also point out great opportunities are born during recessions and inflation periods. UDR is in a position to take advantage of this environment in three ways. First capital. It is hard to find and it will cost more. This will not be a challenge for UDR. With portfolio sale, we have funded our development, redevelopment, and debt maturities through 2009 and had zero outstanding on our line of credit. We will also be paying a special dividend later this year in the $130 million to $190 million or $1 to $1.50 a share.", "Second, we have transformed the portfolio focused on 22 markets. As many of you know the right market position and price point are key. Let me highlight three statistics based upon our NOI weighted-average portfolio. Supply, first economists are forecasting a record low multi-family, single-family delivery in 2008 of less than 800,000 homes this year payment. Price points, our average monthly rent of 1,200 compares to an entry-level condo in our markets which would be 2000 a month payment and entry level house of 2,400 a month, meaning even further drops in housing prices should not represent a great threat if anyone can qualify for a loan for those homes.", "And lastly jobs, 19 of our 22 markets posted positive job growth in the first quarter. While the US is expected to lose 120,000 to 200,000 jobs in 2008, our portfolio is expected to have zero job growth with a weighted average unemployment below 5%. And third, inexperienced team. True none of us have seen all of 10 recessions, although we have an gray hair to prove, we prospered many of them coupled with our strategy, we believe we are in a position to create shareholder value.", "And again I want to extend a personal invitation that our Investor Day on June 2. You can see the details on our website. We look forward to seeing as many of you there as we can.", "Let me know me turn the call over to Jerry Davis.", "Jerry A. Davis - Senior Vice President, Property Operations", "Thanks Tom, and good afternoon everyone. I would like to give you some brief commentary on our first quarter operating results. Revenue was up 5% at 32,342 apartment homes that we classify same community homes. Expenses actually decreased by 0.5%, resulting in NOI being up 7.7%. The revenue growth is the result of effective rent growth of 3.6% and an increase in occupancy of 60 basis points from 94.0% last year to 94.6% this year. 15 of our 22 markets had higher occupancy year-over-year and 19 of the markets had higher revenue. We completed our yield star rollout in the fourth quarter of 2007 and to date we are pleased with the results.", "In addition to our 4.7% growth in net rental income, we also enjoyed an increase in utility reimbursements of 15.9%. The expense growth was negative 0.5% due entirely to insurance expense in the first quarter '08 being 73% lower than last year. Because we are self insured up to a limit, we benefited in first quarter '08 from very low loss experience compared to first quarter '07. Last year, we had heavy losses caused by several large fires in the first quarter. In addition, we rewrote our insurance policy late in 2007, which resulted in a reduction in our premium of about 6%.", "Administrative and marketing costs were also down 1.8%. Increased administrative expenses this quarter were offset by a 19% reduction in marketing and leasing cost as we continue to pull out print advertising, and push more of our marketing efforts to the Internet. During the fourth quarter\u2026 I mean during the first quarter, 46.7% of our move-ins originated through the Internet compared to 35.2% last year. Utilities were flat in large part due to the relatively mild winter. Repairs and maintenance expenses were up 3.8%, personnel expense was up 4.1%, real estate taxes increased 4.2%. We've seen our resident turnover drop in the first quarter to an annualized rate of 50.2% compared to 51.7% in first quarter '07. Move outs to home purchases were 13.5% in first quarter '08 compared to 16.02% in first quarter '07. This quarter our traffic has increased about 10% to 20% year-over-year due predominantly to our increased efforts in Internet marketing, as well as in mid April we completed our full portfolio rollout of a level one call center. Level one now handles all prospect calls after hours, as well as handling rollover calls when our associates are busy helping our residents and are not able to answer the phone.", "So, far the second quarter is tracking well with within our plan. Our physical occupancy last Tuesday, April 29 was 95.1%. That compares to 94.4% in the same week last year, an increase of 70 basis points. This gives us confidence that we'll have good pricing powers, as we move into our prime-leasing season. We're very encouraged by our first quarter results, but for the most part, they were in line with our expectations. We feel that there is still quite a bit of uncertainty in the economy for the remainder of the year and we do expect revenue growth to ease. We know that we also can't count on the continuing favorable insurance claim comparisons every quarter. At the beginning of the year, we gave operating guidance of 4% to 4.5% growth in revenue, 3% to 3.5% growth in expenses and 5 % to 5.5% growth in NOI. We're still comfortable with those ranges.", "In closing, I would like to thank all the UDR associates who worked so hard to stay focused during this first quarter, even while being distracted with the portfolio of sale of approximately one-third of our apartment homes, they were still able to turn an industry-leading results.", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Mark Wallis.", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Jerry. I'm going to speak to our core strategy, the first one, and which is to strengthen our portfolio. And I believe we made significant progress in the transformation of UDR's portfolio that began with the $1.7 billion sale that closed at the beginning of March. Now we are involved in the execution of using those proceeds for 1031 exchanges. And I want to briefly review the $580 million acquisitions that we closed this quarter and then I'll briefly touch on our development and redevelopment activities.", "First community is the community named Edgewater; it is located in the Mission Bay sub-market of downtown San Francisco. Now the Mission Bay redevelopment area is an area that will include the headquarters to the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, a 2.65 million square foot research campus for the University of California, San Francisco, a 6 million square feet of office, life science and tech space, and ultimately that's going to create over 31,000 new jobs in that sub-market. Now we own 1,800 homes in the metro bay area, that's now our third largest market from an NOI measurement standpoint with 4,097 of those homes located in downtown, San Francisco. This gives us a property down the location that's in walking distance to giant stadium and all the restaurant and retail amenities that make this location one we want to own for the long-term. Another plus about this property, unlike most San Francisco properties, it does not have the required below market rental element in unit count.", "The second community we acquired is known as Delancey at Shirlington Village in Alexandria, Virginia. This property has great visibility and access is located just south of the Pentagon 395, the major highway that links Northern Virginia and downtown Washington, DC. It's easily accessible from 395 and is in close proximity to employment centers, such as Crystal City, the Pentagon, Roslyn and the Eisenhower Corridor. This is a new product with loft, mid rise and high rise homes, and it is located within walking distance to just under 60,000 square feet of office space that\u2019s currently 97% occupied. This community has an attractive streetscape with retail amenities that a renter of the future will expect. You can go downstairs to a gourmet grocer, you can buy a Starbucks, you can meet friends at restaurant. Once you're home, you don't have to get back in your car. And with this in-fill location we\u2019ve avoided the difficult DC commute of up to two stressful hours.", "The property was in lease-up when we acquired it and provided opportunity for to us purchase without the typical competition we face from leveraged buyers who now really can't buy this type of lease-up property with GSA money and have to wait until stabilization.", "The next acquisition was located in the Baltimore market, in the heart of Towson adjacent to Towson Town Center in that central employment area. This property was built in 2003. It includes a structured parking garage and it's adjacent to Towson Town Center, which is a premier shopping destination with quality restaurants. Again, you're at home; you're close to all you need without having to get back in your car. This property has excellent visibility on Dulaney Valley road that carries over 40,000 cars every day. We believe too, there's a percentage of kitchens that can be converted to a more upscale finish that will have extra future rent growth.", "Circle Towers is a mixed use development contained in three high rise towers located in Fairfax County, Virginia. The property is located in the highly desirable area near the Vienna metro station at the I-66 Corridor and just outside of the 495 Beltway. This is the only residential high rise product in the Vienna metro market, and the mixed use design again provides for renter needs, needs that you can meet without having to get back in your car. There's more than 15 million square feet of office space located within 3-mile radius of the site. This property was constructed in the 1970s. We will redevelop it and it will be done by our team, headed by Richard Geonardy [ph], who have successfully done extensive redevelopments in this region. The incremental rehab expenditures should produce incremental rates of return of 7% to 8%.", "Legacy apartment homes is located in Legacy Town Center, one of Dallas' newest premier mixed use developments. This consists of three apartment communities that provide urban-style living with 40 restaurants in the area, 450,000 square feet of retail and office within walking distance. The adjoining Legacy Business Park provides a solid job base with a number of Fortune 500 companies. Some of those names are Frito-Lay, PepsiCo, EDS, AT&T Wireless, JC Penney, all of which supports the need for apartment housing in this area. This is a vibrant kind of... it's kind of an uptown Dallas type area but it's located in the West Plano job growth Corridor.", "The Place at Millenia is our first closing on presale program. Again this product is in walking distance of an upscale mall, where you arrive at your apartment, you can reach the entertainment and restaurants and retail there within walking distance. This property is in lease-up. We leased 30 homes last month, which is a respectful number of what is considered a soft market.", "We've completed our 1031 exchange identification process, and we expect to purchase an additional 375 million to 425 million of apartment communities that will close by August 30. We have identified properties that are primarily located in Northern and Southern California and in Seattle. And they are in sub-markets that complement our existing portfolio.", "Now on our development activities, we continue to complete our redevelopment communities and turn them back over our operations. This has been a success and we will have sharper focus in the future on the Northern Virginia market, especially Circle Towers, which I mentioned, and upon assets in California. Our $2.6 million pipeline provides UDR with long-term growth potential. However, we believe that we are managing that pipeline judiciously and with careful restraint. We have only 6% of lease-up and 35% under construction. With 56% of the pipeline producing income, we can be patient in our timings and we look forward to a recovery of the economy in the 2009/2010 timeframe. Our yields remain in the original rage and construction costs are not inflating beyond projections.", "Also I want to point out that we obtained approval from the city of Addison for a contribution of $39 million for infrastructure and amenity costs of our development in Addison. This development is located strategically near the important intersection of the North Dallas toll road in the LBJ freeway. The location puts residents within 6 miles of some 11 million square feet of office space and the high paying jobs that fill that space. And if you extend that corridor now to the George Bush toll road, an additional 7.7 million square feet of office space that is added to that number. Another important point is 20 minutes from the D/FW Airport only 15 minutes from the Love Field Airport. With the city of Addison approving their funding, we anticipate the Phase I construction commencing this summer. That's my comments regarding our investments and development activity.", "And now I'll turn the call over to Mike.", "Michael A. Ernst - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks a lot, Mark. Let me start by updating everyone on the uses of the cash from our $1.7 billion portfolio sale that we closed about 60 days ago. On March 3, we received $1.45 billion, which was the sale proceeds net of the mezzanine loan of $200 million, closing costs, and then there were two small deals that were delayed due to lender approvals. We closed one of these deals last week and expect to close the other one in the next 30 days.", "Of the money we received, we use it in the following ways during the quarter. We acquired $580 million of assets, as Mark has outlined. Our cash balances increased by a little over $350 million. We've reduced debt and other liabilities by about $350 million. In addition, we bought back during the quarter 4.8 million shares at $23.33 a total of $112 million. And then we bought another 500,000 shares back since quarter end.", "At this point, with the state of the capital markets and our considerably higher share price, we're being cautious about additional repurchases, but we'll keep you updated in the future on those. We also spend about $60 million during the quarter on development and redevelopment capital expenditures. At the quarter end, as Tom mentioned, we had nothing drawn on our $600 million line of credit. We had about $400 million of cash balances. For most of March, we had about $1 billion of cash on our balance sheet, as most of the closings that Mark described actually closed right at the end of the quarter. So, that was extremely dilutive during the course of the month of March. We are very cautious on how we invested the funds, because of all the uncertainty and the \u201csafe investments\u201d that we have seen over the last few months. And unfortunately, we are only earning about 2.5% on the cash during the quarter.", "One other thing to note, because these properties closed right at the very end of the quarter, in the last three days basically, there was very little income that came off of those during the first quarter. As Tom mentioned, if you look at our cash, sources and uses over the next couple of years, we have identified sources for basically all of our committed capital needs, including our development pipeline through the end of 2009. So, we're feeling very good about our position on that front right now.", "During the quarter, we closed a $240 million two-year bank term loan facility with a group of nine banks. We swapped $200 million of this loan at a 3.61% rate for two years, and the remaining $40 million is floating at LIBOR plus 85. We used the proceeds to retire $200 million of 4.5% bonds, which matured in early March and for various other corporate purposes. Tom also mentioned the special dividend. We believe the range is $130 million to $190 million. We will nail that down by the end of August, when the 1031 exchange periods expire. We are contemplating whether we will pay part of that in stock, and we'll make that decision later this year, depending on a number of factors, including our share price at that point, attractiveness of other investment opportunities, and the state of the capital markets.", "With our sale now closed and the benefit of a couple of months to analyze how all the pieces are coming together, we've reevaluated our forecast for the year and are lowering the top end of our guidance to $155 million from $160 million. The significant factors leading us to reduce the top end are the lower returns that we're getting on our cash investments, the increase in our stock price which has made it the economics of the share buybacks somewhat less compelling than we originally modeled and then we're buying some assets that are in lease-up that we think our great investments but create quite a bit more dilution in the short-term than we were originally expecting.", "As a reminder, our new guidance range of $1.50 per share to $1.55 per share is for core FFO only and does not include any potential gains on sale on RH Re [ph]. By our numbers the current consensus on the Street of $1.54 has about $0.03 of RH Re gains in it, so the comparable numbers are $1.51. And then as Jerry mentioned, we have not changed any of our operating guidance for the year and he's still confident we will be in the range we outlined last quarter.", "That concludes my comments and I'll turn it back over to Tom for any closing remarks.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Operator, we are now ready to take the call for questions.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "Thank you sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Michael Bilerman with Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Craig Melcher - Citigroup", "Hi, it's Craig Melcher here for Michael. Can you talk a bit on the, who were the sellers of assets that you acquired so far in the first quarter?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Mark you want to...", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "Yes, I mean. I can give you some general information, sort of respecting some of their wishes on disclosure. The asset in San Francisco was the part of [inaudible] sold developer there\u2026 in private developer in San Francisco. And\u2026 let me go through this list here, the one in Shirlington Village, another local private owner there, Towson Town Center was a group that had acquired this asset\u2026 another private group acquired the asset of probably about 10 years ago, and it\u2019s operating that themselves and it has nothing\u2026 a smaller management company there. Legacy apartment homes may be familiar with [inaudible] property, which was actually part of the original Columbus REIT, great developer down there, excellent product. Then, the place in [inaudible] was a\u2026", "Craig Melcher - Citigroup", "Okay. Do you have a blended cap rate on the acquisitions that you did and also the acquisitions that you're planning on of next few months.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. The blended cap rate is probably going to be in the half works [ph].", "Craig Melcher - Citigroup", "That's current or...", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "That's current.", "Craig Melcher - Citigroup", "And where do you...", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "[inaudible] outside that number obviously as we some REITS have got some lease upside and some management upside.", "Craig Melcher - Citigroup", "And so high 4s on the existing ones you bought and on those targeted ones that you're anticipating that other 350 to 400?", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "Yes.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "And Craig, just to clarify that that is net of CapEx so...", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "Right.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So, the actual FFO impact could be higher than that,", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "Yes.", "Craig Melcher - Citigroup", "What type of CapEx and/or management be your\u2026 built into that?", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "We built in a typical 2.75% management fee unless there is some areas where that needs to be monetized based on additional staff, that pretty well is how we run it. And on, all these product is a new product but we run it at... basically what our standard CapEx is for the whole company even though generally there will be less than that for the first couple of years.", "Craig Melcher - Citigroup", "Okay. And just two income statement items probably for Mike. The income tax expense line and the subsidiary interest investment income, if you could just comment on these two items and what we could expect for the balance of the year there?", "Michael A. Ernst - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, the income tax expense is actually a... that\u2019s a benefit. It was realized because if there weren\u2019t a lot gains on sale during the first quarter, so you had the ability to recapture prior year\u2019s taxes paid. And I am sorry the other line item you mentioned, Craig?", "Craig Melcher - Citigroup", "Just on FFO add back, the subsidiary investment income?", "Michael A. Ernst - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That's pretty small number. It is 374,000. I think it's related to one of the joint ventures.", "Craig Melcher - Citigroup", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jay Habermann with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "Hi, guys. How are you?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Great.", "Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "I had a question for you. Obviously on NOI growth, you're fully running pretty strong revels year-to-date, based on the occupancy level you cited up until the present, I am just curious what sort of assumptions you're building in. Just sort of get to your full-year guidance. I mean what are you assuming if you're maintaining your occupancy level, is it really a function of deterioration in job growth in the back half of the year?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Not a whole lot of that. A lot of it is we just finished up last year so strong, it\u2019s a  more difficult comparisons to last year. We're still little concerned about some parts of Florida and the Inland Empire is weakening a little bit for us. But everywhere else right now, we don't see the job growth really hurting us in our markets.", "Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and obviously the pick up sequentially on expenses, can you just provide some more detail there and I guess in general you've been pretty good at keeping expenses under control and sort of what do you anticipate moving into the balance of the year? Is there still more to go there on expense control?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "First, I'll discuss your sequential increase. The biggest part of that was real estate tax and sequentially were up 15.7% and we accrued taxes throughout the year based on our estimates of rate changes and reassessments and then we get the final tax bill typically near the end of the year we true it up or true it down. And luckily in 4Q07 we had to true it down because we were accruing at too high of a rate. So what you are seeing right now is first quarter '08 we're accruing at a rate that is 4% to 5% higher than all of last year because we basically reduced our accrual in the fourth quarter '07, it looks like a huge increase. In addition, we had gas expense in the first quarter for heating. That was 50%\u2026. 57% higher than in 4Q, and I guess the last component is in fourth quarter of '07, we had extraordinarily low healthcare and workers comp expense in our personnel lines, and we had more normalized loss experience in this quarter. Now going forward, we still feel like the 3% to 3.5% expense growth is in line and as I told you in my opening remarks, personnel is up about 4%, R&M is up 3.8%, tax like I said we think are going to up 4% to 4.5%. Utilities we are hopeful are going to be in the 3% to 4% range. So, we really, we don't anticipate great savings but a lot of it does depend on our insurance, our insurance claims since we are self insured up to a limit.", "Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, just one more question. In terms of the Kitchen & Baths and the upgrades, the renovations you're doing to your properties. What are you seeing from the competition generally in your markets versus the same activities?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We are seeing them do what they call a Kitchen & Bath but typically don't think they do it as well as we do. A lot of times they will just change the doors, paint the cabinets, change the counter tops. We do a Kitchen & Bath, we replace the entire cabinet tree. We also go in and typically put in... we put in all new appliances, do a lighting upgrade and change up the flooring. So a lot of people's K&B is, let's pull the outdoors off, put new doors on and paint the boxes.", "Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And just for Mike, are you assuming any share repurchases in the guidance for full-year, additional share repurchases?", "Michael A. Ernst - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, the current guidance does not have any additional share repurchases. However, obviously, we may very will do that which would provide upside.", "Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Bragg with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "David Bragg - Merrill Lynch", "Hi, good afternoon. Just another income statement question for Mike here. Could you talk about the other income line? What are the components of that in addition to interest income?", "Michael A. Ernst - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "David, I believe most of that is interest income off of the $1 billion of cash that we had sitting on the balance sheet for a good... well for most of March. You also have one-month worth of income on the mezzanine note that runs a little over $1 million a month. And I don't think, I think that was really most of it. There may be have been a few minor miscellaneous things but\u2026", "David Bragg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thanks. Then looking at the development page, Mark could you just run us through real quick the expected commencement of deliveries or the commencement of lease ups over the balance of this year?", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "Yes, I can do that. I'm going to refer to... I\u2019m over on a schedule, that\u2019s where I am looking at.", "David Bragg - Merrill Lynch", "Yes, for 8B actually?", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "8B, that's correct. If you look at Tiburon, that one is in lease up and we expect that to be stabilized probably by the third quarter. Lease ups doing going very well there. Currently in part we will just be commencing construction, same thing in Hawking Street. Mission Bay has not commenced construction yet. Signal Hill will commence construction in the second quarter. Laura Wood we've just turned two buildings there and opened a club house. So that lease up has just now begun, anyhow the rate of lease up down in Huston is 10, 20, 30 units a month and we are hitting a good period. There is a lot of jobs out there in that sub- markets. So we expect that to do well. Belmont has just commenced construction in the last quarter; we have work commenced on Waterside Towers. We have started a grading work at the residence of Stadium Village buildings where there is no big lease up, not being leased up this year. [inaudible] Phase II I would expect based on all the plans have been put on next side and we're going vertical on two to three of them. So, we will start lease up there probably in the probably into the third quarter, we\u2019ll have buildings turned and the clubhouse ready to go. And that\u2019s, and Jefferson at Marina del Rey, which is our joint venture with JPI, the clubhouse is now openly started turning units and gotten the permits to do those COs there. So, that has commenced lease up in the last three weeks. And then, the project in Orlando, which really\u2026 gets on our development page but was we're in lease up there, they we're probably about 58% leased at this point. I think I have covered all of them, that\u2019s for now.", "David Bragg - Merrill Lynch", "Now I think that's it. Thank you. And then just lastly, Mike, what's your expected redevelopment spend over the balance of this year?", "Michael A. Ernst - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It depends on a little bit on timing of some of the starts later in the year. But, I think it\u2019s only about $60 million, $60 million or $70 million.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. I don't think we will top over $60 million just based on timing and permitting some of these Western California markets' permitting across just more prolong, so that would probably keep some $60 million or less range.", "Michael A. Ernst - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. We're really at the point where we're finishing a lot of this stuff that was in the first stage and we were getting ready to identify some new ones. So, they will be actually a little bit of a low during the course of the middle part of this year as a redevelopment.", "David Bragg - Merrill Lynch", "And then you would shift towards California?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "That's right.", "David Bragg - Merrill Lynch", "Correct. Okay.", "Michael A. Ernst - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. And I mentioned we\u2019ll still do some work in the Northern Virginia markets especially Circle Towers.", "David Bragg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Thanks and good afternoon. Good morning.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes it is.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Good morning right. So, in terms of stock dividend component, I mean do you have any idea how much that would be stock, have you talked to investors about their interest in getting a stock dividend a little cash, I mean how much of this have you investigated so far?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "This is Tom. Rich, I think what we're seeing from large institution is a leaning towards stock instead of cash. But, we're still out collecting input and always want to listen to our shareholders, and be responsive to their desires; I mean we do work for them, so.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "That's where we stand on it.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. If the stock were trading where it is today, would you be inclined to have stock element?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Most likely, yes.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. In terms of the, the buying activity obviously you had some redeployment needs and executed on lot of it this quarter, the past quarter. How did you handle that sort of 1031 redeployment pressure with making sure you've got the best deal that you could? In other words, what was your pipeline of deals that you had to choose from whether your new sellers weren't going to pressure you into a better deal for themselves?", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "Well, I'll comment on that first and Tom may have some comments on that too, this Mark. In the 1031 process you are allowed to identify assets over and above the dollar amounts you ultimately spend and there is some specific rules there but, let\u2019s generally at least 2 to 2.5 times the amount. So we've approached it, we're identifying a lot of quality properties and now we're trying to pick the best of several on our plate. And the ones that we closes, some of these we started work on before actually the sale had closed so that we wouldn't be under that pressure. They were assets we wanted to buy and last quarter we mentioned the closing of Marina del Rey that actually was reverse exchange that came into this $1.7 billion sales. So two things, we've identified properties early in markets that we wanted, and then second thing is we've identified more properties than we ultimately buy and we are competing against each other to get the best deal.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. That was the point exactly actually. So, and how do you feel let's say you weren\u2019t under any pressure to buy assets today. Do you think you may be gave up 25 basis points of cap rate or do you have any sense of what you could have done in terms of the negotiating process?", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "I'll answer it this way. I mean I think any time you're making a number of purchases like this each deal has its own character to it. And we are viewing it, the way I think about it is, we are buying a portfolio in the end of $800 million to $900 million and highly lock that portfolio, how does it fit our company. And so, you have one, I expect we have got 50 basis points better than I thought what we get. Another may be we are 25 basis points we paid may be 25 basis points higher but there is some benefits that being adjacent to other properties. So Jerry has got some management benefit there to it. I think it pretty well equals itself out, how it\u2019s been going so far. There is some higher quality properties here that we are buying at a good stage of lease up, there is some upside in but we are not taking them zero occupancy. So overall the balance\u2026 some were up, some were down, but overall pretty much where we want to be.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Last question you mentioned the high 4s cap rate with the CapEx etcetera and where do you think that number trends on an apples-to-apples basis once you get that lease up properties to stabilization?", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "Well, I mean. I think pretty quick all of these assets are being in the 6% yield range in the next 12 months to 18 months, that is how we're forecasting this portfolio to perform. And I think Jerry has been pretty pleased with the assets we have turned over so far. We are hitting our numbers and Jerry's team is very much involved in setting this process. The acquisition group is going to turn the property over to him and hope that they get the number stay. They sign off with us on these numbers and we go out as a team, so\u2026", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Rich this is Toomey, I\u2019ll just add a couple of things, and one time we made a decision last July to go after the portfolio sales. At that time, we knew we are going to be a 1031 buyer. And Mark, we turned them loose. Jerry and his team Mat Atkin, and really said listen lock up what makes sense, and extend, extend, extend and keep bleeding the prices to make sense. And so, lot of these were assets that even if you look back at the contracts and negotiations, you would find several addendums and you find that we strung them out to a, insure that the closing happens, but also slating out sellers in terms of credit crisis you're not going to find GSAs lending that much and that was one tactic. The second tactic was to really go after value creation efforts, the 1972 tower, great deals almost 100% occupied, haven\u2019t raised in ages on the darn thing, meaning we got a real opportunity to add some value by rehabbing it, and the others lease ups where the GSAs are not going to finance those deals, there is no money available. The only other buyer of those are going to be 1031 buyers or pension. And we didn't find a whole lot people knocking on those doors. So, we understood the market very well and think that in the end it might not been a great short-term earnings kind of positive event but a long-term value creation for our shareholders. And a lot of stuff sit right in our strike zone in terms of markets, overlaid our new portfolio in terms of 22 markets and in terms of value creation capability. We're not finding the\u2026 on great vice [ph] in my opinion.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, great. Thanks very much.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Alex Goldfarb with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS", "Thank you and good morning to you. Just summing up on the 1031 question, just looking at your 1031 balance on the balance sheet of about $350 million, can you just reconcile that to the $360 million or so that you've done so far?", "Michael A. Ernst - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, the balance that's on the balance sheet at March 31 is in accounts for future acquisitions. So, as March 31, all the ones we have already done. They have been funded out of the cash from the sale.", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS", "Okay, so the remaining balance, the $350 million is also a more 1031 money, it\u2019s not cash that's free and clear?", "Michael A. Ernst - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That's correct.", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS", "Okay. Your thought earlier in some of the previous conversations there with an amount of money may be $400 million or so that was free and clear cash above and beyond the 1031 needs.", "Michael A. Ernst - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The $400 million that I've referenced was all cash. So it included, approximately $350 million that's sitting in 1031 accounts and that about $50 million that's just pretty included do with what we want.", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS", "Okay. Okay, and then going on to the expense line, just two expense questions, one when you guys do any build backs for utility or anything like that. Is that netted out in the expense line, or is there a revenue line with an offsetting expense line?", "Michael A. Ernst - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It's a revenue line with an offsetting expense line.", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS", "Okay, and then on the self insurance, did all of that flow through the operating expenses or does any of that flow through G&A or another non-property related line?", "Michael A. Ernst - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It's all operating expenses.", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS", "Okay. So, whether it's a claim or an expense, it also through operating expenses?", "Michael A. Ernst - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS", "Okay. Great, thank you very much.", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "[inaudible] interacting questions, somebody do it differently Alex, I thought we're insuring property. He\u2019s\u2026 already, that\u2019s al right, keep going.", "Operator", "Our next question comes [inaudible] with KBW. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thanks. Mike, with the increase in development activity, kind of ramping up here. Can you just give me a sense of where capitalized interest was first quarter and where it goes kind of throughout the rest of the year?", "Michael A. Ernst - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, I believe in the first quarter it\u2019s in the supplement. I believe it was $3.3 million, is that correct? $3.5 million $4 million, something like that. Yes $3.3 million in the first quarter. We are expecting over the course of the year, I think what's in our forecast is it\u2019s about $4 million in Q2, $4.5 million and $5 million those are approximations in the third and fourth quarter. So, it ramps up over the course of the year.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And then, you had mentioned a couple of the dispositions held over into the quarter, if there is $50 million, or so I think it's held for sale on the balance sheet, is that, those properties or are there other things held for sale?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "There is a couple of condos that are still classified as held for sale, I think if you look at that $55 million number, I believe $35 million to $40 million of it was the other two properties left over from the big portfolio sale, of which we closed the larger ones. So, there\u2019s only about 10 left of those and then the rest is condos.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And Tom, I think you referred that basically you've got everything funded through 2009, does that include any incremental sales from here?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, it does not.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our next question is a follow up from Michael Bilerman. Please go ahead.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "And it's silly [ph] question of 500,000 shares you bought so far in the second quarter, where were those done?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I don't have the exact number for those 500,000. But, I know when you average those in; you are at $23.50 instead of $23.33. So, they were up a bit higher obviously as the stock prices going up, and they were very much weighted towards the first couple of weeks of the quarter.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "All right. And it sounds like given the stock at close to $25 your appetite to buy stock is completely diminished?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I wouldn't say completely diminished, I think what we felt is, it was a time to take a pause, take a look at how some of these 1031s play out. I get a better gauge of how the capital markets play out over the next couple of months and see where we stand, I think we still like the price, I think we do not like it as much as $21 or $22.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "But, I guess with your stock trading, it has called 63,64 [ph] implied cap rate and these deals that you went into high 4s and hope to get to a 6. I know there is some tax implications in 1031 positions, but a sort of how we understand why you wouldn't be aggressively continuing to buy the stock as it offers a better return potential than going out and buying assets?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, you look at the return potential or development pipeline and the rehab pipeline, and it looks very compelling even compared to the stock. And you haven't seen us got just by acquisitions unless there was a tax motivation reason to do it. So, and we think that tax issues are significant enough where that make sense for us to do the 1031s in most cases?", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "Plus, we've also very cautious in these capital market environment, that if your company that's got to raise capital in this environment, you might be paying dearly for it and that doesn't look like it's going to ease any time soon, so saving capital is an important part of... and creates an opportunity for the window so\u2026", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "Right. And I think Tom you had mentioned on one of the assets\u2026 of the assets you acquired they hadn\u2019t raised rents, I think you said 20 years or something. But, may be you can just walk through a sort of growth in that return from the high 4s, of course the low 4s may be I\u2019m mixing up my own notes, going to a 6, how much of it\u2019s just leasing up those two under leased assets, how much of it\u2019s rent growth that just sort of splitting it out in terms of going out to 12 to 18 months.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "It's a hard question", "Michael A. Ernst - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I'll tell to you the general answer there is as far a splitting it out, it's probably there is 30% to 35% just lease up improvement in there and majority is agreeing with that and then I think the balance is just our team getting in there putting our leasing strategy, our Internet strategy on top of it and racing rents and I mentioned to that there is a limited amount of can be opportunity little bit down the road that help us get there but I think 35% or so will be sort of lease up, and the rest is just working on it in our style of management.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "Just getting up that monthly revenue number?", "Michael A. Ernst - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "And the monthly revenues numbers that you show, those are current or those are you targeted?", "Michael A. Ernst - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I believe those are the current ones in a disclosure, yes.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ryan Bennett with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.", "Ryan Bennett - Lehman Brothers", "Good afternoon guys. I know you don't give earnings guidance regarding RE3 because one of you guys were actively in the market with any of the assets from RE3 and if so what markets they would be in?", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "This is Mark. I'll answer that question, there is nothing active obviously at times you do get unsolicited offers, I will say, the assets we have in RE3 they are in the Dallas and Huston markets. Those markets are pretty strong, and we're just getting those to the point where it will be proper to mark, we don't want to mark them too early, but there is some interest once those things are stabilized, and that looks steady later half of year.", "Ryan Bennett - Lehman Brothers", "Got it. And what sorts of buyers are usually look after this pension funds, life insurance companies?", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "People want brand new product and those markets there is always a lot of buyers in those markets and yes, obviously people that can tap those sources, you've got management operations around those kind of assets. We will see how that plays out.", "Ryan Bennett - Lehman Brothers", "And just lastly, in dealings with your capital markets, have you seen any of the spreads lining out of any [inaudible] past quarter or so?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "You know, spreads what we have seen with those guys is that the absolute rate has actually stayed pretty constant. So, the spread has tended to widen and narrow sort of according to the\u2026 what happens with the underlying treasuries. But, if you're at the five-year end of the curve, you're kind of in the low to mid five, if you're at the 10-year end, you are probably in the high five somewhere, and that's been I think fairly consistent for the last several months.", "Ryan Bennett - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Great, thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.", "Haendel St. Juste - Green Street Advisors", "Hi, good morning. I guess, good afternoon for you guys, good morning for us. Tom just wanted to get some color from you. We have been hearing talks of portfolio discounting in the marketplace, I wanted to hear your thoughts on this, and if you could also discuss the tax spread the marketplace today, what do think it is when you could see that closing a bit?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I guess, bid ask, I\u2019d chime in and ask Mark for any more color there. It certainly seems like everything today is funneling through what Fannie and Freddie are able to lend at and that people are seeking anywhere from a 100 basis points to 150 basis points spread over that to get into this market. So, if they are landing at 5.25, seems to me that the market is at 6.25 to 6.75 and that's where people are able to transact with an ease of comfort about this economy and it's... whether it's slowing and at what pace. So I don't see that I guess I read the same research you do, [inaudible] looks like volume is up $5 billion a month which is about an average kind of pace in the year if you take out the LBOs. So it seems like transactions are getting done and seems like to us Fannie and Freddie are there, lending that of stabilized number, and proceeds are tightening in terms of what their coverage is are, so people have to put more equity. Seems to me in past experience when more equity is required, pace slows down, bid ask, trades lengthen out. Translated, I think it would be very tough for us to get our portfolio sales to be done today at the cap rate we did just 90 days ago. So, I think we've got a great execution in that calendar. Anything else you would add, Mark?", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "Just... a general commentary on the bid ask, I think the bid ask is nearing although there is still sellers out there that maybe the bid ask is 6% to 7% spread going in, I would say the last 30 days, the top end on the ask is they are coming off pretty quick, were as Tom mentioned before, earlier in this process, it was a slow process of negotiating the deal down, but... so I think they are narrowing, but there is still some people putting assets out there for sale at pretty high prices but they're happened to come off those, but the sellers seem to be getting a little more realistic now as Tom mentioned, because they are looking the ruby mirror and they are realizing that they can\u2019t sell those assets but they could have done six months ago.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "And on your point about portfolio sale, I think you are right on a point there is even when we are transacting our portfolio, we found a lot of buyers with a $100 million to $200 million of equity on a levered basis meaning they could buy $1 billion in the marketplace today. But you don't find a lot of people with $1 billion out in the marketplace, and so large portfolios are going to be hard to get done or they are going have to be club deals to get done. Anything under $1 billion is probably something that you would have interest from a number of buyers and probably get an auction going. Anything above that it appears to us that there is very, very few one-off buyers and so they translate to clubbing and that means clubbing both ways gets a little bit of a beating.", "Haendel St. Juste - Green Street Advisors", "Wasn't sure which clubbing you were talking about there.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. I understand. You're always bright. You will pick it up.", "Haendel St. Juste - Green Street Advisors", "I guess, any color you guys can share at this point on the Addison JV discussions you mentioned that this was going to be one of your near-term focuses. Anything you could share there?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I would say, yes. We have just gotten the money nailed down from the city with a sort of the numbers have been a little bit influx until we had that result. I think that's a significant priority for the rest of the year.", "Michael A. Ernst - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We got to be excited that for those of who are going to be DOI [ph] on the call later this week in Dallas, we are going to have a ground breaking ceremony on Thursday and should have a prominent section of the Wednesday Dallas morning new business page on this development. So, the city is turning out in mass. It's a defining moment for a small city, suburb of Dallas to bring the property of this caliber on line. So, I think that helps us, second, we have already leveled the significant number of the apartment homes and that's gone well and believe it or not even a demolition on an green play. So I think property is going to get a lot of press, we are in control of a, the development timing, the markets in the upswing. We think it's a good time to be knocking on doors, but don't feel compelled that we have to; it is a multi-based, multi-year deal.", "Haendel St. Juste - Green Street Advisors", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Richard Ole [ph] with ABG Investments. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, guys. Just a couple of questions. Hopefully, I didn't miss them, I had to hop off the call for a minute but have you guys looked at repurchasing any of your unsecured notes in the market. A couple of your, I guess competitors or other REITS have kind of nibbled at that. And it seem like there were at some point trading at the good discount. I have a follow-up also?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We bought back in February; space amount of the bonds was about $67 million bought them at a yield to maturity in the high 6s. And bought them about $4.5 million discount phase.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. The next question is did you guys provide an outlook for FFO and core NOI for 2Q?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, we did not. We are trying to get away from doing quarterly guidance. So we updated the year guidance but don't have anything for 2Q.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And then the follow-up question, Tom, you kind of gave a shout out earlier about I guess the self-insurance. And I think the question was relating to in part one of your peers excludes what they term casualty and losses from the same store not necessarily from operating expense but from the same store comparison and I guess you can approach it to... and I think in part, I don't want to speak with them but in part their argument was that with this core trend if you have a large sort of unpredictable one-time event and maybe you can just give me your take on that?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think everybody has their own right to make their own decision. It just struck me that, you wouldn't be excluding that, it seems like a cost of doing the business and maybe one of those things that you disclosed how much self-insurance risk you do take. And how you expect to manage it, and the rationale behind it. I am not critical of anyone; I just haven't heard that before. It caught me by surprise.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Right. And just to follow that up, how much of an influence on the expense rate this quarter was the comparison of somebody not throwing a toaster in the bathtub this year versus last year?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we hopefully we can stop smoking and sleep with the cigarettes these days.", "Jerry A. Davis - Senior Vice President, Property Operations", "This is Jerry. Given where our other expenses lined up like I said utilities were flat, repairs were up 3.5% to 3.8%, personnel was up 4%, taxes were up 4.2%, ad marketing was down 1.8%. If you had flat insurance, we probably would have been somewhere in that 3.5% to right about 3.5% growth range.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.", "Operator", "At this time I\u2019m showing no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the call back over to management for any concluding remarks that they may have.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, thank you operator and thank you all of you for participating on our call today. We hope to see you in June 2 in DC, which I think you will get to me, a significant member of the management team and towards some fabulous assets. So we look forward to seeing you there and with that wish you the best of luck for the rest of the earnings season and take care.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the UDR Inc. first quarter 2008 earnings conference call.

Second Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties would be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today on Tuesday the 5th of August, 2008.", "I'll now turn the conference over to Mr. Larry Thede, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Larry Thede - Vice President Investor Relations", "Thank you. And thanks to all of you for joining us for UDR's second quarter financial results conference call. Our second quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed yesterday and posted to our website www.udr.com. In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements.", "We'll begin the call with management comments and then open the call to your questions. I would like to note that statements made during this call which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in yesterday's press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.", "I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you Larry. I am joined on the call today by Mark Wallis, Warren Troupe, David Messenger and Jerry Davis. UDR had a very strong quarter on a number of fronts. I'll let the team fill in you on the details but first let me cover some highlights.", "The operating team did a great job, in particular achieving our 16th consecutive quarter of revenue growth. Based on July's results, it looks like we're now on our way to 70. We performed well in a number of areas but to stick out. We nearly reached 70% in NOI margin and we're approaching average rents of $1200 a month.", "On the development, redevelopment front, we delivered nearly 1000 homes, at returns exceeding our original underwriting. We've also provided enhanced disclosure in our earnings supplement to help investors understand the status of our activities. In the investment area, we continue to reap the benefits of our March 3rd portfolio sale.", "Since, March 31st we closed on $280 million of West Coast acquisitions, bringing us very close to completing the redeployment of our sales proceeds. To improve transparency, we're now producing a quarterly portfolio update which details on each of our top 20 markets, which is available on our website.", "On the capital front, we also continue to enjoy solid balance sheet. It's been great to be sitting on cash, especially during this very turbulent time. It is afforded us the chance to pick our spots and take advantage of market conditions. Now let me take a moment and share our views about the future.", "Reading countless autonomous forecasts and listening to a number of earnings calls, this quarter from our industry and others, I find that everyone have their queries on the economy for the balance of the year. Simply stated, we at UDR see so many cross currents, it's hard to forecast trends. For the near term, we believe that business is solid and that our capital flexibility will keep us safe during these highly volatile times.", "We intend to remain focus on what we can control. In particular, our value creation strategies in operations, development and redevelopment. Looking further out, we believe demographics limited new supply and portfolio positioning will work in our favor. And we remained very optimistic about our long term prospects.", "Now I will like to turn the call over to the team. First, Jerry Davis will discuss operations. Then Mark will cover development and redevelopment, and David will cover our capital markets activity and then we'll open it up for questions. Jerry?", "Jerry A. Davis - Senior Vice President of Property Operations", "Thanks Tom, and good afternoon everyone. Today, I would like to cover several topics. First, our revenue performance during the quarter, next our expense management and finally, our guidance for the remainder of the year.", "Because we're one of the last to reach to report, I won't spend time going over individual markets. We've heard what our piers have been telling you on their calls, generally we're in agreement with their views of the markets. One of our primary goals as an operating team here at UDR is to lead the individual markets and year-over-year revenue growth. Over the past several quarters, we've had great success doing this, primarily because of our superior location at the right price point.", "Additionally, we consistently look for ways to reinvest in our real estate with various revenue enhancing initiatives. Critical to our continuing success, as the exceptional performance of our site and regional operating teams. I would like to take this term and to personally thank all of my fellow associates here at UDR, who are dedicated to keeping our performance at the top in the industry.", "With most of the apartments REITs having reported their second quarter numbers, during six months it looks like we're leading 63% of our markets in revenue growth and we're leading 74% in NOI. During the quarter, we had NOI growth of 7.1% over last year. This was due by revenue growth of 4.4% and a decline in expenses of 1.2%. This performance is driven our same-store operating margin in the second quarter up to 69.2% an increase of 170 basis points.", "First, on the revenue side. Our effective rents increased 3.4% during the quarter and average occupancy was 20 basis points higher than last year at 94.9%. Revenue per occupied home is now pushing $1200. Looking at our markets, we saw growth in 19 of our 22 markets with declines coming only in the State of Florida. 17 of our 22 markets had sequential revenue growth which drove our same-store revenue growth to 1.2% over the first quarter. This marks the 16th consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth.", "On the expense side, our expenses for the quarter were 1.2% under last year's second quarter. When, I look at our expenses the categories of payroll, utilities, taxes, and repairs and maintenance that makeup about 85% of total expenses grew by 3.9%. The remaining 15% of expenses which is made up of insurance and administrative and marketing cost decreased 30%. I'd like to speak of these decreases.", "Insurance expense was again down due to lower third party premiums compared to last year, as well as much better loss experience. The administrative and marketing cost side, we come down primarily as a result of our continued elimination of print advertising. We expect to totally be out of print at our stabilized properties by the end of this year. Since 2005, we've brought our marketing cost down from $155 per home per year to $95 per home.", "In the second quarter of 2008, 46% of our movements actually originated from Internet sources. This is up 8% compared to the second quarter of 2007. With our recent web enhancement, we expect this trend to continue going forward. Last, how do we see the balance of this year playing out? Well, I've listened as our piers have told you over week that revenue growth will moderate during the second half of the year. We see the same deceleration occurring.", "For us, this will be caused primarily by lower job growth, higher prices of the pump as well as other consumer goods. And lastly total revenue comparisons in the second-half of the year. Since rents continue to grow at a good pace in 2007, a lot of the year-over-year growth in the first six months of this year was actually the result of the rent increases achieved last year. With rent growth slowing over the last six to nine months, year-over-year comparisons will moderate. That being said, our revenue growth has remained strong throughout the first-half of the year at 4.6%.", "We feel very good about our performance so far and our revenue guidance for the full year remained at 4% to 4.5% range. We're about half way through our summer leasing season. Traffic compares well to last year.", "We look at our occupancy for same-store properties, last week we stood at 95.4% physical occupancy, that's 30 basis points higher than we were at the same week last year.", "Although pricing power is challenging and all of our best markets. We do feel like we'll be able to push occupancy during the last half of the year. We also believe that we'll be able to continue to see sequential revenue growth for the remainder of 2008.", "Year-to-date, our expenses are 1% lower than that were last year. But we think the second half of the year will be higher. We began seeing favorable insurance loss experience, both on the property and healthcare side in the second half of last year.", "We also had positive real estate tax accrual adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2007. Because of this, we expect that our third and fourth quarter expense comparisons will be more difficult from the first half of 2008.", "Our guidance for expense growth remained to 3% to 3.5% for the full year. Although we will do everything possible to come in below that level, we do recognize that we're being compared to very low expenses last year.", "With that I'll turn the call over to Mark.", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "Thanks Jerry. I am going to provide just a brief update of our acquisition redevelopment and development activities for the quarter.", "First, on the status of our repositioning and the use of our 1031 exchange proceeds resulting from the $1.7 billion sale in March. Since our last call, we've added 546 homes in California and 455 homes in Seattle using 1031 proceeds. We will complete these remaining proceeds by the end of this month; we'll use two of our development pre sales as part of that exchange, the one in Peoria Arizona and in Tampa Florida, those who are listed on Exhibit 8 (c).", "In addition we are negotiating a little more powerful acquisition for $59 million and we do expect to proceed on that purchase within the next few days. At that point our exchange will be complete with around 4300 homes, purchased on average cap rate of 5%.", "It's important to note that, at least 72% of the assets we acquired are in targeted coastal markets of California, Metro Washington DC and Washington State. 80% of those assets will be the less than 10 years old and I want to point out the remaining 20% will be rehab by our very experienced redevelopment team.", "Second, just a review where our developing pipelines stand to say Exhibit ratio of the pipeline at $2.6 billion. I want to break that down, it should be noted that $149 million of development and redevelopment projects have now been completed. The development projects are leasing up well and redevelopment completions are now leased up and producing yields between 7% and 8%.", "Our in house development and redevelopment seems to have $885 million inactive developments. We have $541 million of pipeline being run by third party development groups under our JV and development presale programs.", "Then a little over $1 billion or 47% of this pipeline has not been started. We refer to these as our warehouse assets of which approximately 80% produce income today.", "Let's take a quick overview of the portfolio repositioning and now I will turn it call over to David Messenger.", "David L. Messenger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks Mark. Our second quarter was relatively flat in the capital markets area. We continue to make progress against our initiatives. We continue to execute our share repurchase program buying back 963,200 shares of our common stock an average price of $23.65 per share approximately 5.4% discount to yesterday's close.", "We also repurchased $35 million of debt at an average yield of 632. We took advantage of favorable floating rates and drew down the remaining capacity in two of our secured facilities for a total of $55 million currently floating at 3%.", "We believe this will further insulate us from continued volatility as the capital markets and the GSEs. In addition, since the close of the second quarter we have closed on approximately $50 million of construction loans, with another $100 million in process that we expected to close in the next 45 to 60 days.", "Going forward, we'll continue to assess the markets for share and bond repurchases from possible debt issuances. We're seeing a great deal of invested capital, sitting on the sidelines, waiting to be put to work often at very attractive rates.", "Consequently, even though we have funding capacity to grow of our capital and debt obligations through 2010, we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to extend our current maturities and to continue to strengthen our balance sheet. As we previously stated, the calculation on our special dividend would be completed after August 30th when the section 1031 time period expires.", "The amount of its special dividend remains in a range of $130 million to a $190 million. Upon completion of the calculations, we will review the current market, capital resources, and share price to determine the divided component, cash, stock or combination of both.", "As we head into the second half of the year, we have a solid balance sheet with 230 million in cash and substantial financial flexibility. While this may be causing some short term earnings dilution with cash currently invested at 2.5%. We believe that position does well to find our strategic objectives and we continue to deliver long term value for our shareholders.", "Now I will turn the call back to over to Tom.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks David and operator we're now ready for questions.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen at this time we will begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question from the line of Michael Bilerman please state your company followed by your question.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi this is David Toddy [ph] here with Michael. Just a couple of quick questions, to start with development. Has there been any changes to your underwritings relative to costs expected stabilized yields and the timing?", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "This is Mark Wallis, no; there has not been any significant changes at this point. As you can see the pipeline remains fairly stabilized so is volume. So nothing at this point we try to underwrite those conservatively and so far, that's held.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great. And then relative to the shadow pipeline it appears that it's increased in scale. Can you just provide some color on those additions?", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "Are you referring to... I guess the last Exhibit pay test [ph]. It moved I believe part of it is we've moved part of the trivial [ph] over there or just because those are lighter places which are the income producing assets on there.", "And in addition we've moved, we should go back to where that is a site we have that has entitlements but we're finding those entitlements at this time and we would term that entry in this development a little bit later than originally thought.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And forgive me I joined the call a little bit late, but could you talk a little bit about the traffic and the price tolerance that you're seeing of incoming customers in June and July?", "Jerry A. Davis - Senior Vice President of Property Operations", "Traffic, this is Jerry. Traffic's holding up pretty steady with last year. It's gone up just a hair and that's probably because we rolled out our level one call center in at the end of the... we are in the middle of rather the second quarter. And that's helped push traffic higher, so we don't miss any phone calls any longer.", "Pricing, we have pricing strength up in the Pacific North West as well as Northern California. We're typically seeing 4% to 5% increases on either renewals or incoming people over what they have prior resident was paying. I'd say for the rest of the country with the exception of Florida, Phoenix and the England Empire we're probably seeing in the 2% range and then when you get to Florida, Phoenix and the England Empire it's roughly flat.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great. And then just lastly, just had a quick question on a strategy which is probably in the acquired longer asset, but could you just give us a sense of what your team is thinking relative to the growth focus today, now that you've gone through this sort significant transformation? Would you characterize your focus more as internal now? Do you still feel there are sort of large scale external opportunities?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "This is Toomey. At this point in time, I think what's our view would be, first interest rates is going to rise. And interest rates rising usually indicates that asset pricing is going to fall. What's the timing of those two events, we think it's slowly easing into it. I mean you look at spreads today and you look at base rates, there really doesn't seem to be a whole lot of pressure up and as a result you are not seeing a whole lot of pressure on asset pricing. So the thing is one of these cases where a lot of people are waiting around for assets to appreciably dropping value, we don't see that happening. We see a slight drop, probably another 5% to 10% more.", "It's not going to be a great feeding frenzy that it was in the '80s or even the '90s. By virtue NOIs are pretty solid, there is no new supply until I would tell you I think from external standpoint, we're going to continue to look and pick our spots in markets where we think we can add some value redeveloping our operations that our second growth strategy is continue to focus on this development pipeline which looks to be delivering $400 million to $500 million on an annual basis that are 100 to 150 basis points over what we can get in market.", "And I think those are the primary growth strategies that we have at this time and see that if we play our capital prudently and be patient that by the year 2010 you got a large demographic swell coming right at you and you just got to be in the right market presenting the right product and it's still going to come down to where the job markets are in 2010. And I think we have our portfolio positioned right in those corridors where people are going to be getting jobs right out of college and those are pretty good targeted group. So, I think that's our strategy over the next three, four year period.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great. Thanks for the call today.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Michael Gorman. Please state your company name followed by your question.", "Michael Gorman - Credit Suisse", "Thanks, good afternoon. It's Credit Suisse. Can you just spend a little bit time on you guidance I guess I'm a little bit confused on the moving parts. It looks like your operational guidance is projecting a pretty significant fall off in the second half, but if you look at the FFO guidance continued in acceleration in the quarterly run rate to get there on the second quarter. Can you just give us a little bit more breakdown on what's actually moving in and out of the guidance at this point?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Jerry I'll cover the kind of the operation guidance for the balance of the year. From an FFO standpoint there is a couple of things that are you're not seeing right now which is broaden some assets and then lease up and you have lot of redevelopment assets coming back on line as well as development come in. And so second half of the year, we're forecasting goals assets to generate more than they did this last quarter. Jerry.", "Jerry A. Davis - Senior Vice President of Property Operations", "Well,I'll just reiterate what already said. On the expense side, we get kept guidance at 3% to 3.5% that is based purely on tough comparisons to last year when we had very low insurance in the second half of the year as well as a real estate tax adjustment. We are hopeful we can and under that but it's still tough. The one thing we do see is that revenue has slowed from the first half of the year. We don't see it decelerating at a great pace, July right on planned what we expected but those are really what we say.", "Michael Gorman - Credit Suisse", "Okay and one follow up. What was the timing like on the 960,000 share repurchase, how much did that add to the quarterly results?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Minimal.", "Michael Gorman - Credit Suisse", "Okay thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Rob Stevenson. Please state your company name followed by your question.", "Robert Stevenson - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "It's FPK. Good afternoon guys. Tom when you are thinking about redevelopments, how does the economic outlook play into that and from that standpoint, what do you expect to start over the next 12 months or so in terms of new redevelopments?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "I'll let Mark take a lead on that and I'll follow up.", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "Well, you can see we are really finished a lot and we moved through back into the fully leased stabilized status and I think we did hit the market pretty well with several of those. Going forward, we're really tackling some deals as for a little bit harder in that couple more in California.", "So I think that range of homes that are being production where they were 4000 based on working on firming and entitlements we may have more than we're working on but actually productions to be more 1500 homes here to take. That's what we see going forward. Now we like the business a lot. We've had very good returns there some the market are changes in response we have ability to do more that's what we see right now.", "Robert Stevenson - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "What's generally the thing that you start to see because as you would say hey let's pull back on investing dollars on redevelopment because we are not going to get money out the other end", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "A lot of it's just trying a lot product frankly. We've done a lot of our product and with our sale we did and repositioning net down 40 some thousand homes there is less to do that fit our criteria. So target is fine where our products I mentioned in the couple of our acquisitions do fit that criteria. So it's somewhat limited by overall market factors but then also finding the right products.", "Robert Stevenson - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Okay.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well pull back decision for us would be primarily driven around the rent structure. And we think when we start one of these or we get a pretty good handle on it, we got good solid handle on the cost structure of it. What may often weigh our decision is where do we see rent and that's where you see us moving towards the West Coast or in our case the district in DC.", "Those markets are still as Jerry has said where you've got pricing power, you feel strong about the market and the prospects and we think we can take assets offline there and bring them back and get the rents that are better than today's markets trend itself.", "I think that's what would really weigh us down Robert and that's been our plan all along was to move towards the coast in our redevelopment strategy and Mark's right in terms of the number of homes you see but if you look at the net throughput of rents that we're deriving from those it's about the same level of dilution on a consistent basis.", "Robert Stevenson - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Okay. Just a follow-up when you take a look out there and you see what the reasons are for moving out and sort of the profile of your tenants I mean how much of an impact do you think it might have on closing the turnover the back door in terms of turnover from the elimination of some of these down payments at system programs on a single-family side?", "Jerry A. Davis - Senior Vice President of Property Operations", "I think it's kind of difficult to tell right now. I think with the new laws out or the new home owner's systems program, it obviously going to help some people jump into the first house. But you still have a huge cost difference between leasing and owning and most of our markets, especially out in the West Coast and D.C. Area, it's not clear yet how much it's going to help.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "This is Toomey. At this level I would add to that is the psychology of a purchase of a home is still very damaged, and once you get passed the economics and the tax incentives would you invest in something that you knew the price was going to go down another 10%.", "Most rationally people won't and we think that going to prevail for sometime and when it will reverse, you'll see it like anything else it was down turn. You'll see it in certain markets at certain price points. We think the way we are positioned, California, the West Coast being 50% of the portfolio now; it's got a long way to go before those people get back into the game in our opinion.", "Robert Stevenson - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "What's the move outs of home purchases running this past quarter?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "This quarter it was 13.5%. That's the same as it was in the first quarter but last year and second quarter it was 16.7%. So it's down quite a bit.", "Robert Stevenson - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from line of Dustin Pizzo. Please state your company name followed by your question.", "Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities", "Banc of America. I guess its David or Tom, was any of the positive impact from the debt repurchase or the common stock repurchase factored into guidance previously?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "This is Toomey. The guidance that was given was really done at beginning of the year and which we had contemplated significantly more share repurchases and no debt repurchases, and as the market has progressed the share prices have risen to an attractive level but not to a point where we would buy them and that has presented an opportunity. And so in my calculus of looking at their kind of two are offsetting each other but it wasn't the original plan it's more of the consequences of the environment.", "Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. So then as you look to the back half, can you comment on what you're currently thinking there as far as either continued repurchases or continue activity on the debt side?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes,I think we'll be active in both depending on the price and based on your call notes and the results thereon.", "Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. And then just thinking about on the debt side, I guess first what was the coupon and the maturity date of the bonds that you repurchased?", "David L. Messenger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "See coupon was 5.5% and the maturity were $2.14.", "Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities", "Okay, so I guess, how do you think about given that we're in a pretty difficult environment here, you think the rates are probably rising in the future, you look at the yield to maturity of 6-3 that they are repurchased at versus the comment. Should we take that to mean that you guys are assuming less than kind of 6%-3% return on the comment going forward here?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "No we didn't try to look at it both, I mean one, if I comment considering a number of things, both your liquidity position. Where do you think your NAB is and where do you think your price will be in the future? The debt we really looked at the inside of the trait. If we think today we could issue secured or unsecured debt inside a fix and extend the maturities. And the market gives you an opportunity to buy $35 million on a $3.2 billion debt.", "Okay, you take advantage of it. It's not that big of a number. Kind of interesting opportunity to buy at below par we thought why not. It's a big deep market at that discount? Probably not. The shares you can pretty much look at where we've been buying them for the last three year-to- date. And gather where we think our NABs and where we think a good discount is. So well we bought was 6 million shares, something like that, year-to-date inside a 24 stock's trading at 26 today, but we're not buying today.", "Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities", "Fair enough. Thanks.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "No, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Rich Anderson. Please state your company name followed by your question.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital", "I am with BMO and this question is for Toomey.. I just want to say that.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Some day I am going to be able to respond in stand or two Rich.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital", "Actually I am in notice for Toomey, but anyway the questions on that special dividend, and I guess Mark it was you said that once you finished some of these acquisitions there you have right on the immediate landscape that you'll be done with the redeployment process of the portfolio sales. But that doesn't... you are saying that in addition to that you will do another special dividend of about 150 and a special dividend the range of about $150 million, is that right? It gets you to a 150 million shy of the $1.7 billion.", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "Toomey here, Would tell the range on your special dividend and the timing in that.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "The range of special dividend Rich is still the 130 to 190.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital", "Right.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "And that's contemplating the acquisitions that Mark is queuing up and closing over the course of... from today through August 30th.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital", "Okay. So then the other question is, if I'm right and I think you guys said this in your Investor Day that you actually sort of looked at two and half times the amount of acquisitions that you would actually need to buy...right to eliminate some of the pressures that might come from people knowing that you are a buyer. And so have you given any thoughts of saying, you know what let's strap the special dividend idea and let's just... let's go buy more assets?", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "This is Mark; let me speak to that, I mean... we've bought nearly 4200 homes towards... kind of $1 billion and so of acquisitions. So...and we have ...we did identify over two times in our assets were we've closing gone through we've traded one against another as we've got through these closings, we are just down to a really one asset.", "We have one competing with that, we think we picked the one we are going to pick. So in this last trade actually I had two assets competing against each other. So we're just out of the end now.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital", "Okay.", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "So I don't have any ...the assets that I have left had identified I can think of a couple but on the surface look pretty good as far as the marking the location we can't get too impressed there are market for us to buy.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Rich it's Toomey and in addition to that. One year against the short market if you will. I am 1031 expires at the end of august. Mark and his teams traded a number of assets and you kind of get to a point where you say, wait a minute. We think cap rates are moving a little bit. If the sellers are not going to move their price, is it really serving a judiciary duty to just pay up? So, that to pay a special dividend. And I just can't bring myself to do that, and I think that's been the discipline we've forced upon ourselves as I say that's why we gave you a range to 130 to 190.", "We didn't want to back ourselves into a corner and say all of a sudden we've changed our mind we wanted to buy more assets. That's because we thought we could get good prices. We didn't get good prices. We weren't going to buy the damn real estate and we always thought about it that way. Its more discipline on our part, than it is to try to do anything else so.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital", "Okay. So, then the other question is the stock up as high as it is at this point. I mean does that give you a sense to issue more in a way of a stock dividend or a cash dividend. It might be better for you as a company to issue the stock as a dividend, but maybe investors wouldn't be thrilled to get it to 26.50 as they might at 23%.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think as we've talked to shareholders, a lot of them viewed is a stock split. And so it's not diluted to them or just getting pro-rata share that they had before, and if they so elect to monetize it by selling the, company has got capital and if the shares would fall they viewed as positive by virtue of people, we would be able to jump in and support the stock if they had a number.", "Other people have said just send me the cash. And right now we are lending out and saying what's the best thing both given the economic environment that we are dealing in, the stock price environment and the value of cash. And I tell you that I am more driven by the long term value of the enterprise and one quarter of earnings or even the next six months of earnings.", "So we're going to play through that, we'll have a pretty damn good picture after August 31st. We finish the 1031 period, we get the auditors in here, we get the tax people in here to sign off on the tax calculation and then we figure out exactly where the market is.", "And we'll be very upfront with everybody about the rationale behind whatever decision is ultimately reached.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital", "Okay. A quick one here, any additional debt free purchases in the current 2008 guidance?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "No.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital", "Okay. And then my last question is; I need to just further understand the development pipeline and I know you said you moved some things from the sort of the underdevelopment to the future development category. But can you explain how that happened mechanically? You'd spent money up until the first quarter on these four assets that moved from the under development to the future development. So how do you account for that in terms of the money that's has already been spent sort of from the balance sheet because you expected to do it eventually or how does that work?", "David L. Messenger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "This is David yes, those dollars are still good on the balance sheet in terms of our being capitalized cost. We're still going forward with, like Mark spoke to you about Mission Bay [ph]. We're on the top to give you the entitlement knowing the work is done we are just meeting from fine tuning to it and that caused us to move it from our so it today being developed through a future development activity.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital", "Okay. But is there any chance that any of these would be shelf completely?", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "From the past... no I don't think so in that case now. Soon these assets I guess the print started growing at 40% in San Diego which actually I guess it's not totally out of the room for the possibility, you might delay you doing it, but no. All of these we feel are good solid opportunities. I think we're trying to communicate to that we are trying to be prudent about when we bring these on to the pipeline that match up market conditions. And that's where we're hoping to communicate there, but no, they are all in good solid shape, very good size.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital", "Okay. Thank you Wallis.", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "And the one they have mentioned in admission we haven't probably today; we got a window we can better it. And so we feel like we had to do that, just create more value that way.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital", "Okay.That's it for me. Thank you.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "This is Toomey signing off too.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital", "Thanks Toomey.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Sameer Upadhyay [ph]. Please state your company name followed by your question.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Sameer Upadhyay from FBR Capital Markets. Can you please talk a little bit about your thoughts on the GSE financing environment spreads and the overall availability?", "Warren Troupe - Senior Executive Vice President", "Yes, this is Warren. In terms of GSEs we're still seeing a very aggressive action in terms that their willingness to make secured loans and we have not seen any pull back. There's been pulled back on a secured loan I think a couple of our peers have noted that its still 100 to 150 basis points less than some of the unsecured financing. So it's still very attractive financing.", "Unidentified Analyst", "But you only rate on a 5 or 7 or 10?", "Warren Troupe - Senior Executive Vice President", "Our normal rate are five, is still five or six, in that.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "I think one thing to recognize thing is that that if you can get back your money at 5-6 its going support cap rates for where back rates are at. And so you got positive NOI growth and you got a 5-6 debt number and you can get 70% proceeds. Your return on equity on a levered basis, moderate growth is still going to be probably about 12. That's pretty attractive in this environment. So we think real estate is going to hold up.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Just another question. Your views on the Florida markets, you look at cap, its negative. I think its been a couple of quarters it's negative and what's your view going forward?", "Jerry A. Davis - Senior Vice President of Property Operations", "This is jerry. Tampa does continue to be our worst market right now as far as growth. We think it's probably going to stumble along the bottom, may be for another 12 months, that's at least what we're hearing. Has a lot of speculator homes or just a shadow market, we do perform better I can tell you up that was on that Atlas County side than we do on Hills Burrow side but Tampa, it's tough to call it bottom but hopefully we're in it, and it's not going to get worse.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Did they get many worse right now?", "Jerry A. Davis - Senior Vice President of Property Operations", "No its not really its getting bottom and... closing on the bottom. So you ought to start anniversary soft numbers and start being able to get some growth, start next year. Yes.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Don't call it a recovery just call bottom in.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thanks", "Operator", "Thanks. Your next question is from the line of Michael Salinsky. Please state your company name followed by your question.", "Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Market", "Mike Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets. Real quickly, your performance in South Carolina and its areas and that such and Southern California has been well above your peer group. To what do you attribute that to, is it redevelopment, is it people training down A assets to D assets, is it market positioning, what's the driver behind that?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "He just answered the question. It's actually a lot of that. In Orange county where we stated this before and we firmly believe it, we have great coastal locations, we're located the west of the 405. We do think we're at the right price points where some of those peoples those have lost their lending jobs last year had traded down to us in our average French and Orange Counties in the 1400 to 1500 range. People were paying 22,300 have come down to us. We had an active kitchen and bath program there over the last several years that have helped profits up in modernize some of our 1968 to 1972 product.", "And the other think I think as we have a real stable operating team in Southern California and there is really even other some new product popping up in Ravine [ph] as well Anatine [ph] in our more direct backyard of New Port and the Huntington beach in coast we've really not seen that product, that's the Orange County.", "And the England Empire just we looked great there but keep in mind we have three properties. One is a development that we completed I think in 2006. We finished a lease up there last year about mid-year we were still heavily in the concession for first half of the year and those were burned off, anniversary high concession and we eliminated concessions there around the third quarter or so.", "Other two assets are probably around break even and that one property is in fit in Rand Rodomont [ph] I think struck either, that one is doing extremely well. San Diego is also doing very well, and a lot of that is... we own a lot in north San Diego County, and as the... they cater a bit to the military market and then this represent we do well and we have done extremely well there.", "Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Market", "Okay. Second question with the acquisitions you made around five at year I think you mentioned in the last call that you anticipated being pretty close to north of the six by the end of 2009. Is that still the case given what you see in the markets right now?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "That's your call Mark.", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "Can you repeat that.", "Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Market", "Yes, previous call you have mentioned that, you know, why you are buying these assets at low cap rates these are the growth opportunities for phenomenon which have been north of the six followed by a the end of 2009 at this point, that still the case given what you are seeing across the markets right now.", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "I think generally that's still the case where we underwrote those assets yet.", "Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Market", "Okay. Third question is fixed charge coverage has continued to come down here over the past couple of quarters. Is that something that you are going to be able to grow into with properties and lease that you are bringing on line or is it possibly you have to sell additional assets next year to fund to continue capital spending and growth efforts?", "David L. Messenger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "This is Dave. We'll improve that as the assets come out online, second half of this year going into '09.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "This is Toomey. We have on the 2010, all our funding obligation are already met. So we don't see the need for capital raise. What we see it as an opportunistic window market presents itself those things we do.", "Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Market", "But you're not pushing up any close to any covenants.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "No.", "Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Market", "And then finally, just subjugate as quarter end, have you repurchased any shares or bought back any additional debt?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "No.", "Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Market", "Okay. Thank you.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Operator, are we done?", "Operator", "Sorry, our next question is from the line of Alex Goldfarb. Please state your company name followed by your question.", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS", "Hi, UBS. Good morning out there.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi Alex.", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS", "Sorry, I hopped on late so I apologize if you already addressed some of this stuff, but just wanted to go back on the special dividend and the one cash balance. Is the $190 million top end of the special dividend, is that what would happen if you did all the acquisitions that are planned? So try another way if you don't do all the acquisitions that are planned and you get to that deadline on the 1031 money, then the special dividend could potentially exceed the $190 million?", "David L. Messenger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "No it's the top level, assuming we don't close anything in the next 29 days... 28 days.", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS", "Okay. So if the cash in the 1031 accounts stay there then that would get you through the $190 million.", "David L. Messenger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "That is correct.", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS", "Okay. And from a modeling perspective or guidance were you giving other income for the year, your expectations?", "David L. Messenger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "No. We haven't changed any of that. I believe at the beginning of the year, we said already three end come and still don't believe there is any.", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS", "Okay. And then just the other stuff running through there is fairly interest income?", "David L. Messenger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Interest income, correct.", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS", "Okay. And then on development side, whether your peers... some write downs, want to get a sense from you guys how comfortable you are with the land on your books, the way it's strengthening?", "David L. Messenger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "I don't think we bought any land with anticipation of building condos like some of our peers.", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS", "And what about the new rentals developments?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "You're talking that rental acquisitions?", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS", "Yes...", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Now we are very comfortable with those. And I think Tom spoke to the fact that we think there is fact where cap rates still in there... they are steady right now. We've been pretty active in several markets. And so we feel really good by our acquisitions and there is a rent growth that's in front of us on all of those and we think on our development side that, we are in very good position there and for our unit cost.", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Paula Poskon. Please state your company name followed by your question.", "Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird", "With Robert Baird. I have an operational question for you about just generally speaking what percentage would you say of your tenant base is involved in some sort of automated rent payment either from direct dividend of their checking account or to a credit card?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Currently, it is pretty low. We're actually in the process of rowing out ACH payment throughout our portfolio we're testing it at a seven or eight locations right now. So it's a low percentage right now.", "Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay, thank you.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Paula.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from line of Anthony Paolone. Please state your company name followed by question.", "Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan", "Thanks JP Morgan. First question, on the presales, can you give us an update as to where you think those yields will come in at?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Well, I think we're still in usual range that we disclosed. As Tom mentioned our acquisitions are at least 150 basis points better that what we can basically softened when those probably more like 175-180 basis points, over... they are still isn't leased up so we are reported how they come out but we're still in a pretty good range there.", "Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan", "So, for the assets like 15x temp Orlando [ph] being three of four that has been a significant amount of gymnasium [ph] and what maybe the yield you're expecting in those markets?", "W. Mark Wallis - Senior Executive Vice President", "We had seven plus percent yield on Phoenix and that might be more to 7 or 7.5 we've still started to lease up there so that's yet to determined. Orlando we've actually 87% leased I think we've leased 35 homes so that actually has been surprising that we had pretty conservative underwriting on that we did that a couple of years ago I remember that it was a couple of years ago.", "So that's been actually better than expected to give in the wind of marketing in Tampa. We've not turned into units yet its an interior location in that part of that market area. We've locked that location through urban infield spot and so it will be little bit difficult from the typical suburban markets that or may be softer.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Offsetting that you've got that those are flat or slightly below and you've got plus which Texas, California and Seattle all probably going to be well.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Right and as mentioned we have a asset where in lease up for the development in phase 2 Lincoln Town Square in Dallas. This is still little bit of back to report but we're 50 leases at that project in July. Probably enclosed with 60 and we've been since the numbers, so in Texas its pretty strong.", "Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan", "Okay. So when you roll up all of this stuff it doesn't sound like its too for up to mark?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "That's not characterized.", "Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan", "Okay. And second question, you commented about the move out home ownership rate being heading down to 13% by any chance you have a track where your tenants are for coming from. And whether there's been any meaningful trends on that front?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "You know I'm hard date on that, if you're asking and getting it foreclosures or we're getting people from suburban locations any more infill, we are feeling some of that but I really can't quantify with accuracy.", "Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan", "Yes, I mean whether it's a foreclosure not just the idea of home ownership rate coming down and maybe folks coming back in from a house if there's been any trend there that's indiscernible.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Nothing they could that I've seen.", "Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan", "Okay, thank you.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Thanks Sam, Tony.", "Operator", "All right thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from the line of Jeff Donnelly. Please state your company name followed by your question.", "Jeffrey Donnelly - Wachovia Securities", "Yes, Wachovia and my first question just concern of the product you're seeing in acquisition market, are you easing any noticeable shift in the mix of assets available for purchase such as more redevelopment projects and stabilized or any more products in second year cities and kind of 24/7 locations?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "I think we're not looking at those secondary markets, so I really can't speak to that although I don't think there's been any dramatic change in the current market ad you can see in those markets. Do you think there has been which as been good for us it has been more urban in-field product its on real ends or near real ends or near urban retail and we've been able to take advantage of that.", "We haven't seen a lot of rehabbed product under markets we as I mentioned we had a couple kind of that we wanted to do provide that expertise and do rehab work on but there hasn't... what we've seen and haven't seen a lot of that top product its been some newer developments in these more than urban locations.", "Jeffrey Donnelly - Wachovia Securities", "And what was competition like I am curious to floor assets you just acquired and it may be used at as a mechanism just talking about how has the competitive environment changed for acquisition this level for last six to 12 months do you we seen it improve?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "I think it has improved and I think this term, if you look at may be the early summer of the last year when you look at the asset pretty good to the August, September time frame of the last year. That in the top assets that you see we bought in Washington State and in California. They were typically ten 10 bidders and you've been invited of best in final of may be five to six with us there and it was highly competitive a lot of care [ph] compression. I think on these higher end assets there has been improvement over may be 25 or 30 basis points because what we saw they were probably five real bidders versus 10.", "So it was a better environment to buy, but there still were competitive buyers out there but fewer. And we also stepped down and chase some assets a couple of assets like Allan's where they were completing their lease up and we will and that near of the number bidder's down because we're comfortable with to finish that lease.", "Jeffrey Donnelly - Wachovia Securities", "I guess here is a follow and may be in earlier question on Tampa, I guess is that your view with the company on markets at Vegas to Phoenix or Orlando similar in that and that they might reach bottom in '09 and I guess wanted to take three guys to get more aggressive on allocating capital some of those challenge markets over the next 12 to 18 months?", "Jerry A. Davis - Senior Vice President of Property Operations", "Jerry, it might have space to what do you see as a slower I think we spoken to that probably Phoenix and Tampa, Orlando are close to bottom. As Tom mentioned we'll look for opportunities and be opportunistic there. We don't see things compelling out there in those markets right now. Anything you want to there?", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "I would agree with that, Tampa, Orlando has been trailing along the bottom. Phoenix over the last couple months did get quite a bit worse. Luckily we have only have three properties there. But, Phoenix did turn south this past quarter. We're hopefully in our quarter at least 2009, things pop and '09 probably a little bit later trailing Florida I would think Phoenix comes back.", "Jeffrey Donnelly - Wachovia Securities", "Just one last question. Does your 2008 guidance contemplate any common shares repurchases but through the remainder of the year?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "We gave guidance at the beginning of the year it had a significant amount of share repurchases of which we've not completed and so it's really hard for us to look out the next five months and say we are going to be able to excluding more share repurchases given where the stock trading, you guys are frustrated as we are but if you see it up 5% one day and down seven the next and its all other period to tied for us to have any forecasting accuracy about what we're going to be able to do or not do.", "And so yes it was an original guidance, that is correct we have not changed it. Our contemplation is that to be responsible to the market and our part is not to tie ourself to the next quarter or the next six months earnings but we've prudent capital locator's thoughtful about what we have to put in our capital, so I think we're going to continue that posture we don't see any material change and reason for change in our guidance.", "Jeffrey Donnelly - Wachovia Securities", "Great. Thanks guys.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. There are no further questions at this time I'll turn the call back to Mr. Toomey for any closing comments.", "Thomas W. Toomey - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Operator and for everyone on the call we appreciate your time today and know that you got a few other calls. So we will say goodbye, wish you the best and take care.", "Operator", "Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude the UDR Inc. Second Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call.

For those who are a little less intense and cannot bear the media coverage of the election tonight, the movie Get Smart comes out on DVD.", "Overall the third quarter was a good quarter. Our operations performed on plan in spite of deteriorating fundaments. We raised over $300 million in equity and debt and recently renegotiated a 2010 maturing credit facility extending the maturity to 2018 increasing the size at a blended rate of 4.8%. This proves that even in a volatile market capital is available for well-capitalized companies who can move quickly.", "We completed the deployment of our exchange fund with the acquisition of five communities for $286 million. We also completed over 1,000 homes or nearly $200 million in development and redevelopment. Lastly, we finalized the special dividend at $132 million to be paid in January 2009.", "On the subject of the economy it is very easy to be caught up in the minute-by-minute data but I might suggest a couple key points. Yes, the capital markets are volatile but with unprecedented action taken by the government and the potential for more to come on so many fronts, we have to keep in mind that these actions will take some time to change the course of our economy. But they will change the course.", "The recession, they all come and they all pass. No segment of the economy will escape. Over the last 60 years we have endured 10 recessions and they\u2019ve lasted anywhere from eight to 16 months each. When our management team backs up and looks at today\u2019s economic environment, we realize we cannot predict what will happen but we can prepare. While it might be easy to sit back and let the recession and capital markets run their course, we have been adjusting our tactics to ensure we manage the capital markets and recessions to prepare UDR to take advantage of the inevitable opportunities.", "Let me turn the call over to Jerry Davis and the rest of the team to discuss specific areas.", "Jerry Davis", "While our third quarter operating results of 3.4% revenue growth and 6.6% expense growth are not as strong as previous quarters, they are what we expected and what we previously communicated they would be. Revenues will continue to moderate in our market as the economies worsen. Expenses were up quite a bit this quarter due to very low comparisons in the third quarter of 2007. That being said if you look at our year-to-date numbers, our revenue was increased 4.1%, expenses were up 1.7% and NOI has grown by 5.3%.", "I would like to point out that we do see further deceleration in revenue growth in the fourth quarter and we once again will be challenged in expense growth due to very low comparisons from the fourth quarter of 2007. These are related to low insurance expense as well as favorable real estate tax adjustments we took in the fourth quarter of 2007.", "When we look at our revenue growth in the third quarter of 3.4%, it is important to realize that Florida which makes up 17% of our same-store NOI experienced a 1.5% revenue decline. If you throw out Florida\u2019s results, like I\u2019m sure Al Gore wishes he could have done eight years ago, our revenue growth was 4.7%.", "Our strongest markets continue to be in Northern California where job growth has been 1.1% to date and new supply has been limited. While we have felt a softening in Southern California, we continue to feel that our superior locations at the right price points have enabled us to continue to outperform the market in Orange County. Our coastal locations west of the 405 Freeway continued to be where people want to live in Orange County. I\u2019d like to remind everyone that the average Orange County occupancies have historically not fallen below 93%.", "Prior to moving to Denver a year ago, I ran this portfolio for UDR. I can tell you from personal experience that besides superior locations at the right price point and a very seasoned operating team running those properties, we have continued to invest in these properties both on their exteriors and interiors. With the average property in Orange County being over 30 years old, and that\u2019s not just us, that\u2019s the entire inventory of the County, and most of the product being privately owned we are confident that our properties are in better condition than our competition and we will continue to outperform the market as we have over the past four years.", "Finally, Florida continues to suffer from an oversupply of housing, both apartments as well as single family. While we have begun to see some encouraging signs recently in Tampa, we are concerned about future job losses that could hit all of the Florida markets.", "Occupancy for same-store communities for the third quarter was 95.1%. That\u2019s 10 basis points higher than last year. 13 of our 22 markets were the same or higher than last year. Also on our occupancy report that we produce weekly, last week our same-store communities were still at 95.1% physically occupied which is flat with the same week last year.", "Now to the expense side. We reported growth this quarter of 6.6%. This increase was primarily caused by an increase in insurance expense of 59%. Because we self-insure up to a cap, we can experience quarterly swings in our insurance experience based on our loss experience. Last year in the third quarter we had very low losses while this quarter we had several fires as well as some claims from Hurricane Fay in Florida. I would like to point out that on the year-to-date basis our insurance expense is actually down 27%. Insurance makes up only 7% of our total expenses. ", "During the quarter the remaining expense categories were up a combined 3.8%.", "Marketing costs continue to decline as we see more and more traffic and ultimately leasing and move-ins coming from Internet sources. In September we saw 55% of our move-ins originate through the Internet. This is up from 43% last September. Our website www.udr.com is on pace to have 1.6 million unique visitors this year. This is roughly double what it was in 2007. We\u2019ve continued to work hard to make it easier for our customers to find us and do business with us both through www.udr.com as well as our mobile sites, through social networking sites such as MySpace and more recently on our iPhone enhanced website.", "Now looking to turnover. Our resident turnover is flat for both the year and the quarter. For the quarter it was 67.2% and year-to-date it stands at 60.2%. Also, move-outs to home purchases have continued to go down. In the third quarter it was 13.1%. That compares to 15.5% in last year\u2019s third quarter. The average rent of a UDR apartment is roughly 59% the mortgage payment on an average entry-level home.", "Looking to the future, we know we\u2019re facing a recession. That being said I\u2019d like to point out a few things.", "First. Our properties are well located in markets where the price difference between renting and owning remains wide.", "Second. We have a very experienced operating team running our properties. Each of our area vice presidents has well over 20 years of experience. They have operated through challenging economic cycles and they know how to adjust their strategies.", "Third. We have focused much of our technology efforts on the front end of our business. We have the best website in the industry and we are constantly working to find new ways to drive more traffic to www.udr.com.", "Finally. We have and will continue to invest in our real estate. Over the next year we expect to see private owners who control over 75% of the national apartment supply starve their properties of capital. We believe this will enable us to better hold on to our existing residents as well as attract new customers.", "In closing, I\u2019d like to thank my fellow associates for all of their dedication to making UDR top performing in the REIT group.", "Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mark.", "W. Mark Wallis", "I\u2019m going to cover our strategy of strengthening the portfolio which involves acquisitions, dispositions, development and redevelopment. If you have the earnings supplement in front of you, attachments 8 through 10 cover the data I\u2019m going to be talking about.", "First I\u2019ll discuss the acquisitions that were closed in the third quarter. We successfully completed our acquisitions that we had targeted to deploy the 1031 exchange funds that were generated from the $1.7 billion sale that was closed this past March. We added homes in San Jose, Mercer Island and Austin. These are markets that are still showing decent rent growth and have traditionally shown long-term job growth with their employment based on strong tech companies and state government.", "We also closed on two pre-sell assets in Phoenix and Tampa. These were contracted for over two years ago. These development pre-sells were structured in such a way that we were able to utilize them in the 1031 exchange without having to spend new additional funds in that exchange.", "In addition you\u2019ll note we were able to purchase a fully entitled development site near downtown Los Angeles. This is a future development. We\u2019re currently making tweaks to the unit designs and will commence construction only upon successfully arranging construction financing.", "Second I want to speak to our development pipeline. Please note that we\u2019ve reorganized the attachments 8 through 11 in order to give a better and hopefully clearer picture of development activity.", "[Mark Caldwell], who heads our development now, and I have experienced several downturns in the market and those downturns have made a significant impact on development including the severe S&L banking crisis that occurred in the late 80s and early 90s. While there are differences in that downturn compared to this one, that experience taught us to keep your development pipeline as scalable as possible. Now what does that mean?", "First. Have centralized control of your development activities. Don\u2019t build up a big overhead in decentralized markets. This makes it very easy to stop building in a particular market and takes away the temptation to keep building in a market to cover overhead in that city and keep the office open. Our strategy at UDR has been to keep our development activities concentrated in our Dallas office. Really with today\u2019s technology and construction management software we can very effectively manage development from our central Dallas location. This gives us more flexibility to right size our development efforts.", "Second. Warehouse as much of your land inventory as possible. You\u2019ll note on attachment 10 that we have $139.6 million invested in [inaudible] that can be converted to $1.1 billion of future development when the lending markets are available and the market turns up. In the interim we clipped the coupons on the existing week\u2019s revenue on these.", "For example, I\u2019ll point out that Summit at Mission Bay\u2019s a 323 home community; it\u2019s well located in San Diego; has views of the bay; but it\u2019s an old structure that eventually will be torn down and replaced with a new lead certified building that will contain 504 homes. Currently it\u2019s yielding us over 9% on our investment. We will harvest the value from the increased density when the timing is right but we\u2019re under no pressure to start today.", "Third, even though the long-term fundamentals look good, right size your portfolio to the construction money that is available in the market. Our active pipeline today amounts to $342 million and will require only $20 million of equity dollars funded by UDR. If we obtain financing for the three deals listed on attachment 10, development subject to financing, that will increase the active pipeline to $610 million with only an additional $8 million of equity funding required from UDR.", "We believe that a $400 million to $600 million pipeline that\u2019s financed and delivering primarily into late 2010 and 2011 is properly sized for the market in our enterprise. This pipeline could have been much larger but we have chosen to scale back to this level and will be able to easily scale back up as the markets recover.", "Fourth, don\u2019t become myopic and assume a recession will last forever. Development\u2019s a long-term strategy and requires looking beyond the current one to two-year window. The year 2011 is stacking up and looking to be one of the best years in recent history for the multifamily industry, and here are the reasons why I think that.", "First, supply is relatively in check today and multifamily construction starts are plummeting. It looks like the annual levels that should go below 200,000 homes annually next year. That\u2019s really a historic low. Second, demographics are in our favor. Our major markets still have population growth and the [inaudible] ranks are swelling in 2010 and 2011.", "Third, jobs which are now in decline but with the stimulus that has been put into the worldwide economy most expect a dramatic job growth recovery beginning in 2010 and possibly in full swing by 2011. So with supply not meeting demand, favorable demographics, potential dramatic job growth, 2011 should be a very good year in which we\u2019ll be delivering new competitive multifamily developments.", "Let me just wrap up my portion by saying that our portfolio is stronger with the successful $1.7 billion sale and the completion of our 1031 acquisitions that added new product in core market locations. We will continue to add new product through an appropriately sized and financed development and redevelopment program.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Dave.", "David L. Messenger", "During the third quarter we took a number of tactical steps to strengthen our balance sheet. Our primarily objective given current market conditions is to ensure that we have sufficient capital near obligations through 2010 and beyond. In addition we want to maintain sufficient flexibility to take advantage of market opportunities. Let me summarize our recent activities.", "In July we repurchased 400,000 shares of our common stock as part of our previously announced stock repurchase program. As we move further into the quarter the market and our stock price experienced unprecedented levels of volatility. We\u2019ve taken advantage of that volatility to capitalize on certain market opportunities.", "For example in august and September we repurchased $27 million of our medium term notes for a gain of $2.5 million and we also repurchased 969,000 shares of our Series G preferred stock at a yield of 8.1% and a 16% discount to PAR. In October we issued 8 million shares of common stock at a price of $24.25 per share at almost 27% premium to yesterday\u2019s close and we raised $194 million.", "On November 28 we are scheduled to close on an expanded Fannie Mae credit facility. This facility will replace our current $139 million facility that matures in 2010. The new facility will have an expanded commitment up to $300 million and a maturity of 2018. Warren will provide some additional details on this facility momentarily.", "Next, our debt maturity schedule and how we\u2019re addressing it today. With the closing of the Fannie Mae facility our current cash balance and receipt of the proceeds from the $200 million note in mid-2009, we expect to be able to satisfy all of our debt maturities in 2009 without having to draw on our $600 million revolver.", "During 2010 we have $550 million coming due. With our new Fannie Mae facility we\u2019ll move $139 million from 2010 to 2018. Now we have $411 million due in 2010. This amount could be further reduced to $360 million if certain extensions are elected. With $360 million due in 2010, I need to put that number in some perspective. During the last 45 days and in the next 30, our team will have raised in excess of $600 million in capital in what many consider to be the toughest capital markets we\u2019ve seen in decades.", "That being said we have an 18-month head start on satisfying the 2010 maturities. We\u2019re executing extensions where available and reviewing current market disparities. We continue to monitor the markets for opportunistically issuing new debt and if those opportunities do not arise, we can fully fund the 2010 maturities on our revolver. ", "We\u2019ve demonstrated an ability to execute transactions despite difficult markets. To date, we\u2019ve closed on the sector\u2019s largest sale transaction and completed the sector\u2019s largest equity offering. As market volatility continues we intend to continue to execute and continue to take advantage of these market disruptions.", "Now let me turn to guidance. As a result of these turbulent times, we\u2019ve had to recalibrate our earnings expectations for the balance of the year. As you know we do not publish quarterly guidance as we continue to operate the company with a long-term view knowing that from time to time that will impact short-term results. Since our last guidance update the world has changed significantly.", "Today\u2019s annual guidance change is based on three key factors. One. Slower than expected revenue growth at the end of the third quarter and start of the fourth and expense growth at the high end of the range that accounts for approximately $0.02. Second. We had lower-than-expected contributions from our JV partners since four of them planned lease-ups which also accounts for $0.02. Third. Dilution from our recent equity offering and the impact of lower returns on cash holdings due to our very conservative approach accounts for the final $0.02. ", "Accordingly, we\u2019ve adjusted our full-year FFO guidance to a range of $1.45 to $1.47 per diluted share. We believe these short-term impacts to FFO will position us for success in the turbulent environment and support value creation over the long term.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Warren.", "Warren L. Troupe", "On October 20 we signed a letter of commitment for a new $300 million facility with Fannie Mae which will mature in 2018. The new facility is being initially collateralized with six multifamily assets that will provide for initial loan advance with the commitment of approximately $224 million. UDR has spread-locked $154.8 million in the commitment at a blended rate of 4.3% and has also rate-locked $70 million in the commitment at a rate of 5.85% for an overall blended rate of 4.8%.", "Proceeds from the loan will be used to pay off an existing $139 million Fannie Mae facility that matures in April 2010 and the remaining proceeds will be retained to fund future capital needs of the company. We expect to close the new Fannie Mae facility by November 28, 2008.", "Secondly let me address the special dividend. As Tom said, we previously announced that as a result of the capital gains arising from property dispositions in 2008 we expect to declare a special dividend. The amount of the special dividend is expected to be $132 million and the company expects to pay the special dividend in conjunction with the company\u2019s regular dividend for the quarter ended December 31, 2008.", "The special dividend will be payable in cash or a combination of shares of common stock and cash. We expect to formally declare the special dividend and set the record date later this month, and it is anticipated that the special dividend and the regular dividend for the quarter ended December 31 will both be paid on January 29.", "Thomas W. Toomey", "With that operator we\u2019ll open up the call to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Analyst for Michael Bilerman - Citigroup.", "Analyst for Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "Can you talk a little bit about your revenue management systems and are you seeing dramatic decreases in rent levels as a form of concession relative to most of your markets?", "Jerry Davis", "We use yield star and we are seeing reductions in rent levels especially on new leases. What we\u2019re really seeing as getting probably 2% to 3% increases on renewals but pretty much probably going backwards 1% on a new lease coming in the door. That varies a little market-to-market. It\u2019s a little stronger in the Pacific Northwest as well as Northern California. In Florida we\u2019re typically having to give away a little bit more than that. We\u2019re pretty fortunate typically in Florida if we renew at flat.", "Analyst for Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "What\u2019s your tolerance level before you feel comfortable giving up occupancy? I guess the question is, how negative could you see that going before you\u2019d give up occupancy as that ratio balances?", "Jerry Davis", "I hadn\u2019t really thought of that. We\u2019ve been able to really manage the portfolio pretty consistently throughout the year on the 94.5% to 95.5% range. Year-to-date we\u2019re at 94.8%. There are a few markets it\u2019s tough for us to get 95% especially in some of the Florida markets but fort the most part we feel like an occupied unit today is better than getting the rent growth.", "Thomas W. Toomey", "A couple things I might add. In this cycle and all other recessions that we\u2019ve approached in the past, we\u2019ve seen a lot of development occur. In fact the trigger has been an oversupply. There\u2019s very little development going on. What is, is not probably going to be finished that quickly so we don\u2019t have that big threat of oversupply at us so we think with the technology advances on being able to drive more traffic and literally buy traffic if you will, we\u2019ll be able to sustain our occupancy levels at pretty good levels through this recession.", "Pricing, what Jerry pointed out, is as customers are becoming very sensitive to it and we have to fight it floor plan by floor plan, market by market.", "Analyst for Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "With regard to your development pipeline, can you talk a little bit about whether concessions in your lease-up properties are coming in at pro forma levels, if you\u2019re seeing any margin compression given where rents are in those markets?", "W. Mark Wallis", "In our Texas developments we\u2019re at or above our pro forma. Anecdotally our projects in Houston made our target last month for leases with 30; we get 36 so obviously we\u2019ve got some power there. I will say that in Florida that\u2019s where we see some softness in concessions on the pre-sell. We have one that\u2019s really not turned units yet but the one that has in Orlando, we\u2019re about 90% leased but the concessions have been over our initial pro forma.", "Warren L. Troupe", "What are we giving? Six weeks on 12?", "W. Mark Wallis", "Yes. Six weeks on 12 but we\u2019re at the top of the market as far as our rents, and from an overall performance standpoint it\u2019s doing well. We have a small pre-sell that\u2019s only 200 homes in Phoenix and we\u2019re seeing similar activity there although the traffic\u2019s actually better than we would have expected given the market in the last six months.", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Mark, why don\u2019t you go down some of the occupancies or percentages leased on attachment 8? These were as of September. Are there any material changes between there and where we stand in November while you\u2019re pulling that up?", "W. Mark Wallis", "Yes. If you look at the Marina Del Rey for example, it\u2019s one of the lower ones, 37.9%. We\u2019re now at about 50% there this month. The Laurelwoode deal in Houston is the one I mentioned that had the very strong leasing month. That\u2019s now at over 62%. The deal in Phoenix, we\u2019ve gotten to 50% there at the end of the month. So you can see those actually this last month have fairly decent leasing months and they were hitting their target activity. That gives you maybe a flair for how that\u2019s going.", "Analyst for Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "Did you talk about your appetite for additional debt repurchasing going forward?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "I think the appetite is to continue to look at liquidity on some of these bond holders and other forms of securities. We\u2019re getting daily calls and solicitations from them about buying our debts back at substantial discounts from where they\u2019re trading today. We feel like that will continue to grow between now and the end of the year.", "We think that as you can see Fannie and Freddie are still open for business and if we can borrow money under 5% from them and we can go back and buy debt that is of greater yield than the 5%, then that\u2019s not a bad use of that credit facility from Fannie. That\u2019s one option we\u2019re looking at but I would expect us to continue to look at that market and find out where it\u2019s inefficient for us to be jumping in there and creating some value.", "Last time I checked in life if I could buy back my debt at $0.70 on the dollar, I\u2019m doing pretty good.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Bragg - Merrill Lynch.", "David Bragg - Merrill Lynch", "I just wanted to ask a few more questions on development and specifically Tom, I wanted to get your thoughts about the relationship between development yields and cap rates and how you see that changing going forward? I remember on last quarter\u2019s call you talked about a spread of 100 to 150 basis points and obviously we\u2019re in a different world today so it\u2019d be great to get your update on how that relationship has changed on both ends and what you can see happening over the next couple years?", "W. Mark Wallis", "I\u2019ll start and Tom will chime in here. We\u2019ve been at this a long time as far as the development industry and I think that basis point spread that you talked about, 125 to 150, really is still holding in there in our opinion.", "How could that be possible given all that\u2019s going on? There\u2019s always probably submarket exceptions somewhere where somebody\u2019s overbuilt the submarket but as Tom talked about this downturn is probably different from the big one we had or referred to in 1990 because that was not only bank driven although the bank situation probably was smaller, it was supply driven. A lot of deals were tax indication deals. That\u2019s how the multifamily industry was financed.", "Today supply is more in check and I think that\u2019s holding that spread. The cap rates going in yields may change as the market changes but I don\u2019t see the spread changing dramatically unless you\u2019re in a particular market that\u2019s been dramatically overbuilt or maybe just has a huge overhang of some nature happening there, a big vacancy overhang. But we don\u2019t have anything to point to to speak to a fundamental change there today.", "Thomas W. Toomey", "I think Mark\u2019s summarized it correctly.", "David Bragg - Merrill Lynch", "Just to follow up on that, if we think about acquisition cap rates clearly have moved up over the last quarter since we last talked about that and it\u2019s debatable at what degree, but then you think about penciling out rent rate potential declines, are you seeing a decline in replacement costs?", "W. Mark Wallis", "I\u2019ll speak to a couple of those points. One. What we\u2019ve experienced up until the last six months on construction costs was dramatic increases; hard costs moving 30% up off pro forma\u2019s that were done nine months ago. That\u2019s correcting itself in a dramatic way. I think construction costs are getting back in line but they\u2019re certainly not moving where replacement cost is below quote what you can buy for. I think replacement cost is still a good measure to look at things. That\u2019s how we look at both acquisitions and development.", "And then there\u2019s a presumption that pro cap rates have changed. In visiting this week with [Matt Akin] who heads up our acquisition and disposition activities who\u2019s in the market every day I said, \u201cMatt, where are we today in your view if you were asked that question?\u201d He said, \u201cThe bid ask is pretty wide.\u201d", "My view might be a little more focused on newer assets; we\u2019re not talking about C assets or secondary markets, that\u2019s another subject even though there\u2019s not as many trades going on there, but in those markets Fannie actually still is available to private buyers and Matt said, \u201cWe still see some transactions happening there.\u201d", "But in the upper end of the market, I\u2019m looking at a schedule. We track deals even though we\u2019re not in the market to buy today, we track deals every month. I\u2019ve got half a dozen; a dozen deals max of decent quality. None of these assets are priced when they\u2019re marketed so you have sellers hoping, still sticky on their sale prices and buyers; they\u2019re not meeting and things aren\u2019t trading.", "That may be a deduction that cap rates have changed but until we start seeing trades for high quality products, it\u2019s hard to say. And the other thing is there\u2019s not much product out there. So it\u2019s hard to say how much cap rates have in fact moved although I think the general wisdom out there, everyone says they\u2019ve probably moved maybe 50 basis points. But I can\u2019t point to a trade that backs it up.", "That\u2019s sort of a long-winded answer but that\u2019s kind of an overview.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities.", "Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities", "Mark, just to follow up on some of David\u2019s questions there. Some of the recent published reports even for your markets and some of the comments your peers have made on the calls have suggested that land prices have fallen anywhere from 20% to 30% from the mid-to-high rise properties and 50% for garden properties. Should we just infer from your comments that you\u2019re not seeing that?", "W. Mark Wallis", "I\u2019ll say this. I think number one, entitled land sites are for sale. That\u2019s different. You couldn\u2019t touch entitled land sites. Those sites you probably can get a 5% better price on today. You can only speak to your own particular experience so I\u2019ll say we had a site we were looking at in the general area of Southern California; pretty good site; near rapid transit. We attempted to renegotiate that land price in due diligence on the theory that probably we were only one of the few buyer\u2019s in the market. The seller did not hesitate to terminate the due diligence period and go on to the next buyer.", "If you\u2019re talking sites that are not entitled that are further out, that aren\u2019t near a metro stop, I\u2019m sure those prices are softer and probably someone could throw up an example of one that\u2019s 20% off but we don\u2019t see that across the board. We do see people who spent money on entitled types probably writing some of their planned costs off and some of their pursuit costs off wanting to sell those sites. So depending on how you interpret that percentage, there are a few of those that are available.", "Thomas W. Toomey", "It\u2019s tough to always throw a blanket over a statement. The natural thought would be is people that borrowed heavily, that are out in the burbs, are speculating on land going up have obviously gotten burned and they\u2019re trying to cut their prices.", "The core on-transportation hubs in urban areas, if dirt\u2019s coming down, Mark had the right idea. It\u2019s 5%. It\u2019s not material. Construction costs; I was talking with a couple other people running California REITs as well as development private companies and they\u2019re saying their construction costs are coming down 10% to 15%. If you take those two combined and you say your rents are coming off on your forecast instead of growth of 5% and now you\u2019re having to say 2% in some of those markets, believe it or not your returns are holding up. There\u2019s just not enough volume of activity to really draw any more than generalities to this.", "The point is we\u2019ve outlined our development and the optionality of moving in to it, continuing it should funding be available, and if it\u2019s not we\u2019re happy to just warehouse it and live on the NOI that it generates today. We\u2019re not going to go out and just develop because we feel compelled to. We\u2019re going to develop because we think it\u2019s a responsible use of our capital. It has to compete with other uses including buying back the debt, including acquisitions.", "We\u2019re about trying to build the right company for the long term and we\u2019re not going to abandon any one effort over another. We\u2019re going to compete them against each other.", "Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities", "As you think about the redevelopment program and the kitchen and bath specifically, it\u2019s been a pretty big driver of returns. It looks like there\u2019s nothing beyond the first quarter from looking at the supplemental. Are you guys basically just shutting down redevelopment here as it becomes more difficult to push rents at a level necessary to achieve your target IRRs and conserving capital for some of the more opportunistic investments that you outlined?", "W. Mark Wallis", "A couple things. One, we finished a lot in our portfolio so naturally we knew the number was going to go down. On the redevelopment we\u2019re concentrating on a couple of deals that we want to do out in California, but the permitting, entitlement process out there which you would think would be a routine redevelopment is very lengthy. So that\u2019s delayed. That just means we\u2019re going to keep them leased up longer on the current status.", "We\u2019re not abandoning that process. We have a couple of longer term entitlement processes that a lot of times our teams working on the eastern half of the country is going to take them probably 10 month to get those done. So they\u2019re actually all working. We\u2019ll add a couple in California when those permits are available. ", "On kitchen and baths we\u2019re cutting back. Jerry may want to comment on that because it obviously ties into his work. We\u2019re trying to be prudent about where we should do those kitchens.", "Jerry Davis", "What I would add to that is several years ago we were doing 500 a month. That was one of your larger portfolios. In 2008 we\u2019ve been averaging about 200 kitchens and baths a month. We\u2019re probably projecting next year it\u2019s going to go down to about 150. Part of that is it\u2019s harder to get the return. The other part is a lot of the product that is coming on notice that we have the opportunity to do the kitchen and bath has already had a kitchen and bath done. So we just kind of run out of product.", "Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities", "Are there any additional one-time gains as it stands today that we should expect in the fourth quarter from either additional debt repurchases or preferreds?", "David L. Messenger", "At this time like Tom said, we\u2019re evaluating where we stand within the market place where we\u2019re looking at the different opportunities. As of today we\u2019ve not done anything.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "I was curious on the expense growth. You mentioned the pickup obviously for the quarter but given the challenges you\u2019ll likely face into 2009 just given the tough comps of the existing year, is it fair to say that the expense growth rate will likely persist?", "Jerry Davis", "We really haven\u2019t gotten too far into our budget process. I don\u2019t know if we really want to give guidance for 2009.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "In terms of comps year-over-year?", "Jerry Davis", "Comps year-over-year, I don\u2019t expect to have bad comps with real estate taxes like we\u2019re going to have in the fourth quarter this year. I think on the insurance front it\u2019ll probably even itself out. Utilities, gas prices have come down. We should be in pretty good shape there. I think what you\u2019re going to see is a more normalized rate on a more consistent basis but again any time you self insure on insurance, it can cause fluctuations on a quarterly basis.", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Insurance is one topic, it\u2019s 7%, but if you think about the primary drivers of our expense growth and you look out to next year, start with real estate taxes. You\u2019ve got 45% of the NOI coming from California. Real estate tax is our largest expense so they\u2019re capped at 2.9%. You\u2019ve got to think, \u201cIf I\u2019ve got the other 55%, what do taxes look like?\u201d That\u2019s going to average right around a little bit over 3% or 3.5%. Payroll, our associates know it\u2019s a tough job market. We\u2019ve done a good job on the benefits area so that number probably comes in at a 3% just to peg it.", "And utilities; people forget that 87% of our utilities are born by our residents. Of the remaining 13% it\u2019s probably our third largest expense category and you had a spike this last year and probably won\u2019t have a recurrence of that spike going into next year so that\u2019s probably going to be a more manageable number. This year it probably came in at 4%. It\u2019ll probably be better than that in my view.", "Probably 80% of your cost structure just in those three or four line items, and you hear a lot of, \u201cWell, around 3%.\u201d That\u2019s probably this business and this portfolio on a long-term basis. I can\u2019t see next year any unusual spikes. I think we\u2019re going to be fortunate to get our insurance renewal done in December before the market runs out of capacity next year and that\u2019ll probably give us a chance.", "On the other front, marketing and admin, staffing areas, the technology that we\u2019ve deployed is a long about the front end of our business attracting more customers, and I think as we move further and further into the implementation of that we\u2019ll continue to shrink our marketing costs and find other ways to become more efficient in our staffing model.", "I think Jerry and his group have a pretty good plan. They want to go through their detailed efforts but I\u2019m not going to say that next year looks like a heavy expense year at this point. We\u2019re not going to continue. This portfolio\u2019s been doing real well and they\u2019ve been doing great at keeping it at 2% to 2.5%, and I think we\u2019ll probably revert more to the normal 3%.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "In terms of an outlook here, I guess focusing on California, given the recession concerns you highlighted and risks that unemployment move up perhaps as much as 200 basis points from here, can you just give us your thoughts in terms of coastal California? You did mention thus far it\u2019s been holding up well but how do you see that market relative to the national average?", "Jerry Davis", "I think everything we\u2019re seeing is that job loss is probably going to be a little harder hit in California than the national average. But we do like our markets, our locations; we like our prices. We really haven\u2019t been directly affected by too many job losses to date but there could be an effect coming. I will tell you we\u2019ve experienced a little bit of doubling up; one bedroom guys going into two bedrooms together in Orange County. But it\u2019s interesting when you look at our occupancy across floor plans. They\u2019re all right around 95%. It\u2019s pretty consistent. Right now we haven\u2019t felt any softness really up in Northern California to date.", "Seattle depends on which jobs you\u2019re dependent on. A lot of our new product up there is in Belleview and Microsoft is about to move in right next door to our property so we feel like there\u2019s a lot of jobs coming in there. It\u2019s kind of specific to the properties.", "To date, have we felt in coastal Orange County a decline? Yes. You can see it in our numbers. Our revenue growth has been shrinking over the last couple of quarters but we still feel like we\u2019re better suited to handle that market than our competition.", "The other thing we feel is one thing we do better than most people, especially in California which is older product and it\u2019s very privately owned, is we have continued to invest in the interiors as well as the exteriors. We just think as our competition starves their assets, even if there\u2019s some job loss, people that want a good apartment to live in are going to flock to us.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "Focusing on development for a second, in the event that cap rates do move up higher over the next 12 months, would you anticipate or do you think that there\u2019s some risk that some of the projects you currently have slated for that 2010, 2011 or beyond would get reconsidered or possibly drop off?", "W. Mark Wallis", "If you look at what we\u2019ve outlined there, we\u2019ve got today $342 million underway; we\u2019ve gotten approved financing on [Signal Hill], we\u2019ll start that; and then the rest of the last we just will look at as the market unfolds.", "What I was trying to communicate is this is a very scalable development pipeline. $350 million to $550 million or so of development for an enterprise this size scattered among several markets is what we should be doing for the long term but we\u2019re not going to scale up until some of these clouds go away when the financial markets get a little more clarity to them. To answer your question, we\u2019re going to be careful about it.", "Thomas W. Toomey", "I would add, take a hard look at attachment 10. You can see Barc\u2019s pipeline of warehouse opportunities is $1.1 billion but it\u2019s on our books for $140 million. We\u2019ve got $11 million of NOI coming off that $140 million. We\u2019ll just sit on it. We think we\u2019ve got great dirt, great communities situated where we want to ultimately develop, but if the returns aren\u2019t there and the returns are greater at buying other investments, these opportunities will continue to sit in the warehouse.", "As Mark highlighted earlier, this economy\u2019s going to turn around. In \u201910 or \u201911 you\u2019re going to be asking us what we are doing to grow our enterprise. And the simple answer is, and we\u2019re going to be 60 days away from turning these back on and building in the right market with the right product, we think we\u2019ll get good returns.", "That\u2019s the way experienced developers handle themselves. Merchant builders go out and lock up lots of land, borrow until their teeth bleed and then keep building because t hat\u2019s the only damn thing they can do. Experienced people buy it; they option it; they warehouse it; and when the right time comes, they have the financial and the technical skills to deliver it.", "So spend a little bit of time really looking at 10 and you\u2019ll understand our psychology about development.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from [Michelle Coe] - UBS.", "[Michelle Coe] - UBS", "Earlier in the call you mentioned that you had taken down guidance partly because you were seeing slower revenue growth at the end of 3Q and beginning of 4Q. I was wondering if you could expand upon that a little bit more and tell us which markets you think are deteriorating going forward?", "Jerry Davis", "I wouldn\u2019t say any are really deteriorating. I would just say they\u2019re all getting marginally worse to a degree. You don\u2019t see any that are going to be getting higher from this past quarter\u2019s growth over 3Q when you compare 4Q to 4Q. Florida continues to struggle. We have seen Jacksonville get a little bit worse than the last three to four months. Phoenix has probably gotten more hurt in the last four months than any of our other portfolios. Luckily we only have 1,000 units there. ", "But the remainder of the portfolio is just coming down a couple percent of growth. Earlier in the year we were at 10% let\u2019s say or more in Northern California and Seattle. It\u2019s getting down into the 7% or 8% but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a massive deterioration. They\u2019re all coming down a couple percent.", "[Michelle Coe] - UBS", "Given that we believe fundamentals are worse than next year and cash flows could be less than anticipated, how secure do you feel about your dividends going forward?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "I\u2019m very confident in the dividend, very confident in the company\u2019s ability to fund it and that\u2019s where we stand.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from [Simiti Yupatia - CR Capital Markets].", "[Simiti Yupatia - CR Capital Markets]", "I was looking at the bad debt side and it was up a lot sequentially. Can you provide some color on that? Is that more of a seasonal thing?", "Jerry Davis", "A little bit of a seasonal thing. When you look at it sequentially, we run a special with our collection agency every year in April to try to get people that have skipped on us in the past that owe us to give us a portion of their tax refund back. We run a sale on what they owe us. Typically you\u2019re going to see second quarter be our lowest of the year. That would really more explain the jump up in 3Q if you\u2019re looking at it sequentially.", "[Simiti Yupatia - CR Capital Markets]", "Can you provide some color on foreclosure activities in some of the major markets that you\u2019re seeing?", "Jerry Davis", "They\u2019re continuing to go up, that\u2019s for sure; a couple hundred percent year-over-year. When you look at either the Inland Empire or Phoenix or L.A., the biggest problem markets are in the Inland Empire. Again, luckily we only have two or three assets there. We\u2019ve been able to do pretty well. We\u2019re not seeing a lot of foreclosed homeowners flocking to multifamily. We think they\u2019re heading to the shadow market of single family homes that are being rented out.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeffrey Donnelly - Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC.", "Jeffrey Donnelly - Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC", "Building upon Michelle\u2019s earlier question, Tom are there markets that have been persistently strong or weak for that matter in the past few quarters that you see approaching a peak or bottom in the next 12 to 18 months that might lead you to change your thinking about capital allocation in this areas?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "I think markets that we feel like we\u2019re getting close to a bottom might surprise you, but Florida feels a little bit that way. Looking into next year and thinking about markets that\u2019ll probably surprise you to the up might be D.C. You\u2019re going to have a complete turnover of a lot of jobs and it turns out that all the former politicians become lobbyists and still stay there. That\u2019s probably going to be an up.", "Texas more sideways probably. High fuel is driving a lot of its engine; it\u2019s still got a robust economy but it\u2019s not on fire at $65 a barrel as much as it was $140 a barrel.", "Moving across Southern California, we\u2019re almost a different kind of market condition there because we\u2019re west of the 405. I\u2019d really encourage you to look at our website for details of where that\u2019s at. It\u2019s a pretty high employment area, stayable, if people lose a job they go find another one very close. We\u2019ve got a good price point there. Technology I think in \u201909, people are going to cut back on their technology spending and you\u2019ll see San Francisco go from a high 10% revenue growth to half.", "In Seattle I wouldn\u2019t want to bet against Google or Microsoft or Boeing; whoever wins and given their cash reserves and their plans to grow the enterprises. So I feel like Seattle\u2019s still got another good year in it. So that\u2019s kind of a mix in markets and how I feel about them.", "Jerry, any different thoughts?", "Jerry Davis", "I would agree. D.C. is lining up to look very good for next year from what we see.", "Jeffrey Donnelly - Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC", "On the expense side Tom you were talking earlier about expense growth returning to a more normalized 3% pace. Do you think we achieve that more later in the year, because you potentially face some difficult comps in the first half of \u201909 to the first half of \u201908?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "You\u2019ve kind of got this roller coaster and that\u2019s why we\u2019re not overly alarmed at year-over-year at 6.6% when we look at it and say it\u2019s an insurance plan here and the trend on a year-to-date basis is 1.7%. That\u2019s a pretty good trend. I\u2019ve never as long as I\u2019ve been at this focused on a quarter of expenses as much as I\u2019ve looked at a trailing four and asked myself how that feels. I don\u2019t think companies can continue to run well below 3% for long periods of time. Cost structure kicks up, contracts catch up; that\u2019s just this business as long as I\u2019ve been at it. I\u2019ll tell you I\u2019ll take it as long as you\u2019ve got a 70% margin business, 3% revenue growth, expense growth isn\u2019t an issue.", "Jeffrey Donnelly - Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC", "That might be the answer then to my next question. A good bit of the increase you saw in Q3 expenses on the sequential basis was concentrated in the markets that are exhibiting the weakest fundamentals. What\u2019s driving that and do you think that those weaker markets will come in line with your expense growth expectation next year?", "Jerry Davis", "When I look at the higher sequential expense growth markets, Jacksonville, some of that was higher turn. We did turn quite a few units in the third quarter versus the second. You always have to look at when do people move in and move out. Typically the summer is heavier and in the softer markets people have more options to move to and also those other options typically are more concessionary and they\u2019re price driven so they\u2019ll jump on you. Other than the insurance amounts, you had some repair and maintenance.", "Norfolk you had some higher utility costs. Sometimes that\u2019s just the timing of when we pay the bills if it\u2019s an every other month type deal. We\u2019re pretty much on a cash basis with some of our utilities.", "Same thing in Phoenix. Even though turnover for the company is flat for the year and quarter-over-quarter, a couple of markets such as Phoenix and the Inland Empire are up well over 10%. During the summer we saw heavy turnover expense in Phoenix.", "Jeffrey Donnelly - Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC", "I think you mentioned at the start of the call about you anticipate further deceleration in Q4 revenues. To be clear, does that mean you believe that year-over-year same-store revenue could in fact turn negative next quarter or it\u2019ll be just slightly positive?", "Jerry Davis", "It won\u2019t be negative. It\u2019ll still be positive. You\u2019ve seen it go from 5% to 4.4% to 3.4%. We expect it\u2019s probably going to be a hair under 3%. It won\u2019t be negative.", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Looking over my notes and some of the anticipated questions, I failed to mention a couple of things. this portfolio when we go through and analyze our next year numbers and think about where we stand, we look a lot about the employment base of our residents and what our exposure is.", "Just to give you some feel, our largest employer in the portfolio frankly turns out to be government or utilities. I think those are probably safe industries.", "Technology is only about 10% of our employment base and manufacturing is about 5%, so when we look around we see industries having to roll through this recession and we ask ourselves what industries are going to have a hit and how does that overlay because you can be in a good market but if the industry goes upside down, it\u2019s still going to hit you. So as we think through next year and through each of our quarters, we overlay our employment base over our belief of what industries are going to do well.", "I think one of the surprises next year is going to be the military; a lot of it\u2019s going to come home and a lot of it\u2019s going to have to get rebuilt. They tore up a hell of a lot of equipment and a lot of people are going to get employed by rebuilding that equipment, and we think we\u2019ve got good exposure in the tightwadder Norfolk area and Jacksonville and some of the Florida cities. And that\u2019s probably driving a little bit of our optimism is that belief that you probably don\u2019t hear from other people.", "We think about it in a lot of different ways.

Mark Wallis", "We\u2019ve got a real wide bandwidth there. We\u2019re under no pressure.

We\u2019d have no place for it to go. So the first big chunk is already coming in of their dollars. We\u2019re about ready to cut all those actually public contracts from the City of [Athama].

Assets go down 20% in value and all of a sudden you\u2019re writing your loan down or you can say, \u201cWell great, we\u2019ll just take the asset.\u201d We\u2019re not interested in suburban assets like that and that\u2019s where you\u2019d see those opportunities.", "Infill, urban, transportation hub driven developments are usually well capitalized by very high caliber people and they don\u2019t need our help as mezz.", "[Mark Ziffert] - Oppenheimer & Co.", "How do you think of RE3 and the things you plan to do through it over the next year or so? Do you see any gains coming out of that business and is that built in to your expectations looking ahead?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "We\u2019ve said and adopted a policy that we wouldn\u2019t count on RE3 for gains and put it in the earnings cycle. We\u2019ve got assets in there. We continue to believe that they\u2019re worth more than what we have them on the books for. We\u2019ll continue to run them and increase their value. Today\u2019s not an environment where we would see RE3 as a very big component of our enterprise.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "I got on really late so I don\u2019t know if the question was asked, but I was curious and I just have one question about the special dividend and with the current stock price if you changed your strategy about whether it would be stock or cash?", "Warren L. Troupe", "The way that we set up the special dividend and it can be paid in either cash or a combination of shares and cash, and we retain the flexibility if we get at the end of the valuation period the share price is not at a price that\u2019s acceptable to the Board that we could pay that in all cash.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "So at this level would you pay it all in cash?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "We\u2019re deferring the question. It\u2019s just premature. It\u2019d be like me trying to tell you who\u2019s going to win the election tonight. It\u2019s just premature.", "Operator", "", "Our last question comes from Hondo Lee Ute.", "Hondo Lee Ute", "Tom, not to overuse the phrase but obviously the world has changed significantly the last couple of months and I appreciate your earlier comments on asset values, but given the dramatic asset value distillation currently underway and increasing return requirements, where\u2019s the puck headed? How much more do you think asset values can potentially decline and is it inconceivable to consider a version to a 9% cap rate world?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "I\u2019ll tell you this. I read your piece. I thought it was very well thought out.", "Here\u2019s kind of what I think about this business in multifamily. We typically find a typical B apartment across America prices across five year leverage. So a five-year paper today can be had at 75% loan to value at a 5.7, it\u2019s going to tell you cap rates are anywhere from 6.5% to 7.5% for that asset. If you tell me interest rates are going to 8% or 9%, then yes. 9\u2019s an easy number to see.", "I think a lot of it\u2019s going to be driven off of where interest rates move. I think what you have and my personal view is that interest rates come down because of all the stimulus in the short window of the next year but then after that start to climb pretty steadily.", "One wild factor in your cap rates that you didn\u2019t calculate in there is what if you\u2019re in a high income tax bracket game and we\u2019re back to tax indications and people are using not just the cash flow but also the after-tax benefits in valuing real estate. That era is potentially there under both potential candidates. I think in the interim to see 9% caps as your article points out is a long shot. To see it if interest rates move to 7.5% on that type of paper, then I\u2019d say yes.", "Think more about where interest rates are headed than values and return expectations because in this business I\u2019ve seen cap rates more correlated to that.", "Hondo Lee Ute", "Mark, I\u2019d like to go back to the [M] acquisition for a moment. I didn\u2019t quite hear, maybe I missed it, but if you compare that purchase price to what that land might have sold for a year ago and assuming you could get construction financing today, what type of return do you think you could develop to?", "W. Mark Wallis", "Is there a specific piece you\u2019re talking about or just in general?", "Hondo Lee Ute", "If you could compare that purchase price today versus what you think it might have -", "W. Mark Wallis", "Oh, a year ago?", "Hondo Lee Ute", "Yes.", "W. Mark Wallis", "I think on that particular site probably when you consider the pursuit costs, that it\u2019s entitled, I don\u2019t have a staff out there churning and burning payroll every month, because this site\u2019s 400 feet from metro station and 500 feet is easily walkable, it\u2019s probably all-in 10% better.", "We feel like our construction costs as tom talked a little bit about are coming in 10% to 15% better than a year ago, so then we see the yield on that to be pretty strong for a California deal. If you get a mid-6% return or upwards, I don\u2019t want to over-forecast as we price everything out and work on that deal, it could be from a long-term perspective a pretty healthy deal like we hadn\u2019t seen in a while.", "But as Tom said, these infill urban sites we do not see them being discounted 20% or 30%. Some suburban sites are starting to build it anyway. By the time you carry them you end up in the same spot. They\u2019re going to be discounted but we\u2019re just not seeing it. And we\u2019ve been bidding on some sites with that expectation and not getting anywhere.", "Hondo Lee Ute", "A question on construction financing today; any sense of what that would be today versus what you closed your loans for during the quarter?", "David L. Messenger", "We were doing something earlier at loan to cost of 70% to 75% and it\u2019s more like 60% today. The pricing has moved from LIBOR + 1.75 to about LIBOR + 2.50 today.", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Operator, I understand we have no more calls. Let me wrap up with closing. Let me mention again that we are hosting a Los Angeles Property Tour, specifically Marina Del Rey, on November 18. This is the day prior to the NAREIT Conference. If you fly into L.A., we\u2019re glad to give you a bus ride down to San Diego to the conference.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Larry Thede, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Larry Thede", "Thanks all of you for joining us for our fourth quarter financial results conference call. Our fourth quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed yesterday and posted to our website. ", "In the supplement we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements. ", "I\u2019d like to note that statements made during this call which are not historical may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in yesterday\u2019s press release and are included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Thomas Toomey.", "Thomas Toomey", "Thank you Larry, as we are toward the end of earnings season and I see little benefit in taking up your time playing amateur economist, I have a few quick thoughts and then we\u2019ll turn the call over to the key executives for details. ", "On the subject of the fourth quarter and 2008 performance in the face of challenging times we were very successful on a number of fronts. We strengthened our portfolio with sales of $1.7 billion, and acquisitions of nearly $1.1 billion in the right markets. ", "We raised over $1 billion in capital with over $700 million raised in the fourth quarter alone. Our operating team delivered the second best NOI growth for the apartment REITs for the year and twice we reduced our cost structure to reflect changes in our portfolio and operation environment. ", "We adjusted our development deliveries and redevelopment deliveries to reflect a slowdown in the fundamentals, and I personally want to thank and express my appreciation to all our associates who worked very hard to deliver these results. ", "Let me now turn to 2009 and 2010, our guidance will be given in more detail by David and Jerry, like you we believe the business climate and volatility will remain challenging. We are extremely concerned over the rapidly eroding employment picture that has seen unemployment rise from 4.7% to 7.6% in just six months. ", "We are skeptical that the government\u2019s efforts to restart the capital markets will show benefit during 2009. I will say though that our strategies will not change. I will continue to focus my efforts on increasing our financial flexibility and in fact in the first 40 days of 2009 we have increased our lines of credit by $240 million brining total cash and credit capacity to $1.2 billion. ", "With that let me turn the call over to Jerry.", "Jerry Davis ", "Thanks Thomas, and good afternoon everyone. In the fourth quarter of 2008 we saw increasing job and worsening economic conditions effect our business. Our revenue growth of 1.8% during the quarter was lower then we anticipated as pricing power that we enjoyed in our California and Pacific Northwest markets for the first nine months of the year disappeared.", "Fourth quarter expense growth came in right where we expected it at 6.8%. As we had communicated all year our fourth quarter 2007 expenses were extremely low due to several favorable tax deals as well very low insurance. Taxes and insurance make up 38% of our total expenses and they were up 20.6% for the quarter. ", "The other operating expense categories which make up the remaining 62% of our expenses were actually flat with the prior year. On a sequential basis our revenue fell 0.8%, marking the first drop in sequential revenue in the past 17 quarters. Our expenses were down 5% from our third quarter levels and the result was fourth quarter NOI was 1.2% higher then the third quarter. ", "For the full year our revenue increased 3.6%, expenses were up 3.1%, and the resulting NOI grew by 3.8%. In comparison to the apartment REITs that have reported full year results, that would place our revenue and our NOI growth at second best in the sector. ", "Beginning in late October and then continuing through the end of the year, we saw a strong shift in our pricing power throughout our portfolio but most notably in our West Coast markets. While we have been able to keep occupancy at very stable levels, rental rates on new leases in most markets have retreated. ", "In the fourth quarter we continued to get modest increases on the 3,600 lease renewals we did in the 1% to 2% range. However these were not enough to offset the average decline of 4% that we experienced on the 5,000 new leases that we signed in the fourth quarter. ", "Given the continuing job loss expectations in 2009 we see revenues decreasing by 1% to 3%. Our expectation is that the DC, Virginia, Northern California, Pacific Northwest, and Texas markets which represent 36% of our total revenue will have positive growth but they will be dragged down by deteriorating conditions in Southern California and Phoenix and a continued struggle in Florida. These markets represent 46% of our total revenue. ", "We expect our 2009 expense growth will be in the 1.5% to 2.5% range. Real estate taxes and utilities which account for almost half of the total expenses are expected to grow in the 4% to 5% range while the other expense categories are projected to be flat on a cumulative basis. ", "NOI is projected to be in the negative 3% to negative 5% range in 2009. Occupancy for same store communities for the fourth quarter was 94.6% compared to 94.4% in fourth quarter 2007, that\u2019s a 20 basis point increase. More recently our occupancy in January was 94.5% compared to 94.1% last January. So far in 2009 we\u2019re seeing traffic at a slightly higher level then last year and our applications are flat. ", "Turnover for the fourth quarter was 53.7% which was up 40 basis points from last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Move outs to home purchases were 14.1% in the quarter that compares to 15.3% in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year 49.7% of our move ins originated through the internet as we continue to see the benefits of our industry best website. ", "This is up from 40% in 2007. Our website, www.udr.com had almost 1.6 million unique visits this year, that\u2019s roughly double what it was in 2007. We continue to develop enhancements to our website to keep it the best in the industry as well as find other ways to connect with our customers through things like mobile websites and social networking.", "Not only have these enhancements driven our revenue, they\u2019ve also enabled us to reduce our marketing costs over the last several years. These expenses for 2008 were down 18%. Now looking to the future, we see the same job loss projections as everyone else. Most of our markets will be effected. ", "That being said I\u2019d like to make four points, first our properties are well located in markets where the price difference between renting and owning remains wide. Over three quarters of our apartment homes have average rents that are still less then 65% of the average mortgage payment on an entry level home. ", "Second we have a very experienced operating team running our properties. Our expectations for our teams to outperform their peers and their individual markets. In 2008 we had the highest revenue growth in nine of the 19 markets we were have REIT peers and we came in second in another three markets. ", "Although 2009 will be a challenge for everyone our expectation to market leadership remains the same. Third we have focused much of our technology efforts on the front end of our business. We have the best website in the industry and we are constantly working to find new ways to drive more traffic to udr.com. ", "Lastly we have and we will continue to invest in our real estate. We have a five year CapEx plan for each one of our properties and our plan in 2009 is to spend $675 per apartment home on recurring CapEx. The private investors only know where 85% of the apartment stock in our country we expect to see many of them starve their properties of capital over the next year. ", "Even though job loss will effect the entire apartment industry we know that renters value a well maintained community and they will seek out those places to call home. We believe this will enable us to better hold onto our existing residence as well as attract new customers. ", "In closing I\u2019d like to thank my fellow associates for all of their dedication to making UDR a top performer in the REIT group. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mark. ", "Mark Wallis ", "Thanks Jerry, in 2008 we completed $1.7 billion of dispositions and $976 million of acquisitions making us a net seller of $724 million of assets in 2008. We believe this not only brought needed liquidity into the company but that the portfolio is better positioned for the long-term future of the company.", "We do not have any planned acquisitions for 2009 other then one pre-sale asset for $29 million that was put under contract a couple of years ago. We have received offers on one of our recently completed developments in Houston and are evaluating a possible sale of that asset. ", "On the development front we are wrapping up the completion of two communities in the next two months leaving us six communities that we have under construction. While we are doing pre-sale entitlement and design work on three land sites, we do not have any new construction starts planned for 2009.", "In addition we cancelled a pre-sale purchase commitment for 2010 of $59 million and that\u2019s for a to be built development project in Orlando. We increased our development team three years, we decided to run a centralized operation out of our Dallas office and with as lean a staff as possible. And as the market showed signs of weakness last year, we began trimming our development staff since early summer of 2008.", "Today our development team consists of one SVP, and one VP and a talented group of six development associates and seven construction associates. We believe that this is a right size group that can properly execute the six jobs underway and the planning for the future. That\u2019s a brief summary of the highlights in the investment area and I would direct you to supplemental schedules nine through 12 including the press release for more details. ", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Warren.", "Warren Troupe ", "Thank you Mark, I will give a brief update on recent capital market activities, for 2008 we closed five construction loans totaling $179 million at an average spread of 184 basis points over one month LIBOR or approximately 2.3%. In January we closed an additional construction loan with a spread of 250 basis points over one month LIBOR or [4%]. These loans have been through a number of strong regional banks.", "In addition we\u2019ve entered into commitments with Freddie Mac for two seven year ARM mortgages on existing properties. We expect the loans to close in the first quarter with net proceeds of approximately $63 million and all at a floating rate of approximately 4% with cap of 7.5%. A summary of our capital activities is set forth in detail in the capital markets update in our press release. ", "At the end of 2009 we expect to have access to $836 million of undrawn credit facilities and at the end of 2010 we expect to have access to $487 million of undrawn credit facilities. And finally we continue to take advantages of opportunities in the debt market. In the first quarter we purchased $27 million of face amount of our outstanding debt at an average of 20% discount to par for a yield of 13%. ", "In addition we purchased $18 million of our 6.5% note due in June resulting in interest savings of approximately $495,000 in 2009.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to David.", "David Messenger ", "Thanks Warren, my comments will focus on our 2009 guidance, dividend, and disclosure enhancements. As Jerry discussed we are forecasting occupancy of 94% to 95% and a decline in same store revenue of 1% to 3%. On the expense side we made a lot of progress in the fourth quarter renegotiating our contracts and pricing and expect to be able to limit our same store expense growth to 1.5% to 2.5%. ", "This equates to the same store NOI forecast of negative 3% to negative 5%. Some of this decline will be offset by increased NOI from completed developments and redevelopments as well as assets purchased in their lease out stages in 2008. We expect to reduce our G&A expenses by 8% in 2009 as a result of our 2008 actions. ", "We will continue to be active in repurchasing our debt and possibly our common and preferred stock. As we mentioned in our press release last night we have repurchased $27 million of our debt for a $0.03 gain to FFO. Weighing all of these factors and utilizing a diluted share count of 160 million common share equivalents, we are forecasting our 2009 range of FFO to be $1.23 to $1.35. ", "To simply the range, take the fourth quarter of 2008 and consider that a run rate of $0.30 to $0.31, annualized you get $1.20. Add the $0.03 of debt transactions we\u2019ve already done and you\u2019re at the low end of our range. Its an additional $0.12 to get to the top end. Assuming operations come in better then a 5% decline I can pick up half that spread and the balance can be obtained through further debt repurchases. ", "Turning to our dividend, in 2008 [inaudible] for our special dividend we paid an annual recurring dividend of $1.22 per common share. Given our forecasted operations the collection of our $200 million note receivable and our current capital plan, we expect to generate taxable income of $1.00 to $1.20 per share. ", "Based on those levels we do not see any meaningful savings from reducing the dividend. A final comment about our supplement, we have continued to add to our transparency. We have added additional disclosures and attachment four regarding our available credit facilities, as well as our debt maturities with and without extensions. ", "This should give you a better picture of what we have coming due and the available facilities we can use to satisfy those maturities. We have also provided a home count reconciliation on attachment seven. This helps complete the picture of what our company will look like as our non-mature assets become mature. ", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Thomas. ", "Thomas Toomey ", "That concludes our prepared comments, we are now ready for questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "Could you comment at bit on just the government stimulus plan and obviously implications for what you think might be move outs to single family throughout the year. ", "Thomas Toomey ", "I think we\u2019re going to learn a lot about this plan over the next week as everybody gets into dissecting it. Certainly a big part that we noticed was the $15,000 credit towards home ownership and I first I\u2019m for anything that gets this economy started. In the long-term our business will be positively impacted if they get there. The $15,000 credit, if you take a median home price or you take any of the home prices in our markets let\u2019s say, you give people $15,000 down, they\u2019ve still got to come up with anywhere between probably $20 and $35,000 themselves and we think a lot of people, that\u2019s going to be a hard thing to come up with these days to buy a home. ", "So I think its not going to be that visible to us initially out of the gate in 2009 but as the economy turns its probably going to be another threat to us in 2010. But again I think its going to be market by market, price point by price point, and I think in the future as the clarity is provided, we may put some more in our road show materials about the direct impact in our markets. ", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "Turning to guidance can you decipher a bit, the expectations for West Coast and specifically NOI growth for California. It sounds like the deterioration was more then expected quarter over quarter. ", "Jerry Davis ", "I would tell you Southern California, we would see Orange County as probably going to be negative 1% to negative 3% revenue growth. LA is probably going to be a hair worse then that, San Diego is looking to us, that it could be flat to slightly down. Inland Empire is going to be very bad, probably revenue growth of negative 5% to negative 6%. As you move up the Coast to Northern California we think San Francisco, San Jose, will be positive, slightly in maybe the 2% range. ", "And we think our Monterey portfolio is well positioned to perform well and could easily do 3% to 5% revenue growth. ", "Thomas Toomey ", "I think a couple of things as I look at California, certainly an unemployment rate for the state at 9% or better and probably going higher, when we dissected it down to our individual submarkets, we think that unemployment is more at the 6.5% range. So I think we\u2019re going to do better then the totality of California will. ", "The second that  concerns me a great deal is this budget deficit and I don\u2019t want to use the work bankrupt but when you don\u2019t pay your bills I don\u2019t know what you call it. So I\u2019m worried a little bit about what California is going to do as a state fiscally and is that going to be higher taxes on retail system already, on wages, prop 13 hasn\u2019t been attacked at this point. I think it would hard for them to repel it given it would take a populace vote to carry that. ", "So think we\u2019ll have to watch how California deals with it. Certainly nothing right on the immediate horizon points to a bright future or to a rebound, it points to more negative. That\u2019s our view on California. ", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "Can you comment a bit just on the expense savings from the internet, it sounds like half of all move ins, and that\u2019s a positive trend that obviously expectations looking ahead. ", "Jerry Davis ", "That savings are roughly historically over the last several years, we\u2019ve cut it by about $50 per unit so that\u2019s a $1 million, $1.5 million when you look back two or three years ago. It was down in 2008 versus 2007 by the 18%. We expect it to go down marginally going forward but for the most part we\u2019ve exited all print ads and we\u2019re predominantly in the internet right now.", "So the savings rate will continue to get less as time goes on. ", "Thomas Toomey ", "What\u2019s interesting is we\u2019re seeing the number of visits climb dramatically, its up another 25% already this year. People are shopping properties much more where they were looking at three to five before they\u2019re probably now looking 10. So we\u2019ve started moving our tracking of our traffic to really truly applications. And what\u2019s been interesting out of that is the number of aps that we\u2019re taking in, in fact is slightly climbing so that gives us some confidence that we\u2019re going to be able to sustain our occupancy levels at today\u2019s rates but and Jerry has color more on what the pricing for renewals and new leases, he\u2019s provided that earlier, you can see that our rents are rolling down. ", "But different then a lot of cycles, it appears that we\u2019re going to be able to sustain the occupancy number at this time through. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stevenson \u2013 Foxx-Pitt Kelton ", "Robert Stevenson \u2013 Foxx-Pitt Kelton ", "Can you talk about what your certainly is at this point about the $200 million notes payable being paid off as soon as the lock out period is over, its about 7.5% loan. ", "Warren Troupe ", "It is 7.5% interest rate on that and its, we\u2019ve had conversations with DRA and they\u2019ve told us that that money has been reserved and set aside in the fund, $200 million. And we had conversations with the lenders on that note so we have a lot of assurance that its going to be paid and we\u2019re proceeding along that way. ", "Robert Stevenson \u2013 Foxx-Pitt Kelton ", "So at 14 months or whatever, it gets paid, its not something that they\u2019re going to wait and see and let it run until some time later in 2009.", "Warren Troupe ", "Under the loan agreement, default is not paid by June 1st. That\u2019s the loan agreement between them and Fannie Mae. And even then we have an absolute right to have it prepaid later in that year or so. But we have no indications that number discussed with them, have no indications they\u2019re not going to pay.

", "David Messenger ", "Correct and they also have more shares, so the aggregate dividends they receive will be the same or go up.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W. Baird ", "Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W. Baird ", "Could you review the terms and conditions under which you can exercise the extension options of the debt maturities this year and next and further could you tell us whether the later extension opportunities could be contingent upon extending the earlier ones. So for example if you fully utilized all the ones available in 2009 and 2010 does that impact your ability to utilize extensions in 2011 and beyond. ", "Warren Troupe ", "On the Fannie Mae facilities we just have an absolute right of extension and there are separate facilities and we can add properties to them, pull down $275 or add properties and pull down $140, they are not contingent on one being [inaudible] before the other. With respect to the one such as the Marina Del Ray loan which is in 2009 that\u2019s just an absolute extension right that we have. Its two one year extensions. And with all of the other construction loans its just an absolute right at our sole discretion. ", "Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W. Baird ", "What are you seeing in terms of early lease terminations, and correspondingly an average length of stay. ", "Jerry Davis ", "I can tell you the lease terminations are roughly about what they were last year. I haven\u2019t seen a large variance. You\u2019ll see some people that have a job loss and break their lease. And some of those situations you have to write off the balance because they\u2019re not going to pay whereas in previous years you would see people moving because of job relocations and their new employer would pay that lease break but its been fairly stable. ", "As far as normal length of stay, we don\u2019t track that specifically. But I think most of our residents still tend to sign a nine to 12 month leases. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Swett \u2013 KBW ", "Steve Swett \u2013 KBW ", "Last quarter you had an attachment in the supplemental where you had some land positions identified and some operating communities you were looking at redeveloping, and some of those have slid into the active pipeline it looks like but the other ones I don\u2019t see listed anymore in the supplemental, are those still land positions you hold, are you still capitalizing costs related to those.", "Mark Wallis ", "There are still land positions that we do hold and I mentioned that  on three of those we are still working entitlements and doing predeveloped planning so appropriately those costs are capitalized. So there\u2019s no real significant change there other then we\u2019re trying to communicate from a volume commitment standpoint of new construction and the cap requirements associated with that that may have been misinterpreted in the past that we are not, we will tell you we\u2019re start to deal with those, they are not going to be started until the as mentioned earlier the financial markets are in line on the deal and it looks like the appropriate yield. ", "And as I mentioned too there is quite a dynamic market right now where costs could do much better and we\u2019ll see how that plays out. ", "Steve Swett \u2013 KBW ", "Did you indicate how much the accounting adjustment on the exchangeable notes would be.", "David Messenger ", "We have not, we\u2019re looking at that right now. For 2009 we estimate its going to be between $0.04 and $0.05 for the year. We\u2019ll keep that broken out on the face of the income statement as a separate line item so you can easily see it and we don\u2019t try to mix up the interest expense. ", "Steve Swett \u2013 KBW ", "Its not in the guidance.", "David Messenger ", "No it is not. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Bragg - Merrill Lynch", "David Bragg - Merrill Lynch", "On the guidance range the bottom end of the range 123, that does include the 3%, that repurchase gain from the first quarter and it also assumes negative 5% NOI growth. ", "David Messenger ", "", "Correct.", "David Bragg - Merrill Lynch", "", "And then to get to the top end of the range, what does that assume, negative 3% NOI growth and does it assume any other one-time items?", "David Messenger ", "Its assuming we\u2019re more active in the debt markets and repurchasing our short longer term debt as well as the operations coming in better then the 5%, 3% being on the high end of that range. ", "David Bragg - Merrill Lynch", "", "And is there a quantifiable level of the debt repo gains that get you to the $1.35?", "David Messenger ", "No, we were just saying that if you split it, its $0.06 on each side, $0.06 from operations, you pick up another $0.06 from debt repurchases, that gives you the $0.12.

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the UDR third quarter earnings conference call. During today\u2019s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. (Operator instructions) This conference is being recorded, Monday, October 19th of 2009. I would now turn the conference to our host, Tom Toomey, President and CEO. Please go ahead, sir.", "Andrew Cantor", "Thank you for joining us for UDR\u2019s third quarter financial results conference call. Our third quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed earlier today and posted to our website, www.udr.com. In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements.", "I would like to note that statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in this evening\u2019s press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.", "When we get to the question-and-answer portion, we ask that you be respectful of everyone's time and limit your questions and follow-up. Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered on the call.", "I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.", "Tom Toomey", "Thank you, Andrew. And good evening to everyone. Welcome to UDR\u2019s third quarter conference call. With me today are Jerry Davis, Senior Vice President of Operations; David Messenger, Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our results; as well as our Senior Executive Vice Presidents, Mark Wallis and Warren Troupe, who will be available to answer questions during Q&A.", "After the market closed today, UDR announced that it achieved core FFO per share of $0.31 compared to $0.30 last year. This quarter\u2019s FFO results were impacted by two items. One, a $0.10 charge related to non-cash equity loss on the company\u2019s investment in a development joint venture and a $0.02 charge associated with our bond tender. Including these amounts, our reported FFO per share is $0.19.", "During the quarter, we engaged in a number of capital market activities. In September, we completed a bond tender. The tender was at a 10% premium, but was the right decision, as we realized interest savings over the long-term and were able to modify our bond covenants. Furthermore, in mid-September we initiated at-the-market stock issuance program where we sold roughly 2.3 million shares at an average price of $14.89.", "In addition to our efforts to lower our interest expense via our bond tender and to raise our equity opportunistically through the ATM program, UDR secured a 10-year $200 million facility with Fannie Mae at a weighted average interest rate of 5.28% and entered into a $450 million acquisition joint venture with Kuwait Finance House. These activities will be discussed in detail during Dave\u2019s remarks.", "These activities further illustrate that the market\u2019s willingness to provide strong multi-family operating platforms like UDR with capital necessary to fortify its existing balance sheet and capital to take advantage of anticipated acquisition opportunities.", "From an operating perspective, as we have discussed in the prior calls, the economy certainly remains challenging due to the continued job loss and increasingly tough comparables in the field. However, we remain encouraged by how effective we have been executing despite these headwinds.", "To that end, in the quarter, we limited our same store NOI decline to 3.7% on a year-over-year basis and 1% through September 30th and continue to maintain occupancies above 95%. We have been communicating throughout this year that rental growth will be allusive in the near-term as we go through a bottoming process. But the scarcity of new product to compete with in most of our markets and the minimal vacancy in our portfolio should allow us to push rental rates when the job market recovers.", "While we expect some markets to continue to moderate, such as our Southern California where we are generating 27% of our same store NOI, we are seeing a slowing in rental rate declines on a sequential basis in other markets, specifically Washington DC and Florida where we generate almost 50% of our same store NOI.", "And as we look for sequential rental rate increases across several of our markets perhaps as second half of 2010. Jerry and his team have done a great job of managing the trade-off of occupancy, rents, turnover and resident quality in the field, and he will continue to provide more color on these trends in the individual markets during his remarks.", "Recently, there have been some high profile deals going to contract that illustrate the disconnect between private market values and those of the public markets. One particular deal in the DC beltway comes to mind. There are over 30 bidders for this asset at a reported cap rate in the low fives. This high level of participation on the anniversary of the financial markets dislocation shows just how far the pendulum has swung from the irrational despair of 2008.", "Institutional investors are showing\u00a0an appetite that has returned particularly for properties located in strong employment markets with high barriers to entry. While this is just one market and one single asset, the story is the same across many markets and many deals and should provide a reference point or baseline on how valuations in the private market for institutional quality assets relate to those in the public markets.", "With that, we\u2019ve got a good amount of ground to cover. I\u2019ll pass the call over to Dave to discuss our financial results.", "David Messenger", "Thanks, Tom. My comments today will focus on the third quarter results, the steps we\u2019ve taken to further improve our capital position, and our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2009. Earlier this evening, we reported $0.19 of FFO, which consists of $0.31 from our core operations, a $0.02 charge associated with our tender offer, and a $0.10 charge related to a loss on an equity investment. We have excluded the $0.01 effect related to the convertible debt accounting. Our core FFO $0.31 compares to $0.30 last year. Jerry will provide detail on our operating results in a moment.", "During the quarter, we recorded a non-cash charge of $16 million or $0.10 per diluted share on an equity investment in two of our unconsolidated Seattle-based joint ventures. One of the ventures is completing development of elements of a 274-unit property located in Bellevue, Washington. The other joint venture was originally established to develop a retail site also located in Bellevue, Washington. However, during the first quarter, the joint venture decided to delay that construction.", "UDR does not have any other joint ventures involved in the development of multi-family communities. This charge was a result of recent discussions to change the capital structure of the joint venture such that UDR would become the general partner. Although a definitive agreement has not been reached, nor can be assured of being reached in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, our investment must be recorded at fair-market value. And if that fair-market value is less than our historical cost basis, then a loss must be recognized.", "Regarding capital activity, the third quarter was an active one as we took a number of positive steps with regard to our capital position. We improved the term and cost of our debt, implemented an opportunistic equity offering program, and secured a new line of credit and announced our venture with Kuwait Finance House.", "Our Q3 share count increased, as we raised $33.7 million from the sale of 2.3 million shares at a weighted average price of $14.89 under our at-the-market equity offering program. As of September 30, we had in excess of $1 billion of cash and credit capacity, which will more than meet our maturity and development needs through 2001. This capacity allows us to manage our capital plan opportunistically and efficiently. We maintained our fixed charge and interest coverage ratios in excess of 2.0 times after factoring for non-recurring items.", "During the quarter, we completed a tender offer for our 8.5% debentures that mature in 2024. We were able to retire 70.3% of the debentures outstanding for $35.7 million and incurred a charge of $3.7 million or $0.02, representing the premium and transaction costs. The retirement of this debt will result in savings of $15 million to $17 million in future interest payments.", "We closed on a construction loan for Vitruvian Park Phase 1 with an interest rate of 5.3% and a maturity of four years inclusive of the one-year extension. Upon closing of this loan, no further financing is required to complete our development pipeline. Also during the third quarter, we closed on a new 10-year $200 million secured facility with Fannie Mae at an all-in rate of 5.28%. The proceeds of the second draw will be used to prepay substantially all of our 2010 secured debt maturities.", "In August, we announced that UDR has established a joint venture with Kuwait Finance House. The total amount of the venture is $450 million with an equity contribution from the partners of $180 million. UDR\u2019s maximum equity contribution will be 30% or $54 million. The venture\u2019s target markets are key high-barrier markets and products similar to what UDR owns\u00a0today.", "Finally, with one quarter remaining in fiscal 2009, we are updating our guidance. Our FFO guidance range is now $1.14 to $1.20 per diluted share compared to the prior range of $1.23 to $1.35. This change reflects the $0.10 charge we recorded this quarter and our expectation that our property operations will continue the trend of the first three quarters. The detailed walkover of our guidance is included in our press release.", "Now I will turn the call over to Jerry.", "Jerry Davis", "Thanks, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone. In the third quarter, our NOI decreased by 3.7%, as revenues fell 3% and were offset by a decrease in expenses of 1.6%. Our operating teams continue to execute our strategy of maintaining the occupancy, reducing resident turnover, driving the operating expenses down, and automating the way we do business. It appears that job losses are slowing in our markets though we have not yet begun to see any meaningful hiring. It is unlikely that we will see much of a change in operating results until we see jobs.", "Our effectives rates were 4.1% lower in 3Q \u201909 compared to 3Q \u201908 and down 1.6% to the second quarter. We have continued to see new leases reprice at lower rates, but the rate of decline is slow since the first of the year. This gives us hope that we are approaching a bottom in many of our markets, but we have little visibility on how long that bottom could last.", "Rental rates on new leases that were signed in the third quarter of 2009 were 6.8% lower than what the prior resident was paying, while renewing residents averaged decreases of 0.8%. These amounts vary throughout our 21 markets, with California, Phoenix, Orlando and Seattle, experiencing the largest rate declines on new leases. As expected, our DC, Baltimore and Mid-Atlantic markets experienced the lowest rental rate drops on new leases.", "Our strategy in 2009 has been to drive occupancy during prime leasing season in anticipation of the winter seasonal downturn. We have met our plan as same community occupancy increased 60 basis points to 95.6% from 95.0% last year.", "During the third quarter, all 21 of our markets had occupancy rates over 94%. Because of the continued expansion of our technology platform, superior locations, the quality of our real estate and our focus on customer service, we have been successful in maintaining occupancy levels that have averaged 95.4% over the first nine months of this year.", "We are confident that we can sustain this level of occupancy through the remainder of 2009. In fact, just this past weekend, our occupancy rate was 95.5%. To be at this high occupancy level in the seasonally slow fourth quarter will drive higher revenue this year and also allow us to raise rents when the economy turns around.", "Our annualized turnover rate for 3Q \u201909 was 69%. That was slightly better than the 70% we reported in 3Q \u201908. Year-to-date turnover is 60%, which is flat with last year. Move-outs for home purchase continued to be very low in most of our markets.", "During the quarter, only 14% of our departing residents left to purchase a home. This compares to 13% last year and also 13% in 2Q \u201909. Markets with high home prices, such as Orange County, San Francisco, San Diego, Monterey and LA, all had move-out rates for home purchase of 10%. These markets represent almost 40% of our same-store NOI.", "Now turning to expenses for the quarter. Total expenses were down 1.6% for the quarter compared to the same quarter last year. Real estate taxes increased 3.2%. Utilities were down 3.4%, as increases in water expense were offset by lower natural gas prices and lower electricity expense. We continue to renegotiate pricing with the vendors that service our properties. These efforts have helped to drive down repairs and maintenance expense during the quarter by 4%. This includes the reduction in turnover expenses of 21%.", "Personnel costs were flat, as we have been able to realize some staffing benefits as a result of automating the way we conduct our business. Direct personnel cost -- personnel costs were down 2%. However, they were offset by slightly higher associate health care costs. Over the last several years, we have working to automate our business.", "Our first priority was to increase our Internet marketing to drive more and more perspective renters to our website. This has resulted in over 64% of our third quarter move-ins originating through an Internet source. This is up from 53% last year and from 62% in the second quarter of \u201909.", "Additionally, for the first nine months of 2009, we have experienced an increase in traffic to our website, udr.com, of 41% year-over-year. Driving more traffic through Internet sources, including mobile devices and multiple language sites, has been beneficial not only in maintaining our occupancy but also in decreasing our administrative and marketing costs, which were down 7% compared to the third quarter of last year.", "In the past year, we have been moving toward giving our residents what they want; 24/7 access to us and self-service. At the beginning of this year, we rolled out a resident Internet portal that allows them to electronically communicate with us as well as pay their rent online by ACH. Just nine months into the program, almost 80% of our residents are signed up to use the portal to conduct business with us electronically, and over 53% of our residents paid their rent by ACH in September.", "Additionally, during September, 26% of resident service requests were submitted through the portal. This enables our customers to submit a service request 24 hours a day, seven days a week with a detailed information they give us going directly into our system and automatically put into the queue to be completed, enabling us to get to the service request faster and fix the problem more quickly. This eliminates administrative work for our site teams, while giving our customers what they want.", "Now turning to our redevelopment and development progress. If you refer to attachment nine in our earnings supplement, you will see that we completed the redevelopment of seven communities, containing just over 2,100 apartment homes. These properties have leased occupancies between 95% and 98% and are performing in line with our pro formas.", "We have also completed eight developments containing almost 2,000 homes. Lease-up velocity has been very strong at these properties. In fact, leased occupancy at these properties ranged from 91% to 100%. As our development and redevelopment assets reach stabilization along with our recent acquisitions, our reliance on California and, in particular, Orange County will begin to diminish, and our metro DC market will gain prominence in our portfolio. Consequently, DC will become our second largest market and will account for 12% of our NOI. This also means that while Orange County will still be our largest market, it will represent only 13% of NOI, down from 16% today.", "In closing, these have been and will continue to be challenging times in the field. But with our use of technology, our commitment to our customers, and our focus on having our assets located in the best markets, we should continue to drive cash flow and emerge stronger. I\u2019d like to thank all of my fellow UDR associates for executing our game plan and continuing to bring in industry-leading results.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to you, Tom.", "Tom Toomey", "Thank you, Jerry. And operator, I think now we\u2019re prepared for the Q&A part of the call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from the line of David Toti with Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "David Toti \u2013 Citigroup", "Thanks. Tom, is it possible -- or Dave, can you walk us through some of the components of your guidance change? It looks like it is suggesting a stronger underlying NOI performance than you originally projected. Or is there some component that I\u2019m missing, given the sort of percentage of the reduction?", "David Messenger", "David, this is Dave Messenger. Regarding the guidance, essentially what we do is you take the midpoint from the original guidance, which is $1.29 and you take up $0.10 for the charge and $0.02 for the additional debt tender that we hadn\u2019t contemplated during the year. That gets you down to $1.17, which is the midpoint of the new range. And then we tightened the low and high end of the ranges, which is a combination of several items. One, we continue to reverse inquiries to purchase our debt. But we find the pricing unattractive, so we think there is little opportunity left in that well. We have also chosen to reset some of our maturities during the last couple quarters at higher interest rates than what they were previously. We are considering the equity that we issued during the quarter as part of the ATM program. And we are expecting our operations trends to continue the way they have in the first nine months of the year.", "David Toti \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up, are you -- are you comfortable with the sustainability of your expense reduction rate? Or is that something that has a finite life?", "Jerry Davis", "Hey, this is Jerry. I think it\u2019s sustainable. We won\u2019t be negative forever obviously the way we have been for the first nine months. But we haven\u2019t been deferring work. We think we are going to be able to continue to whittle away at expenses throughout the foreseeable future. We continue to negotiate contracts with vendors, and we continue to automate our -- the way we do business with technology, which I think is going to yield future benefits. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see a blow-up, but staying negative long-term just isn\u2019t possible.", "David Toti \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Swaroop Yalla with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Swaroop Yalla \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Yes, hi. Good afternoon, guys. My question is about the JV you have at KFH. What kind of competition are you expecting for the assets, which you will be targeting? What kind of bids you are expecting? And also if you are anticipating any distressed properties to come through and which you will be able to take advantage of?", "Mark Wallis", "This is Mark Wallis. I think what we\u2019ve seen so far is, there has been quite a few buyers in the market for high-quality assets and assets in these higher barrier-to-entry markets. We continue to look at a lot of deals, and we\u2019re going to -- we obviously have some criteria that we\u2019re going to stick by. At this point, we think we will be able to make some acquisitions. But I think what we\u2019ve learned so far is that cap rates are lower than probably when we first started talking about this months ago, which I think everyone would agree with that they are seeing the marketplace too. So a lot of it depends on finding the right asset that matches your criteria portfolio. We are seeing a fair amount of deals to look at, and I think we have an advantage on larger deals. So we are just going to keep shopping and keep looking, and go from there. Tom, do you want to add something to that?", "Tom Toomey", "Yes. This is Toomey. I\u2019d add, the distress, as you specifically stated, requires the fact that you don\u2019t have anybody to show up at a table to buy or that you have a limited number of buyers. And as I noted in my earlier comments, you see one asset come to the market and there is 30-plus people that are showing up to bid for that asset, all in a tight range and most of them not with financial contingency. So we are seeing that similar type of event across many markets. And so I\u2019m not saying that there won\u2019t be distress. Right now, we do not see any in the marketplace.", "Swaroop Yalla \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Habermann with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Jay Habermann \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Hey, guys, good afternoon. Tom, just a comment. I guess in the press release you mentioned for development, most of the deliveries being delivered next year in 2010 expecting improving market conditions. Can you clarify a little bit? Are you still expecting that the gap between new rents versus existing will just be that gap continues to narrow or do you think you\u2019ll actually start to see some pricing power again?", "Tom Toomey", "Well, I think a couple of things, then I\u2019ll ask Jerry -- add Jerry to -- in some of our markets that the developments are being delivered, say, for example, the DC corridor and Texas corridor of rents seem to have bottomed and be strengthening. And so; we\u2019ll probably see stronger rents next year in those markets as those development activities get delivered. In the case of properties of Phoenix, it\u2019s still sliding down, but not at a greater rate than it was at the beginning of the year. Is that a fair summary, Jerry?", "Jerry Davis", "Yes, I would agree with that. Just to add on, if you look at our DC rents -- when you look at the new leases we signed in the third quarter compared to what the prior residents was paying, certainly down 3.5%. That\u2019s been sliding down each quarter throughout this year. So we do feel like DC is going to be a market that continues to do well and the same thing is true for our Dallas product.", "Jay Habermann \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And I guess, given the cap rates you talked about, sub 5% or 5% range for certainly best-in-class assets, are you starting to look at development yields? And I guess, give us a sense of where yields would be today for starts.", "Mark Wallis", "This is Mark Wallis. I mean, traditionally what you look for on development yields is obviously a premium of what the cap rates are. The cap rates getting in the 5s and sometimes low 5s, obviously when you get to a range of, say, 150 basis points over, 6.5%, in that range in some of these markets, take a DC market with your expected rent growth as the markets recover, start to make sense. Historically, what we\u2019ve seen, the cap rate spread or development versus an acquisition, it\u2019s probably tighter in the DC market, in California. If you get to markets like Texas market, for example, probably that basis point spread is 25 basis points more. But with the cost of debt and the way things are looking as far as ultimately a recovery, I think we see that median of a 150 basis point spread as being where it is today. Given -- qualify that a coastal market may shade a little bit differently from a sunbelt market.", "Jay Habermann \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "I\u2019m sorry, just to clarify, did you mention that the cap rates were -- those were US institutional buyers or you seeing foreign capital given the weak dollar?", "Mark Wallis", "US institutional buyers.", "Jay Habermann \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Biffert with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.", "Mark Biffert \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Good afternoon. Just adding on to the KFH joint venture, Tom, what IRRs are you guys targeting in that fund, or that JV?", "Warren Troupe", "This is Warren. We are looking at a 7%.", "David Messenger", "Our IRRs are looking more like a 12.", "Mark Biffert \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Okay. And then in terms of the markets that you\u2019re looking at, I mean, are they focused mainly on -- you were saying high barrier. I mean, do you consider high barrier in this market to be DC, New York, or is it the West Coast looking like you might get some opportunities given either distress or sellers that may be financially distressed?", "Warren Troupe", "I think we agree DC, New York and the West Coast, particularly San Francisco would be considered in that area. And we\u2019re also looking at Southern California. And there may be up -- we would go up the West Coast to Seattle at some point, but those would highlight where our focus has been.", "Mark Biffert \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Okay. And then, Tom, you had mentioned in an interview a couple of weeks ago that you might have something close by the end of the year. Is that still your anticipation or has pricing not moved enough for you to make a move in making a deal?", "Tom Toomey", "I think we are in tight on a number of properties that we are bidding on. And while nothing is certain to get across the goal line, we will see how the chips fall, that we feel pretty confident that we will be able to get this money out over the next couple year period and find activities, rather it\u2019s between now and the end of the year and shortly thereafter. I\u2019m not overly worried about the long-term yields that we\u2019re going to get out of this deal and our promote [ph].", "Mark Biffert \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Okay. And then lastly, I\u2019m just wondering what you think the impact might be if Congress continues the homeownership credit in terms of -- it seemed like homeownership move-outs, homeownership ticked up about 1%. I mean, would you expect that to move up, given some of the recent axiometric [ph] data, which showed that the costs or the spread between renting and owning had compressed through the third quarter?", "Tom Toomey", "I think Jerry highlighted in his earlier comments that homeownership in our portfolio -- in this reconstituted portfolio, move-outs have been extremely low\u00a0at 10% in our high barrier markets and 13% in Florida and Texas markets. So I don\u2019t think we are feeling the impact of that 8,000. I don\u2019t think it makes people psychology of running out to buy a home any comfortable now, and you combine the 8,000 credit with even record low mortgage rates that seems like housing doesn\u2019t appear to be much of a threat to this portfolio at this time.", "Mark Biffert \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Levy with Macquarie. Please go ahead.", "Michael Levy \u2013 Macquarie", "Hey, good evening. I know it\u2019s early on, but can you please discuss the delta on effective rent since maybe the end of the summer leasing season, maybe the end of August? Also, are there any markets in which effective rents have been improving since then? I\u2019m trying to get a sense of, now that the demand may have dried up a little bit, where rents have headed.", "Jerry Davis", "Sure, Mike. This is Jerry Davis. They really haven\u2019t dropped much. Most of our markets have remained firm. When you look at our occupancy at 95.5% as of today, we\u2019ve been able to stay forward out really seeing a decline in our market rents. And when you look at our gain to lease we have on our rents, and compare June to September, it\u2019s actually the gain has gone from about 2.5% in June to a little less than 1% now. So we are actually seeing most markets stabilize. The exception would be some of the Southern California markets. Orange County and San Diego have probably trended down a little. Our Mid-Atlantic markets have strengthened. San Francisco\u2019s remained stable. We\u2019ve done surprisingly well up in Seattle where the rents have gotten -- they have been fairly stable, but when you look at the decline from last year, that shrank a little. And Florida has been pretty stable for the last three to four months.", "Michael Levy \u2013 Macquarie", "Thank you very much. If I can just ask a follow-up question unrelatedly, I know Tom's example of the asset being sold in DC with the low five handle was meant for illustrative purposes, but with assets being sold at levels that seem somewhat aggressive, I guess maybe to me, would the company consider disposing of assets to take advantage of the flood of bidders that seem to have entered the market?", "Tom Toomey", "This is Toomey. We sold the $1.7 billion portfolio earlier this year. And in that effort, we made a conscious -- to try to clean out this portfolio, if you will, at that time. I don\u2019t see any point now in what we would be selling and redeploying the funds as a very accretive to NAV-type situation. So I think we are on the sideline for selling assets at this point in time. We will evaluate it probably in the next year when we get more clarity on NOIs and what we would do with the proceeds. I\u2019m pretty comfortable where we are at right now on this portfolio. I\u2019d ask Jerry to comment a little bit about the occupancy and the rent.", "Jerry Davis", "I think you have to realize that we are making a conscious effort to run our occupancy up as high as possible in the 95-plus range to give us, if you will, a little bit of gliding room through the fourth and early part of next year when traffic is very slow. And what we're hopeful is an improving job market and a higher occupancy gives us a chance, if you will, to go to guns and rent increases earlier. And that was a conscious debt on our part. And I think we\u2019re going to -- it's going to pay off.", "Michael Levy \u2013 Macquarie", "Well, I certainly hope so. I guess I would just ask after hearing that, what sort of efforts were being made to -- I mean, it sounded like the turnover was basically the same as it was the previous third quarter on an annualized basis, which I guess given that you seem to be working pretty hard to keep existing tenants. I guess I was a bit surprised that it was not a more material improvement. Is there any -- is there any way that I should be looking at that or is it just a function of the summer trends [ph] and the high natural turnover in the portfolio?", "Jerry Davis", "There is a little bit of that, but the other thing that\u2019s affected us when you compare this year over last year\u2019s move-outs related to money problems, whether it\u2019s skips evictions or people just moving out or losing their jobs, has gone up 4% to 5% year-over-year. The people that can afford to stay, they really don\u2019t want to move. And I think they are seeing the customer service efforts that we\u2019ve been giving them as well as allowing them to do business more automated with us, has helped keep it flat, especially when you do look at that increase in the money issues that people have. And you\u2019re seeing that more, again, out in the West Coast than you are the other parts of the country.", "Michael Levy \u2013 Macquarie", "Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michelle Ko with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Michelle Ko \u2013 Bank of America", "Hi. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the wide gap, the spread between the new leases and the renewal rates. It seems like you\u2019ve done a good job in terms of sustaining the wide spread. I was just wondering if you thought that would narrow over the next six to nine months with the renewals rolling down, and in those weaker quarters, in the 4Q and 1Q, the seasonally weaker quarters, if we might see more roll-down then.", "Tom Toomey", "I think you will see that spread between new leases and renewals compress. This quarter, we were at 6.8% down on new leases and our renewals were down 0.8%. I think what you\u2019re going to see over the next six months is the spread on new leases to the expiring lease continue to go down. Especially as we get more pricing power in the Mid-Atlantic markets, it does feel like some of the West Coast markets have stabilized. They are not growing larger. I think you\u2019re going to see that continue to come down. And I can tell you, right now, we are not -- we are making a conscious effort not to push anybody out because of the rent increase. We are consciously monitoring that. We are not going to get aggressive on the rent increases till we get more comfortable that we can reload that exiting resident with somebody who is going to pay higher. So I think you are going to see that spread, which today is about 6% tight.", "Michelle Ko \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay, great. Also I was wondering if you could give us a little more color on the JV write-downs and how much in percentage terms were actually written down. And do you think there could be more write-downs related to some of the other JVs?", "David Messenger", "Michelle, this is Dave. In terms of our JVs, we assess these every quarter. These are the only two that we felt were indicative of a write-down to what\u2019s essentially a lower cost or fair-market value of the accounting rules. They are also the only two assets that we have that include non-stabilized or development properties. So we felt that at the end of the quarter, the balance of our JV investments, which are small to the balance sheet as a whole, were accurately stated under GAAP. Did that answer all of your questions?", "Michelle Ko \u2013 Bank of America", "Yes, thank you.", "Tom Toomey", "I think, Michelle, you need to also remind -- this is Toomey. The value that we wrote them down to were appraisals furnished to us by a bank as they were looking at the loans. And so they may not be indicative of what the ultimate value of the real estate is. It\u2019s just marked to what you have to do in an equity accounting treatment is the fair market value, and our auditors have determined fair market value at this time as the appraisal process. And as a result, I think if you talk to any other real estate person, you\u2019d find that appraisals are probably not a very good indication of long-term value of the real estate. They are indicative of kind of stressed banking situations, stressed NOIs, and what assets would have to be sold for today. But I think the accounting rules take precedence over everything, and as a result, we use the appraisals to evaluate those.", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator instructions) Our next question comes from Dave Bragg with ISI Group. Please go ahead.", "Dave Bragg \u2013 ISI Group", "Hi, good afternoon. I think one market we didn\u2019t really cover yet is Texas. I know it\u2019s not a big part of the same store pool, Jerry, but could you talk about operations there and how they have trended over the past few months?", "Jerry Davis", "Yes. We operate in three markets in Texas, Dave; Dallas, Houston, and Austin. Dallas has -- the job markets held up fairly well. They have lost 61,000 jobs this year, but overall what\u2019s affected Dallas most is the new supply that\u2019s come on line. And in the fourth quarter, another 8,500 units are set to come on line. So we are in for a fight there. A lot of the new product also is coming in from the Plano area, as well as uptown and downtown. So it will\u00a0be competitive for our properties there because that\u2019s also where we\u2019re located. Our rents fall in about 4% on the new leases in Dallas. And rents in Dallas overall, when you talk to the economists, have fallen 4% year-over-year. Right now, we are not seeing any real job losses in the foreseeable future, but you do have the supply that\u2019s always going to be an issue in Dallas.", "Houston -- Houston, at the beginning of the year, was probably our best market when you look at new rents versus expiring rents. I think in the first quarter we actually had increases. By the third quarter, we were down 7.3%. So Houston has really done a U-turn on us. Over the last year, they have lost about 95,000 jobs. There is a not a whole lot of new supply coming on line about 3,200 units. But unfortunately, there is quite a bit -- somewhere in the 15,000-plus units that are still in lease-up, and lease-ups are taking longer in Houston. And as you\u2019re probably aware, what\u2019s affected Houston, there has been a little bit of job loss. I mean, there has been job loss, but there's also been all the people that's moved in from hurricane Ike. Their homes have been repaired and they have moved back. So Houston has gone dramatically worse in the last nine months.", "And moving on to Austin, Austin continues to be a market that is over-supplied. We saw new leases repricing at 7.6% below what the exiting resident was paying. Austin, we still believe in it long-term. It\u2019s going to be one of the premier markets in the country over the next two to three years, but it\u2019s going to have to just make its way through all the supply that\u2019s come on and could continue to come.", "Dave Bragg \u2013 ISI Group", "Okay. So, just assuming you get the same level of job growth throughout the portfolio, it sounds to me as though you\u2019d be more concerned about these markets going forward -- over the next 12 months, assuming no job growth.", "Jerry Davis", "Well, I think you\u2019re going to have the supply issues, which are much higher than you could see around the rest of the country. I think Dallas, Houston and Austin over the foreseeable future probably will have job growth that\u2019s a little better than the rest of the country. But they are going to continue to have supply issues like they always have.", "Dave Bragg \u2013 ISI Group", "Got it, okay. One other question. Could you just talk about the -- your efforts to generate other income at the property level? Just from visiting properties, I\u2019ve seen a couple of things, including TVs, closet systems. I'm not sure if you're doing valet waste or something similar to that. Can you talk about just the broader efforts and what sort of penetration do we have across the whole portfolio?", "Tom Toomey", "This is Toomey. We have always evaluated each individual assets in the market on its merits and tried to find opportunities where we could inject a better quality product and get a better return for our investment. What we are finding today is that many of those programs that residents are not receptive to those rent increases, and you\u2019ll find that we\u2019ve curtailed a great number of them where it does have some tractions, probably the DC marketplace, couple of our particular properties in Southern California and Northern California. So the program hasn\u2019t been put forth with the same kind of energy we\u2019ve had in the past because not a prudent use of capital and not a prudent return. The good news, I think, when the economy kicks back up, we\u2019ll be able to go back to guns on those and do well at them.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Paolone with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.", "Anthony Paolone \u2013 JP Morgan", "Thank you. I want to tie together your core guidance from the last quarter and just the guidance for the year. So you had negative 3% to negative 5% same store, and it would seem that to kind of even be in that range, the fourth quarter would be down into the double digits almost. And can you comment on that? Are we looking at that right?", "David Messenger", "I guess the way I've kind of rationalized the guidance going into the fourth quarter, since we are\u00a0not in the business of giving our quarterly guidance, is that we expect our trends to continue for revenue and expenses through the balance of the year. And while we try to be on the low end of both of those ranges, we didn\u2019t feel prudent to try to update and specify an exact target for both revenue and expense. So revenue, we thought, would still -- we're trending towards the 3% to 5%. Expenses, we\u2019re trending hopefully on the better side.", "Anthony Paolone \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay. And then just a follow-up on the JV tying together I think a couple of the things you said. So with 5% cap rates, can you get to the return hurdles of the fund?", "Mark Wallis", "This is Mark Wallis. I mean, we didn\u2019t verify it. So I think that\u2019s the statement that we\u2019re looking for some values better than that. As you know, cap rate is not the only story. We are running these on IRR models, and it depends on what kind of recovery it is, what the occupancy makeup is, what we think we can do the asset to increase revenue. But a general answer is, when it gets that low, it\u2019s going to be harder for us to clear our hurdles. But you've got to ask them sometimes that's mitigated by value-creation opportunities we see in the asset that we could put into the asset.", "Anthony Paolone \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Dustin Pizzo with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Dustin Pizzo \u2013 UBS", "Hi, (inaudible). Just a follow-up on some of the private market questions. How sustainable do you think these lower cap rates are, assuming that they may be driven by either, A, the lower cost of financing we\u2019ve seen, or B, simply a dearth of quality product that\u2019s on the market today as opposed to buyers getting more aggressive with some of their growth assumptions? And then, two, do you think that -- or I guess, what type of spread do you think there would be today between some of these one-off asset sales that we\u2019ve seen as opposed to if you try to trade a larger portfolio, assuming you could even get financing for something like that?", "Mark Wallis", "This is Mark Wallis. Regarding the sustainability of these cap rates, and again the cap rate is just one factor you look at, but one thing if you look out in the next two to three years, aside from a couple of markets, there is very little new product being delivered to the market and there is very new little products being started. Therefore that factor is going to remain the same. In fact, the two-year old asset in two years is going to be four to five years old. So that\u2019s one thing we think is going to make it more sustainable than maybe we thought originally.", "Two, eventually recessions end and eventually jobs come back. And when they do come back, someone may underwrite a depressed low NOI, knowing that it's going to rebound quickly when jobs come back. And they will show greater growth even though the initial going-in cap rate is low. So we will see how long this situation will last. But when jobs come back, that may make it sustainable also. And then again, just the lack of supply and how that\u2019s going to play out, it\u2019s hard to replace these assets at these prices. So, I think it's more sustainable, but as you know, depending on job growth, individual markets, they can -- there is going to be variations off that theme.", "Dustin Pizzo \u2013 UBS", "Okay. And can you tell us what dollar volume of properties you\u2019ve actually bid on this year?", "Mark Wallis", "I would say around $350 million, give or take.", "Tom Toomey", "Nearer to $350 million, if you look at my scorecard.", "Mark Wallis", "Yes. Some of those, obviously, you bail out early in the process. But what I\u2019m trying to indicate there is we are looking at a lot of stuff. And so, that doesn't mean we're -- we may\u00a0decide to lose early on.", "David Messenger", "A couple of other things you might want to factor in to the overall equation about cap rates is the amount of capital that has\u00a0been raised either in terms of the private REIT, the public REIT or just other streams of levered players that are in the marketplace. And when we look down the list of who we\u2019re losing to, these are not amateurs. These are people with a lot of money behind them and a lot of skill behind them. In particular, I thought the DC asset was unique in the sense that the top 10 bidders were only 2% apart on their bids. So that meant there was, in this case, 29 people who did not succeed, who are probably out there a little bit hungrier the next time around, trying to get that money out.", "So I think high-caliber assets in good markets, good locations, we are going to\u00a0start to finally see the spread in cap rates emerge that hasn\u2019t been lacking for the last three years. And so the five that\u2019s kind of being thrown around that deal certainly looks like there is a lot of money out there that\u2019s interested in putting itself to work at that entry level. And I can\u2019t say it\u2019s not a bad idea. If you think about a long-term supply/demand of that market, Mark\u2019s point is right, I mean, lot of people are underwriting kind of an 2012 spike in rents because there has been nothing been delivered for some period of time now. I mean, we are at a 25-year record low building. And every time I\u2019ve seen this industry and I haven\u2019t been at it for full 25 years, but whenever you have these type of supply numbers and there is capital, prices rise.", "Tom Toomey", "One thing we didn\u2019t I guess ask you one-off question, one-off asset versus portfolio. I think that's always very difficult to answer because portfolio sometimes mean there\u2019s five great assets and one asset you got to try to get the great asset that clouds the cap rate and the delta between the two. I think people tend to underwrite these assets on their own. Sometimes you get a dynamic either way, either a better price or depending on the competition and the strategic value of the portfolio, you can have a higher price. It\u2019s really hard to make the call on that. (inaudible) compared to either way.", "Dustin Pizzo \u2013 UBS", "Okay. And then I believe Ross has a follow-up as well.", "Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS", "Hi, guys, good afternoon. A question on your expense line, because you, I think, positively surprised us with the decline. And I\u2019m looking at page 27 of your supplemental, and I compared it to your disclosure a year ago for the first nine months. And what\u2019s interesting to me is, it looks like year-over-year you drove the spending curve unit down -- at least for the first nine months, down to about $519 a unit, which is down $10 from where it was at this point last year. But the CapEx spending shot up pretty dramatically from about $430 to $511. So it looks like the R&M line is going down and the CapEx line is going up. So I guess -- I\u2019m having trouble reconciling those two.", "Why don\u2019t we, as we\u2019re looking through it, take the next call and see if we can come back with --", "David Messenger", "This is Dave. Ross, just real quick. The R&M line, we expected to be coming down as we have newer assets and we completed a lot of the projects over the past several years, be it the kitchen and bath a few years ago, the HVAC program we\u00a0did two, three years ago, four years ago, with that, we have a newer portfolio, younger portfolio that requires less to do on the repair and maintenance side. And so what we\u2019ve chosen to do is, put more of our dollars into the capital side of the business versus having to spend on a used basis for R&M.", "Jerry Davis", "I would add one thing to that. We made a conscious effort this year to get a lot of our larger projects, what we call asset quality deals, done early in the year, so we get the benefit in revenue from that, whether it\u2019s paint jobs, parking lots, things like that. So I think part of it is, we\u2019ve done more early in the year than we did in the past. We\u2019re on track this year to spend about $675 a door in recurring CapEx. Last year we spent about $630, $635. So it\u2019s going up a little bit. I think the other thing is we pushed more of it early in the year to get the revenue benefit.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Stevenson with Fox-Pitt Kelton. Please go ahead.", "Rob Stevenson \u2013 Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Good evening, guys. Most of my questions have been answered, but, Tom, given the comments that you guys have made about cap rates of the DC markets, the demand for properties that\u2019s probably only going to get more significant as we move forward, why wouldn\u2019t you guys start the 14th Street development project in the remainder of 2009 for, let\u2019s say, a 2011 delivery, given that your debt is in a decent position, you guys could issue at the market equity today at 15.5 or so, something like that? And so it seems like that that would be one of the development projects that could get green light sooner rather than later?", "Mark Wallis", "This is Mark Wallis. A couple things on timing, obviously we entered 2009 being very cautious about our timing. We probably tend to be more cautious than we maybe could have been, but that\u2019s usually good. Couple of things. One is timing of just when you start projects in DC and the weather. So right now, what we -- we're always evaluating when is the right time to go. I can\u2019t commit to that today, but it would be more of a mid-2010 would be a time we look at starting. And the other thing we\u2019re doing is our construction prices have got much better. We have spent the time to get drawings up to 100%. And so we now can really get tighter bids on that, and so we would still have that process to go through, come back, evaluate, see how the market looks, how the capital market looks, and go. But those two factors would put you, when you -- decision point mid-2010 versus -- in mid-2009, we were not at that point.", "Rob Stevenson \u2013 Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Okay. And then a follow-up. Part one, Jerry, what was bad debt this quarter and a year ago? And then, Dave, is there any equity issuance in your fourth quarter guidance?", "Jerry Davis", "I\u2019ll take that first. Bad debt this quarter was 0.6% of gross potential rents that compares to 0.5% last year in the third quarter, so it was a little bit. If you look at on a full year versus full year, this year we are 0.7%. Last year, we were 0.4%. What that tells me is the worst of the bad debt, hopefully, is over. We started having bad debt look worse in the third quarter of last year, aggressively got worse, probably peak in the middle of the first to the middle of the second quarter, and it seems to be stabilizing back down on that 0.6%.", "David Messenger", "This is Dave. In terms of guidance, what we provided was an annual range. So what I have in there is the equity\u00a0issuance that we did in the third quarter, 2.3 million shares.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karin Ford with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.", "Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc", "Hi, good evening. I guess on past calls, Tom, you\u2019ve discussed at length your views on the ideal leverage for the company. And given the positive changes in the capital market environment as well as seems like improving visibility in the fundamental environment, can you just talk about any changes to your views on leverage?", "Tom Toomey", "I guess my views haven\u2019t changed at all. It\u2019s been pretty consistent through this economic downturn, and we\u2019ve got a good balance sheet structure properly. And we will continue to be looking at the market and the pricing of the full range of capital, and figuring out what\u2019s the best opportunities for us.", "Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc", "Okay. Just a follow-up. We talked about the write-downs in the JV portfolio. Do you guys foresee any potential write-downs in the old land portfolio?", "David Messenger", "This is Dave. We continue to evaluate our land and our holdings every quarter. So it\u2019s an ongoing quarterly process.", "Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky with Royal Bank of Canada Capital. Please go ahead.", "Michael Salinsky \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada Capital", "Good afternoon, actually. Most of my questions have been answered. Just had a question specifically about the 2008 acquisition portfolio. Can you talk about the performance of that? And also, one of the catalysts there had been about the lease-up opportunities, the ramp-up opportunities. Can you talk about, like, where that portfolio is from an occupancy and how much lease-up opportunities, and also when you expect to roll that into the same store portfolio?", "Jerry Davis", "Sure. I\u2019ll take first shot at that. Every one of those properties we bought last year, I believe, has reached stabilized occupancy and probably of rates between 90% and 98% occupancy today. Obviously some of the rents we underwrote those deals at, the economy changed and we\u2019re not getting the pro forma rents that we had expected. But we have been able to fill them up, to run them effectively. And I guess that\u2019s about it. But, you know, rent levels in some of the markets, DC, probably held up a little better than the one from San Francisco and the West Coast. We did have one in San Jose that has performed probably better than expectations. The ones in Texas are pretty close to expectations. But the ones up in Seattle as well as the one in downtown San Francisco, the rents are not where we had expected.", "Michael Salinsky \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada Capital", "Okay. Relative to your same store portfolio, I\u2019m assuming the performance has been better then?", "Jerry Davis", "It\u2019s probably comparable. It depends on the market they\u2019re in. They have done as well as the properties in our same store DC, probably a little better because these deals were inside the beltway versus the ones that are outside. So they probably performed a little better, although they have been in competition with other properties in Arlington that were in lease-up. So they have been fairly concessionary\u00a0over the first 12 months we owned them. The rest of the properties, I would say, have performed pretty much like our same store properties. And your other question, I think, was when did they roll into our same store? They have been. They typically stay out of the same store for five quarters and then we roll them in. So we can always have a comparable quarter in the last year.", "Michael Salinsky \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada Capital", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And I think that\u2019s it for me.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paula Poskon with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.", "Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Thank you. Good afternoon. Are you seeing any differences across the markets in terms of turnover trends? And in particular, in what markets, if any, are you seeing job loss as the biggest contributor to move-outs?", "Jerry Davis", "I\u2019m seeing job loss as probably one of the bigger ones in Orange County, some in San Francisco. Turnover trends, you\u2019ve got some markets that are down dramatically from last year. I know Phoenix, Inland Empire, some of the ones that you\u2019d be surprised because of the market is not performing well. They just had such high turnover last year when the economy first turned that on a comparable basis, they are doing better.", "Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Thanks. And just a follow-up on the DC asset transaction that we\u2019ve been talking about. Would you have been considering that for your JV or for your own balance sheet?", "Mark Wallis", "This is Mark Wallis. That was considered for our JV, although I said [ph] we liked the asset. We think that that would be a first look for our JV, but we like the asset -- certainly it\u2019s something we would put on our balance sheet if given the right opportunity.", "Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with ISI Group. Please go ahead.", "Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group", "Good afternoon. Tom, I\u2019d just want to clarify, the cap rate that you\u2019ve been talking about for this DC asset, as I understand it, that\u2019s kind of after CapEx and the management fee. Is that correct?", "Mark Wallis", "This is Mark Wallis. That\u2019s correct.", "Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group", "So if you were to just kind of adjust that to kind of plain old NOI, do you have a sense for how much that cap rate might move up?", "Mark Wallis", "It usually moves up, what, 100 basis points. Typically, rule of thumb -- haven't done the math. It\u2019s going to be close to that.", "Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group", "Okay. And then, just to maybe go back to Ross's question, just on this I guess attachment 12, where you\u2019re talking about CapEx, I guess I\u2019m just trying to understand the -- there are kind of two buckets. You\u2019ve got something called revenue enhancing as well as asset preservation. And I guess the revenue enhancing would seem to me, you almost have to add that with the bucket below in order to kind of really assess how the same store is being impacted. Is that correct? Or what am I missing on the revenue enhancing?", "Mark Wallis", "That\u2019s correct. Just keep in mind that on a -- the asset preservation is on stabilized (inaudible), so it will be slightly different. But your analysis isn\u2019t far off.", "Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group", "Okay. So would it be fair to use the rough same 43,400 units for that kind of $19 million bucket to try and get a kind of a gross CapEx per unit number or am I going to be terribly off?", "Mark Wallis", "No, that\u2019s correct.", "Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group", "That\u2019s correct. Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Liddell [ph] with AIG. Please go ahead.", "Mike Liddell \u2013 AIG", "Thanks, guys. Just a follow-up to a leverage question earlier. Just curious in terms of the combination between secured versus non-secured. Is this purely a pricing decision in your mindset or is the greater alliance like GSEs or just mortgage debt as a whole come into play there? Where does the price become less of an issue?", "Warren Troupe", "This is Warren. I think to date, the unsecured market has been not as attractive as the secured. And so obviously we\u2019ve gone out and done a substantial amount under the Fannie Mae facilities. But the secured market -- you know, the unsecured market has come in and it\u2019s become a lot more attractive. And also we\u2019ve tried to maintain some kind of balance between our unsecured and our secured. So I think as we go forward, we will continue to evaluate both options.", "Mike Liddell \u2013 AIG", "Do the rating agencies give you any sort of restrictions in terms of what percent of your debt is coming from secured versus unsecured and where that could put downward ratings pressure?", "Warren Troupe", "It gives some general guidelines, but they don't give you specific numbers.", "Mike Liddell \u2013 AIG", "Okay. And then just an operational question. In previous quarters, you may have noted this already, but you provided a rent versus buy gap on your portfolio. Could you give us any sort of sense as to what that is this quarter?", "Warren Troupe", "I\u2019m sorry, rent versus what?", "Mike Liddell \u2013 AIG", "Rent versus buy differential margin?", "Warren Troupe", "I\u2019m sorry, yes. Today, for the entire portfolio, our average rent is probably about 80% of a -- what a mortgage payment would be. That varies obviously by market when you look at Orange County. I think last quarter I said the difference was, I think, $750 or $800. It\u2019s dropped a little. It\u2019s about $700. And then the spread on San Francisco, for example, is still well over $1,000. Some of the markets, it\u2019s a push, to be honest with you. Some of the Sunbelt markets where prices have\u00a0been knocked down and average rents may be $900 to $1,000, it will be equal. But portfolio-wide it\u2019s about 80%.", "Mike Liddell \u2013 AIG", "And at what level do you get -- do you start to see a greater propensity to move out to buy? I know you said it -- the whole portfolio, that you\u2019re not really starting to see much of an increase, but at what point do you believe the stress actually pushes them to move out?", "David Messenger", "I don\u2019t think rent levels today would stress. I mean, I think what\u2019s pushing them right now is own prices coming down. And you are losing some of your better residents that have been -- now they have good credit and they have good jobs, do see opportunities at times to jump out and buy a house. That happens more in the\u00a0Sunbelt markets than we\u2019re seeing in our coastal markets. What you\u2019re really -- move-outs to homeownership to purchase a home in Orange County, it\u2019s 6% of our move-outs. And in San Francisco, it\u2019s I think 6% to 8%. DC is probably a little around 10%. The markets where you see people moving out are places like Nashville, Houston, Richmond, places where home prices are cheap.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew McCulloch with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.", "Andrew McCulloch \u2013 Green Street Advisors", "Hi, good afternoon. Back to the private market valuation for a second -- the private market value for a second, cap rates can be misleading depending on what CapEx you are using, NOI, what NOI assumptions, management fee, et cetera, can you comment a little bit on the trend you are seeing as far as price per door in your major markets? And are those actually rising or have they just stopped falling?", "Mark Wallis", "This is Mark Wallis. I think generally it\u2019s a very general question, but the price per door has been going up.", "Andrew McCulloch \u2013 Green Street Advisors", "How do you think that compares to replacement costs and how do you think about replacements costs when you are looking at acquisitions versus starting the development pipeline backup?", "Mark Wallis", "Well, the academic method is you find a comparable piece of land and you have to price the land, and then we take -- since we are in the development business, we usually have current construction prices at hand, and we price it out that way. The variable always is can I find a comparable piece of land. In some cases, it\u2019s hard to find -- if it's infill, urban -- an exactly comparable piece of land. But what we do is take our -- we can, in markets, usually have relationships with general contractors aside from the deals we're building and see what they see as far as prices and you had to also evaluate, design and that kind of thing. But we do that exercise.", "Tom Toomey", "This is Toomey. I think the asset that we are particularly focused on in commenting priced probably at about 75% of its original construction. And so today, replacement cost is probably at 90% of replacement cost four-year old asset. So I think we've got some visibility and comfort around your NOIs. Assets are going to price very close to replacement costs very quickly, and people will -- astute buyers will focus on that. And where you still have falling NOIs, people are going to be a little bit more hesitant and resident, if you will, and pull back from that type of number. But ultimately, I think a replacement cost represents a nice flooring for our business with very little supply coming online. And you will see more and more people get drawn to that pricing mechanism.", "Andrew McCulloch \u2013 Green Street Advisors", "Great. Thanks. That was helpful. And then just had one follow-up question on unsecured\u00a0debt. What do you think you could do a 10-year unsecured deal at today?", "David Messenger", "Probably about 7.5.", "Andrew McCulloch \u2013 Green Street Advisors", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sherman [ph] with Parental Real Estate. Please go ahead.", "Jordan Sherman \u2013 Parental Real Estate", "Yes, hello. I\u2019m trying to -- two things. One is, midpoint of guidance -- FFO guidance that comes down by $0.02, trying to understand how much of that reflects the changes in the capital market activities, your debt issuance, the debt retirement, equity issuance versus changes in your operating assumptions?", "David Messenger", "Jordan, this is Dave. The $0.02 that you\u2019re referring to was a result of the debt tender offer that we did in the third quarter. So the midpoint of the original guidance was $1.29. Take out $0.10 for the charge on equity investments, $0.02 on the debt tender, gets you to $1.17.", "Jordan Sherman \u2013 Parental Real Estate", "Okay. So no changes in underlying operating assumptions?", "David Messenger", "We tightened the ranges. We tightened the high and the low end just based on what we are seeing in debt repurchase activity and possibilities. The fact that we\u2019ve reset some of our maturities ahead of schedule, we factored into account the equity issuance we did in the third quarter of 2.3 million shares under the ATM program.", "Jordan Sherman \u2013 Parental Real Estate", "Okay. Okay. And then I just want to revisit the question that Tony Paolone asked previously, come at it from a different angle. The way I understand your answer to this question is that the negative 3% to negative 5% decline in same store NOI is a run rate in the fourth quarter, not the expectation for full year results.", "David Messenger", "No, it\u2019s not correct. The expectation for full year would be -- for the full 12 months of 2009, the revenue would be down 3% to 5% -- I\u2019m sorry, 1% to 3%, and NOI would be down 3% to 5%.", "Jordan Sherman \u2013 Parental Real Estate", "Yes. That sort of implies a negative sort of 12% decline in the fourth quarter or something in that range.", "David Messenger", "That\u2019s, I believe, how the math shakes out. And like I said earlier, revenue we're expecting to be in the midpoint of our original guidance. Expenses, we\u2019ll try to do better than what we\u2019ve got out there. And we\u2019ll let the NOI line shake out to where it is. So we end up eating the 3% to 5% range, or landing in the middle of it. We will be pleased with those results.", "Jordan Sherman \u2013 Parental Real Estate", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Lee [ph] with L&B Investments [ph]. Please go ahead.", "Jon Litt \u2013 Citigroup", "Hey, Tom. It\u2019s Jon Litt. I'm here with Craig Melcher. Can you hear me all right?", "Tom Toomey", "Yes, we can, sir.", "Jon Litt \u2013 Citigroup", "My question was following up on Tony\u2019s as well. And I\u2019m just trying to understand, so -- the decision you guys are taking is that you are not giving quarterly guidance and that\u2019s why that 3% to 5% for NOI is still valid. Is that right?", "David Messenger", "Correct.", "Jon Litt \u2013 Citigroup", "So if you were -- because you did give effectively fourth quarter guidance by narrowing the range, so it seems a little incongruous because we're not going to get a negative double-digit NOI number. So it sounds like it\u2019s just you\u2019re abstaining from commenting on that for the fourth quarter.", "David Messenger", "Correct.", "Jon Litt \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Michael Salinsky with Royal Bank of Canada Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Michael Salinsky \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada Capital", "Just a follow-up question in light of the impairments there on the two Bellevue assets. Are there any of your joint venture partners that are struggling right now and is there any buyout opportunities on any of those?", "Mark Wallis", "This is Mark Wallis. We -- that was the only joint ventures, with those Bellevue assets, that we might have that opportunity. We have engaged in that. We are trying to develop -- and this is I think a mutual engagement. So we are trying to work on something that will be a win-win for both of us. I think obviously out there in the marketplace, a lot of private developers are looking for capital, and they might be more willing to look at this than they would otherwise. So, yes, we are looking at that. But we're just working out something that would be a win-win for both of us now that the asset is about completed.", "Michael Salinsky \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada Capital", "Okay, thank you.", "Tom Toomey", "Mike, you\u2019ve seen the asset, right?", "Michael Salinsky \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada Capital", "Yes.", "Tom Toomey", "Yes. You know it's a fabulous asset right across the street from Microsoft. Lease-up is going better than planned. I think Jerry has already reported this month 35 leases. And practically, for everything that\u2019s got a COO, we\u2019ve got a lease. So we are encouraged by lease-up of the assets. And we want to be fair to our partner as well.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is another follow-up question from Mark Biffert with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.", "Mark Biffert \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Sorry, all my questions have been answered. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of David Toti with Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup", "Hey, it\u2019s Michael Bilerman. David, just want to come back to the -- just the guidance range for the fourth quarter is $0.24 to $0.30. I\u2019m just trying to understand what may be in there if there is any sort of charges or gains or anything that would cause such a wide variance. We are talking almost 22%, 23% in terms of a spread for fourth quarter expectations.", "David Messenger", "If you take the third quarter core operations, we\u2019re expecting revenue to come down. Expenses will have tough comparables. I think that gets you into your range of $0.24 to $0.30 for the fourth quarter.", "Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup", "But the core coming out of the quarter was $0.31, I mean, to go down $0.07 to the low end would seem pretty dramatic of a decline.", "David Messenger", "That\u2019s fair. It's not an exact science. But looking at how leases are repricing today and where we see some of the possibilities on expenses, be it through either insurance, real estate, taxes, and some other unknowns that are out there, we are comfortable that $0.24 to $0.30 is the number you stated.", "Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup", "Right. And then effectively, everything in guidance is updated from capital markets perspective in terms of the equity issuance, the earlier debt issuance and everything else, the losses on the JV expect for within guidance today it\u2019s still this negative 3% to negative 5%. So if we model what you\u2019re running today, negative 1% year-to-date same store NOI growth, if we model that negative 2%, the Street generally is going to move their numbers much higher than your guidance range. Is that a fair assumption?", "David Messenger", "I\u2019d have to run the math when you're talking about going down to 1% or 2%. But the first half of your question about everything being factored into guidance, that is correct.", "Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup", "And then it\u2019s just the operations --", "David Messenger", "Correct. Yes, it\u2019s just the operations.", "Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Anthony Paolone with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.", "Anthony Paolone \u2013 JP Morgan", "Thanks. Tom, last quarter you were pretty adamant about not issuing equity unless you had an investment use of the proceeds, and you did a little bit in the third quarter, and your stock is a little higher today. Just wondering if you can update just your thoughts on how you are thinking about your at-the-market program in equity right now.", "Tom Toomey", "Tony, it\u2019s a fair question. In terms of the use of proceeds, certainly we\u2019re focused on our joint venture in funding our $54 million under that opportunity. And we find assets to buy with the joint venture. It\u2019s nice to show up with our money. And so that\u2019s been in the intent on the equity issuance is to try to get ahead of that. And I think it\u2019s a smart move on our part.", "Mark Wallis", "I think we\u2019ve just always said that we want to be flexible too and be able to dilate all of our capital market opportunities.", "Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up question from Michael Levy with Macquarie. Please go ahead.", "Michael Levy \u2013 Macquarie", "I was actually taking myself out of the queue. Tony just asked my question.", "Operator", "Thank you. And at this time, I\u2019m now showing no further questions. I'll turn the call back to management for any closing remarks.", "Tom Toomey", "Well, thank you, operator. And thank all of you for your time today. We certainly appreciate your calls and your attention to our company. With that, we look forward to seeing many of you next month at NAREIT. And with that, take care.", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the UDR third quarter earnings conference call.

Following the presentation, the conference will be opened for questions.

Please go ahead.", "Andrew Cantor \u2013 Vice President of Investor Relations", "Thank you for joining us for UDR\u2019s second quarter financial results conference call. Our second quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed earlier today and posted to our website, www.udr.com. In this supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements.", "I would like to note that statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements.

Welcome to UDR\u2019s second quarter conference call. On the call with me today are David Messenger, Chief Financial Officer; and Jerry Davis, Senior Vice President of Operations who will discuss our results, as well as Senior Officers, Warren Troupe; Harry Alcock; and Matt Akin, who will be available to answer questions during the Q&A portion of the call.", "On the call today, we will discuss our comments on four areas. First, a significant investment activity in 2011; second, capital markets activity; third, David will discuss our financial results and guidance for the remainder of the year; and finally, Gary will discuss our operations. The team has accomplished a great deal this year. I appreciate all of our hard work and believe we have a great deal of momentum to continue our success. With that, let\u2019s just start the results.", "In the first seven months of 2011, we have grown the portfolio by more than 15% or $1.2 billion through the acquisition of 2,600 homes in seven communities in Manhattan, Washington DC, San Francisco, and Boston. We have announced four new development projects continuing over 1,300 homes for an estimated cost of $375 million and the redevelopment of our Rivergate community for an estimated cost of $40 million to $60 million.", "As shown by our investment activity, we believe there has been opportune time to continue to grow our company and take advantage of the multifamily tailwind and the long-term positive fundamentals of the business.", "Let me take a minute to start the recent success in Manhattan and the rationale for nearly $1 billion investment in this market. I think it is clear we have demonstrated the ability to find the attractive off-market deals with above average growth prospect that will strengthen our portfolio. 10 Hanover Square, Rivergate, and 21 Chelsea were all acquired from three different families, each an off-market transaction. These types of acquisitions require an additional level of patience and creativity. Ultimately, we see significant value creation at these communities through the implementation of our operating platform and redevelopment expertise. We will continue to look for similar opportunities grow our presence in Manhattan. Gary will discuss in more detail the success we have already seen at 10 Hanover Square and Rivergate.", "Turning to capital markets activity, our recently completed $500 million secondary offering was very well-received by the market. The deal was four times oversubscribed and it was priced an attractive 2% discount to the previous day\u2019s close, demonstrating investor\u2019s confidence in our strategy. The offering combined with the ATM and opening unit issuance bring our year-to-date equity raised over $930 million, which means we have funded over 75% of our acquisition through equity.", "In summary, our company has gone through dramatic change since beginning of the year. And as a result, we have improved our balance sheet, a larger percentage of our NOI coming from above average growth market, and dramatically increased our income per occupied home. We have successfully executed on what we bet we are going to do, de-leveraging through acquisitions and high-barrier to entry market. We are done yet and we believe that this is the right time to enhance the quality and size of our portfolio through acquisitions, development, and redevelopment.", "With that said, we also believe now it is an appropriate time to sell selected communities. As NOIs have recovered, combined with low interest rate provides us an opportunity to execute at attractive prices. In closing, with the substantial improvement to our portfolio and balance sheet as well as the continued success for our operating platform, we look forward to the remainder of the year.", "With that, I would pass the call on to David.", "David Messenger \u2013 Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Tom. Earlier this morning, we reported a year-over-year 15% increase in our quarterly FFO to $0.31. This consisted of $0.32 from our core operations and a $0.01 charge from non-core items or $1.1 million. Our results are consistent with our original guidance announced in February. Further details are included in our press release and supplements.", "The four non-core items for the quarter consisted of the following. First, we completed $628 million of acquisitions consisting of 10 Hanover Square in Manhattan and View 14 in Washington DC as well as our previously announced $500 million asset exchange. In connection with these transactions, we recorded $2.1 million of acquisition cost and will record additional cost in the third quarter as we have announced $570 million in acquisitions. Specifically, the closing of Rivergate in Manhattan and we are under contract to purchase 21 Chelsea also in Manhattan.", "Second, we completed a $350 million refinancing for six assets in our UDR/MetLife joint venture. The refinancing was done at a fixed rate of 4.73% and has a term of 10 years. UDR was paid a refinancing fee of $844,000. Third, we incurred $745,000 of severance charges, which will result in future D&A savings. And fourth, we sold Mustang Park a community owned by our (indiscernible) and recognized a gain net of taxes of $891,000. This asset was developed by a third-party through our pre-sell program in the third quarter of 2009 and subsequently sold this quarter.", "Turning to our balance sheet, as of June 30, we had $882 million of cash and credit capacity, which will more than meet our debt maturity, development, and redevelopment needs through 2012. During the quarter through our APM, we raised $231.2 million through the sale of $9.4 million shares at a weighted average net price of $24.51. Also we took advantage of an opportunity to repurchase 141,200 shares of our series G preferred stock at $25.38 a share and a yield of 6.71%.", "As previously announced, we priced a seven-year $300 million unsecured bond offering at 4.25%. The bond will mature of June 1, 2018. Subsequent to the quarter close, we sold 20.7 million shares at a price of $25 per share with proceeds being used to fund our most recent acquisitions, pay down debt, and for general corporate purposes. The balance of the year has $103 million of debt maturing, which we planned to pay for through asset sales. This debt has a weighted interest rate of 3.8% and an accounting rate of 5.6%.", "We also have the opportunity to prepay at par $100 million of a secured credit facility that carries a 6.78% interest rate. This too we planned to pay with sales proceeds. As a result of our acquisitions in 2010 and 2011 and the equity we have raised over the same time period, our credit metrics are improving faster than originally anticipated. We expect that our debt to EBITDA to have moved from above 10 times to below 8.5 times. Our debt to DAV will decrease from being above 53% to below 48% and our fixed charge will be above 2.4 times.", "Turning to our guidance, in conjunction with our July equity offering, we increased our 2011 guidance. Our full year 2011 FFO is expected to be between $1.25 and $1.30 per diluted share compared to our prior guidance of $1.20 to $1.25 per diluted share, a 4% increase at the midpoint. The change in the midpoint can be accounted for through the following; A $0.02 addition from improvement in same-store property NOI and $0.08 addition from our 2011 acquired properties, a $0.02 to $0.03 addition from improvement and other non-same-store property NOI, a $0.01 reduction from interest expense resulting from our $300 million 4.25% unsecured offering occurring earlier in the year than originally forecasted, and a $0.06 deduction related to the common equity issued in 2011 through our ATM program to July equity offering and the issuance of OP units.", "Let me give you some addition details of the following three material components impacting our new guidance. First our NOI, the revenues we expect the full year range of plus 4% to plus 4.5%. For expenses, we have tightened our range from plus 2% to plus 2.5% as a result of certain real estate tax appeals that were settled in the second quarter. Our NOI is now projected at the range from plus 5% to plus 6%.", "Second our share count; during 2011 through our ATM, we sold 15.2 million shares for $368.3 million in net proceeds. In July we sold 20.7 million shares at a rate of $496.3 million in net proceeds. In addition, as far the 10 Hanover closed transaction, we issued $2.6 million operating partnership unit for $64 million. In total, we have raised $930 million of equity at a weighted average net price at $24.16 per share. Third asset sales, we have announced that we expect about $200 million to $300 million of assets in the second half of the year, which the proceeds will be used to pay our maturing debt.", "Now I will turn the call over to Jerry.", "Jerry Davis \u2013 Senior Vice President, Property Operations", "Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Same-store NOI in the second quarter was up 5.1% as a result of revenue growth of 3.6% and expense growth of 70 basis points. Total same-store income per occupied home increased 3.7% to $1,181 and occupancy is down 10 basis points to 95.7%. This is the ninth straight quarter that our occupancy is averaged greater than 95.5%, translate into continued pricing dollar. In fact, our loss to lease at the end June 2011 was 6.3% or $74 per home. ", "Our same-store portfolio effective rental rate on new leases entered in to during the quarter on average 5% higher than what the prior residents was paying. Renewing resident on average paid 5.5% higher on effective basis. Renewal increases sent out for the month of August, September averaged greater than 6% with increases in our strongest market by San Francisco and Washington D.C. averaging 7% to 8% While we are pleased with our ability to push rent, our maintained occupancy this year that has been done without substantial job growth in majority of our market. We believe we will see more job creation in 2012.", "Resident turnover was down slightly in the quarter to an annualized rate of 55% compared to 56% to the second quarter of 2010. This marks the ninth consecutive quarter of declining turnover. Expense growth of 70 basis points will be result of higher utility, insurance cost, which were offset by lower real estate taxes. Repairs and maintenance and personnel costs were up less than 1%.", "Given the acquisition, development and redevelopment activity over the past 12 months, our non same-store portfolio has grown to 6,900 homes and now represents 20% of our total NOI, including over 3100 acquired homes located in markets such as Boston, Manhattan, San Francisco, Washington D.C., and select Southern California submarkets. The completed development of over 2,200 homes in six communities at a total estimated cost of $434 million or $185,000 per home. Over 80% of these homes will enter our same-store pool within the next year. In addition, we have 2,000 homes being developed at a total cost of $607 million or $304,000 per home. 40% of these homes will be delivered in 2012 and the remainder in 2013. Over 850 homes that are in redevelopment, the pipeline consists of three communities totaling 862 homes at a total cost of $117 million.", "Highlands of Marin, San Rafael, California is expected to enter our same-store portfolio in the second quarter of 2012. Barton Creek Landing in Austin, Texas is scheduled to be completed later this year. And City South in San Mateo, California will be completed by mid-year 2012. Leasing and pricing continue to be very strong at both of these communities and both are operating ahead of plan.", "Our joint venture with MetLife continues to progress well after taking over management of the portfolio in November of 2010, when physical occupancy was 83%, we have pushed that number up to over 94% occupancy and we have fully implemented our operating platform which has driven expenses down. We are pleased with our continued success with this portfolio.", "Let me turn now to our recent acquisitions. These acquisitions were completed in the third quarter of 2010. First, 10 Hanover Square since acquiring the asset in April, effective rents have increased 14% on new leases buying, exceeding our initial expectation. This level of rent growth in Manhattan over such a short period is an example of our ability to create value through our operating platform. We believe the World Trade Center development site will continue to define the lower Manhattan residential market, with plans for approximately 10 million square feet of office space, 500,000 square feet of retail space, a performing art center, and an improved 800,000 square foot transportation hub. The redevelopment of the World Trade Center site will continue to increase the desirability of the lower Manhattan area, including the residential market. We believe the Financial District is an attractive submarket of Manhattan to grow our presence and we will continue to look for opportunities.", "Second, Rivergate, let\u2019s take a minute to walk through this transaction. It\u2019s a 706-home community located in one of the highest barrier to entry market, Manhattan. Current in-place rent that are more than $500 below market, but in another way a loss to lease of $500 or over 15%. In the first 10 days since acquiring the asset, we have increased leased occupancy from 95.6% and 98.2% and raised rents 15% over the expiring lease rate. This is 5% ahead of our initial underwriting. While its only 18 leases, the results are very encouraging.", "Next, we plan to do a $40 million to $60 million redevelopment project, which will include a new rooftop fitness center and deck, as well as an updated lobby building entry way, anticipate additional $700 in the rent following the renovation. Clearly, we are excited for the continued opportunities we see in these assets, and we\u2019ll keep everyone updated on their future success.", "With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to, Tom.", "Tom Toomey \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "And thank you. Operator, now we are prepared for the Q&A portion of the call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Anthony Paolone \u2013 JPMorgan", "Thanks, good morning. Tom, with the MetLife JV on the land side, you guys were able to take down a piece of land and start construction there or at least do the pre-sale deals. I was wondering if you could tell us how that process went and the prospects for potentially more of those deals, and also the economics?", "Tom Toomey", "Well, certainly, I\u2019ll let Harry cover the economics. With respect to the process certainly, we\u2019re having a dialog with Met on a broad range of topics not just the operations of the properties and how they are doing very well, but also the land inventory and how it will ultimately be disposed or build upon. And we are working through the 11 sites and suspect that we\u2019ll find other opportunities in there that we can either work together or we\u2019ll buy the land and build it for our own account. So, I think there will be more activity over the next year on that front. The dialog relatively straightforward, we have recurring meetings with the lot of different Met from the local asset managers all the way to the top and how to manage this $2.5 billion portfolio to optimize this value and continue to reiterate our interest in owning more of it. We are working on the long range of topics there, but I would suspect that you will see us over time figure out how to accomplish what Met wants and what we want, which is to own a little bit more real estate with them, the deal itself and the economics.", "Harry Alcock", "Yeah, from a \u2013 just from yield standpoint on today\u2019s rents are un-trended rents, we expect to get close to 6.5% on that front.", "Anthony Paolone \u2013 JPMorgan", "Got it. And then just my follow-up here, now that you\u2019ve done these deals that now are about or you now have about 20% of the portfolio not in the same-store and the numbers out of New York seem really quite strong. So, I was just wondering how we should think about growth out of a non-same-store pool rate over the next, I don\u2019t know either few quarters or year, whatever you feel comfortable commenting on. It seems like it maybe different than the rest of the core?", "Jerry Davis", "Yes, I mean, this is Jerry. I think our non-same-stores will grow at a higher rate. When you look at the bulk of them, they are in New York, Boston, D.C., some in Northern California. I think you are going to see annualized growth rates that exceed what our core portfolio is, if I have to guess. And you are looking probably in the high single-digits in many of those markets, which is quite a bit higher than our same-store.", "Anthony Paolone \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Dave Bragg with Zelman and Associates.", "Dave Bragg \u2013 Zelman and Associates", "Thanks. Good morning. Tom, last quarter, you opened and closed the call with some interesting thoughts on homeownership you said that the new dynamics there may redefine how the multifamily business has been traditionally underwritten in models. Can you expand on this thought and offer any comments as to whether or not this has already been \u2013 you are seeing this contemplated by those in the acquisition market today?", "Tom Toomey", "Well, with respect to homeownership, I believe you will continue to see it fall for some time as inventory, foreclosed gets delivered at lower prices, appraised values pick those up, financing available for housing tightens. So, I think we are still have not felt the bottom of homeownership in America, and I think the dynamics in the future, people\u2019s willingness to gamble on housing is going to be less receptive. So, where that pendulum swings to the bottom David I am not certain, but as long as it\u2019s continuing to swing in our favor, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for our business.", "Dave Bragg \u2013 Zelman and Associates", "Okay. And sure, a follow-up to that is given your portfolio strategy of investing in higher barrier markets, can you talk about the long-term threat of homeownership versus supply and perhaps update us on the trajectory of multifamily supply here as we look into 2012 and beyond?", "Tom Toomey", "Well, certainly. And one of the keys of that strategy is to try to get to more of an urban and less home ownership friendly environment, if you will, and to get away from the suburban, primarily because I do worry not over the next couple of years about the supply equation, but certainly if you talk to lenders, you can see that they are lending more aggressively on multifamily, because of the NOI growth rates. Merchant builders will find a way to secure capital. And they are going to start building on the suburban locations, and you can already see that reflective in the start. So, why would I want to have a company exposed to that, I am trying to move us away from as much of that is possible. And I think you\u2019ll see us take advantage of that by selling a lot of our suburban real estate in the years ahead to shrink that exposure.", "Dave Bragg \u2013 Zelman and Associates", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And your next question is from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Eric Wolfe \u2013 Citigroup", "Tom just, just on your answer there can you just tell us for the $300 million of dispositions you are expecting this year what kind of valuations you are expecting and then also looking at a little bit longer term, how much capital recycling is going to play into your strategy versus just going out and issuing equity and issuing debt to grow and upgrade your portfolio?", "Tom Toomey", "Well, great. It\u2019s very good question Eric. I will start with the sell side, we are out in the market today exposing $600 million and we will wait and see how the pricing comes in on that. Our suspicions are with the five-year secured loans interest only at about 2.3% as of last week that will get good pricing. We are currently thinking that\u2019s going to be selling probably at about fixed cap.", "The market that we are exposing is Florida, portions in Southern California, suburban Texas and suburban D.C. and so we will see what the pricing is. But I think it\u2019s a great time to sell and I think being patient and waiting for NOI, trajectory to recover and with low interest rate environment I think we'll be able to thread a needle and get that out. ", "With respect to capital recycling in our plan towards the future, we are modeling and thinking here is that every year we will sell a portfolio that is equivalent to what our delivery for development will be. And we anticipate that probably be a $200 million to $300 million a year and then any high coupon debt and so that will minimize the dilution and fund our development pipeline and high coupon debt.", "I think that\u2019s the good prudent strategy over the next couple of years and we sized our development pipeline today if it stands at about $600 million, we will probably growth that closer to $1 billion over the next year. And as a result that we coupled with the maturing debt or high coupon debt in the next three years probably get though a portfolio that will sell in the $1 billion to $2 billion over the next three, four years. We don\u2019t see much dilution out of that activity.", "Eric Wolfe \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay. And all of that I have seen is the suburban non-core product that\u2019s you referred to or is there anything and that you consider core just not in the market that you really see yourself something in long-term?", "Tom Toomey", "I would see that is probably the suburban marketplace drive.", "Eric Wolfe \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay. And just one quick one on your markets Monterey saw some pretty strong sequential revenue growth over 7% and I was just curious also in San Diego you saw a negative sequential growth there. Just wondering if there is changed on the outlook there?", "Jerry Davis", "No. This is Jerry. In Monterey that is predominately in agricultural marketplace, so you typically we see more growth between 1Q and 2Q. You will make the most of your money in that Monterey portfolio really between February and December of every year, so that\u2019s a normal occurrence.", "In San Diego, we had some military movement did impact that area and we saw similar issues in both Jacksonville as well as Norfolk and in part of our Seattle portfolio that\u2019s relying on the military. There seem to be an increase in movement this quarter.", "Eric Wolfe \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And next question is from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Jeff Spector \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Tom, you discussed a couple of times now that you are not done yet with the portfolio transformation, can you provide I guess the ideal mix in percentage terms what market to market were at least ex-suburban?", "Tom Toomey", "Certainly, Jeff I would think of it this way that the market that we would label 10% to 15% exposure and all that carried chime on in these as well. Would probably the New York, Boston, SoCal and San Francisco, will probably be the 10% to 15% marketplace reducing. If you add that you probably going to end with some more between 60% to 65% of the company in those five market. We probably add a little over 50% today in that market mix. So there is a little bit more buying left to do primarily in New York and Boston and San Francisco with respect to how much is left to sell.", "I think we have said it on the previous answer to Eric, we will probably looking in about a $1 billion or %2 billion, but our intent is to really just use that money to fund our development. If look at our development pipeline is clearly concentrated in those markets so that I highlighted 10% to 15%. There will be a range of markets that will be somewhere between 5% and 10%, obviously that's probably Seattle, it\u2019s San Diego and Dallas, and that will make up to rest of the portfolio.", "Jeff Spector \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thank you. One follow-up on your comments about off-market transactions, I would have thought even a year and a half ago, it would be tough to do and you guys have done that. Do you anticipate that will continue? Is it getting tougher? It was David's comment on Rivergate about the dramatic improvement you've had there just in 10 days. It would seem is if people would market to sell their assets?", "Tom Toomey", "Harry, you want to color a bit?", "Harry Alcock", "Sure. We're out there actively looking for additional opportunities in New York City. As you know, it's hard to find these deals. They come along on an opportunistic basis and it candidly, it's helpful that we're active in the market, our names out there. So, we're finding additional families to talk to just given our recent track record in that market. We're optimistic that we will find other opportunities, when we certainly would like to.", "Tom Toomey", "This is Tom, I'd add additional color that, we've done three different family groups. You've had one take OP, the other two have looked at OP transactions, decided to take the cash and pay the taxes. Commonality between them was really the law firms, the tax advisors. So, now we\u2019ve got familiarity, as well as the framework and it's a lot easier for the professionals to go to their clients in their relationships and explain our structure, the way we close, the way we negotiate and I feel like we're going to have more success in that area, but it's patience, patience and patience that gets these deals.", "So, we're excited about trying to find more, but they are complicated. They take time. It's a great strategy in our view is to pursue that asset that's really an A quality location, but a B asset and bring not just the operating platform to bear, but also the potential for redevelopment. I can understand the owners and operators of these assets today. They've done a fabulous job of creating value for themselves for long periods of time. But every once in a while there's an opportunity and they want to get some liquidity and we'd like to help them in that. So, I think we'll find more.", "Jeff Spector \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Jay Habermann with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Jay Habermann \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Good morning. Tom, as you talked about Rivergate and some of the other acquisitions you've made so far this year clearly pushing rents 15% right off the bat is a very good start. Can you give us some sense of what you're assuming perhaps in years two and three, especially for markets like New York?", "Tom Toomey", "We've got a couple things going on. We generally expect over the next couple years to be able to achieve market rent increases of 10% to 12% in aggregate. But in addition to that the Rivergate property and 21 Chelsea property we also have redevelopment component and expect to be able to capitalize on that investment as well.", "Jay Habermann \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And what are you assuming for the returns on redevelopment?", "Tom Toomey", "It's an all in return on the assets. So, it's a purchase price, plus there is the money spent and you look at your total return. So, the redevelopment we're not looking at necessarily as an individual investment decision, but rather that's part of our game plan going in.", "Jay Habermann \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Maybe Tom just thinking big picture, is it too early to think about job growth for next year. What are your assumptions that you're baking in for 2012 at this point for job growth?", "Tom Toomey", "Boy it is a little early for that Jay. What I\u2019d tell you is a lot is to watch what\u2019s going to happen in D.C. and what\u2019s going to get act and where. I didn\u2019t think defense would be on the agenda, but clearly its front and center now. So, that\u2019s changing the dynamics that I didn\u2019t think was on the table. I think we have to wait and see, both the interest rate environment and a little bit about where these cuts and programs are going to occur as well as if there are some give and take on the tax issue. So, it\u2019s just pre-mature. There is a lot coming out of D.C. that I think we all ought to be sensitive to and watch very closely, but I am still hopeful that small businesses take up the slack and then we get back to 2 million jobs a year, but more importantly to me is our local dynamics of our supply demand and how that plays out and not the aggregate of the U.S.", "Jay Habermann \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie. Please go ahead.", "Rob Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie", "Hi, good morning guys. Tom, you\u2019ve talked in the past about your New York City strategy being mostly Manhattan\u2019s only strategy for the time being. When you think about Boston, how far out into the burbs, are you willing to go there? I mean, it seems like that that market especially the sort of downtown Boston and such is a less deep market right now at least right now for acquisitions. Are you comfortable going stretching further into the burbs there?", "Harry Alcock", "Well, this is Harry. A lot of our portfolio is in the suburbs in Boston. In terms of our investment strategy going forward, our goal is to acquire for our new acquisitions to be closer into the downtown area. And you are right it is not as deeper market as some of these other downtown areas that that\u2019s where we intend to focus the majority of our efforts going forward in Boston.", "Tom Toomey", "This is Tom, and I would add Rob that you probably be sign up a couple of development activities in Boston. And it\u2019s still a great city. Long-term, it weathered the downturn enormously surprisingly very well. And so I think we\u2019ll find a couple of development sites downside, down in the business district, if you will. We\u2019ll see how those pan out, but we\u2019ll get our exposure there, we\u2019ll just be patient about how we get it.", "Rob Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie", "Okay. What about developing New York City? I mean, you basically bought in Southern Cal, San Francisco, D.C., and then started developing there. It sounds like buying in Boston now and thinking about developing there. At what point does this development in New York City makes sense for you guys or doesn\u2019t?", "Tom Toomey", "Well, Rob, I don\u2019t want to say, I was never, certainly at some point the lifecycle of the company and its talent face it may. Today, we are just very, very comfortable that there is a very deep pipeline of this product similar to what we have got in Rivergate, 10 Hanover, and Chelsea, where there are great properties, good locations, there is upside in what we can do tomorrow. And I think we\u2019ll stay at that bandwidth for a while. That doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t see a lot of development opportunities, we\u2019re just not comfortable with that risk reward at this point and feel like there is enough opportunity in the bandwidth that\u2019s in our strike zone to find those. And I do like the opportunity just trading with these families. They are very sophisticated, they are very capable, and there is a lot of assets that they hold and we see it as a pretty good pipeline, if you will, that not many other people are pursuing with the same intensity that we are.", "Rob Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie", "Okay, good. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.", "Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O'Neill", "Good morning. Just sort of curious as you guys underwrite the New York deals, what you are expecting for turnover as you guys are new institutional owner versus these who are privately run from the family perspective? And sort of, how that turnover \u2013 your turnover assumptions there if they differ materially from what you typically underwrite for other acquisitions?", "Jerry Davis", "Alex, it\u2019s a very good question. Generally, what we find is, is when we do a light rehab is that the residents can take the absorption and they don\u2019t frankly move. When we do a more higher intense re-grade, we expect almost to turn 100% of the residency over. And so I think the people at Rivergate are probably over the next three years going to get enough rent increases that it will push a substantial number of amount. I think in the case of the Chelsea that they\u2019ll probably generally stay and in 10 Hanover, we\u2019re finding that they are taking the rent increases and not really moving. So, we weigh it as part of our overall strategy of each acquisition, each opportunity, but the higher end, the more intense work. We have generally we do try to target turning over the entire resident base. Then it\u2019s a question of how deep the market's going to be at 4,500 to 5,000 a month, basically for 1,000 feet. We think its $50 a foot, $52 a foot in that particular location of Rivergate, but the market\u2019s pretty deep in that price point.", "Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O'Neill", "So sounds like the image for Chelsea and Hanover stay the same, but I guess resident perception of Rivergate is being the more affordable that will change as you guys upgrade it and run into more institutionally, it sounds like?", "Jerry Davis", "Absolutely.", "Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O'Neill", "The second question for David, just want to make sure I got everything. The $1.25 to $1.30 guidance, one just wanted to know what the transaction expense in the third quarter and for the second half of the year we should model in? Then are there any other onetime items like any other gains or anything like that in there?", "David Messenger", "The $1.25 to $1.30, you take the acquisitions that we\u2019re going to close on here in the third quarter. Rivergate, 21 Chelsea and then you've got another call it roughly $300 million that we have in guidance and assume between 50 basis points to 1%. At the beginning of the year, we came out with 1% of the guidance, but we've seem to trend down from that a little bit. So you can probably back off that a little bit probably $0.02 in there in terms of acquisition cost, and then the rest of the earnings is a pretty sterile I believe.", "Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O'Neill", "So, no gains or anything like that?", "David Messenger", "No.", "Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O'Neill", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And your next question is from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Hey good morning everyone. Jerry mentioned the expected job growth in 2012 and Tom you mentioned you expect the housing market to remain weak for the time being and those kinds of two comments and could be argued that they are in contrasts with one another. That is revitalize housing market is going to be a part of recovery in the jobs markets. So, I'm curious as to why you think jobs will return in 2012, if you think the housing markets going to stay weak?", "Tom Toomey", "Well, I'll take my shot at what I think jobs. First, I would put up the dollar is going to get weaker. I think the export that easily we'll do well in that. I think technology will continue to strengthen. Healthcare up in the air, but it's clear to me that there is just a workforce shortage in that industry.", "So, I think those are going to be three that will probably grow in terms of jobs. Construction, which is always been kind of the industry that led us out of recessions in the past. I think is going to be muted. That I just don't see any need for construction. So, therefore is one down. The other down is probably going to continue to be government and now it might be defense.", "So, that being said, it's going to be a lot about what markets you're exposed to and, where that jobs are going to take place and probably would add oil and gas to the positive side as well. Homeownership, homeownership is really, can you give me any reason yourself that you see it swinging back around.", "You got to stay about for a down payment. You're probably going to be face with higher interest rate, going to squeeze your mortgage payment. I just don't see people wanting to venture back into that while the economy is still maybe in a double dip, maybe trying to find its way out of this recession. So, that's how I reconcile the two, Rich.", "Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. And then second question is you guys obviously pretty aggressive buyers of real estate key market, have been made for an interesting story to cover obviously, but you can't know for certainly that it's going to be the right call. Right I mean something could turn against you and the prospects for multifamily could this time next year maybe not as good as what we're feeling today. It could happen to say that, right. So, what are your trigger points as you're going through this aggressive or active acquisition effort that might make you say, wait, hold on, let's slow this down a little? What are some of the things you're looking for that might give you pause?", "Tom Toomey", "Well, Rich, I'm not trying to time out of market. What I'm looking at is the long-term aspect of staying to be out of blank sheet of paper, where do you think the best prospects are for the long-term and they are in multifamily. They are in urban settings with what I would call amenity-driven space around them being transportation parts, job centers.", "So, I just look at the long-term and say, that's probably the areas that are going have the most enduring quality cash flow growth prospects as well as value appreciation in our assets. My experience and history proves it's probably right, this industry generally gets in trouble mostly, when we overbuild or the housing market becomes an artificial bubble enabled by the government.", "So, if you take away the government enabling the housing bubble, which I can't control, then it's the function of supply. Where does supply occur? It occurs in all our markets at different times and different paces and so our theory is that, it's going to start in suburbs where land is relatively available cheap and people will build out there to kind of meet a growing demand of the long-term demand if you will.", "So, that's why you will see the push for us more on in urban, more affordability, and the lastly is the equation of margin. In our suburban portfolio margins are probably in the low 60s and our urban portfolio margins were probably in the high 60s, a 10% margin differential combined with a better growth rate tells me, you're going to get lot better return over long-term.", "In the short run, there is a lot of things that can go wrong and the old saying, when Washington's in session, nobody\u2019s safe, is true. And I don't know what's going to come up that. It's our biggest threat to our industry over the short-term, but that being said, it seems to me that I\u2019d rather buy today than I\u2019d build because of that uncertainty over that time horizon.", "That being said, we're going to find those unique sites that are worth building on and we\u2019ll continue to pursue that and we\u2019ll find them with our sales. So, I tried to lay both the capital risk by seeing I will sell assets to fund my development and my high coupon debt and that I will continue to buy as long as I have a very accretive possibility with my share price and the acquisition and the growth prospects. So, that\u2019s how we thing about capital allocation over both the short-term and long-term.", "Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, great color. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Hi good morning. Just another question on the non-same store pool, I appreciate the color that you\u2019re expecting high single digits growth there. Did you own enough assets long enough, or do you have enough data that you could talk about, maybe what the sequential growth was in revenue and the non-same store pool compared to the 1.6% you posted in the same store pool?", "Jerry Davis", "Karin, this is Jerry. We really don\u2019t have that information. Now most of the properties in that non-same store pool purchased at the latest in the fourth quarter of last year or late third quarter, you\u2019re still working through some things like concession burn off. We don\u2019t really have true growth rates to really give meaningful data on.", "Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay. Second question just relates to acquisition, I know you've funded 75% worth equity from here, drove down to at the EBITDA down to 8.5%. What percentage of acquisitions from here do you think will be funded with equity and where ultimately do you think debt to EBITDA will wind up by the end of the year?", "Tom Toomey", "Karin this is Tom. Funding source in the future, I still think we probably need to be doing 60% or greater in equity. I think it\u2019s a good balance for us and a good strategy for us to lock-up acquisitions to come back to the street and say, here is what we have locked up. Here is our strategy, here is how we think we're going to manage this asset and increase its value and let the street actually see what they're investing in. So, that probably be better than 60% for time being and we will see how that goes as well as we will watch the stock price and how it respond.", "David Messenger", "Hey Karin, this is Dave. Regarding debt to EBITDA, assuming everything works out with respect to in the second half of the year, I would say our debt to EBITDA ends up somewhere between an 8 and 8.5.", "Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Paula Poskon with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.", "Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Thanks. Good morning. To follow-up on that home ownership penetration rate discussion, one of your peers last week compared their average home ownership penetration rate in their markets to the national average. How would you do the same?", "Jerry Davis", "This is Jerry. I haven\u2019t pulled that data. I would tend to say it\u2019s probably fairly close to the national average. When you look at markets like San Francisco, New York, Boston I\u2019d say it's below the national average and then when you get into markets such Nashville, Florida. Texas, Phoenix, it would tend to be a little bit above, so my guess and this is just a guess is it\u2019s probably close to the national average.", "Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Thanks Jerry. And also to talk about turnover, what percentage of move-outs this quarter were due to home purchase and also to high rent and how did that trend compare year-over-year and sequentially?", "Jerry Davis", "Sure. Move-outs to home purchase were just under 12%. That compares to 14% last year in the second quarter and it\u2019s up slightly from about 11% in the first quarter and I would tell you that\u2019s just seasonal home buying more than a trend. Move-outs to rent increase were about little over 6%, that compares to about 2% last year, so it is up quite a bit, but still not a meaningful number and then first quarter was up 5%. So, it\u2019s inched up a little. What\u2019s interesting is when you do look at move-outs to home purchase, there is two different scenarios, one is place like San Francisco, where we have pushed move-outs to rent increase above 10% there. So, it\u2019s above our average, but what\u2019s great is we are able to reload quickly with people willing to pay upwards of $300 million more than what the departing resident was paying and we are able to maintain occupancy levels in that San Francisco market of above 96.5%.", "So, in some markets you can push. You don\u2019t really care if they move out, because you\u2019re going to reload high rate. Conversely, when you go to markets like Florida, you\u2019ll push and at times we\u2019ll see occupancy get high and will get aggressive on renewal increases and there you will find people will move out and it\u2019s more difficult to reload quickly. And therefore as you struggle to get your occupancy back up to over 95%, you may have to reduce your rent.", "So, when I look at my rates on new leases in a place like San Francisco in the month of July, we were getting over 16% increases on new leases in San Francisco, which was the best in our portfolio. In Florida, that percentage was more in the 2% to 4% range. So, sometimes you don\u2019t mind when you push people out of those high increases and sometimes it gets painful when you have to re-look through strategy of how hard you push on renewals.", "Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "That\u2019s very helpful, Jerry. Thank you for that. And then just a housekeeping, yeah\u2026", "Tom Toomey", "Just to add to that, because I think we\u2019ve read through the dialog on a lot of these conference calls about people trying to look at percentage of income. I\u2019m not so certain that metric has the same relevance and power that it did in the past. Why, because I don\u2019t think homeownership as is appealing as it was during when lot of people were measuring that and trying to correlate this next where rents going to go to or when they\u2019re going to top out to. I think, what Jerry pointed to is very critical, which is how much do you grow rent, how long does it take you to reload the property after pushing that rent. And that\u2019s probably a metric that I think maybe the sell side, buy side should focus a little bit more on, because that\u2019s the one we are very much focused on is push the rent, when we see people move out, we say, well, wait a minute, that\u2019s okay, if we can reload in 15 days. If it takes us a month to reload, then we push too far. So, it\u2019s a lot about where is the top in the rents. It\u2019s the questions more of how many people does it take to resell the property and how quickly do you identify them? So, I think that plays well into both our electronic platform, which has really given us daily information on that reload in that traffic to determine if we\u2019re getting there on the pricing point.", "Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Tom, I certainly agree with you on the all of the reasons why we don\u2019t \u2013 shouldn\u2019t be excited about the return of homeownership. I happen to subscribe to the theory that there is a secular trend underway among the psychological approach of the next generation coming out. Do you subscribe to that theory as well or do you take issue \u2013 or do you think that once the economy straightens out and there is wage growth that homeownership will return to norm?", "Tom Toomey", "No, I believe that there will be. The pendulum is swinging in our favor. At some point, absent government intervention, it will slowdown and start to swing back the other way in individual market by market. What\u2019s the right number? I think ours with the interest deductibility on the payable potentially that the true dynamic of where it settles out won\u2019t be settled for the next couple of years. I like the fact that it\u2019s swinging in our favor during that period of time.", "So, secular change depends on how your time horizon. Having two kids that are post-college graduate out there in the workplace, I listen to them, listen to their friends and they say listen homeownership ties me down, I know I\u2019m going to have to move around to get jobs, I don\u2019t want to be tied to a home. Plus I can\u2019t save up the damn money, I can got to mom and dad and get it. But the truth is I\u2019d rather have my lifestyle, the flexibility, and all the amenities that renting affords me today and they are not really inclined to see homeownership as what we saw at my generation. And Paula, you are much younger than I so, you can fill in the gap.", "Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "I wouldn\u2019t bet on that, but thank you for the color. I appreciate it. And then just two housekeeping questions for Dave, what did the severance charge relate to and what is that savings that you mentioned going forward? And secondly, what were the insurance related expenses?", "David Messenger", "On your second question, insurance-related expenses, we had a significant fire at one of our communities in Northern Virginia, that related to the series of units that were down, because of that there was the deductible related to that fire and the severance charges, about $750,000 were related to individuals throughout our enterprise that are no longer with us and the savings will be not dollar for dollar, but will be somewhere less than that on a go-forward basis.", "Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Quick question, guys. You talked a little bit about near-term targets what are the long-term targets from a leverage standpoint? And in addition to that how much of the $75 million to $300 million of acquisitions you have in the guidance for the second quarter half of the year here is identified at this point?", "Tom Toomey", "Michael, with respect to identified targets, I can say that we probably put in $300 million in the guidance. We are probably looking at assets that are double that likelihood of closing, unclear to us. We are trading a lot of terms if you will, so many time, you are trading a lot of terms on a deal, lower probabilities securing it. Long-term capital and leverage level, I\u2019m a big fixed guy. I really think that\u2019s the key metric. We\u2019re at 24 today. I\u2019ve always been very comfortable at the 22 to 25 range. So, I am getting very comfortable where our leverage is. I know there is a debt to EBITDA orientation. We are looking at \u2013 we\u2019re going to be in a low eight range. I look at the shape in the form of debt over that and that I've got $3.5 billion of debt at a 4.4 with a weighted average maturity of six years. So, I think we\u2019ve got a good balance sheet, we\u2019ve got a good shape to our debt structure, and really don\u2019t have a desire to see it down into the sixes, if you will.", "Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Then switching over to operations here for the second question, can you give an update on in terms of June and July trends in Orange County, I know Irvine Company changed the caps, they had on place there. Also curious as to the performance of Boston, you gave a great deal about New York, but I didn\u2019t hear anything on Boston there during the second quarter in terms of your portfolio? And then Jerry if you could break out loss to lease maybe by region or a couple of your largest markets that\u2019d be helpful as well?", "Jerry Davis", "Sure. I\u2019ll start with the Orange County. Orange County did have a good second half of the second quarter and it has continued Orange County. We\u2019ve been able to maintain our occupancy levels up north of 95%. We're setting out a renewal increases that we're setting out for August and September in Orange County are some of the highest in our company. Our average increase by the way that was setting out for the next couple months or up in the mid sixes. Orange County is in August and September, call a blended 7.5%. It's not as good as San Francisco, but it's probably up in the same ballpark with the Seattle.", "So, we feel pretty good about Orange County right now. Some submarkets within Orange County are strengthening more quickly and Platinum Triangle, while it's getting better still is in at the strength of the Coastal Properties. Boston, we've continued to see good results in Boston. We're sending out rent increases there north of 6%.", "We've maintained occupancy levels in that Boston portfolio that we have both the MetLife venture as well as the wholly-owned averages probably in the 96% to 98% range, but it's a very strong market. We don't see a whole lot of new supply that's been affecting us up in Boston.", "Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "And then finally just in terms of loss lease, could you maybe break it out by few of your larger markets, just to kind of sense of where how it's trending, just specifically, do you see maybe versus the West Coast?", "David Messenger", "Sure. In June, the total loss lease was a little over 6%. San Francisco was pushing 12%. Austin was at about 12%. LA, Orange County were both in 7% to 8%. If you get back to D.C., D.C. is actually about 4.5%. Everything else, I would tell you is roughly it's bundled up close to the 4% to 5%. It's probably the Florida stuff is a little at the low end down in the threes also.", "Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.", "David Messenger", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. And your next question is from the line of Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Jeff Donnelly \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Hey guys, just a question or two. Tom, the GSEs had floated the idea of renting single-family homes that\u2019s really pressure on housing markets and we can debate whether we actually saw anything or not. I'm just curious, do you think that's possible for a private enterprise not necessarily UDR to profitably manage single family home rental business in the scale or even for the government do to without losing money?", "Tom Toomey", "Yes, it\u2019s interesting, because I had three people in my office for the last two weeks, they were asking about what systems they thought would be needed to be able to secure that and that they were actually putting together companies to make debts on that effort, if it were to come to fruition. And listening to the dynamics of it, they were going to tap realtors as kind of their leasing agents and pay them a commission. So, it seemed to me that an efficient structure could be put in place to manage that I didn't think it was high return business, it looked to me like their margins were somewhere between 15% and 20%. So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a great use of capital manpower.", "But it seems to me that there could be a market that would be efficient and effective in that and an opportunity for some entrepreneurs to jump in it. Though can it happen? Certainly, if the government puts its will and heart behind it, how much business you want to do with the government it always is cautious statement in my mind. Is it a much of a threat to us? Looking over kind of what their business plans were and the identified product, I didn\u2019t see it as any much of a threat to us in terms of our portfolio or our business model. So, if it helps the housing market strengthen, helps the overall account, the economy, I probable before it, if all things would be an equal.", "Jeff Donnelly \u2013 Wells Fargo", "And just a follow-up maybe from earlier questions, so what do you think about your purchases in New York as well as the assets involved and the exchange with Avalon, where your initial cap rate was when you bought them and maybe where you think that can go?", "Now that you\u2019ve had more time with these assets, are you able to maybe put a finer point on as to say, for example you see 100 basis points of upside in your yield and that split, what between I\u2019ll call it better revenue management versus better expense controls, really that latter piece I'm more interested in where you kind of see the source of your upside?", "Tom Toomey", "I think in New York, the vast majority of the improvements on the revenue management side of the equation. That the cost structures that we would say probably get eaten up by the higher tax equation, but it\u2019s probably leaning 80% towards the revenue side of the equation in the Manhattan stuff. The other stuff we bought in D.C. I would think it\u2019s a combination, Boston, probably more 50/50 revenue and expenses. They are not poorly run real estate. It's probably just not optimized and not responsive to the resident.", "Jeff Donnelly \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And your next question is from the line of Seth Laughlin with ISI Group.", "Seth Laughlin \u2013 ISI Group", "Thanks. Just given that your exposing assets in the more suburban markets and obviously looking in the higher barrier markets to acquire. I'm wondering if you just comment on the cap rate spread, how that spread has changed over the last 12 months and maybe where you see that spread going forward over the next year going?", "Tom Toomey", "This is Toomey, I'll ask Harry to comment further. My view of cap rates on the B product suburban is always a function of the debt and so, with debt being if nothing else coming down, I would literally drop my jaw to see a five-year piece of paper at 3.5 isle only and to look at that paper and say guys suburban, you should be talking about five caps. They are saying think six. We'll see what we can do and maybe we'll get better. So, I contrast that where I look at the urban portfolios, where it's a lot more competitive and we're seeing, basically its turn to four cap markets.", "Does it have much room to fall from there? I don't have any idea about, where cap rates are headed, but I know the urban is not as right sensitive as in the past. So, that's kind of some color. If I think about interest rates in the future, maybe the base rate phased down low like it is, but my sense is given what's going on in Washington, spreads are going to have to widen and I think that's going to have a more direct impact on the pricing of the B and suburban portfolios than it is the urban orientation, which have more institutional less levered players trying to pursue it. That's been my experience and I would probably think it's going to continue to repeat itself in this part of cycle. Any other comments on cap rates?", "Harry Alcock", "I don't think. So, they'll clearly come down in all product types, the A stuff, as well as the B product that we're going to be selling. Remember a lot of what we're buying and have been buying particularly in New York City, is that a rehab component. So, in addition to getting some market growth we're going to get a return on our invested dollars as well.", "Seth Laughlin \u2013 ISI Group", "Understood. Then maybe just a quick follow-up for Jerry, it looks like from your comments Orange County, it's firming up. Is it your expectation that we could see revenue growth above the portfolio average sometime this year or do you think we have to wait till 2012 for that?", "Jerry Davis", "I think you\u2019re probably looking at 2012.", "Seth Laughlin \u2013 ISI Group", "Understood, thanks for the comment.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Derek Bower with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Derek Bower \u2013 UBS", "Thanks. Most of my questions already been answered, but two quick ones hopefully. On the future Manhattan deals, are you only looking at off marketed deals, where there may be some operating inefficiencies that you can exploit to help reduce your returns, or are you also looking at assets, which are more well leased with rents in line with the market average?", "Tom Toomey", "Well, we're looking at the deals that are in the market as well as the off-market transactions. The properties that we've acquired, the three properties happened to be from three families and we believe, we've realized the capitalized and the operational inefficiencies in those properties.", "So, at the end of the day perhaps those are the deals that are just easiest for us to get done, to get across the finish line rather than competing with everyone on the market that deals. But we're looking in all of them.", "Derek Bower \u2013 UBS", "Okay, got it. And then quickly just back to D.C, can you discuss your overall acquisition strategy there going forward and maybe touch upon the View 14 acquisition you had there and given your commentary of expecting D.C. to no longer being a top market for your portfolio starting in 2012?", "Tom Toomey", "This is Toomey. With respect D.C. in 14 View, the benefit out of 14 View is that we're developing a community right across the street from it. So, truly it was an auction. We have been quoting the seller for a better part of three years, knowing that we were under development and thought that it would make a great complement. It\u2019s in the union area, which is very trendy and upbeat. So, that was an auction that frankly we thought was worth stepping to the top of the list and winning, because of the synergies that we could run the two of them together and achieve some better returns out of that.", "On a go-forward basis, I always like the strategy of \u2013 in D.C. of buying what I call the old towers of buildings that are 8 to 15 and rehabbing them. We think that the rehabs give us a chance to create value and that the suburban portfolio in D.C. is just trade in capital over time and we will trade out of that, but no particular hurry, we like the exposure, but that would be how we probably shape D.C. in the future.", "Derek Bower \u2013 UBS", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Swaroop Yalla with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Swaroop Yalla \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Yes, hi. Actually, just to touch upon expenses, some of your peers have reported strong expense controls and so have you this quarter. Just wondering if you see any opportunities to control expenses maybe other tax deals later this year?", "Tom Toomey", "We definitely are hopeful that we\u2019ll win some tax for later this year. We are comparing against favorable taxes last year and the second half of the year, so it\u2019s hard to determine if that\u2019s going to come. On other expense control items, I would tell you when you look back over the last three to five years, we\u2019ve been really pushing electronic initiatives to make our advertising more efficient and less expensive as well as the workforce in our site offices. So, we\u2019ve reaped a lot of that benefits historically and we continue to lead the way and look for additional ways to really drive down expenses going forward. We are cognizant though that you need to continue to maintain your assets at a high level if you want to command premium rates and occupancy. So, we are not going to make a short-term decision just to drive expenses down this year.", "Swaroop Yalla \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Got it. And Tom, I hear your comments on rental income as metric, which is changing as the rental psychology is changing as well, but just curious as you have repositioned your portfolio, how has the rent to household income changed as you have moved between your markets?", "Jerry Davis", "This is actually Jerry. It\u2019s really stayed the same for the last two to three years. It\u2019s about 17%. And it will be a little higher in some markets, a little lower in others, but it\u2019s been fairly consistent the last couple of years.", "Swaroop Yalla \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Great. And is the long run average around the same as well or?", "Jerry Davis", "I think, longer term when you go back a few more years it was probably in the low 20s and now it\u2019s in that, again, the 17% to 18% range. What we have seen as our average renters\u2019 income has gone up about 4% in the last year and sometimes that\u2019s the guy that was living there last year got a 4% raise, but more often I think we are trading now departing residents with higher income, higher grade residents.", "Swaroop Yalla \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.", "Tom Toomey \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, thank you all of you for the time today and we look forward to another second half of the year, hopefully, as busy as the first half, but we do like our business. We like its long-term prospects and continue to believe it's a great time to grow our enterprise and all the momentum in the industry seems to be very positive, so look forward to talking to you more in the future. Take care.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the UDR 2011 second quarter earnings conference call.

Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered on the call.  I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.  ", "Thomas W. Toomey ", "Welcome to UDR\u2019s third quarter conference call.  On the call with me today are David Messenger, Chief Financial Officer and Jerry Davis, Senior Vice President of Operations who will discuss our results as well as senior officers Warren Troupe, Harry Alcock, and Matt Akin who will be available to answer questions during the Q&A portion of the call.", "My comments will primarily focus on two topics: first, quarterly results and the overall state of UDR\u2019s business now and moving into next year; and second, our expansion efforts over the past year, how our investments have performed, and what is in store moving forward.  Following my comments David will discuss our financial results and Jerry will provide commentary on operations.  ", "First, UDR\u2019s business remains strong.  The company generated robust same store revenue and net operating income growth of 5% and 7% respectively in the third quarter translating into 14% year-over-year increase in core FFO per share.  While we are in a challenging and volatile macro environment, the effects on our business have been mitigated by the combination of declining home ownership rates, a multigenerational low in new supply, low turnover, and solid job growth amongst younger aged cohorts.  ", "Late in the third quarter we saw a typical seasonal slowing in rental rate growth but as of yet have little evidence that this is anything but industry wide seasonality consistent with my many years in the business. We continue to push new leases and renewal rates with little effect on occupancy.  The year-to-date rent growth we have realized in 2011 has provided us with initial visibility into revenue growth into early portions of 2012.  Jerry will provide an overview of how our core markets are performing in his prepared remarks.", "Second, we have grown and improved our overall portfolio within the last 12 months through a combination of acquisitions, developments, redevelopment and dispositions totaling a net investment of $2.7 billion.  These strategic actions have resulted in our average portfolio rent for our wholly owned community increasing to $1,320 per home at the end of the third quarter.  This is up from $1,150 per home in the second quarter 2010, or a 15% growth.  And, the corridor between Boston and Washington DC, now comprises 36% of our net operating income while the west coast comprises 38% of our NOI.", "First let\u2019s discuss and focus and focus on the acquisitions.  Our 2010 and 2011 acquisitions have targeted urban markets with favorable job formation in the renter cohort, low single home affordability and advantage multifamily supply and demand dynamics such as Manhattan, Boston, Washington DC, San Francisco, and southern California.  Integrating these high quality assets into our portfolio has been a top priority.  I am pleased to report that Jerry and his team have made great progress driving operating efficiencies at these assets and thereby creating significant value.", "Before moving on to development and redevelopment, I\u2019d like to say a couple of words on $1.2 billion of acquisitions we\u2019ve completed in Manhattan during 2011.  We are very encouraged by the improvement in operations and the rent increases we have achieved thus far in Manhattan.  While we are just beginning our redevelopment efforts, I\u2019m excited about the initial outperformance versus our pro forma expectations for the project and our entire portfolio there.  Jerry will speak in more detail on the success we are achieving during his prepared remarks.", "Next, our development and redevelopment pipeline continue to grow totaling nearly $1.1 billion or 12% of the enterprise value at the end of the third quarter.  This is consistent with our coverage level of 10% to 15% of enterprise value.  Important, many of our projects are in unique [gym] locations in high barrier entry markets where we are better insulated from future upticks in new multifamily supply.  Our redevelopment pipeline continues to provide opportunity to improve the portfolio at a good risk adjusted return and can be right sized quickly to changing market dynamics.", "Non-core asset disposition will be our preferred tool for funding our development and redevelopment activity.  To date we have sold $440 million of property in such markets as Dallas, San Francisco East Bay, as well as non-core communities in Southern California and Raleigh.  Currently we have approximately $50 million of assets under contract and are marketing over $200 million more.  We believe that there\u2019s a strong market for asset sales are potential buyers are hungry for yield right now.  NOIs are benefitting from solid fundamentals and the lending environment for multifamily remains very supporting and accommodating.  David will provide more information in his prepared remarks on our dispositions.", "In conclusion, market fundamentals remain strong.  Our asset integration efforts are beginning to yield results at our acquired properties and our operating platform is running on all cylinders.  We look forward to our continued success.  With that, I\u2019ll pass the call over to David.", "DD", "Earlier this morning, we reported a year-over-year 14% increase in our core FFO to $0.32.  Our results are consistent with our guidance announced in July.  Further details are included in our press release and supplements.  During the quarter we had two primary non-recurring transactions.  First, we recorded $2 million in costs in connection with our acquisitions and second, we completed the sale of a technology investment realizing a gain of $2.6 million.", "Turning to our balance sheet, during the quarter we raised $584 million through a combination of our ATM program, secondary offering and operating partnership units.  This equates to 24.2 million shares in operating partnership units at a weighted average price of $24.12.  For the year, we have raised $974 million of equity at a weighted average price of $24.19.  This is consistent with the amounts disclosed during our second quarter call and no additional shares have been sold under the ATM since.  ", "In September we acquired 95 Wall and issued $1.8 million operating partnership units for $45.1 million at a price of $25 per unit.  At September 30 there were 232.2 million common share equivalent outstanding and for your models, if you assume no further equity issuances for the remainder of the year, the fourth quarter weighted average share count would be 232.2 million and the year-to-date average would be 214 million.", "As of September 30th we had $506 million of cash and credit capacity.  Last Tuesday we announced the closing of our new $900 million revolving line of credit which has an interest rate of LIBOR plus 122.5 basis points, a facility fee of 22.5 basis points, matures in four years with a one year extension option and included an accordion up to $1.35 billion.  At the same time we announced a repricing of our $250 million unsecured term loan due in January 2016.  The pricing was improved to LIBOR plus 142.5 bips from LIBOR plus 200.  The balance of the year has no debt maturing that does not have an extension option.  ", "During the quarter we repaid $97 million of our 3 5/8th percent convertible notes and two secured mortgages for $15 million.  Combined, the debt had a weighted average interest rate of 3.9% and a GAAP accounting rate of 5.6%.  The retirement of these [bonds] eliminates the convertible debt amortization of $359,000 per quarter.  In the fourth quarter we had the opportunity to prepay at PAR $100 million of a secured credit facility that carries a 6.78% interest rate.  We are currently planning to repay this facility with sales proceeds.", "To recap our balance sheet metric, since 2009 we have discussed how we would delever through acquisitions and how it would be funded with a larger percentage of equities and debt.  Accordingly, our debt to EBITDA has moved from greater than 10 times to an annualized 8.5 times today.  Our debt plus preferred stock to gross assets value ratio has decreased by more than 500 basis points to approximately 48%.  Our secured debt to asset ratio improved 900 basis points to 23%.  Our fixed charge ratio has improved to 2.5 times and our unencumbered asset pool has grown by more than 25% to more than $5 billion on a historical cost basis.  We anticipated these metrics will continue to improve as we execute our strategy.", "During our second quarter call we provided asset disposition guidance of $500 to $600 million.  To date we have closed on asset swaps for $237 million and sold three types of assets for $81.5 million.  Subsequent to September 30 we closed on the sale of The Tribute in Raleigh North Carolina for $56 million and two communities in non-core markets in California for $69 million.  We have two additional units in non-core markets under contract for $53 million expected to close in the fourth quarter which will bring the year-to-date total to $496 million.  In addition to these transactions, we have several other non-core communities listed for sale.  The proceeds from these sales will be used to fund debt repayment and our redevelopment pipeline. ", "Turning to guidance for the balance of 2011.  Our year-to-date and third quarter results are in line with our expectations for the full year.  Accordingly, we will maintain our practice to update guidance through the year or when a material event has occurred.  Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jerry.", "Jerry A. Davis ", "We\u2019re happy to report same store NOI was up 7% which results in revenue growth of 5%, expense growth of 1.1%.  Total same store income for occupied homes increased 4.9% to $1201 and occupancy increased 10 basis points to 95.6%.  Our loss to lease at the end of September, 2011 was 5% or $58 per home and market rents that increased 6.6% since last September.  On a sequential basis revenue increased 2%, [inaudible] were up 2.5% and NOI increased 1.8%.  ", "In our same store portfolio effective rental rates on new leases entered into during the quarter were on average 4.7% higher than what the prior resident was paying.  Renewing residents on average paid 6.4% higher on an effective basis.  Tom mentioned the seasonality of our business and I\u2019d like to expand on his comments. We manage our lease expirations to have more leases ending during the second and third quarter when traffic is heavier.  Accordingly, during the fourth quarter when we have a natural deceleration of traffic we have fewer leases expiring.  Our pricing engines are more aggressive when demand is high in the second and third quarter.  ", "In addition, since we have fewer leases turning over in this fourth quarter time period, we have fewer opportunities to increase rent.  What we are seeing this year is no different than what we\u2019ve seen historically.  Going back to 2005, our sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter averaged flat to nearly flat.  We would expect fourth quarter of this year to be consistent with the past.  What is more important than looking at the next three months is looking out beyond that.  In that same time frame since 2005, our first quarter sequential growth has averaged .7% and in each year was higher than the preceding fourth quarter\u2019s sequential revenue growth.", "I would remind you that our loss to lease at the end of September was 5%.  Assuming market rents don\u2019t fall over the next year, we should capture most of this in the rent growth.  As we entered the fourth quarter we began to experience the typical seasonal slowing as just discussed that has resulted in slightly lower increases on both new leases and renewal leases.  That said, we saw our same store new lease rate increased 3.2% in October led by San Francisco with average increases of more than 12% and Austin and Dallas with over 7%.  ", "Renewals in October remained strong up 6% led by San Francisco at 9% and Phoenix and Seattle over 7%.  Renewal increases sent out for the remainder of the fourth quarter averaged 6%.  We\u2019ve also noticed that we have better pricing power at our A communities than our B communities within a given market.  Over the past three months new lease rates in our A communities were up 5.5% versus 3.8% for the B communities.  We believe this is the result of higher rent residents being more concerned with location, amenities, interior finishes while lower rent residents are looking for the best deal.  Our higher rent properties tend to be more urban and our lower rent communities are more suburban.", "Resident turnover was up slightly in the quarter to an annualized rate of 66% compared to 65% in the third quarter of 2010.  Year-to-date our annualized turnover rate decreased by 100 basis points to 55%.  Move out for home purchase remain well below historical average at 12% while move outs due to rent increases are rising slightly, they still represent only 7% of move outs. ", "Expense growth of 1.1% was the result of higher real estate taxes, utilities, and insurance costs which were offset by lower repairs and maintenance, personnel costs, administrative and marketing costs.  Given the acquisition redevelopment and disposition activity over the past 12 months, our non-same store portfolio has grown to 10,107 homes and now represents 28% of our total quarterly NOI including over 3,200 acquired homes located in markets such as Boston, Manhattan, San Francisco, Washington DC, Los Angeles, and Orange County.  These properties are performing as expected and are generating better growth in our same store portfolio.", "In fact, on a sequential basis, our 2010 acquisitions had revenue growth of 2.8% compared to 2% for our same store portfolio.  Our 2011 acquisitions produced revenue that was almost 2% over pro forma in the third quarter.  Our recent New York acquisitions are giving rent increases in the 11% to 14% range and have occupancies averaging 98%.  In addition, since acquiring these properties we\u2019ve been able to eliminate broker commissions and reduce maintenance costs. ", "Average occupancy for all properties acquired in both 2010 and 2011 was just under 97%.  If you refer to attachment nine in our earnings supplement, you will see that we have completed the development of over 2,200 homes in six communities at a total cost of $437 million or $186,000 per home. All of the homes go into our same store pool within the next year except The Tribute which was sold last week.  These properties had sequential revenue growth of 2.4% in the third quarter.  ", "In addition, on attachment 10 and 11 you\u2019ll see that we have 2,573 homes being developed at a total estimated cost of $751 million or $292,000 per home.  On attachment 10 you will see we have close to 3,000 homes in redevelopment.  The pipeline consists of seven communities at a total investment of $337 million.  Barton Creek Landing in Austin Texas is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year.  CitySouth in San Mateo California will be completed by mid year 2012.  Leasing velocity and pricing continues to be very strong at both CitySouth and Barton Creek Landing and both properties are operating ahead of plan.", "We have five additional properties in Southern California, Metro DC, and Manhattan that are just now beginning the redevelopment process with estimated completions ranging from the second quarter 2013 to the second quarter 2014.  Our joint venture with MetLife which includes 26 properties containing 5,748 homes continues to perform well.  During the third quarter we reached 95% visible occupancy for the portfolio.  The 23 communities that had stabilized occupancies in both second and third quarters achieved sequential revenue growth of 3%.", "With that, I\u2019d like to give my thanks to all our dedicated associates in the field and in our corporate and regional offices for a strong quarter.  Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you Tom.", "Thomas W. Toomey ", "Operator, we\u2019re now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.", "Question-And-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from Anthony Pallone \u2013 JP Morgan.", "Anthony Pallone \u2013 JP Morgan", "My first question is Tom you mentioned the environment for selling assets and just transactions in general just pretty strong.  I was wondering if you could comment on how participants are underwriting NOI growth over the next few years versus say how underwriting saved up a few months back.", "Thomas W. Toomey ", "With respect to the environment I\u2019ll let Harry and Matt speak about the bidding and what people are underwriting.  But on the environment topic I think one thing that is telling about that is that as we\u2019ve talked to a number of lending institutions about their plans for \u201912 we have found every platform is going to increase its lending to the multifamily space over \u201912 and believe that will be a great environment conducive to getting our sales done both those that are in the pipeline and those that we\u2019re going to undertake in \u201912.  With respect to the underwriting, what people are underwriting, do you guys have an idea?", "Matthew T. Akin ", "I think buyers are still underwriting strong revenue and NOI growth.  There hasn\u2019t been any substantive change over the past several months.  It\u2019s still a good fundamental operating environment.", "Harry G. Alcock ", "I\u2019d just add that I think the value add buyers are coming back more and more so we\u2019re seeing a little more emphasis on value add opportunities.", "Anthony Pallone \u2013 JP Morgan", "For your New York City assets, I guess with concerns over financial services potentially pulling back and what the implications may be for Manhattan, I\u2019m wondering how those assets that you bought that were up and running from 2007 to 2010 performed?", "DD", "Well, the assets they experienced a dip in revenue and now they\u2019re at or above their peak revenue levels.", "Thomas W. Toomey ", "Tony, to be clear we didn\u2019t buy anything until April of this year and so in underwriting historical numbers we didn\u2019t really go back all the way through the last 10 to 15 years to see where the troughs were and the impact.  But it\u2019s clear from our value add that we\u2019re getting in rent increases better than 12% and in some cases up to 15% and that\u2019s primarily what we identified in the underwriting and so we\u2019re exceeding our pro forms on those.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Eric Wolfe \u2013 Citi.", "Eric Wolfe \u2013 Citi", "Could you just talk about the level of traffic that you saw in October relative to the same time last year and how that trending through the third quarter?  I\u2019m basically just wondering whether you\u2019re seeing the same pause in demand that one of your peers mentioned.", "Jerry A. Davis ", "We\u2019ve been hearing a lot about traffic over the last week or so and I\u2019d like to tell you that our traffic and rents in the fourth quarter are in line with our expectations.  If I were in home building or retail I\u2019d focus a lot more on traffic but we tend to look more at leasing activity and putting money in the bank.  I think the key points to focus on in our business really are what\u2019s sequential revenue growth going to be in 3Q and 4Q.  ", "We look back over the last five to 10 years, typical growth from 3Q to 4Q is flat on a good year, down in most years.  This year it\u2019s looking like it\u2019s going to be flat to slightly up.  Let me repeat that, we think it\u2019s a good quarter and we think sequential growth from 3Q to 4Q is going to be slightly up.   The other thing we focused a little bit more on is what is 4Q versus last year\u2019s revenue growth look like and right now it\u2019s looking like it\u2019s probably going to be 5% to 5.5% up.", "Lastly, we look at the strength of our ability to renew and I think I said in my prepared remarks that through the fourth quarter we\u2019re sending out 6% on average and we think in January, so as we turn into 2012 at the beginning of the year we\u2019re going to see rent increases going out to existing residents of 5.5% to 6.5%.  I\u2019d remind you that this is from our same store portfolio.  In our non-same stores which represent over 25% of the company, we\u2019re expecting to do even better than that.  Outside of New York will be slightly better than the 5.5% to 6.5% and in New York it looks like it is probably more 8% to 10% range.  So again, traffic is where we expect it.  There are no surprises on traffic and pricing.  The fourth quarter is playing out how we thought.  ", "Eric Wolfe \u2013 Citi", "That sort of leads into my next question because Tom, you mentioned that the leases you\u2019re signing now give you a pretty good look into the early part of 2012.  So just based on those leases would you expect growth to accelerate in the early part of the year or is it going to stay flattish?  What do you think that sort of revenue growth might look like without of course providing guidance.", "Jerry A. Davis ", "I would tell you in the fourth quarter again, you typically have a drop down in your ability to increase rents just because there\u2019s reduced traffic.  As you enter the first quarter you typically pick up some momentum, traffic comes back usually about mid January and accelerates throughout the spring and really accelerates in the summer.  So without giving guidance, we would things would pickup in the first quarter.", "Thomas W. Toomey ", "One thing I\u2019d add is I think in my prepared remarks if Jerry were not to increase rent anymore than he already has in terms of market and if occupancies were to stay flat, you\u2019d be embedded somewhere around 4.5% revenue growth next year.  Obviously, we\u2019re not standing still and obviously we think fundamentals are strong and we like to be able to beat that number.  It\u2019s just saying as a floor, if you would, under that premise next year and that it\u2019s only to the upside is where we\u2019re looking.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from [Swaroop Yalla \u2013 Morgan Stanley].", "[Swaroop Yalla \u2013 Morgan Stanley]", "Jerry, you mentioned in your comments that there seems to be a bifurcation in As versus Bs in your ability to improve rents.  I was just wondering, does that hold true also for your markets which are at the top end of the rent growth like San Francisco and Austin?", "Jerry A. Davis ", "I think it holds true throughout the entire portfolio, the disparity between As and Bs in the markets we operate in.  There\u2019s definitely the disparity I talked about as far as the ability to push new rent.  The other thing is occupancy levels on our A properties are about 95.9% in the third quarter and Bs were about 95.4%.  Well, you tend to see it, more of our portfolio on the market basis \u2013 more of our portfolio in San Francisco tends to be in the A range and we\u2019re getting much better performance there.", "[Swaroop Yalla \u2013 Morgan Stanley]", "Just turning to redevelopment, what are the yields you\u2019re looking at on the new redevelopment projects you\u2019re starting?  And also, what was the difference in what you realized at CitySouth and some of the others ones that you completed versus pro forma?", "Thomas W. Toomey ", "Our underwriting, which we\u2019ve discussed in prior years is first you have to undertake the effort to bring the asset to market.  So if we think the asset is on our books at $10 million but truly we can sell it at $20, we calculate our return assuming the $20 and our return expectations for the redevelopment pipeline are generally probably going to be 7.5 if you take out that step of the market value, you\u2019re probably more in the nine range.", "[Swaroop Yalla \u2013 Morgan Stanley]", "Did that hold true for CitySouth and the way the rents are looking right now?", "Jerry A. Davis ", "I think both CitySouth and Barton Creek are up in that range.  You know, we\u2019ve increased rent at Barton Creek over $500 from pre rehab to post rehab and at CitySouth they\u2019re up well over $700.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Jana Galan \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jana Galan \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Following up the comments you made on the disposition environment, I was wondering if you could comment on how you\u2019re thinking about acquisitions now and do you see better opportunities in redevelopment, development, or maybe land purchases?", "Jerry A. Davis ", "With respect to the best opportunities, I think the best opportunity for capital would probably be the redevelopment effort in our mind.  Why?  Because, you have an embedded cash flow, you take a part of it offline but the efforts that we\u2019re undertaking mostly in California right now, many of the residents frankly do not move while we\u2019re conducting the redevelopment so very little dilution out of that effort. Next up to that would probably be the acquisition front, but that\u2019s hard to project.  We\u2019re certainly looking at a number of opportunities.  We\u2019re never certain about which one will get across the go line but there\u2019s plenty in that front.  On the development front, where we can\u2019t buy, or we don\u2019t have existing assets then we\u2019ll undertake development.  ", "On the land pricing, we think land really did not take a hit in the downturn is right back to the 2007 pricing levels and so we\u2019re looking for development sites.  We\u2019ve got a lot in front of us, we\u2019ll just have to pick through the opportunities and see what really fits us and our return expectations.  So there\u2019s plenty of opportunities for us to put capital to work, we\u2019re just going to be very selective and thoughtful about that process.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Rob Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie Capital.", "Rob Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "Tom, just a follow up on that last question, in the release you guys talked about the Beach Walk JV potentially starting in the next year and I think you\u2019ve got some more Vitruvian land and a Wilshire Los Angeles site, am I correct in that\u2019s basically right now what\u2019s on the books as the extent of your development capabilities for future starts?", "Thomas W. Toomey ", "That\u2019s correct as well as I would add the Met joint venture which has 10 sites remaining and we\u2019re out examining those right as we speak and I would suspect over the next year that some of those will be undertaken.", "Rob Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "Jerry, can you give us the monthly breakdown during the third quarter of the rental rate growth increases for both new leases as well as renewals?", "Jerry A. Davis ", "For renewals in July it was 6.2%, August was 6.6%, September was 6.4% and for new leases July was 4.7%, August was 4.5% and September was 5.2%.", "Rob Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "Then one last question on expenses, do you guys talk about whether or not you\u2019re seeing any significant upward pressure on expenses that you had through the back half of this year relative to expectations?", "Jerry A. Davis ", "Really, the only real category of expenses that we expect to see some pressure compared to last year is real estate taxes.  They should be even with what they\u2019ve been throughout the last quarter or two but last year in the fourth quarter we had some revaluations that came through to us and gave us some savings in the fourth quarter of last year.  So year-over-year growth in 4Q will predominately come from real estate taxes.", "Thomas W. Toomey ", "One thing that [came] to me to add to the expense front here and I\u2019m going to take a little bit and pat Jerry on the back and his team.  We look at the long term trend of expenses, and you can have short swings but the truth is over the last five years he\u2019s grown expenses on average under 1% in each of the last five years. And certainly I think a lot of that is people, a lot of it is technology and just better but the end is what it does is lead us to a better margin and we\u2019ve crossed back over 66 and if you add in the non-matures I think the margin gets to 68%.  People lose sight of, sometimes that in the real estate field, it\u2019s a big metric to us especially when we go and look at acquisitions and if we say we\u2019re running down the street at 68% or 69% margin and the existing operator is running at 62% we know we can get that margin over time.  So it\u2019s an important metric to start thinking about. ", "Rob Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "", "Is there anything big left on the horizon to improve that any further?", "Thomas W. Toomey ", "Well, I think one of the biggest fronts here is our open and you\u2019re going to see as we probably move through this slide in home ownership is retention.  If we can figure out how to unlock more and more of this turnover and bring it down with an average turn cost of $2,000 we could potentially cap for a great deal of upside in that area.  On the new technology front, how you procure a customer, we\u2019ve all made the first frontier which is to get into pricing technology.  ", "The question now is how to identify to spend the right marketing dollars on the right customer, so to work backwards on your channeling of marketing dollars to get the high probability tenants who is going to stay there for long periods of time.  I think you\u2019re going to see more and more of that predictive model about how to score your customer, how to attract your customer, and then how to keep them.

Davis ", "I would tell you our third quarter unique visitor traffic at www.UDR.com is up 30% year-over-year and in October it was up 35% to 245,000 hits.  In addition to [inaudible] our mobile traffic which represents about 14% of our unique traffic at www.UDR.com is up about 132%.", "Derek Bower \u2013 UBS", "And what about the actual asset level, people walking in the door?", "Jerry A. Davis ", "It\u2019s about what we expected.  It\u2019s down probably 15%.  That\u2019s what we projected it would be.  You know, what you had happen last year and the year before is people were aware that there was a large drop from peak to trough and they went out and looked and in 2009 they were able to find a great deal so traffic was up.  So instead of looking at three competitive properties they may have gone to 10.  Last year they went again and thought they could play the same game and get a substantial increase and I think what they found was price was roughly the same as they were paying at a comparable property.  This year, I think people look online more than they did two years ago.  They do all of their price shopping through places like www.UDR.com to help narrow down their selection.", "Derek Bower \u2013 UBS", "On markets specifically, can you talk about trends in Norfolk Virginia and I guess comment on the [Norfolk] overall?  It looks like your rent per occupied home actual slipped sequentially so any additional color there would be helpful?", "Jerry A. Davis ", "Norfolk is predominately a military town, sort of Navel basis.  Norfolk has been hurt more than most our other properties, all of their decline recently is not seasonality.  It can really relate to ships going out versus ships going in so you have some unique phenomena that occurs there as well as in our San Diego and the Jacksonville market.  That\u2019s the primary thing that happened in Norfolk, the military rotations.", "Thomas W. Toomey ", "I\u2019d add that with the recent administration\u2019s announcements that they\u2019re going to pull back some of the people from the Middle East it will be interesting to see which markets and what divisions get pulled back and what the timing of that is.  But I think the long term aspect of Norfolk is it will recover just on the indication that we\u2019re going to draw down our troops.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "I wanted to follow up on your answer to Tony\u2019s question, you said that all the lenders you spoke to are looking to increase their lending activity in multifamily.  Are you finding that is true for construction lending as well?  And is it just for the multifamily REITs or are they looking to expand their activity to both public and private borrowers?", "Warren L. Troupe ", "I\u2019ll tell you that with respect to we\u2019re out in the market in construction loans and it\u2019s a very competitive pricing and there\u2019s a lot of buy in for construction loans.  I think that\u2019s true with respect to public REITs.  We have heard anecdotally that construction lending is still difficult for the private.", "Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "My second question is just a clarification from Jerry, did you say that you thought sequential growth from 4Q to 1Q on the revenue side would be 0.7%?", "Jerry A. Davis ", "I did.  Well, I didn\u2019t say that\u2019s what I thought it would be this year, I said that as we look back over the last six or seven years that\u2019s what it\u2019s averaging.  ", "Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "If 4Q ends up flat to slightly up sequentially and then 4Q to 1Q ends up at that average of 70 basis points what do you think the year-over-year revenue growth would be in 1Q12?", "Jerry A. Davis ", "I don\u2019t think we want to give any guidance right now.", "Thomas W. Toomey ", "It will be positive Karin.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Dave Bragg \u2013 Zelman & Associates.", "Dave Bragg \u2013 Zelman & Associates", "Just back to this traffic topic, I don\u2019t mean to dwell on it but I just think it has this figure that you put out and also another peer put out in terms of the year-over-year decline has caught some people\u2019s attention.  And I know it\u2019s not your preferred metric in terms of visits to the communities but can you just put this into historical perspective for us?  On a year-over-year basis have you seen other periods where you\u2019ve seen a decline like that?", "Jerry A. Davis ", "I have.  Traffic will fluctuate at any given time.  I can tell you for the full year our traffic is probably down a little over 10%.  So what\u2019s happening right now is a little more pronounced but again I think what happened last year and the year before is people were out looking for a deal they were able to get in 2009 they discovered in 2010 they couldn\u2019t find it and this year they\u2019re just looking on the internet while they\u2019re price shopping.", "Thomas W. Toomey ", "I do believe that there\u2019s a little bit too much emphasis on the early part of the reporting season on this traffic patter when in fact, what really matters is what cash we\u2019re putting in the bank, what our occupancies are, what we\u2019re sending out for renewal notices, what those renewal notices are going to be the take rate.  And in our business we\u2019re telling you we see continued revenue growth, that we\u2019re not at all surprised at the seasonal pattern and frankly it makes a lot of sense to us in light of both holidays, heat wave, all those traffic elements that influence it.  But the truth is we\u2019re pushing rent, we\u2019re not getting a push back on it and that\u2019s where we think the business is headed and headed for a long period of time.", "Dave Bragg \u2013 Zelman & Associates", "Jerry you had an interesting comment on As versus Bs, you mentioned the spread in terms of pricing during the third quarter.  Is this a widening spread or is that spread consistent with what you saw in the first half of the year?", "Jerry A. Davis ", "I\u2019ll be honest with you Dave, we weren\u2019t really tracking it in depth earlier this year so I don\u2019t have that number handy.  I may be able to go dig that back up.", "Dave Bragg \u2013 Zelman & Associates", "Last question, Tom, just given your preference for redevelopment today can you talk about that pipeline and maybe put it into perspective for us in terms of how large of an opportunity that is in your core markets, what\u2019s the potential annual spend there?", "Thomas W. Toomey ", "Well, David it\u2019s hard to forecast exactly how much of the pipeline will pencil out but moving it out by $300 million as we\u2019ve done, I would like to continue the increase to have about $300 million underway each year.  The source of that, we think a lot of it is going to be frankly in the California corridors where it\u2019s so difficult to really develop from the ground up there with sometimes three, four years of lead time to look at something and scrape it.  A lot of our portfolio in those markets frankly are up against the west side of the 405 and we think that\u2019s a great place with a high propensity to rent where an improved product has a wide pool of renters available to it.", "So we\u2019re focused on that which happens to be our largest market at present. Then followed by that we\u2019ll probably be looking at the DC corridor and the inner loop there where we think we have a handful of opportunities.  But the redevelopment is, as you can visit in many of our assets, for us it is not a $10,000 a door effort. We are actually taking the community apart, you\u2019re really attempting to retenant it completely not just on a cash-on-cash returns analysis but also on a cap rate compression.", "For many of you that have seen CitySouth, if we had sold that in the open market it probably would have been a 6.25 cap and post redevelopment it\u2019s probably a 5.25 cap and with a $700 a month rent increase you can kind of pencil in the kind of great return and it\u2019s a great location.  So that\u2019s why we really gravitate to the redevelopment efforts and believe on a risk adjusted basis why it scores the best on returns.", "Dave Bragg \u2013 Zelman & Associates", "Tom, one last question on that, in terms of your underwriting on the new redevelopment starts, is that 100 basis points of compression a pretty good rule of thumb for us to think about?", "Thomas W. Toomey ", "I would do that, yes.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Alex Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill.", "Alex Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill", "Just going back to Tom, on the redevelopment front, if you could just give us some examples on Marina Pointe and the two Costa Mesa deals what your team is expecting from the revenue for the rental pop for those redevelopments?", "Thomas W. Toomey ", "We expect somewhere in the neighborhood of $600 to $700 per month in incremental revenue on those.  Marina Pointe is about $1,500 it\u2019s going to $2,100 to $2,200 [inaudible] in each of the Pine Brook assets which are next door to one another are going to be very similar going from that $1,500 to $1,600 up above $2,000 per month.", "Alex Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill", "Then those assumptions are based on current rents today, right?  It\u2019s not like you\u2019re trending it forward?", "Thomas W. Toomey ", "Those are based on current rents today, yes.", "Thomas W. Toomey ", "Alex, once you\u2019ve visited enough of these you realize that the vast majority of the people are not going to move while they\u2019re being rehabbed.  That our team has been very good at deciphering how to properly do the rehab and sequence it so we really don\u2019t take much of a hit in the cash flow.", "Alex Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill", "The second question is as you talk about your dispositions and recycling capital, I\u2019m sort of curious, the Fannie JV, I\u2019m sure they wouldn\u2019t mind raising a few extra dollars although I don\u2019t want to speak to them, but given that JV is there any chance that maybe that\u2019s a harvest opportunity for you?", "Thomas W. Toomey ", "We\u2019re always talking to Fannie both in terms of the joint venture and lending, and the market.  And if the opportunity avails itself for those assets to either be sold, or split, the [babies] so to speak, but I\u2019m sure when the time is appropriate there will be a dissolution of that.", "Alex Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill", "But there\u2019s nothing actively being discussed in the near term.", "Thomas W. Toomey ", "I\u2019d just say we\u2019re always in conversation with them.", "Alex Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill", "The last question is probably for Warren, you guys are the latest to do the line of credit and the term loan financing.  I\u2019m just sort of curious where you started conversations to where you closed, how much of an improvement in rate do you think you got from banks being more competitive versus simply the market coming in?", "Warren L. Troupe ", "Obviously, we\u2019ve looked at this, done the analyst on this and [ETR] has been out in the market and a couple of our other peers so pricing really is kind of set what you\u2019re peers are priced at.  I will tell you that it is a very competitive market and it [inaudible] very heavily to be in the line.  I think the combination of how we got pretty good pricing on it.", "Alex Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill", "But you can\u2019t give us some perspective as far as that competitiveness helped pricing versus just general market trends?", "Warren L. Troupe ", "No, not really.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Stephen C. Swett \u2013 Morgan Keegan.", "Stephen C. Swett \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "Tom, you\u2019ve got another $250 million under contract and being marketed.  When those sales are completed where does that put you in terms of your long term portfolio transition goals?  Are you going to kind of be where you want to be or is there still more selling either by market or submarket that you\u2019ve got planned?", "Thomas W. Toomey ", "I think this management groups sees it as a continual effort to always improve the quality of the portfolio and so there\u2019s always going to be an evaluation of every asset in terms of where it stands, what do we think is left in the upside of it, what does the cap ex need and a decision made about the long term right use of capital.  At present what we\u2019re targeting is to get into a program of $400 to $500 million annually in sales to offset what is coming online in new development.  And we think that nice match, if you will, we think developments are getting 6 to 6.5 and we can go to the market and be selling Norfolk, Virginia, Tennessee, those markets at 6 to 6.5 that it\u2019s a great redeployment of capital, it won\u2019t be dilutive.  ", "So I think we\u2019ll continue to do that and we think that environment will sustain itself for a while primarily because of the low interest rate environment that looks like it\u2019s going to persist for some period of time.  And most of those buyers of that caliber of asset are very leverage sensitive and they\u2019re going to be there in depth. So I think it\u2019s a long term program for us.  ", "Stephen C. Swett \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "Second question either for David or Warren, as you look into 2012 the debt maturities, any initial thoughts in terms of refinancing either with some incremental equity or your sense on what kind of terms you would use.", "DD", "I think we\u2019ll always look at all the different alternatives and possibilities that we have when that time presents itself.  We\u2019re always trying to keep our finger on capital markets to where debt pricing is and equity pricing and if an opportunity presents itself one way or the other we would utilize it.  But as of today we wouldn\u2019t pin ourselves down to one mode or another.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets.", "Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Just to go back to the rental traffic, can you talk about qualified applications?  I know people coming into the property but many people that are actually looking to lease the property as well, maybe that\u2019s a better way to look at it?", "Jerry A. Davis ", "I will tell you the rent scores are comparable to what they have been.  We really haven\u2019t seen a change in that.", "Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Has there been a change in the number of applications?  I mean, a person walking in who is shopping the property versus a person actually putting in a rental application I think are two different things?", "Jerry A. Davis ", "I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t follow your question.  No, you\u2019re right applications have really stayed fairly constant with where they were last year.  Today our occupancy is 95.3% so a little bit lower than what we had last year but what we\u2019re really trying to do this year is maintain some of the rate not cut price too much to load up on the occupancy right now so that will push it up in 2012.", "Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Second of all you talked about a 5% loss to lease, can you break that out maybe by region or market a bit more so we can see how pricing trends are going?", "Jerry A. Davis ", "As of September \u2013 our largest loss to lease at September was in Austin at about 12.5%.  That was followed by San Francisco at about 10%, Dallas was around 8%, the bulk of the rest were near the middle.  The lower loss to leases are currently in some of our outlaying tertiary areas like Sacramental, other Mid-Atlantic, Portland and Monterrey at 1% to 1.5% and actually Washington DC is down around that 1% level too.", "Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Finally, just in terms of non-core assets as we start thinking about you mentioned for next year recycling assets to refund development, are we to assume then that acquisitions will be more equity funded as with this year or is that going to be also funded with recycling proceeds?", "Thomas W. Toomey ", "I think that is our preferred path with equity and we think it\u2019s a great partnership with our shareholders.  They can look at individual acquisition opportunities and determine if we\u2019re heading in the right direction and they get to vote with whether they\u2019re going to buy in or not so we think it\u2019s the right path.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Robert W. Baird \u2013 Paula Poskon.", "Robert W. Baird \u2013 Paula Poskon", "Just a follow up on Karin\u2019s question around the environment for construction financing, are you more or less concerned about new supply across your markets than you may have been maybe six months ago?", "Thomas W. Toomey ", "As I\u2019ve just recently come back from [inaudible] and a number of conferences, it\u2019s very clear to me that the merchant building model is out there seeking capital but the capital is picking through deals.  And so there are now, I think in the Mill Wood guys for example are going to say they started out in 2012 thinking they were going to do 2,000 doors and they\u2019re not really upping their increase because capital is being very selective.  So I think the merchant builders are hanging around the hoop if you will.  There\u2019s not a lot of equity or they don\u2019t have the financial guaranteed entities to get the deals done right now.  ", "Markets that they\u2019re looking for and building in, no surprises there, it\u2019s the suburban DC, it\u2019s the Texas market and we\u2019re starting to see them spring up a little bit in Florida.  So mostly suburban oriented product, but again, recognize we\u2019re at record low, generational low, supply numbers and they could go up from here and still not represent a threat to our revenue outlook.  ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from [Handal St. Jewws \u2013 KBW].", "[Handal St. Jewws \u2013 KBW]", "Jerry, I guess this one is for you, can you expand a bit on your southern California experience during 3Q, particularly LA?  Recent third-party data indicated LA strengthened materially during 3Q yet your numbers don\u2019t seem to reflect that?", "Jerry A. Davis ", "LA stayed stable.  I think the Marina area during the summer saw a month or two of weakness and since stabilized with our occupancies there being up in the 95% to 96% range.  But early in the summer June, July, maybe the first part of August the Marina area was a little soft but it strengthened and probably half of our LA portfolio was up in that market.", "[Handal St. Jewws \u2013 KBW]", "And your thoughts on the other pieces of the LA market, maybe downtown or some of the other areas you\u2019re exposed to?", "Jerry A. Davis ", "Downtown has been performing strong for us.  Our MetLife deal, 717 Olympic has been able to push rents and have a good strong occupancy.  We sent out pretty good rent increases in the 5% to 7% range.", "[Handal St. Jewws \u2013 KBW]", "Tom, for you I guess more broadly your thoughts on potential acquisition activity today, what are the minimum thresholds ROI today?  How has that changed in the past few months and is it better to assume that despite your preponderance of investment opportunity the last year on the east coast that the west coast is probably where you\u2019ll be focusing your attention a bit more going forward?", "Thomas W. Toomey ", "I think it\u2019s clear from where our platform is headed that we\u2019re going to continue to focus from the DC to Boston corridor and focus on the west coast as well.  With respect to higher ROIs I think it\u2019s one metric.  We use a number of them, one is just replacement cost and we still believe we\u2019re buying assets well below the replacement cost in some of these urban corridors and so I think that\u2019s going to be a metric we\u2019re focused mostly on as well as the growth prospects in terms of what Jerry and his team can do to bring NOIs up to market or exceed market.  The ROI\u2019s to answer directly, I guess we kind of look at an eight on an unlevered basis and believe that that\u2019s kind of a minimal threshold. Sometimes we\u2019ll dip below that and take a little bit more risk in terms of the prospects for the future of the enterprise but that\u2019s kind of a number we think about.", "[Handal St. Jewws \u2013 KBW]", "Just one modeling question, can you guys talk about the cap rate achieved on the assets sold during 3Q and also on the assets that are currently under contract today?", "Matthew T. Akin ", "I think overall we\u2019re looking at a blended six cap rate on the dispositions.  That would probably be equivalent to what we have under contract as well.  So it\u2019s really a forward \u201912 look after cap ex and management fees.", "Operator", "", "At this time there are no further questions in the queue.  I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Tom Toomey for any closing comments.", "Thomas W. Toomey ", "Thank you all of you and I hope that the snow has not inconvenienced you a great deal in the Northeast and we will see many of you a NAREIT and certainly hope that you\u2019ll sign up for our tour of Vitruvian Park.  With that, thank you again.", "Operator", "", "Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude the conference for today.

(Operator Instructions) This conference is being recorded today, Monday, February 6, 2012. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chris Van Ens, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Chris Van Ens", "Thank you for joining us for UDR's fourth quarter financial results conference call. Our fourth quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed earlier today and posted to our website www.udr.com. In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in accordance with Reg G requirements.", "I would like to note that statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. The discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in this morning's press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.", "When we get to the question-and-answer portion, we ask that you to be respectful of everyone's time and limit your questions and follow-ups. Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered on the call. I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.", "Tom Toomey", "Thank you, Chris, and good morning everyone. Welcome to UDR's fourth quarter conference call. On the call with me today are David Messenger, Chief Financial Officer; and Jerry Davis, Senior Vice President of Operations, who will discuss our results; as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock who will be available to answer questions during the Q&A portion of the call.", "My comments today will focus on three topics: first, our fourth quarter and full year 2011 results; second, the summary of our 2011 accomplishments; and finally, our outlook for 2012. Following my comments, David will discuss our financial results and 2012 guidance, and Jerry will provide commentary on operational results and early 2012 trends.", "First, UDR's business continues to improve, as evidenced by the accelerating revenue growth we reported during 2011. In the fourth quarter, core FFO per share rose 21% year-over-year, driven by same-store revenue and net operating income growth of 5.3% and 7.7% respectively.", "For full year 2011, core FFO per share of $1.28 per share rose 13% year-over-year, driven by same-store revenue and net operating income of 4.1% and 5.6% respectively.", "We expect that 2012 will even be better than 2011. Second, we accomplished a great deal in 2011, expanding our enterprise by $1.8 billion in key urban markets and disposing of nearly $600 million of non-core communities. At yearend, our equity market capitalization stood at $6 billion and our total enterprise value is nearly $10 billion.", "Some additional highlights from the past year that demonstrate the progress we made in implementing our long-term strategic plan to improve our portfolio, strengthen our balance sheet and grow our cash flow include: we entered New York City market through four unique off-market transactions totaling $1.2 billion. These acquisitions offer meaningful operational upside as they continue to grow in excess of our original forecast. At the yearend, New York City accounted for 10% of our total net operating income versus 0% at the beginning of 2011.", "We increased our ownership interest in Boston metro area, Washington, DC, and San Francisco through the purchase of approximately 1,800 apartment homes worth $606 million. At yearend, these markets accounted for 25% of our total net operating income versus 21% at the beginning of 2011.", "As I mentioned earlier in my comments, we disposed of nearly 4,500 apartment homes in 18 communities for total proceeds of $594 million. We will continue to use the proceeds from non-core asset sales to help fund our development and redevelopment pipeline unless a 1031 exchange is necessary for tax purposes.", "We commenced the development and redevelopment of nearly 4,300 homes in 11 communities located in markets such as New York, Southern California, Washington, DC, and Dallas for a total estimated cost of $808 million. Our in-progress development and redevelopment pipeline totaled $1.2 billion at yearend, of which 30% has already been funded. We expect to delivery roughly half of these homes by the end of 2013.", "We increased our portfolio-wide total income per occupied home by 15% to approximately 1370 a month. This metric will trend higher as we continue to execute on our strategy of owning apartment homes in high barrier-to-entry markets, while also disposing up lower ramp non-core community.", "We raised nearly $1 billion of equity consisting of $496 million to its secondary offering in July, $109 million in OP units and an additional $384 million through our At the Market program, all of which strengthened and delevered our balance sheet. We completed $300 million in offering of seven year unsecured note at 4.25% in May. And finally, we increased our annual dividend by 10% to $0.80 per share.", "With the closing of 2011, the entire management team would like to thank nearly 1,700 associates for an outstanding year. We look forward to our continued success.", "Turning to 2012, we are off to a great start on all fronts and looking forward to another successful year. I'd like first to briefly comment on a second real estate joint venture with MetLife, announced in early January. It's a new $1.3 billion 50-50 joint venture consist of 12 operating community containing 2,500 apartment homes, with an average income per occupied home of over $3,000 a month and is comprised of well-located communities in our core markets.", "We were pleased with the upside our operating platform generated in our first JV with MetLife as well as the progress we made in owning larger interests in these high quality well-located communities. We look forward to further growing our relationship with MetLife.", "We remain committed to deleveraging the balance sheet overtime. Our 2012 guidance fully contemplates capital needs for the recently closed MetLife JV, as well as $500 million in development and redevelopment activities, the majority of which will be funded by the anticipated disposition of non-core communities in 2012. David will speak further on these sources and uses in his prepared remarks.", "Moving forward, deleveraging will occur opportunistically and likely in connection with growing the enterprise. At times there potentially that our leverage will increase over the short term, especially when of if we close on larger transaction, such as the second MetLife joint venture. But overtime deleveraging enterprise remains a priority.", "Turning to multi-family fundamentals. The robust supply and demand characteristics current evident and our business will continue to provide a tailwind for apartment owners and operators. With our leading operating platform, much improved portfolio and experienced management team, UDR is well positioned for the future.", "Our 2012 guidance calls for same-store revenue and net operating income growth of 5.5% and 6.75% at the midpoint respectively, leading to FFO per share of $1.37 to $1.43, a 9% increase at the midpoint. David and Jerry will provide more commentary on our 2012 expectation in their prepared remarks.", "In addition to a strong same-store guidance, we will see meaningful growth from our non-mature pool community this year. Importantly, many of these non-mature communities are located in the supply-constrained gateway markets that are expected to generate outsized topline growth over the coming years. At the end of 2011, our non-mature pool accounted for 28% of our total NOI. David and Jerry will further discuss our non-mature portfolio and our expectation forth in 2012.", "The following support our 2012 outlook: first, multi-family supply remains intact. Second, there remains an aversion to home ownership as evidenced by still downward trending home ownership rates. This phenomenon continues to simulate demand by depressing turnover and thereby limiting fresh new supply.", "Lastly, job growth is expected to continue to gain traction in 2012. More importantly is that the 20 to 34-year old age cohort, which has a high propensity to rent should continue to garner a majority of new jobs, but potential speed bumps still exist. First, the general economy is recovering, but progress remain stubbornly slow. The overall recovery from Main Street's perspective is still somewhat fragile to us. Second, government intervention, specifically changes to either the GSE or broad-base housing initiative. Lastly, the ongoing European debt crisis or the realization of another macro shot could negatively impact capital markets and/or consumer confidence in the U.S.", "Regardless of these or other risks, UDR remains well-positioned for a robust 2012 and beyond. To summarize, we expect 2012 will be another strong year for UDR. We projected FFO per share will increase by 9% at the midpoint of our guidance, due to the continued acceleration of our same-store and non-mature net operating income growth. As a result, the Board has increased our annual dividend by 10% to $0.88 per share for 2012.", "With that, I will pass the call over to David.", "David Messenger", "Thanks Tom. My comments this morning will focus on our fourth quarter results, of balance sheet update, 2012 guidance and our capital funds. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter core FFO per diluted share of $0.34, a 21% year-over-year increase and consistent with our guidance in month of July. Reported FFO per diluted share of $0.35 during the quarter was positively affected by several non-recurring items which led into an additional $0.01. These items are disclosed in more detail on the first page of our fourth quarter press release.", "Turning to our balance sheet and capital market activities. As of December 31, we had $739 million of cash and credit capacity available to flaunt our business and external growth opportunities. In December and January, we sold 1.8 million shares under our At the Market equity program at a weighted average net price of $24.67. There are 7.4 million remaining shares available for sale under this program.", "At December 31, UDR had 233.1 million common share equivalents outstanding and pretty modeled is the assumed no further equity issuances for the remainder of the year to 2012 weighted average share count will be 234.3 million. This includes the shares sold under the ATM in January.", "In early January, we completed $400 million 4.625% on secured offerings, $100 million of which was used to repay higher cost unsecured debt. With the conclusion of 2011, it is important to look back at the improvements we have made in our balance sheet over the past two years.", "In addition to making substantial and sustainable progress with regard to our credit methods we also acquired and developed over $2 billion of wholly-owned high quality apartments in desirable location.", "The purchases were primarily funded with dispositions of non-core communities in access of $600 million and the issuance of $1.5 billion in equity. In short, we have successfully de-leveraged our balance sheet over the last two years while at the same time materially improving the quality and location of our portfolio. We will continue our de-leveraging efforts as we acquired new assets into opportunistic capital market activities.", "A few highlights since 2009. At the end of 2009, UDR had a debt plus preferred stock to gross assets value of 55%. In annualized debt-to-EBITDA of 10%, a secured debt to assets ratio of 31% and a fixed charge ratio of 2 times.", "Fast forward to year-end 2011, and our metrics have improved meaningfully. UDR had a had a debt plus preferred stock to gross assets value of 47%, a reduction of 800 basis points. In annualized debt-to-EBITDA of 8.3%, that's 1.7 times better or a 17% improvement. A secured debt to assets ratio of 22%, a 900 basis points improvement and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.6, that is 0.6 times better or a 30% improvement.", "Next our 2012 guidance. Consistent with prior years, our guidance is driven by a bottom-up approach that begins at property level forecast from our experiences operations team. Our approach includes a review of the local economy including job growth, potential new supply, current rentals, application counts et cetera. Additionally, we review macro expectation for the national economy and use this information to gage the reasonableness of our more micro expectations. Our guidance is driven by many components, all of which are detailed in Attachment 14 in earnings supplement.", "Let's begin with same-store growth guidance which is predicated on a pool of 38,680 homes or 82% of the homes UDR wholly-owned. For 2012 we anticipate an increase in same-store revenue of 5% to 6%, portfolio occupancy of 95% and expenses to be up 3% to 3.5%, all resulting in same-store NOI growth of 6% to 7.5%.", "Next, non-same-store operations. Due to homes being added to our year-end, non-same-store pool throughout 2010 and 2011, we are unable to provide an apple-to-apple year-over-year growth estimates for these assets. But we'll give you a sense of the increased contribution this pool made to the operations in 2012.", "Excluding our development and redevelopment communities, our recent acquisitions are expected to grow NOI at a rate nearly doubled that of our same-store pool in 2012.", "Let me quickly explain our methodology for this calculation as it is not based on a year-over-year comparable growth rates. All of our acquisitions generated a full quarter growth of NOI in the fourth quarter. If you annualized that amount and than compare to our budget for 2012, we find a growth rate that is nearly doubled the same-store pool when its fourth quarter and alliance is treated and compared to comparable 2012 assumptions.", "I want to be clear with everyone, this is not a comparison of year-over-year growth expectations but rather it compares our 2012 NOI expectations for our acquisitions and same-store pool for the annualized fourth quarter NOI outlined on Attachment six of our earnings supplement.", "Third, external growth wholly-owned acquisitions. We continue to actively pursue opportunities in our core markets, but cannot ensure success in these pursuits. Accordingly 2012 acquisitions will be market dependant. Joint venture investments, we reasonably form a second joint venture with MetLife valid at $1.3 billion. Our equity commitment to fund the additional interest in seven communities and the acquisition of Columbus Square totaled $290 million.", "Dispositions, in 2012, we are marketing some of our non-core communities and expected sales $400 million to $600 million of these communities, at an average cap rate between 6% and 6.5%. These dispositions are expected to be diluted by nature given the timing differences between the realization of sales proceeds and the reinvestment in the development and redevelopment activity in 2012.", "Development and redevelopment. We have 18 projects currently underway that when completed will deliver 6,163 homes. The development and redevelopment pipeline will acquire approximately $400 million and $1 million of spending respectively in 2012, which as previously stated will be funded primarily by disposition.", "G&A expenses. We expect G&A cost of $32 million to $34 million in 2012 down 7% at the mid-point from $35.4 million in 2011.", "Debt activities, aside from the $400 million unsecured debt offerings and the coinciding repayments of $100 million of higher cost unsecured debt referenced earlier in my remarks, the remainder of our 2012 obligations consists of $195 million or 4.5% secured debt that can be refinanced at roughly 4% to 4.5% based on today's spreads, treasury, and a tenure-term.", "Equity activity, potential new equity guidance in 2012 is best understood by examining our capital activity for the year. Starting with the lying balance as of December 31, 2011 are $421 million, our sources include the following. January 2012 ATM sales of $29 million, an unsecured $400 million debt offering completed in January, and planned asset sales of $500 million at the mid-point of our guidance in 2012.", "Then the uses consist of our previously announced payoff of $100 million or 5% unsecured debt at far in January, our previously announced investment in a new MetLife joint venture which required $214 million of cash in January. The payoff of a $31 million secured mortgage in January. And on the anticipated development spend of $400 million during the year, the anticipated redevelopment spend of $100 million during the year and the anticipated redemption of the remaining $82 million of our preferred G stock later this year. Based on this analysis, our activity is fully funded and we do not have an immediate need for additional equity or debt to meet our 2012 funding obligation. Any new equity or debt will be market and use dependant.", "Recurring CapEx, for 2012, we anticipate increase in the amount we spend for stabilized home to $1,150. This equates the $55 million fee-spend on 47,545 stabilized home. The per home increase is the result of the transformation our portfolio is undergoing, moving into more high rise products in the higher cost markets.", "Finally, non-recurring items. In the first quarter we repaid a secured mortgage of $31 million and recognized a gain on the mark-to-market adjustments of approximately $4.5 million, which will be included in our first quarter of 2012 results. This will be offset by an approximately $1 million charge related to acquisition cost incurred with the purchase of Columbus Square. And annually $3 million charge in connection with the plan redemption of our preferred G stock. When added together, these input result in a projected 2012 FFO per diluted share range of $1.37 to $1.43. We will update this guidance during our 2012 second quarter call, fourth and material event, we weren't such an update. ", "With regard to the dividends, this morning we announced a 10% year-over-year increase. Therefore, the 2012 annual dividend will be $0.88 per share and will be paid in quarterly amount of $0.22 per share.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Jerry.", "Jerry Davis", "Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to announce another strong quarter and full year of operating results. In the fourth quarter same-store net operating income grew 7.7% year-over-year, driven by a 5.3% revenue increase and minimal expense growth of 0.5%.", "The fourth quarter progressed as we thought it would, effective rental rates on new leases filed during the quarter grew 1.1% in our same-store portfolio. San Francisco and Austin significantly outperformed the reminder of our portfolio and 14 of our 22 same-store market exhibited a positive new lease rate growth in the quarter.", "Our loss to lease at the end of January was 4%, inline with last year. Growth and renewals remain strong throughout the fourth quarter increasing 6.2% on an effective basis. We continue to go on a renewal rate increases at or slightly above what we originally spin out to residence. San Francisco, Phoenix and Seattle were our top performers. All of our same-store markets exhibited positive renewal rate growth in the fourth quarter.", "Fourth quarter occupancy declined by 40 basis points year-over-year to 95.1%, as we held the rates in the fourth quarter and we're willing to observe the small decline in our occupancy. However, we're announcing occupancy strengthen again. Resident turnover was up slightly in the fourth quarter to an annualized rate of 50%, compared to 47% in the fourth quarter of 2010.", "Move out for home purchase remained well below historical average of the 12%, move outs due to rent increases rose slightly, but still represent only 7% of total move outs. For full year 2011, our annualized turnover rate was flat at 53%. In addition, our eight communities continue to outperform our three communities this past quarter.", "On our third quarter call, I commented that the growth spread for new lease rate between A and B was 170 basis points. It widened to over 300 basis points in the fourth quarter. More discretionary income provides our high rent residents with the means to accept market driven increases, but as our lower rent paying residents have less platitude to accept such increases.", "Sequentially, revenue increased 0.2% just as we had expected and expenses declined by 3.9%, leading to NOI growth of 2.3% during the fourth quarter. For the full year 2011, net operating income grew by 5.6% on the back of 4.1% revenue growth and 1.4% expense growth. Importantly fourth quarter income for occupied homes for our same-store portfolio increased 5.7% to $1,216 highlighting our operational success during 2011.", "Given the substantial acquisition development, redevelopment and disposition activity we undertook in 2011, our non-same-store portfolio grew to 8,663 homes and represent a 28% of total quarterly NOI at the end of the fourth quarter. Our acquired bucket includes 3,200 homes purchased in 2010 and 2011 and they are located in market such as Boston, Manhattan, San Francisco, Washington DC, Los Angeles and Orange County.", "Excluding the redevelopment communities in this group our acquisitions are plying out as expected. With regard to the original MetLife JV results exceeded our initial expectations. Specifically, the four New York acquisitions achieved weighted average rents increases of 11% during the fourth quarter, but occupancies averaging 97%.", "Over the past six months, we have turned just under 40% of the roughly 1,900 homes we acquired last year in this market. And there still seem meaningful upside in the rental rate growth. We expect this to continue in 2012 and experience little to no negative effects from way off in the financial sector. On the expense side, we've eliminated broker commission and reduced third-party cost at our New York communities.", "Lastly, we have nearly 3,100 home and 11 communities under development and over 3,100 homes and seven communities in redevelopment. These homes are expected to generate strong NOI growth as we move past 2012. The Barton Creek Landing in Austin, Texas and City South in San Mateo, California are schedule to be completed by the second quarter of 2012.", "Recent velocity and realized rent increases continue to be very strong at both communities and both are operating ahead of budget. These two projects illustrate well our ideology towards redevelopment, generating strong post-rehab topline growth and also achieving cap rate compression by moving up the quality spectrum.", "In an effort to provide more clarity on our non-mature portfolio, we have included attachment 7(NYSE:D) in our fourth quarter earnings supplement. The new attachment demonstrates our same-store NOI versus total portfolio NOI concentration for the fourth quarter. As you can see from attachment 7(D), the corridor between Washington, D.C. and Boston, now comprises 39% of our NOI, and West Coast comprises 36%.", "Turning to 2012, new lease growth is beginning to reaccelerate and occupancy is heading northward again. In January, new lease rates increased 1.7% year-over-year similar to the prior-year period, while occupancy grew 10 basis points versus yearend 2011. Renewals continue to trend well, up 7% in January or 240 basis points about last January results.", "16 of our 23 same-store markets for 2012 generated sequential improvement during the market, encouraging signs that seasonal pricing power is beginning to ramp. Renewal increases sent out for the remainder of the first quarter of 2012 have averaged 6.5%. We expect to realize the majority of this increase as many of our markets strengthening.", "With that, I'd like to thank all of our dedicated associates in the field and in our corporate regional offices for a strong quarter and a great 2011. Now, I'll turn the call back over to you, Tom.", "Tom Toomey", "Thank you, Jerry. And operator, we're now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Dave Bragg with Zelman.", "Dave Bragg - Zelman", "A few questions on disposition plans. Tom, what's the likelihood or your interest in pursuing large portfolio sale that not unlike that of January 2008, maybe not of the same magnitude, but that general strategy, given you disposition plans for the year? And along with that can you comment on whether or not you believe that there is a premium or discount inherent in a portfolio sale today?", "Tom Toomey", "I'll let Harry take that call.", "Harry Alcock", "We've got $400 million to $600 million in our guidance. And we're going to sort of pursue what we believe to be the appropriate disposition strategy, which may or may not include a portfolio sale. In terms of whether there is a premium, I think, my guess is portfolios would trade today at pricing that's roughly equivalent that the pricing we will get on a one-off basis.", "Tom Toomey", "I had to add that in a portfolio you could probably control the timing and minimize the risk a little bit, the portfolio transaction versus one-off market.", "Dave Bragg - Zelman", "Could you remind us of your methodology to get to that 6% to 6.5% cap rate on these expected dispositions in terms of the NOI and the CapEx embedded?", "Harry Alcock", "Sure, that's going to be 2012 NOI. It's going to have a reasonable management fee and they are up about 3%, and 500 unit to 600 unit in CapEx.", "Dave Bragg - Zelman", "And last question, can you talk about what you're doing on the G&A line to continue to drive that down?", "David Messenger", "A couple of items on the G&A front impacting the 2011 versus 2012. We made several restructuring changes over the past couple of years and you're starting to see the effects of. Our technology efforts have been solely focused on our operating platform and we made significant strides at the corporate level as well.", "Our portfolio composition is a positive for us. It's significantly easier or more efficient to manage $300 million assets in one location and 10 $30 million assets elsewhere. And additionally, we have increased our development and redevelopment pipelines, which have moved some of the people from our G&A forces into that segment of our business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Karin Ford with KeyBanc.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc", "Question just on your revenue growth guidance. I know that the midpoint is slightly higher than the revenue growth you achieved for 4Q '11. So could you just walk through what you expect to see the progression through 2012 quarterly of revenue growth for the first half and then the back half of the year?", "Jerry Davis", "I can tell you, you're right, our midpoint is 5.5%, 4Q it's 5.3% and for the year it was 4.1%. So we do expect 2012 to have better revenue growth than last year. Our expectation is somewhere in the middle of the year. It's probably going to be at its higher points and then it will tail off a little bit at the end of the year.", "When you look at the markets, I don't think it's going to be a surprise from what anybody else has been saying. But the strongest markets will be on the West Coast spearheaded by San Francisco. The Texas markets will also do well. We do expect Southern California to be an above average market for us this year.", "And if I had to differentiate between several markets down in Southern California, I would tell you, I think Orange County and LA will do better than San Diego and the Inland Empire. And then our weaker markets, we expect Florida to still be below average for us. And we think Washington D.C. will be a little bit below average for us this year.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc", "My second question is related to Tom, a comment you made at the beginning of the call. I guess one of the items you mentioned is possible driver of your businesses here would be changes to GSEs or something on the regulatory front with respect to housing. Are you seeing anything on those two fronts or is that just a hypothetical case related to your guidance?", "Tom Toomey", "Karin, it's a good question. I don't think anybody really has clarity in an election year about where the GSEs are going to settle out. There's certainly a lot of noise surrounding it and a lot of people are going to say things to try to garner votes. So I'm not certain that it's going to settle itself out in '12, but it's certainly going to impact our business in '13 as a new congress is seated and undertakes what to do with the management of the GSEs, both from a rate standpoint as well as an asset standpoint. So it's just one of the things that on the horizon it's going to loom larger and larger in our calculus of risk as well as opportunities.", "Today, we're not seeing anything impacting our business. The GSEs are open. The rates are attractive, and we think we are going to take advantage of that window by moving a lot of our portfolio into the sales window, and take advantage of that interest rate environment on the sales front.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jana Galan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "You mentioned deleveraging would be a priority. Can you talk about some goals or targets of where you'd like to get to on the different leverage metrics you laid out?", "Tom Toomey", "I think it's a long-term directional goal. And I'm not really set on a set of numbers or specific metrics. When I look at the balance sheet today, I look at a laddered maturity schedule that feels very good and overall cost of debt inside of 4.2%. And look at the financial flexibility of the enterprise, I think we're right about average on most metrics and above average on debt-to-EBITDA.", "But overtime, I think we'll just drive that down. David mentioned in his remarks about the progress we've made over the last couple of years. I don't think we'll try to do some big transaction, if you will, to fix it overnight. I think we'll going to continue to make slow steady progress on that front. And we think that's a prudent balance when managing a balance sheet.", "Jana Galan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And I apologies, if you said this, but I wanted to clarify, is there any new acquisition functions in your 2012 FFO number?", "David Messenger", "There is not.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citi.", "Eric Wolfe - Citi", "I think you mentioned in your remarks that the acquisition equity guidance here can be market depending. Last year you gave us some specific numbers around that. Just curious, why you changed your approach this year? And secondly, how you think about 2012 might shape up from an acquisition perspective relative to 2011?", "Tom Toomey", "I think when we looked at the beginning of 2011 and we're formulating that game plan about what to do. We thought it was a great window of opportunity to buy that most people were not in the market, trying to buy the caliber of assets, and we think we've been rewarded by finding unique opportunities in that window. And Jerry and his team have delivered on those pro-forma, they've not exceeded them. And that's why we are aggressive in our guidance at the beginning of '11 related to acquisitions.", "As we start out in '12, our intentions turn more to what do we think the pricing of assets are for the sale side of the equations. And we're going to move more towards that initially at the year and I think we'll have success on the sales front.", "On the acquisition, we are continuing to look at the marketplace. It's hard for us to forecast and really see significant number of opportunities at this point, so we elected really to say, we'll look at it as they come up and weigh each of them individually. And again, look at them in light of what do we think we can do to improve the quality of the asset, garner better return out of it. And that's kind of our attitude right now about '12 acquisitions.", "Eric Wolfe - Citi", "And so you wouldn't see it as being, I mean you had a pretty busy year in 2011, so 2012 is the continuation of that or is it just you're trying to pick off assets here and there, and you're sitting or bossing. Just trying to understand how busy I think this year could be relative to 2011?", "Tom Toomey", "A lot of the activity in '11 was big, because we had a couple of successful relationships and we were buying from a lot of private individuals. And those individuals are not forced to sale, so they kind of elect, both on a relationship and a trust basis to sale. And I think that's kind of the environment. Harry, anything you'd add?", "Harry Alcock", "We're in the market on a regular basis and as you know acquisitions are sort of opportunistic by nature. To the extent we find transactions that we feel good about, we certainly will be willing to pull the trigger as we did in '11. I mean, if you remember when we started '11, we didn't expect to complete the level of activity that we did, but again on an opportunistic basis we're in the market we find deals that we ended up closing.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Paula Poskon with Robert W. Baird.", "Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird", "I want to come back to the G&A question from earlier. Specifically what drove the much lower G&A in the fourth quarter relative to the other three quarters of 2011? And then looking ahead for 2012, how much of the drop in G&A that you're expecting is attributable to the reallocation of staff?", "David Messenger", "When looking at Q4 versus Q3, couple I know is going to jump out. First, we had an extremely busy year in the first nine months, first three quarters and a significant portion of our acquisition's debt, equity and sales marketing efforts were undertaken and completed. So accordingly the bulk of the incentive comp for the company was accrued during that timeframe, so there was really a little that had to be accrued in the fourth quarter.", "We had several severance contracts and consulting contracts went up in the third quarter that weren't present in the fourth quarter. And then getting to your second point, we also started capitalizing more of the costs in the fourth quarter to our development and redevelopment pipeline, as those have started to take shape and have nearly doubled over the course of the last year or so. I'll have to get back to you on an exact number for capitalizing costs, so we haven't previously disclosed that.", "Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird", "And then just one other question. Just broadly speaking, what are you seeing in terms of trends in hard construction costs? And also are you seeing any increased difficulty in getting plans approved or projects through the local municipalities just because they are getting overloaded relative to their staffing?", "Harry Alcock", "With respect to construction cost, I think construction activity just in general the levels remained weak by historical standards. There have been some upward pressure on commodity and material prices. In general, construction prices have increased moderately, perhaps 3% or so. So I think that answers part one.", "In terms of part two, the types of markets, there are a couple of different things. One, many of the projects that are in our guidance for 2012, we either have approvals or are near the point where we can put shovel in ground. And in terms of those where we are sort of starting from scratch and working through a new entitlement process, we haven't noticed any particular slowdown in terms of the processing time for these types of deals. A lot of the markets that we're building in, inevitably have longer approval or lead time process, just given the types of markets that they are in.", "Operator", "Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.", "Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets", "I just want to go back to the comments you put on the last conference call. I just want to see if it's still the case. You talked about last time funding development and redevelopment with proceeds from dispositions and funding acquisitions with new issuance. Is that still the plan as you're looking into 2012?", "Tom Toomey", "Yes, Mike, that's currently the plan. And you can see that pretty much they match up at this present time, and the walk-forward that David provided in his comments. We've got about $500 million in development and redevelopment spend plan for the year. And Harry is out marketing a number of communities and we gave guidance of $400 million to $600 million on the sales front.", "Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets", "So that doesn't include those acquisitions?", "Tom Toomey", "No.", "Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets", "I am sorry, joint venture acquisitions, so that wouldn't be defined as an acquisition?", "Tom Toomey", "It's very hard for us to forecast our joint venture partner's appetite or success rate on acquisitions. If they come to the market certainly we'll be telling you about them and fund them accordingly.", "Mike Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets", "Second, can you give an update on the performance of the Hanover portfolio in the fourth quarter? And just curious what you define is below average for D.C. in 2012 as you can kind of walk us through what your expectations are for that market just given the supply pressure that we are seeing there?", "Jerry Davis", "The MetLife portfolio, I don't have the fourth quarter numbers with me. But I can tell you for the year, we exceeded our budget that we underwrote that deal at by 12% and it did pick up steam later in the year. We would expect in 2012 for those MetLife properties to do better than our same-store pool still because there continues to be more opportunities for revenue growth, whether it's continued concession burn off or just rent growth. And as far as D.C., I would tell you we're looking at D.C. probably in the 4.5% to 5% range for revenue growth this next year.", "Mike Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets", "And then finally just can you give us an update as to what you're expecting on the real estate tax front built into the guidance?", "Jerry Davis", "Sure. A large portion of the portfolio in California were at the 2% for Prop 13, but when you look at it when did throughout the portfolio, it's up in the roughly 5% to 5.5% range. Most of the pressure is coming from Virginia as well as Florida.", "Mike Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets", "And I'm assuming that's a same-store number that doesn't include the revaluations for acquisitions done last year at some of the markets like New York, Boston?", "Jerry Davis", "That's true. That is a same-store number.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Derek Bower with UBS.", "Derek Bower - UBS", "Just on the performance of the A's versus B's of the 300 basis points. Can you talk about which markets maybe more pronounced and others not widening and what your sense maybe for how wide that break could get in 2012?", "Jerry Davis", "In the fourth quarter the spreads, like you said, was 300 basis points. And the markets where you really saw the larger spreads were predominantly San Francisco, Seattle. The markets where you didn't see as much of a spread tended to be more in the Washington D.C. area, because new supply has affected our downtown inside the Beltway markets and outside the Beltway did better and that's where our B product is located.", "So those would be the two outliers whether it's the best door or worse. And how large of a spread do I think that will get to be? It's hard to tell. I could see it getting a little bit more, but probably not markedly.", "Derek Bower - UBS", "And, Tom, back to you remarks earlier on the call on rolling the enterprise. Can you give us a sense for how large and if there is any target size you have for your portfolio? And is there a number out there might be too big?", "Tom Toomey", "Derek, that's a very, very thoughtful question. And one that the management and the Board have undertaken as part of our strategic plan and review in 2012 is to revisit the size and shape of the enterprise. So we'll probably be able to give you more color later in the year on the subject. But it's certainly one that we feel good about getting into what turns out to be a $10 billion enterprise and managing $4 billion of JVs. So certainly, we have the management talent and scale to manage a larger enterprise. But how big and where is that right balance is something that we're just undertaking this year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.", "Alex Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill", "Just going back to the dividend, you guys in the fourth quarter increased it 7.5%, so it sounds like you're increasing another just over 2%. As the Board thinks about the dividend, what changed from last time they met when they raised it to the subsequent quarter, they raised it just a little bit again? Was there something that changed or were you guys waiting to finalize like taxable income?", "David Messenger", "The increase in the dividend for 2012 compared to 2011, there is 10% from $0.80 to $0.88. The change we made really this time was to make sure we're paying it out quarterly versus the staggered payouts that we did during 2011 of the $0.185 and $0.20 and $0.215. But the Board looks at this, management looks at this dividend, and always considers taxable income and cash flow of the enterprise, and so the 10% increase on a year-over-year basis to $0.88 per share was appropriate.", "Alex Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill", "But from the last time, I'm just curious, I mean you guys raised it 7.5%, which is meaningful. But the additional amount, I'm just trying to understand, if there was something new that the Board considered or if there was just as the books closed for yearend. Just trying to assess where the taxable income stands? And then also curious where the new dividend rate compares to taxable income.", "Tom Toomey", "Couple of parts in that Alex. First, management and the Board weighed what our growth prospects were going into '12 and beyond in setting the new dividend, and feel comfortable that the level we've set. There is no taxable event or structuring needed at the end of the year to increase the dividend to ensure that we met both, the taxable minimum or to not become a tax payer if you will? So that's aspect.", "David Messenger", "With regard to where we are with the dividend compared to taxable income, we have not disclosed what our taxable income per share amount is.", "Alex Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill", "Then the second question is on the property tax. It's a two-parter. First of all, just as you've entered New York and you're now a 421a, if you can just remind us when the first year where you will experience the step-ups? And then the second was, your comments about Florida real estate taxes increasing and being a pressure point. I would've thought that, that would've been one of the parts to rebound, less, just given that rent growth in some of those northern markets has lagged some of the other parts of the country.", "Harry Alcock", "With respect to the New York City tax abatement. We have tax abatements that range from 10 years, to all the way up to 20 years. So, we will see that the abatement fades out over the course of the 20 years. So it's a long time. 2013 or 2014 is the first year where we'll get sort of the partial burn-off of any component of the abatement.", "Tom Toomey", "On the Florida, Alex, I can see your point. I would tell you that we will appeal anything we can, but right now what the consensus are showing is that heavy growth in Florida, as well as, again, the Virginian team. It's not surprising that D.C. and Baltimore pushed up ahead just like you said, because they were the first to rebound that didn't drop this far. Florida, over the past couple of years to municipalities have really have really come after us more on water rates than anything else, and it seems like their strategy this year is get more tax.", "Alex Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill", "Harry, what is the step-up in '13, '14? What's the amount or impact?", "Harry Alcock", "I don't know what the exact amount impact is, but it's sort of the first 20% of one of the properties they've waived in first half. So, it's not going to be any ruling sort of for it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.", "Robert Stevenson - Macquarie", "Tom, what do you think today sitting here the percent of your portfolio that you would classify as non-core?", "Tom Toomey", "Rob, I don't have the door counts, but with respect to value, we look at it and say it's somewhere between $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion. And if you look at where I and we as the management team size it, that's equivalent to about where we are in the development pipeline. And so our strategy over time is to sell assets and redeployment the new development and the development pipeline of '12 is over the next three years, that's kind of our horizon to dispose of that.", "Now, there will be some dilution as it relates to, we'll probably sell before the asset come online and stabilize, but we think that' a good prudent way to fund the development activities.", "Rob Stevenson - Macquarie", "Given the fact that a lot of these non-core assets are in core markets for you guys, I mean, do you have any desire to do sort of a disposition JV or are these likely to just be outright sales to maximize the value?", "Tom Toomey", "Rob, the vast majority are in tertiary markets that we'll probably exit, and I wouldn't see us joint venturing those. I would just see a whole effort to sell them. And we think the market is good for that today. I mean this capital environment as well as debt environment is very conducive to creating a wide range of auctions and a number of players to expose the assets to. So, I'm very comfortable with our ability to execute the sales at attractive prices.", "Rob Stevenson - Macquarie", "Then one quick one for Dave. Thanks for the additional disclosure. One quick question on the same-store guidance for '12; looks like the unit count is the same for '12 as it was in the fourth quarter. Is that just because you're expecting for whatever is rolling in to sell an appropriate number of assets this year in terms of units, or is there something else going on there?", "David Messenger", "I guess, are you asking are we forecasting sales coming out of the same-store numbers?", "Rob Stevenson - Macquarie", "No, no. For the '12 guidance, the same-store unit count is 38,680, which I believe is the same as the fourth quarter same-store number. Now, the reason why there is no additions to the same-store, no variance between that is because whatever you're rolling into the same-store bucket you're expecting the dispositions to be an equal number of units roughly, or is there something else going on there?", "David Messenger", "Everything that's in the same-store pool in the fourth quarter then goes into your 2012 year-to-date same-store pool. So, I don't think I'll a full year of comparison. And then we've got an additional attachment in the attachment seven that disclose each quarter as to when each asset will roll into the same-store bucket. So that way you can roll your quarter numbers. But I think where it was, we're getting hung up on this. And so we can take it offline is difference in the quarter pool and the year-to-date pool.", "Rob Stevenson - Macquarie", "Well, the 2012 pool. That is offline.", "David Messenger", "That's fine.", "Operator", "Swaroop Yalla with Morgan Stanley.", "Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley", "Jerry, can you give us an idea of your exposure to financial services employment in your Manhattan portfolio?", "Jerry Davis", "Absolutely, it varies really by submarket within Manhattan. When you look at the two deals we have done with Financial District, roughly 50% of our residents are in the financial industry. As you go to Rivergate which is Murray Hill, Chelsea and then up to Columbus Square, it's more in the 15% to 25% range.", "Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley", "That's helpful. And then, in terms of the dispositions, did you guys talk about the markets that you're looking to make these dispositions and also you can give us some idea of the timing of these? I mean, should we be modeling sort of equally over the quarters, or is any timing we should be thinking about?", "Harry Alcock", "The markets are going to be our non-core tertiary markets, and by and large we didn't give any specific guidance, but that will give you sense as to what we're talking about. In terms of the timing, we've got a couple of deals tied up now that it could close in the first three or four months of the year. I think we expect most of the balance to close in the first half of the year. It could be some inevitably that they carry into the second half. But generally, the disposition should be relatively front-loaded.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "So, Tom, if you could get a hypothetical great transaction for your Southeastern region, your Southwestern region and sell all or most of that portfolio, would that be a good transaction for you? Or do you think still, because you guys seem to be leaning towards these higher barrier markets, Northern markets. I mean, is that something that you think still adds value to the story, those kind of low barrier regions?", "Tom Toomey", "There is couple of different questions inside of it, Rich. I mean, certainly for us, any offer that we receive for any asset is always considered. And if we were to receive an offer of substance and size for a particular portfolio or region, there's no question we would weigh it. If it's in our long-term plan to dispose of it. And so that's kind of part of what Harry and the entire acquisition and disposition team is doing, is exposing a lot to the market and see what we get. So, we are not afraid of selling assets.", "And as you recall in 2007 and 2008, we sold 25,000 apartment homes and about a third of the enterprise because we thought it was a great time to unload those assets and it turned out to be very fortuitous and in the sense that we headed just about the right window.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "So if I were to guess though in that transaction, if there is one thing you would have like to done to that transaction is maybe had more of the Florida element involved in the fail, is that accurate? I'm not suggesting you ever told me that but I just feel like maybe that's your past year, is that about right?", "Tom Toomey", "Well, the first thing you're testing is my memory which over the year is saved but on the long-term aspect of looking at it, if we've asked ourselves several times and looking at that transaction that we would have sold more. And what we really thought about when we sized it and shaped it, was both the element of where we would go with the dividend and the coverage of the dividend as well as asset pricing. And it turns out we've got it about half right. We had the right asset pricing, right window to sell but the truth is we didn't forecast the economy dropping as perceived those we did.", "And ultimately a year later we had to cut the dividend. And I don't regret the decision. Florida at the time we thought would weather a better storm. We thought there was some more value to wrung out. And the truth is here we are five years later and Florida is still has not bounced back. And I think we'll probably see some of our asset dispositions in the Florida this cycle.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Just quickly a couple of question, this is on the joint venture. Did you say that you can't gauge the appetite of MetLife in future activity but you did say you expect to do more? So can you provide any color on how big the future business could be with MetLife?", "Tom Toomey", "Well, in the case of Met, I can't really speak on behalf of Met with respect to their goals and aspirations and pricing. What we have is a very good working relationship. And we talk about individual communities and portfolios that are in the market today as well as may come to the market. And I think they are very astute buyers of real estate. And they'll have their own sense of price, we'll have ours and we'll compare in those. But I would say that their overall tenure is towards growing their multi-family platform.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "In Southeast?", "Tom Toomey", "That wouldn't be fair for me to speculate what market.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "And then lastly on the Kuwait Finance House, I'm just curious, is there anything unique about having them as a partner, anything cultural? I mean, are they nice people?", "Tom Toomey", "Rich, I mean, anybody you pick as a partner is always nice people.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "But I mean it's just your typical joint venture. It's not anything unique about because it is kind of unique type of partner I guess I would say?", "Tom Toomey", "Well, I think they are obviously, sure we are compliant, and they are very proud/compliant investor and prudent. They've been investing in United States for many, many years, and they have been successful at it. So, we find them very engaging, thoughtful, and a very strategic partner to have.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tom Trujillo with Bank of America.", "Tom Trujillo - Bank of America", "I appreciate your comments to Jana about your future de-leveraging being more kind of directional and opportunistic and goal-oriented, and I know that's hard to forecast acquisitions in 2012. But can you just provide some comments on potential sources of financing should your acquisitions exceed your divestitures?", "So, if you need additional capital, do you see using the equity market, preferred debt, either secured or unsecured and kind of what you're seeing out of pricing in each of those markets?", "Tom Toomey", "Hey Tom, this is Dave. I think that when we look at future acquisitions and whenever there is an additional need that arises, we look at all sources of capital, and determine at that time what is best for pricing, what is best for long-term growth of the enterprise, and so there may be points in time where unsecured offerings make more sense, while there will be other times where we're going to fund more with equity than we would with debt.", "From an unsecured standpoint, we're looking to continue to bring down our secured leverage and you've seen us access the unsecured markets more frequently than the secured. Unsecured basis we're probably around 4% type number on 10-year paper, and equity is what is trading at today.", "I think we've been pretty vocal in saying that we would fund more of the acquisitions with equity and debt and that we also always have the opportunity to look at the wide array of capital market, I guess products that are out there; being an investment-grade rated company.", "Operator", "Mark Fisher with Bloomberg.", "Mark Fisher - Bloomberg", "This is question for Harry. I'm just wondering if you can talk about acquisition cap rates in 2012, and what you're seeing. Whether you think that cap rates will continue to compress at current levels or if you think they'll level off?", "Harry Alcock", "In terms of acquisition cap rates for the core products that we've been looking at, my general assumption is that the cap rates will be relatively stable throughout the year. These types of assets are influenced significantly by changes in interest rates if buyers tend not to capitalize purchase with nearly as much debt.", "In terms of the non-core product perhaps that we're selling, again, I think cap rates are probably going to move generally sideways and interest rates remain low. Buyers are still underwriting sort of properties with good fundamentals and expect cap rates to remain generally low.", "Mark Fisher - Bloomberg", "And then you guys gave disposition cap rates of 6% to 6.5%; I'm just wondering, given that that's funding your development, what the dilution will be from development in terms of the timing when it bleeds into your portfolio in terms of sale. Are you going to sell these as you need the money for funding for redevelopment, or is there going to be a mismatch of funding there?", "Tom Toomey", "Mark, this is Toomey. There's probably a mismatch. I think the sales will probably be more frontloaded, the development dollars will be even throughout the year. And realize that the development dollars are going to assets under construction. So there inherently is no cash flow coming back from that constructing activity. So that's a big part of the dilution we are taking in the short run. But in the long-run, the caliber of assets, the growth rate of new asset and the market composition of them should far and exceed the assets that we are selling. So that's kind of our plan for '12.", "Mark Fisher - Bloomberg", "And then lastly, on your CapEx spend. You guys have $1,150 a unit priced in and that's up from $1,081 last year. I'm just wondering, where that number goes and how of that is being impacted by the new non-same-store pool that's coming in, given the higher cost markets that they are in?", "Tom Toomey", "You hit it on the head. A lot of it is, it's a different portfolio than we've had for the last couple of years, and whether it's a high rise or a mid rise, you have a lot of systems that cost more than a basic garden community to take care of, as well as the common areas, the amenity base when people are paying rents that are in New York, up in the $3,000 to $4,500 range, the upkeep is more timely. So, most of it is due to the change in the portfolio.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Taylor Schimkat with KBW.", "Taylor Schimkat - KBW", "Just one question guys. Going back to dispositions, it looks like a chunk of the 2011 dispositions where newer properties developed through RE3. Looking forward at 2012, what does the mix look like between newer assets in secondary markets than older assets? And then secondly, could you comment on the expected cap rate spread between those newer and older assets if that's appropriate.", "Harry Alcock", "In terms of the characterization of the properties that we're selling in 2012, a majority of the properties will be our, call it, the non-core assets in these tertiary markets that the age will vary, but it will not be weighted in any particular way towards newer assets. So, inevitably there will be some in those sales.", "In terms of newer versus older, it depends on so many things, including whether there's a rehab component in terms of the quality of the sub market et cetera. I mean, in general, particularly new assets will trade at lower cap rates than older assets, but it gets a little hard to generalize because you have to look at sort of the really micro aspects of the deal on a property by property basis.", "Operator", "We have a follow-up question from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citi.", "Eric Wolfe - Citi", "Just one quick clarification. I think you mentioned in your remarks that your anticipated de-leveraging was fully in guidance and does that mean do you have some equity issuance in guidance or is it just the dispositions that you're talking about there?", "David Messenger", "On the disposition guidance, we don't have any additional equity in our guidance numbers other than the shares issued to the ATM in January that were disclosed.", "Operator", "Okay thank you. And there are no further questions. Please proceed.", "Tom Toomey", "Well, I thank all of you for your time this morning. And as you can tell, 2011 was a very, very good year for UDR. And that we accomplished many of our strategic goals. And as we look at 2012, we feel very good about the business on the ground from an operating and from an opportunity standpoint.", "And I believe that we will advantage of those as they present themselves. We have a very good sound management group, execution team on the ground. And it's reflected both in our guidance as well as our increasing of our dividend. So, we think we're off to a great start in '12 and looking forward to it. With that, we'll close and thank you for your time again.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes UDRs fourth quarter conference call.

Welcome to UDR's 2Q \u201812 Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only-mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be opened for questions. (Operator instructions). This conference is being recorded today, Monday, July 30, of 2012.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chris Van Ens, Vice President of Investor Relations. ", "Christopher G. Van Ens ", "Thank you for joining us for UDR's second quarter financial results conference call. Our second quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed earlier today and posted to our website, www.udr.com. In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements.", "I would like to note that statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in this morning's press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.", "When we get to the question-and-answer portion, we ask that you be respectful of everyone's time and limit your questions and follow-ups. Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered on the call.", "I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.", "Thomas W. Toomey ", "Thank you, Chris, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to UDR's second quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Jerry Davis, Senior Vice President of Operations, who will discuss our results, as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock who will be available to answer questions during the Q&A portion of the call.", "My comments today will focus on three topics; first, broad operating trends and our quarterly results; second, our business plan update; and finally, an update on our CFO search. Following my comments, Jerry will provide additional commentary on the operating results and emerging operating trends.", "During the quarter our business continued to operate at high level, driven by accelerating new and renewal rental rate growth as well as stable occupancy. Multi-family supply and demand fundamentals continue to provide a strong tailwind for apartment owners and we expect will do so for a number of years to come. And especially for those REIT with portfolios concentrated in markets that exhibit above average job growth, low single-family home affordability, a high propensity to win and limited new multi-family supply pressure.", "In the second quarter of 2012, core FFO per share of $0.33 increased by 3% year-over-year. Strong year-over-year same-store revenue and net operating income growth of 5.6% and 6.7% respectively, as well as solid execution in our non-same-store portfolio, drove the improvement. Offset by dilution from our late May secondary equity offering. Second, a business plan update. Creating shareholder value remains our top priority.", "As such we will continue to focus on growing NAV per share and on increasing our cash flow per share, which in turn supports dividend growth. Increasing top line growth and expanding operating margins are low risk, insistent generators of NAV growth per share. Our strong operating platform has historically been one of UDRs hallmarks and we expect will continue to be our primary driver of NAV creation moving forward.", "Capital allocation is the second variable in NAV growth equation. Over the past few years our portfolio quality and footprint has improved dramatically, primarily the result of purposeful repositioning into coastal gateway markets, while simultaneously selling suburban locations and non-core markets. Some comments with regard to these activities.", "First, acquisition activity. We intend to further expand our presence in our core markets over time. Markets that exhibit above average job growth, low home affordability, a high propensity to rent and limited new multifamily supply pressures. The capitalization of any future acquisition will be determined in the context of a lower leveraged operating model, but currently there are limited number of deals that fit our acquisition criteria.", "Second, disposition activity. We are on a number of communities located in non-core markets, but not all non-core markets are equivalent in our view. Let me break them down. We have several markets that do not fit our long-term operating plan and we intend to exit them over the next 12 to 18 months. Combined, these markets represent $200 million to $400 million of value, minimal when compared to our total enterprise value.", "Beyond these, we operate in a number of geographies that do not fit our long-term plan, but serve as warehouses of capital until sold. These market would comprise the majority of our non-core portfolio are more susceptible to new supply and generate lower rents and margin than our coastal market. Some of these markets include Florida and Nashville, are generating solid results currently. We are in no hurry to sell these assets and these solid performers. Their ultimate disposition will depend on potential use to the proceeds, asset pricing and the cost of alternative capital sources at the time of sale. When the time is right these depositions will be consummated in the usual course of business and will represent normal capital recycling.", "Moving on to development and redevelopment. We intend to deliver roughly 5% of the enterprise annually; this implies the development and redevelopment pipeline into $1 billion to $1.5 billion range, versus our current pipeline of $1 billion. When assuming a constant dollar funding approach, and a two to four-year average construction cycle. First, development, new development is an attractive option to drive external growth whereas acquisitions are often event-driven and therefore their timing is difficult to predict.", "Development represents relatively predictable capital investment. Our current $742 million pipeline is 45% funded and 80% of it is scheduled to be delivered by the end of 2013. With stabilized yields the 100 basis points to 150 basis points above spot cap rates on average. We are confident in the value creation these project represent and will continue to target core coastal markets for future expansion.", "Second, redevelopment. Redevelopment often is minimized in our prepared remarks but should not \u2013 given it's important to our business as well as significant value creation potential. Our current $279 million pipeline is 15% funded and 35% of it is scheduled to be delivered by the year end 2013. We continue to evaluate our existing portfolio for redevelopment opportunities and have identified candidates located in key markets including Southern California, Washington D.C. and San Francisco.", "One final point on redevelopment. Our projects go beyond simple kitchen and bath upgrades. When redeveloping a community our objective is twofold; we aim to meaningfully grow rental rate while also achieving cap rate compression through asset quality improvement. All of our redevelopments are significant undertaking.", "Moving on to cash flow per share growth. We expect that our improving operation as well as real estate investment we've made over the past three years will drive growth in years ahead.", "With regard to the balance sheet, we've reached peer average leverage metrics following our late May equity offering in the subsequent community disposition activity. We have worked diligently over the past three years to deleverage our balance sheet and do not intend to re-risk it, even as we continue to examine growth opportunity, we expect that this strategy will yield dividends moving forward, especially in more volatile economic times.", "Finally, our CFO search has progressed. We have retained an executive search firm. We understand the importance of filling this position in a timely manner, but we also have the necessary skill set at UDR to wait for the right hire. To summarize all aspects of our business continue to perform well.", "With that, I\u2019ll pass the call over to Jerry.", "Jerry A. Davis ", "Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. We\u2019re pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. In the second quarter, same-store and operating income grew 6.7%, driven by 5.6% year-over-year increase in revenue and somewhat offset by expense growth of 3.3% versus last year at this time, same-store income per occupied home increased by 5.6% to $1,330 while same-store occupancy remained flat at 95.8%.", "As we indicated on our first quarter conference call, 2012 is unfolding according to plan. In the second quarter, effective rental rate increases on new leases at our same-store communities accelerated 4.5% on average. Renewal rate growth remained comparable versus previous quarters averaging 6.5% higher per year. Accounting for approximately 31% of our same-store NOI, San Francisco, Boston, Austin, Dallas and Orange County were our best-performing same-store markets during the quarter, delivering weighted average revenue growth of 8.5% year-over-year.", "Market such as other Mid-Atlantic, Sacramento markets and Monterey Peninsula struggled, contributed a relatively minimal 9% of same-store NOI in the second quarter. Weighted average revenue growth for these markets was 0.4% year-over-year. Resident turnover remains relatively contained at an annualized rate of 58% for the second quarter, 300 basis points higher than last year at this time. Importantly the pace at which we've been able to refill move out has not slowed.", "Turning to the performance of our non-same-store wholly-owned communities. 4,600 homes are approximately 65% of our total non-mature pool were stabilized during both the first and second quarters of 2012. These 14 communities generated sequential revenue growth of 3.6% during the second quarter, far outperforming our same-store sequential revenue growth of 2.0%. Our non-mature communities now contribute 26% of NOI down from approximately 32% last quarter. As 2012 progresses we expect this to decline to approximately 15% of NOI by year-end.", "As you can see on Attachment 7(NYSE:C) Highlands and Marin, a redevelopment located near San Francisco and (indiscernible), the first phase while the Vitruvian Park project both entered our same-store pool during the second quarter. Another 2,350 non-mature homes around our same-store portfolios by year-end 2012. These are primarily located in higher growth markets including Washington D.C., San Francisco, Boston and New York and have a weighted average income per occupied home of 2,185 in the second quarter. By year-end 2012 these additions should increase our same-store income per occupied home to roughly 1,385 all else being equal. Additional details can be found on attachment 7(NYSE:B) of our quarterly supplement.", "A brief update on New York. As many of you head during our Columbus Square property tour, our Manhattan acquisitions are still generating above market rate rent growth, the blended new and renewal leases increasing 8% to 12%. This level of growth has not impacted occupancy which averaged approximately 96% during the quarter. The Rivergate redevelopment is progressing and we have 33 homes through the end of second quarter and achieved rent increases in line with expectation.", "Moving on, I want to address the question that I\u2019m frequently asked. What is the next six to nine months or longer looked like from an operations perspective? The dominate thing that we have seen over the past few quarter continue to hold true with our view that apartments still has a good runway for growth over the coming years.", "First, we expect the general economic recovery to remain choppy, but many of our markets should continue to exhibit incremental steady growth. Year-to-date the majority of our core markets have generated job growth above the national average. Second, demand for apartments remains robust, especially in urban coastal markets. In addition more cyclical geographies such as Florida and Texas are generating improved results.", "Finally, new multifamily supply. Typically new supply has been a predominant driver behind a slowdown in rental rate growth as the recovery progresses. However, new multifamily supply pressures still appear moderate, deliveries is this year and next are expected to be below or at worst near historical averages in many of our markets. The single family rental market has not negatively impacted our business, now you will not see this as a significant risk given our substantially reduced exposure to markets with high single-family affordability. In short, we continue to see a good runway for growth in the multi-family space over the near and in immediate term.", "Turning to more recent results. Through the majority of July renewals continue to trend well, up 6.7% or 60 basis points above last July's result. Renewal increases sent out for the remainder of the third quarter have averaged 6.5%, and we expect to capture close to all of this increase as is generally the case. With occupancy holding close to 96%, we expect that third quarter results will be strong.", "A couple of words on expenses. You\u2019ll notice that year-to-date same-store expense growth of 1.6% is still below our 2012 guidance of 2% to 3% growth. We continue to believe that our guidance will prove accurate, expense comps toughen in the second half of the year. Turnover is expected to incrementally increase and higher real estate taxes are expected to hit.", "As a reminder, we provided updated 2012 guidance at June NAREIT conference. These expectations can be found in our second quarter press release published this morning. Assuming no further equity raises for the balance of the year our 2012 fully diluted share count will be approximately 252.7 million.", "Finally, I would like to direct everyone's attention to a couple of new attachments in our quarterly supplement. First, on Attachment 4(B) you\u2019ll see a debt covenant analysis. Second, you\u2019ll see a new development layout on Attachment 9(NYSE:A) which better illustrate redevelopment versus the under construction project.", "With that operator, I\u2019d like to open the call up for questions.", "Question-And-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and Gentlemen, at this time we will begin the question and answer session. (Operator instructions). One moment please for our first question. Our first question comes from the line of Jana Galan, with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Jana Galan - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to get a little bit more detail on the turnover and if you are seeing any changes based on reasons for a move out or maybe elevated turnover in geographies versus others?", "Jerry A. Davis ", "Sure. This is Jerry. We are seeing reasons for turnout. They are pretty consistent with what they have been. Move outs to home purchase is up about 100 basis points from where it\u2019s been running at about 13%, and the markets you are really seeing that in for the most part are the locations like Austin, Nashville, Richmond, the Inland Empire and one surprising one where we are seeing an increased move out to home purchases in Boston. Most of our West Coast markets, with the exception of San Diego, are still seeing move out to home purchase under 10%. So, West Coast affordability is still difficult for most of our renters. And when you look at move outs to rent increase, it's been growing each of the last probably five quarters and today it stands at about 8%. One area that we have seen a slight reduction year-over-year in move out reasons is money issues, which is skips evictions, lost jobs things like that. And markets where we\u2019re seeing an increase in front over to the first six months, they are predominantly in the West Coast markets where we\u2019ve had quite a bit of pricing power. And -- So, we've been increasing people over the last two to three years and those happen to be the markets where three years ago our peak to trough rents dropped the most, so your B renter was able to move into an A property or your C renter was able to move into a B, and now we\u2019ve escalated rents to a level where they\u2019ve gone back to where that was before.", "Jana Galan - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch ", "Thank you, Jerry. And I believe in your prepared remarks you said you expected to continue to increase in the back half of the year. Do you mean higher than this kind of 58% level or is it just the year-over-year turnover that\u2019s increased?", "Jerry A. Davis ", "No, I think year-over-year turnover for the year is probably going to be three to four basis points over what it was last year, which will put us in that probably 55% to 56% for the year. Third quarter historically is our highest turnover quarter. So it usually gets north of 60 on an annualized basis, but then it comes down significantly as you get into the fourth quarter.", "Jana Galan - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Karin Ford, with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Hi good morning. I wanted to ask Tom about a comment in your press release where you said most of the heavy lifting on de-levering and repositioning are behind us. Can you just talk about where you see UDR when you say most? What type of percentage that means for each one of those activities where we are today?", "Thomas W. Toomey ", "Certainly Karin, and good morning. With respect to the portfolio when we look at it, we start with its $12 billion enterprise today and our portfolio in the Southeast, which is somewhere, around 12%, 15% of the enterprise is a portfolio that\u2019s performing very well. Strong NOI growth this recent quarter and we expect that to continue over time, but it probably doesn't fit the long long-term aspect of where we would like to be, which is basically from DC to Boston and the West Coast. And so as a result, we view it as a warehouse piece of capital that over time if opportunities are found, developments are completed, we\u2019ll look at the pricing that we can achieve in that portfolio and then redeployed the capital into there. So we are looking at it as relatively a static $12 billion enterprise and asking ourselves, when do we and how do we move out of those markets? And we feel no rush, in fact the performance and where it looks like we\u2019ll probably hang on to them for some extended period of time, but it\u2019s a directional aspect and I would not probably see us be an active seller of those anytime soon. Jerry or Harry, would you add anymore to that?", "Jerry A. Davis ", "Well the market started talking about the South Eastern markets, and we are talking about three major cities that are Nashville, Tampa, Orlando, I think they had same-store NOI growth of about 9%, interest rates are low there continue to be investor interest. So to the extent, we do decided to sell those markets in the future. We expect that to be very liquid markets. There are a couple of markets that we would expect to probably sell in the short-term. We are done for the year given for a variety of reasons, but as we look into the relatively near-term, there are a couple of markets that we probably look to exit that might be to $200 million to $400 million in total.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Great. And just on the delivering front as well, following the equity deal and the portfolio of sales. Now where do you think you are versus your plan today?", "Thomas W. Toomey ", "I think we are in line with our peer group and our intent is to stay in line with the peer group and any activity undertaken in the future will be to continue to be in line with the peers. So I don't think you\u2019ll see us make dramatic moves one way or another the natural growth of the cash flow of the enterprise will help. In addition as we refinance maturing debt will help, but we are comfortable continuing to be in line with the peer group.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe, with Citi Group. Please go ahead.", "Eric Wolfe \u2013 Citi Group", "Hi, thanks. Just a question on your operating guidance. It looks like you are expecting around 5.5% revenue growth this year. So I just wanted to sort of break it down in terms of the different components and see what your expectations are. It would sound like from your commentary that you are sort of expecting this mid-6 renewal rate, this kind of growth continuing mid-4s on new leases and sort of flattish growth on occupancy. Is that pretty much what you are expecting for the balance of the year?", "Jerry A. Davis ", "Yeah. I would say that's what I am expecting for third quarter. I think when you get to fourth quarter, if history repeats the way it has the last two to three years you will see the new lease rate growth decelerate down to the 2% range. I think the renewals do tend to stay fairly strong that this year our expectation is to back down a hair on the renewal increases probably starting in October. So, instead of being in that 6, 6.5 range I think we are going to get down more in line into the 5.5 because last year we saw our occupancy in 4Q dropped to 95.1. Our preference is to keep occupancy north of 95.5. But this is pretty normal seasonality, but yeah the midpoint of the guidance is 5.5, that's where we are at right now. I continue to see strength in most of our markets and very little deceleration.", "Eric Wolfe \u2013 Citi Group ", "Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then you mentioned that some of your non-core markets were performing very well. I think you said 9% same-store NOI growth. Is it surprising to you that these markets are doing so well, even though they don\u2019t have a lot of the characteristics that you would seem to want in markets that presumably obviously the most obvious is, home ownership is quite much more affordable. So, I\u2019m just curious if that's surprising to you at all and whether that makes you more inclined to kind of keep a decent percentage of those non-core markets in your portfolio over the long-term?", "Thomas W. Toomey ", "Eric, this is Tom and then I\u2019ll ask Jerry to comment as well. My view, over the long period time, you look at those markets and they are bouncing off the bottom. In case of Florida, it was five years of down trending on rent and NOI growth and now it\u2019s coming back up and it probably has a good two to three year run in it. But in that time frame development pipelines will start to rebuild rapidly and will represent a threat to the long-term value of those assets. And so for us, I think, we\u2019re going to ride the cash flow up and then we'll look at it, and ask ourselves when are they are going to get threatened by supply or any other economic downturn that may occur there, and we\u2019ll timeout our exit and repositioning of those dollars accordingly.", "Jerry A. Davis ", "I would agree. There is very little supply coming into those markets. When you look at the long-term average, for example, when Nashville is to add almost 2% of supply a year and over the next year it\u2019s only going to add about 1.4%, and you look at that same metric in Tampa. Tampa usually adds almost 2%, it's looking like they\u2019ll add 1.2%. And then Orlando typically adds just under 3% a year, and it\u2019s only going to add 1.2%. So, very little new supply and I would say, in addition to what Tom said, in those markets we do have no exceptional management teams that probably outperform the market in general.", "Eric Wolfe \u2013 Citi Group", "Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Bragg, with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.", "David Bragg - Zelman & Associates ", "Hi, good morning. Just a couple extra questions here on the disposition plans that were outlined at the beginning. The $200 million to $400 million of near-term sales. Can you talk a little bit more about what markets those would be in?", "Thomas W. Toomey ", "Yeah. This is Tom. I think they're going to continue to always look at what we can do with the Norfolk portfolio, the Sacramento portfolio. I mean we feel like we have assets there that are generating decent cash flows, but its tough when you have a boat go out and it takes \u2013 drops your occupancy from 97% to 90%. And that volatility to sustain cash flow growth and pricing power is awful hard to continue in that market. I think Jerry and his team done a great job of operating them. So we will see what they fetch in price and then if they don't, we are glad to run them and continue to generate the cash flow off of them.", "David Bragg - Zelman & Associates", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful and I think Jerry alluded to this, but are you currently marketing anything for sale now?", "Jerry A. Davis ", "No.", "David Bragg - Zelman & Associates ", "Okay. And last question is, under what scenario might we see you buy any assets in the next few quarters?", "Jerry A. Davis ", "Well I think that the scenario that would cause us to buy something would be finding the right asset and having the ability to capitalize that appropriately. So I think, look -- we are continually in the market looking at better deals like everyone else. We simply haven't found anything of size that we\u2019re comfortable with pricing or have been able to make a deal with the seller. In fact we brought a couple land parcels. We have got a couple smaller deals now that are really contiguous to existing properties so we can sort of obtain that at operating efficiency. But if you think about it, we haven\u2019t bought anything of size for several quarters, Columbus; we made that deal on the fourth quarter last year, closed in the first quarter this year. So we\u2019re continually out there looking, we just simply haven't found deals between these off-market deals that we like to look at and we just simply haven\u2019t been able to strike a deal with the seller.", "Thomas W. Toomey ", "David, what I would add is, our view of an ideal transaction would probably be something that is first off market adjacent to or very close to our existing communities where we have some operating efficiency that has a redevelopment potential, something we can look at over time horizon and have a very high comfort that both, we can grow NAV through one of our three metrics and drivers, which would be either ground-up development, the operating platform, or the redevelopment platform. And we are not going to find that in trying to win an option for Class A urban asset where a dozen people show up. And so hence we see them, but we were not overly engaged by them and don\u2019t see the upside for us or our shareholders in doing so. So I think we'll stay more focused in the off market and it\u2019s probably a quiet period, we anticipated it being a little bit more quiet. I think we\u2019ll be intrigued at what happens in the pending tax code and rate structure and if that triggers a selling window. But mostly the assets we\u2019re looking for aren\u2019t really going to be in that caliber. So I think you'll see a lot Bs come to the market, probably not stuff we are going to look at unless we really think it\u2019s well located and got to rehab. So I would expect us to be pretty quiet for the balance of the year on the acquisition front and we\u2019ll look at it from their next year and see how the market evolves.", "David Bragg - Zelman & Associates ", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just one last related question. Tom, you opened last call and you spoke about improving the portfolio both as it relates to the market mix but also urbanizing the portfolio itself within core markets. So we\u2019ve talked a lot on this call about the first part. Can you touch on the second and what markets that are core markets of yours would you like to urbanize the portfolio and how much work does that involve?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "That's just a long-term directional aspect of it. I tend to think when we look at our portfolio we really break down each market into quartiles of sub-markets and we stay very focused on wanting to be in the two upper quartiles and I think over time we'll continue to examine how those sub-markets evolve and position ourselves accordingly. It gives us what I'd call just a direction. Timing on exiting and urbanizing you know it is just part of normal capital recycling of the enterprise for us. We don't feel like that $12 billion (indiscernible) urgency to try to grow the enterprise significantly. We will naturally over time as the cash flows grow and the development, redevelopment activities come online but we are comfortable with our size and a steady growth trajectory. I think that's how I think about it and the Group thinks about. Anyone wants to add anything?", "David Bragg - Zelman & Associates", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Swaroop Yalla with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley", "Hi. Tom, you mentioned growing your development pipeline to 1.5 billion. If you can you talk about the markets where you're planning to do that. And also do you worry about the increase in supply effecting your development plan?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Well, I think for us when we look at the size and scope of the development pipeline, we look at the triangulation of our skill set, our capital structure, our debt maturities and maintaining financial flexibility and leverage of the enterprise. And so those will probably be the governor of how big of a development pipeline we\u2019ll get. The second, we\u2019ve of targeted initially at this space in the company at about $0.5 billion of annual delivery. We think that\u2019s prudent. On the specific market, we\u2019re certainly going to weigh what the supply threat looks like, but as a long-term value creator, long-term holder, you can\u2019t get swayed by what the next six months pipeline or year pipeline looks at. You have to look over the long period of time and then I think we\u2019ll just weigh through that factual discipline in determining where and when and how much our development shapes. ", "And I\u2019ll just remind just remind, I think one thing that does go unsaid very often is the redevelopment efforts that we undertake and the value creation in those. And you\u2019ve visited a number of our redevelopment efforts and you can classify them as much more than kitchen and bath. We\u2019re actually changing both the cash flow trajectory of the asset, but also the cap rate aspect of it. And we think there's a lot of value in that and that Southern California is a perfect example of that market where we can rehab and we do not lose all the cash flow or the community. We in fact retain a lot of the existing residents at the new higher rent and that's underway right now at Rivergate in New York and we\u2019re having a very good success there as well.", "Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley", "Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then Jerry, what percentage of NOI, the non-same-store pool would enter the same-store pool by 1Q. You guys have a good breakdown in the south now with the number of properties, but if you can just quantify the percentage of NOI which will enter by 1Q. I think that\u2019s when most of your New York assets enter the same store pool.", "Jerry A. Davis", "As of right now, 26% of our NOI is in non-same-store. By year-end non-same-store will be 15%. I don't have handy exactly what it will be in one quarter, but we can look that up and get back to you.", "Thomas W. Toomey", "It is fair to say that the entire portfolio is at about $1,500 a month in rent. And so we just kind of gravitate. If we don\u2019t do anything, it kind of rolls itself into and you\u2019ve got to be probably as you said over the next four quarters.", "Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paula Poskon with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.", "Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird", "Thanks. Good morning. A housekeeping question for you. What the amount of the one-time vesting charge in G&A?", "Warren L. Troupe", "Paula this is Warren. It was $3.8 million.", "Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird", "Thanks. And did you incur any one-time cost in relation to Dave Messenger\u2019s departure?", "Warren L. Troupe", "We had a very small associated with some stock that had vested during the quarter, not as a result of the departure but just normal vesting.", "Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay, thanks. And then what was the transaction that generated the gain in the TRS?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "It was Belmont.", "Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay, thank you. And then just a bigger quick picture question for Tom. Could you just give us a little bit more color on the CFO search? Are you already reviewing candidates? Are you seeing the breadth of \u2013 in-depth of quality and skill sets that you are hoping to see? Just kind of give us a little bit of color on where you are in the process?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Well, certainly, Paula. We\u2019ve engaged a search firm in that and we\u2019ve had a number of people come forth and offer themselves as candidate and we have looked at internal candidates and that process is really just beginning and we feel very comfortable with the executive group participating in that and the depth of the team and Mark Schumacher and his skills in the financial reporting area. So we feel like we can take our time and be very selective and thoughtful about the process and fell that we\u2019ll find the right person for the company.", "Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird", "And what are the defining characteristics of the right person given the blend of the skill sets you already have in the team?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Well, we would like a guy that could finish the 4 by 100 in the pool and win the gold. I think it\u2019s fair to say that there is a lot of characteristics we are going to look at. We are going to look at the entire attribute of the candidate, but it\u2019s really an opportunity for us as a Company to get somebody that\u2019s probably going to be active, engaged with the street in communication, but can go anywhere in the enterprise and make it more efficient, more profitable and culturally fit with this executive group and the Company\u2019s culture in the field. So I think those of the attributes to start. There are a lot of qualified people out there who will fit those and we\u2019ll just go through meticulously and get the right person for us.", "Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird", "Thanks Tom, appreciate that.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets", "Good morning. Jerry, first question. Can you give us the loss to lease statistic for the portfolio and also what your expectations are for D.C. just given the amount of supply coming online the second half of year?", "Jerry A. Davis", "Sure. Loss to lease at the end of the quarter, Mike, was 4.9%. That's down from the same time last year when it was I think high fives. So it's still maintaining at a good level and if you look at that blend really between my new leases and my renewals, it blends into that mid-fives range. So we feel good about that. D.C. for the remainder of year, we were, I guess little pleasantly surprised that we saw our year-over-year growth actually accelerate in second quarter versus first because a couple of our properties in Arlington had lease-ups that completed earlier in the first quarter so we didn't have that stress on us. There is a lot of new supply coming as you know in D.C. over the next 12 to 14 months. I think for the remainder of this year we'll stay probably in that 4% revenue growth range and I think we are going to be stressed a little bit as we get into 2013 in D.C. I don't think it's going to go negative, but my guess is that revenue growth will probably be about half of what it was this year.", "Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, appreciate the color there. I don't know if you look at it this way, but if you look at the non-same-store portfolio maybe adjusting for periods where you didn't own the assets, but do you have a same-store number, I mean a year-over-year growth number for the non-same-store portfolio kind of on a comparison basis?", "Jerry A. Davis", "We have tried so hard to figure out the best way to communicate that and we had difficulty going back to last year because in many cases we either didn't own the asset or so we don't have reliable financial data or it was \u2013 it wasn't mature yet and stabilized. So the metric we\u2019ve really try to use more to show is performance versus our same-store is to look at sequential data because it was typically stabilized in 1Q. When you look at that, our non-same-stores that were stabilized in 1Q were growing revenues at 3.6% and our same-store was going at two. So it\u2019s almost double the rate.", "Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Then finally just on the investment front and you guys talked not expecting a significant amount of acquisitions in the second half of the year. What should we expect in terms of development starts and also additional land investment?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "This is Tom. I think in our prepared remarks we\u2019ve described on a relative number of times between 70% and 80% of the development pipeline, redevelopment, so almost $1 billion. 70% to 80% of that will be delivered in the next \u2013 by the end of 2013. So if that comes out of the pipeline we\u2019ve got to add back into \u201814 and \u201815 deliveries. So we\u2019ll be looking at that and again kind of stay in that confines of about 500 million of annual delivery number. So that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be targeting and we think we have a pipeline that probably fits that, meaning the inventory that we already controlled and are just going through the process of defining scope, product and starts. So I think we are well on the way of being able to sustain that level without having to go into the market and finding new opportunities.", "Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. But your guidance for the second half of the year does contemplate additional starts, correct?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "No. It really doesn\u2019t \u2013 probably more of the guidance is what we\u2019re going to spend on the existing assets that are already underway. If we find, if we\u2019re able to finalize plans on some of the stuff that we're looking at today than obviously we will kick it into the start mode, but we\u2019re still in a steady mode on those and scope mode and just not prepared at this time to put forth exactly what will be built because we are still trying to figure that our self.", "Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets", "Fair enough. Appreciate the color. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie. Please go ahead.", "Robert Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie", "Good morning guys. Tom, just to follow-up on the last question. What\u2019s the level of land that you guys either option or controlling that\u2019s not appearing on the attachment 9A on the supplemental? How material is that?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Really the only other land parcels that we have that don\u2019t show up on the schedules are the land parcels that we own with MetLife. So there is 10 of those parcels remaining. Some of those we will develop over time. We have very small ownership interest, but in the future that could change.", "Robert Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie", "Okay. So the Wilshire and the 7 Harcourt plus what you've got left at Vitruvian, is basically the owned and then you\u2019ve got Beach Walk, Fremont and Pier 4 in Boston which are JV sites and outside of that your land that you control is relatively minor outside of that land?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Rob, I think you missed the Fremont site in San Francisco. We control that as well.", "Robert Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie", "Okay. All right. And then, Jerry, you had a comment early on about skips and evicts being pleasantly surprised there. Where is that that trending and has it been sort of consistent despite the \u2013 over the last few quarters despite what you've been seeing in terms of move out the financial reason?", "Jerry A. Davis", "Yeah. It typically runs for us at about 0.4% of potential rents and that\u2019s a long-term average. Last year in the quarter, I think it spiked up to 0.5%, maybe 0.6%, but we don\u2019t see that growing anymore. It\u2019s staying fairly stable and it\u2019s really sub-market driven and it hits as much harder at our lower rent markets than those tertiary areas.", "Thomas W. Toomey", "I would also add that, I think Jerry has done a great job of moving the vast majority \u2013 85%, 87% of the residents pay us online at the first of the month, so we are able to identify people that are going to struggle, are the slow pay piece and years gone past and including most of the private sector, you get that drift in by the 10th or the 15th of the month before you realize you have an issue and we pretty much know it by the third to fourth day of the month who is going to be a problem and you are able to jump on it by narrowing the bandwidth and excuses. So I think you can operate in that range and that electronic payment has helped us a great deal in that area.", "Robert Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie", "Is that going to be moving more now that you're in more urban areas like New York City where the eviction process is long and drawn-out and things of that nature? I believe Boston and other parts of California have issues as well. Does that change the dynamics there at all?", "Jerry A. Davis", "I don\u2019t think so, you are right, it\u2019s harder to get those guys out in places like New York, Boston and the West Coast. But I think as you go to a higher-end resident profile, they don\u2019t live as much paycheck-to-paycheck. So your better quality resident offset the more difficulty with the court systems.", "Robert Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie", "Okay. And then one just odd ball question. What\u2019s the relative number of corporate units in the portfolio these days?", "Jerry A. Davis", "It\u2019s probably \u2013 it\u2019s hard to get a totally accurate count. I think it\u2019s in the 2% to 3% range.", "Robert Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill", "Thank you. Good morning. First question; just going to the guidance for the rest of the year, I don't recall the $0.03 of RE3 gains being in the guidance before. Is there anything upcoming in the back half of the year like any other either RE3 or one-timer gains?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "This is Toomey. No.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill", "Okay. And was there a reason that that wasn't disclosed in the NARIET where you provided the full year guidance update. Was there any reason why that gain wasn't included on that page?", "Christopher G. Van Ens", "This is Chris. When we sold the Belmont there was the $0.03 of gain. There was $0.02 \u2013 a little over $0.02 of gains in our original guidance. So the difference there was not all that meaningful.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill", "Okay. And then second question is looking on the JV page Attachment 9B, if I just do the yield out of the various JVs, the MetLife I, the original Hannaford MetLife JV, the yield on that looks to be about 100 basis points lower than the second MetLife JV and the KFH. When do you think we would expect the first MetLife JV that yield to be more in line with the others?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "My view is that Met JV I is still in a transition period and that we are not done working with Met on that portfolio and what it will ultimately be for UDR. So, I think, it is premature to look at it or look at it in light of catching JV too, because it\u2019s in a state of evolution. Second aspect it is will improve as we just continue to operate the assets which are doing very well and that is very happy with as well. On KFH, I think after looking at it, adjusting for the management fee structure on that, returns will probably get better in that JV too. So, that one is probably just not a full complexion there. When you look at just the NOI, you have to really look at the fee structure that\u2019s also added to that and those are probably above 5, 5.5 range.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill", "Okay. But Tom, on the MetLife I, what are some of the things that you guys are doing that would improve, because I think you\u2019ve had it now for about two years or so. So what are the some of the things that would improve the yields as you guys manage that portfolio?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "I think one, the commercial space there\u2019s always the challenges that relates to the retail and getting tenants in there. The second is, we\u2019re continuing to refine and move those rents pretty rapidly and those improve as well and lastly is just a continued effort on the expense side. So, normal operation stuff that Jerry does day in and day out, we just see a pretty good expose trajectory out of those assets. And we continue to have a dialogue with Met on a wide range of things about what to do with JV I and we\u2019ll continue that dialogue and feel like it\u2019s going very well.", "Jerry A. Davis", "I would add Alex, there is probably two, maybe three assets in that Met I that completed lease up mid way to late last year with heavy concessions. So as you continue to have that concession burn off, that should garner some benefit over the next 12 months.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Hey, thanks. Tom, a question for you. I think the general population public that follows you trusts the Company. You've made some pretty substantial investments over the recent past in some of these core markets. And I think generally speaking, like I said, people have a trust for your Company and your decisions. But even Mickey Mantle struck out a few times. So I\u2019m curious, what could happen or what are you contemplating in growth going forward for these major investments, mainly acquisition for them to work out for you? Do you have any expectation for growth that you could share and what happens if rent growth decelerates substantially? Will they still make sense to you?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Well, Rich, a lot of different embedded questions inside of that and where I would start with is, I guess every one of them was undertaken with the thought that we could grow the value of the asset and add to the overall enterprise. And so in many cases you look at New York, we look at it at a point in time and say we think these assets have embedded operating efficiency which will get us over the initial low cap rate and Jerry has delivered on that. The second phase of that is that we think they are well located for future job growth and they are generally what I call a B type portfolio quality where high propensity to rent, job growth, lack of supply is going to drive outsized cash flow growth and our operating model is basically keeping them full and at higher rents. And lastly is looking at them for redevelopment efforts and that we feel like a lot of them are well located and that we can continue to add to capital to them and incrementally get outsized returns on that incremental capital for rehab and Jerry has done very much that at Rivergate where he has turned 38 doors and he is getting an average rent increase of 25%. And many of the people who are living there are just moving to new units. So that\u2019s the type of long-term value creation that we have looked at when we've bought assets and I think we would continue to do that. ", "We know it\u2019s a very competitive landscape. We prefer buying from non-marketed, non-auctioned deals because we think we can identify those and we have a track record of successfully executing on those. So I think that\u2019s the first aspect of growing the enterprise. We\u2019re not intent on a site as much as we are intent on an NAV creation model and things getting in that and the big part of NAV creation is, what\u2019s your cost of capital and are you adding to it, are you destroying it? And so in our like view we think we've been adding to it. It takes time sometimes to deliver on that and we appreciate people\u2019s patience and willing to go look at the assets and see and walk them with us and I think you've done it a number of times and you can see what we're doing and you look at it and say, yes, you are executing on what you told us you would do and we\u2019ll continue to do that. We want to be very transparent and very clear to our shareholders that we intend to grow NAV and that we have a team that can do that and we\u2019re going to continue to garner opportunities. We don't know what size and scope they are going to bring, but we\u2019ll be disciplined about it.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "If you had known \u2013 if you knew that in 2014, 2015 rent growth in some of these markets would decelerate meaningfully, would you still have a view of buying these assets and thinking longer-term or would you maybe\u2026", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Yeah, I\u2019ll let Harry add to it, but certainly it\u2019s a fair question and we think of what are the potential outcomes of economic downturn and will we slide into a recession which looks like a higher probability every day. And our view is that multi-family has done very well in a recessionary environment. And if you look through the number of recessions I\u2019ve been through, multi-family holds up better than any other asset class and we think that will be true again in this next recession that will come. So you can\u2019t necessarily look and try to time it and say, gosh, we think \u201813 is going to be this way and \u201814. We tend to take a longer term view and realize that in the markets that we\u2019re in there is a higher propensity to rent, there is less likely to be supply and that job we\u2019ve try to concentrate on it, but we\u2019re not always going to it right. The healthcare law is going to spawn a whole new wave of job additions and growth in a number of markets and we are weighing that as well in our future. But we\u2019re a long-term value creator and you\u2019re not going to get it always right on timing, but if you buy right, you run it right, over long period of time we\u2019ll do just fine.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Understood and obviously that\u2019s the right answer, long-term focus on making big investments. And then, Jerry, just a question to you. How much does the addition of the non-same-store assets influence your same-store guidance, if at all? Does it add 50 or 100 basis points for the growth?", "Jerry A. Davis", "For which year?", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "I mean, obviously it\u2019s not going to get in until deep into the second half, so how would you characterize it for \u2013 not to give guidance on, unless you want to give guidance. But for 2013, do you think you could add 50 or 100 basis points to the pool just because of the newness of the asset?", "Jerry A. Davis", "I doubt it. It\u2019s not quite that much. My guess is it\u2019s probably somewhere 10 to 30 bps.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Jeffrey Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities", "Thanks guys. Actually Tom, I\u2019m just curious for your perspective. Some of your peers have suggested that construction activity in the industry, which has been growing is a bit of a bubble, that these are projects that were planned and permitted and not built last cycle and that once we chew through them the pace of growth is going to moderate or at least maybe not climb above current level. How are you thinking about supply I guess nationally and what you do see is more of a passive growth in your markets over the next few years?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Well, a very good question and give me a liberty to talk broadly about it. We talk to a number of merchant building models and for us one of the red signals is when we talk to them about are they doing one-off deals, the source of their capital, their expected returns and are they entering into programs and programs are where you have an investor who says, I\u2019m going to do three, four, five deals with you. And what\u2019s been no to us in the past, when people have seen rapid increases in the supply part of the equation, has been when there have been a number of programs offered up or investors having capital that can sustain that and we\u2019re not finding that in the environment today as I'm aware of probably a dozen merchant build very skilled groups. I'm only aware of one who has a program at this time. And so investor capital is very cautious about supplying them and they are very skilled at garnering sites, entitlements and putting up things rapidly. So the second aspect of that and I think is under weighed by the space is the impact of Basel III on the capital structure of bank, and that a lot of supply comes from regionals and local banks, more so than the nationals. ", "And by getting \u2013 having to come into compliance with Basel III, we think it\u2019s going to be a constraint on the construction loan side, which has a higher capital requirement, which in essence banks are going to say they want to be paid more for that and who is going to charge more in the construction financing side or constrain the amount of lending on it. So I think that those two factors are the ones that we look at and draw a little bit of comfort that the supply is not going to get out of hand. That being said, if our rents continue to grow dramatically capital will find a way to garner space and opportunity. So we feel that that is the overall landscape on our individual submarket and market overviews \u2013 we see very little threat at this point in time. All we can do is look at the same data you do and look at permit, land trade, look at who's buying it and ask our self the likeliness of how competitive that product is going to be against ours and when it\u2019s going to come online. We can't do anything about constraining that, but we continue to monitor it and do not see it as a viable threat to the business over the next 12 to 18 months. Beyond that you are hour glassing it just like the rest of us.", "Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities", "So you don't necessarily see the industry as 250,000 units, let\u2019s just say, pick a number, headed towards 350,000. You think it\u2019s going to sort of running out of gas if you will in terms of just where we can ultimately peak it to have units under construction.", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Yeah. I think it\u2019s often management teams and certainly analysts try to focus on that aggregate number. We are less concerned about the aggregate because where is the 300,000 or 250,000? To us it\u2019s how is in our submarket, directly competing to us? The fact that they are building in Houston is almost irrelevant to us because we\u2019re practically out of Houston. So we don't pay much attention to the gross number. We aggregate and very think much on our submarket market driven numbers. And our red flag is when it gets above 1% of the submarket then we start really assessing the impact to us. But again we\u2019re long-term, if it\u2019s a strong submarket that we are in, 1% is not going to disrupt us that much.", "Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities", "And just a final question or two going the other end into the spectrum, I guess concerning the Pier 4 parcel in Boston, is that residential over retail and I guess how close is your partner there to breaking ground on that project?", "Harry Alcock ", "It is residential over retail. There\u2019ll be about 10,000 square feet of retail, a 20-story tower. We are still finalizing the scope and plans and cost in this thing. The project is entitled. We have BRA approval so that once we get through this exercise, we\u2019ll be in a position where we conceivably could start construction over the next several months.", "Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay, and just one last question. Jerry, sorry if you gave the figure, but do you guys track move outs to home rental and how is that trending? I might have missed it if you said it.", "Jerry A. Davis", "We do. It\u2019s right around 4% and it\u2019s stayed fairly consistent. We don\u2019t see many people moving out to rent homes.", "Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay, great. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference back over to our host, Mr. Tom Toomey, President and CEO.", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Well, thank you all for taking the time this morning to exchange thoughts with us and we do appreciate your time. In closing, I\u2019ll just say, in July of this year, marks the 40th year for UDR as a REIT and our 160th consecutively paid quarterly dividend and I think that\u2019s in testament to the associates over the years, the management team and certainty a trend that we are very proud of and look forward to continuing in the future.

(Operator Instructions).", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Chris Van Ens, Vice President of Investor Relations.  Please go ahead, Sir.", "Chris Van Ens", "", "Thank you for joining us for UDR's fourth quarter financial results conference call.  Our fourth quarter press release supplemental disclosure package and three-year strategy overview document were distributed earlier today and posted to our website, www.UDR.com.  In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial Reg G. requirements.  ", "Prior to reading our Safe Harbor disclosure, I would like to direct you to the webcast of this call located in the Investor Relations section of our website, www.UDR.com.  The webcast includes a slide presentation that will accompany our three-year strategic outlook commentary.  ", "Onto our Safe Harbor. I would like to note that statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements.  Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met.  A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in this morning's press release and included in our filings with the SEC.  We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.", "When we get to the question-and-answer portion, we ask that you be respectful of everyone's time and limit your questions and follow-ups.  Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered on the call.  ", "I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.", "Tom Toomey", "", "Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone.  Welcome to UDR's fourth quarter conference call.  On the call with me today are Tom Herzog, Chief Financial Officer and Jerry Davis, Senior Vice President of Operations who will discuss our results as well as our senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock who will be available to answer questions during the Q&A portion of the call.  ", "To start, I would like to officially welcome Tom Herzog to UDR's senior management team.  Many of you listening to the call know Tom.  He is a well-respected CFO who possesses a strong analytical skill set and valuable public REIT experience with two S&P 500 REITs.  I am confident that his experience will be beneficial to the company over the coming years.  ", "My prepared remarks today will be brief as the majority of my comments will be included in our overview of our three-year strategic outlook, which will directly follow senior management's quarterly and full-year prepared remarks.  ", "2012 was another strong year of operating results and we are encouraged by the early trends that we see in 2013.  Let me quickly review why the company is well-positioned and how we will continue to capitalize on good multi-family fundamentals over the years ahead.", "First, the heavy lifting with regards to our large-scale portfolio repositioning is complete.  Like most every public REIT, we will continue to see some level of capital recycling completed on an annual basis.  But any such actions will be conducted through normal business activities.  ", "Second, our balance sheet is much improved.  But we will continue to manage the lower leverage over time.  In our three-year strategic outlook, we will speak to leverage targets.  ", "Third, we have a topnotch operational platform and a team that we believe will continue to take full advantage of the positive multi-family fundamentals currently available to us.  ", "Finally, we have $1.3 billion of NAV accretive development and redevelopment underway.  50% of this pipeline is currently funded.  And 49% will be delivered by the year-end, 2013.  These activities are expected to begin contributing to our bottom line later this year.  And will generate stronger cash flow growth in 2014 and '15.  ", "In the fourth quarter, we were presented with a challenge related to Hurricane Sandy.  However, we were able to successfully navigate these difficulties thanks to the hard work and professionalism of our New York team.  We do not believe the storm will have any long-term negative impact on the demand for our Manhattan communities or their valuations.  Tom Herzog will delve into more detail in the accounting treatment of Sandy.  While Jerry will discuss the pre and post Sandy New York operating trends in the respective prepared remarks.", "Overall, we were pleased with our fourth quarter and full-year 2012 results.  ", "Finally, with the closing of 2012, the entire management team would like to thank our 1,600 associates for another outstanding year.  The outlook for UDR remains bright.  And we look forward to continued success.  ", "With that, I will pass the call over to Tom Herzog.", "Tom Herzog", "", "Thanks, Tom.  ", "Before I get into my prepared remarks, I want to express how good it is to be back in the public REIT world and specifically here at UDR.  For those of you I have not yet had the opportunity to reconnect or meet, I look forward to interacting with you in the near future.  ", "There are several topics I will cover today.  First, changes we have made to our presentation of FFO.  Second, our fourth quarter and full-year 2012 FFO results.  Third, our transactions and balance sheet update.  Fourth, details regarding the accounting treatment of Hurricane Sandy.  Fifth, our first quarter and full-year 2013 guidance.  And lastly, enhancements we made to our quarterly supplemental package.  ", "Let me begin with the changes we have made to our presentation of FFO.  Effective this quarter and going forward, we will be presenting FFO, FFO as adjusted, and AFFO.  We will also be guiding the all three of these earnings metrics on a quarterly basis.  Unlike our historical presentation, FFO as defined by NAREIT will now be our lead-in metric.  And will reconcile the FFO as adjusted, which is equivalent to our previous core FFO.  The adjustments for reconcile from FFO to FFO as adjusted will clearly set forth the fully set forth in each of our quarterly releases.  ", "In addition, we have commenced reporting AFFO, which reflects our maintenance CapEx reported on attachment 14 or page 25 of our supplement.  ", "There are three primary reasons for these changes.  First was to lead with NAREIT FFO and then reconcile through FFO as adjusted and AFFO for full clarity of the components and adjustments to each of these measurements.  ", "Second, to provide guidance to each of these three measurements to eliminate confusion as to what is included and excluded from our earnings guidance.  ", "Finally, despite inconsistency within the industry, we believe our new presentation more closely reflects that of many of our REIT peers.  ", "Turning now to our fourth quarter and full-year 2012 results, fourth quarter FFO per share was $0.31.  Excluding Hurricane Sandy charges, which totaled $0.04, FFO as adjusted was $0.35.  And AFFO was $0.31 per share.  Full-year 2012 AFFO was $1.32 per share.  Excluding the adjustment outlined on attachment two or page two of our supplement, FFO as adjusted was $1.35 per share, 5.5% higher than in 2011.  Full year AFFO was $1.18 per share, 10% higher than in 2011.  ", "Third, our transactions and balance sheet.  As previously discussed, we completed a swap of ownership interests in certain UDR MetLife I JV operating assets and land parcels in the fourth quarter.  Details are included in our quarterly press release.  ", "At year end, our financial leverage on a historical cost basis was 39%.  On a market value basis, it was approximately 32%.  Our net debt to EBITDA was 7.0 times.  And we are comfortably inside of all of our credit agreements and note covenants.  We ended the quarter with $913 million of available liquidity per combination of cash and undrawn capacity on our credit facilities.  ", "Next, I will address the accounting treatment around Hurricane Sandy.  In the fourth quarter, we recognized a $0.04 charge for Sandy related damages.  As I mentioned earlier, this charge was included in FFO, but excluded from FFO as adjusted.  ", "As to the GAAP accounting for Sandy, first, physical damage is accrued in the period event occurred.  Second, cleanup costs are expensed as incurred.  The recognized loss for both of these items is reduced by the estimated insurance reimbursement.  Third, business interruption losses are recognized as they occur.  Whereas the recovery of business interruption losses are recognized when repayment is received or assured.  ", "Due to the inherent uncertainty in the recovery of any natural disaster claims, we conservatively accrued a charge of $0.04.  $0.02 of which is equivalent to 25% of the physical damage and cleanup costs.  And $0.02 attributable to business interruptions.  Any subsequent insurance recoveries from this fourth quarter 2012 charges that differ from the accrual will continue to be excluded from FFO as adjusted. ", "Business interruption losses incurred in 2013 will inherently have less certainty of measurement.  Accordingly, we will not add back such losses to FFO as adjusted.  And subsequent business interruption recoveries will be included in FFO as adjusted when received to offset prior business interruption losses recognized in the run-rate.  ", "So how does all this affect same-store results?  Business interruption losses that consist of rent rebates to reimburse residents during the period the buildings were uninhabitable will be reported within hurricane related charges in the income statement.  The related rents were contractually receivable and will remain in rental income so that same-store sales will not be disrupted by this item.  This treatment has no net impact to our P&L or FFO.  As a result of lower occupancy due to the inability to lease apartments when the building was down, we have decided to delay 95 Wall's entry into our same-store pool until the second quarter of 2014 so as not to distort our New York same-store 2013 results.  ", "Onto 2013 guidance, our 2013 FFO guidance is $1.35 to $1.41 per share.  We're expecting $0.02 of our (RA-3) gains from property sales, which results in FFO as adjusted of $1.33 to $1.39 per share, or an increase of 1% at the midpoint versus 2012.  ", "Our 2013 AFFO guidance is $1.17 to $1.23 per share.  This includes $1,020 per door of maintenance CapEx per stabilized home.  We anticipate same-store revenue growth of 4% to 5%, same-store expense growth of 2.75% to 3.25%, and same-store growth of 4.25% to 6%.  Other primary assumptions can be found on attachment 15 or page 26 of our supplement.  ", "You will also notice we now provide quarterly guidance.  In the first quarter of 2013, both FFO and AFFO as adjusted guidance are at $0.31 to $0.33 per share.  Our AFFO guidance is $0.27 to $0.29 per share.  Our 2013 FFO as adjusted guidance is only $0.01 higher than last year.  The primary drivers of this low FFO growth includes several items that offset our forecasted 2013 organic [inaudible] growth, which is expected to provide $0.10 contribution to FFO.  The offsetting items include $0.035 increase in FFO drag related to our expanded development and redevelopment pipeline, $0.03 from the 2012 and projected 2013 sales of high cap rate properties in non-core markets, $0.01 of dilution in 2013 from our May, 2012 repayment of debt with equity proceeds, as well as a net $0.01 related to miscellaneous other items.  ", "Finally, we made numerous enhancements to our quarterly supplemental document, including how we categorize our NOI, additional data on our redevelopments, development and joint venture platforms, and additional same-store operating metrics, such as turnover and lease related growth by market.  ", "We recognize that our revised supplement in conjunction with our three year strategy document will likely lead to in-depth modeling questions.  We ask that you hold these questions until after the call when we can walk them through with you individually in greater detail.  We believe you will find our re-tooled supplemental package provides greater transparency and will prove helpful and informative.  ", "We have noted that our guidance is lower than many analysts had projected.  In examining these variances as best we can, we observe several drivers to these differences, which include lower interest expense perhaps due to differences in capitalized interest in our development and redevelopment projects and lower G&A perhaps due to confusion relative to the tax provision as presented in our historical financial statements.  We believe our improved supplementals will help reduce confusion in the future.  ", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Jerry.", "Jerry Davis", "", "Thanks, Tom.  Good morning everyone.  ", "In my remarks, I will cover the following topics.  Fourth quarter and full year 2012 operating results, an update on our non-mature pool of assets, and lastly, an update on our New York operations.  ", "We are pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results.  In the fourth quarter, same-store net operating income grew 7.3% driven by a 5.7% year-over-year increase in revenue and only a 2.3% increase in expenses.  A quite note, on attachment six or page eight, our revised quarterly supplemental package, you will find a breakout of same-store operating expenses with year-over-year sequential and year-to-date comparisons by expense component.  ", "Our same-store revenue per occupied home increased by 5% year-over-year to $1,420.  While same-store occupancy increased by 60 basis points to 95.8%.  ", "On a total portfolio basis including our pro-rata share of JVs, our revenue per occupied home was $1,558.  ", "Sequentially, fourth quarter net operating income increased 3.3% driven by a 0.7% increase in revenue and expense growth of -4.7%.  ", "Before I discuss new and renewal lease growth trends, I would like to direct everyone to attachment 8G on page 19, a new addition to our supplemental quarterly package.  8G provides new and renewal lease growth as well as turnover by market.  In the fourth quarter, effective rental rate increases on new leases at our same-store communities increased by 1.7% on average.  And renewal rate growth remained strong at 5.6%.

You will notice that we have added an NOI bucket title stabilized non-mature.  Only non-stabilized communities are now included in our acquisition, development, and redevelopment NOI buckets.  We also broke out our non-residential and other, which includes commercial NOI.  For more information on how we define our respective NOI buckets and what types of communities are included in each, I will refer you to attachment 16 on pages 27 to 29 of our quarterly supplemental package.

", "Before I review fourth quarter leasing trends in New York, I would like to address any potential long-term negative ramifications to downtown property values.  It is still early in the process.  But we do not see any long term value impairment.  Our resident's property was not damaged by the storm.  And leasing activity is following the normal seasonal patterns.  People still want to live in lower Manhattan.  ", "Let me address where we stand today versus before Sandy from an occupancy and lease rate perspectives at our New York properties.  First 10 Hanover with 493 homes, our pre-Sandy occupancy was 98%.  And our current occupancy is comparable.  Blended lease rate growth is also comparable to pre-Sandy levels.  ", "Second, 95 Wall with 508 homes, our pre-Sandy occupancy was 96%.  And our current occupancy is 92%.  95 Wall was the community most affected by Sandy.  Blended lease rate growth still has some room to run before it returns to pre-Sandy levels.  However, we are making progress on refilling the building.  And would expect business as usual by the end of the second quarter.  ", "Third, Rivergate with 706 homes, our pre-Sandy occupancy was 93%.  And our current occupancy is 88%.  This decline was partially driven by our redevelopment program.  When Sandy hit, we had a certain number of units being redeveloped.  Our crews could not work on these units for the weeks when Rivergate was uninhabitable.  In the meantime, we had already sent out notices prior to Sandy to free up the next batch of homes to be redeveloped.  Those residents vacated when Rivergate became habitable again.  This gave us an abnormally large number of homes in redevelopment, which negatively affected occupancy.  Blended lease rate growth has not yet returned to pre-hurricane levels at Rivergate.  But we have also not had many redeveloped homes come back online since the storm hit.  We expect improved lease rate growth by the end of the first quarter.  To reiterate, we believe that we will be back to pre-hurricane occupancy and lease rate levels by the end of the second quarter in New York.  ", "I'll not turn the call back over to Tom Toomey.

During the three year period from 2010 to 2012, we purchased 1.97 billion of assets and an average Cap rate of 4.7%.  We sold 1.22 billion of assets and an average Cap rate of 6.9%. We grew our development and redevelopment programs to 1.3 billion 50% of which has been funded and deleveraged for a balance sheet by fully funding all external growth activities of equity.  Note that this 2.21 billion of equity was issued at a slight premium to NAV per share over this time period.

Matching our three year acquisition against deposition yielded $0.10 of dilution.  And ramping our development and redevelopment pipeline contributed another $ 0.055 of total dilution in 2013. This was offset somewhat by a portion of a new equity we issued, that was used to fund part of our fully owned joint venture and land acquisitions. This created $0.02 of accretion.  ", "The team was fully cognizant of this tradeoff between short-term dilution and long-term value creation when we undertook these activities.

As you can see, we believe that there\u2019s plenty of reasons starting with multi-family fundamentals continue to look robust.  We have a strong three year growth profile, which is driven by our efficient operating platform, and our repositioned portfolio.  The heavy lifting is completed with regard to our portfolio and balance sheet repositioning, as well at the ramp up of our development and redevelopment programs.", "And lastly, tax flow and NAV per share growth from our external growth efforts will begin to come online towards the end of 2013, and accelerate over the next few years.", "As Herzog mentioned earlier, our FFO and AFFO per share growth, would be rather marginal in 2013.  However, in 2014 and \u201915 cash flow growth is expected to improve markedly to roughly 9% annually.  ", "Quickly, here are the primary big picture assumptions that support these growth expectations during this time period given the current economic conditions. Our projected Same-Store NOI growth of roughly 4.25 per year would result in additional FFO and AFFO growth of 5 to 6% per year.  Development/redevelopment coming online during this period are forecast to add another 3 to 5% growth. And remaining non-Same-Stores is anticipated to add approximately 1% per year.  When combined, and set against our current leverage, our average 2014 and \u201915 FFO and AFFO growth per share of 8 and 9% respectively look very reasonable. These growth levels would result in 2015 FFO and AFFO of $1.57 and $1.41 respectively.  Applying these same forecast to UDRs consensus NAV of $26.50 per share yield annual NAV growth of roughly 9% in 2014 and \u201915, and would result in NAV per share north of $32.00 by the end of 2015.", "This projected NAV increase when coupled with dividends expected to be paid in 2014 and \u201915, would generate CVNI growth of roughly 12% annually.", "We will continue to work hard and execute on all the strategic priorities that we have reviewed with you today.

Tom, just thinking about how you ended your comments, thinking about the growth in NAV and technically the growth in NOI getting to a $32 stock price, or $30 NAV I should say.  I guess underlying that is an expectation of flat cap rates, right?  ", "Tom Herzog", "", "Well, no, not necessarily.  Let me just give you the pieces, Michael.  How we looked at that \u2013 this is Herzog, by the way.  How we looked at that analysis is we took the same store growth to get the \u2013 the NOI will be created from the guidance that we put in the document.  We also looked at the non-same-store and then we picked up our development REIT development value creation from an NOI perspective that would be created from the program that\u2019s in place and projected that over about three years in a pretty in-depth model.  We took that NOI and we capped it out at \u2013 you\u2019re correct, at today\u2019s CAP rate so we could get a sense for it and then incorporated that into our NAV creation to get the growth that would just mathematically come to something north of $32 a share.  ", "And the while we were at it, we did then pick up the dividend yield off the consensus NAV and created the CVNI that we spoke to of about 12.2%.  The CAP rate that we used was the \u2013 it was 5 1/8% and we picked that up from looking to the consensus NAV that The Street had put out and kind of the average CAP rate that was within that mix to utilize the 5 1/8th.  ", "Michael (Unidentified Analyst)", "And so effectively, you know, flat CAP rates and growing NOI, you know, getting to that NAV, obviously, is predicated on CAP rates staying relatively stagnant?

This is on Page 12 of the presentation.  I guess, is that a similar answer thinking about the 100 that\u2019s embedded in guidance for \u201913, that the 500 in \u201914 and \u201915 is predicated on the stock because you\u2019ve now put yourself, I guess, out there saying you will not issue equity below NAV and given the stocks at $23, you\u2019ve got a far way to move up, especially with an outlook that the NAV is going to grow significantly in the next couple of years, that that 500 million has got to come from other things, or you don\u2019t spend the money, right?  You either don\u2019t do the acquisitions or you don\u2019t do the development or re-development because you\u2019ve got to come up with $500 million of cash?

", "Jerry Davis", "", "Yeah, I can\u2019t really speak to anyone else.  I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s behind their numbers.  I can tell you though, we are feeling real estate tax pressure, maybe not as much as the Sunbelt-dominating guys, but you know, our taxes \u2013 we\u2019re expecting to be north of 8% growth.  But when you really look back, like you said, over the last five years, we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of keeping expense growth at sub-1%.  So migrating it up to that mid-point of 3% is predominately driven by taxes.  We think turnover this year will probably be roughly even where it was in 2012.  And you know, we\u2019re really \u2013 we spend the last four to five years making our sales force and administrative functions more efficient.  And over the next couple of years, we think there\u2019s ways to realize efficiencies in our service functions of our business.  So we\u2019re going to be hitting that hard over the next 2 to 3 years.  ", "But yeah, I think when you look at it, it\u2019s really maintaining control and driving down the cost of doing our service side of the business will help keep us at the low end.  ", "Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill", "", "Okay. So if I understand you, I mean, in addition, presumably, Warren\u2019s doing a good job on negotiating with the insurance companies to keep premiums low, but essentially whatever costs you\u2019re seeing rise on property tax, you\u2019re sort of taking it out on the other side by keeping expenses down?  That\u2019s the takeaway?  ", "Jerry Davis", "", "Yes, I think that accurate.  ", "Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill", "", "Okay.  Second question is for Toomey.  Obviously, you know, Tom Herzog doesn\u2019t need an introduction, you know, we all know him.  But just sort of curious given it was a lengthy process, it was one that you guys weren\u2019t under pressure to have to fill right away, you know, given the existing CFO bench strength there. What was the Board\u2019s take in view as far as succession planning?  I mean, if we think about it, succession planning is something that can take four or five-plus years.  You know, I know that you comment that you\u2019re not ready to hang up the spurs anytime in the near term, but these things do take time.  So just sort of curious what the Board thought as you went about filling that role? ", "Tom Toomey", "", "Well, the Board was part of the process, obviously.  And with respect to the subject of succession, you\u2019re right, Alex.  First, I\u2019m 52 years old.  I like what I\u2019m doing.  I like the team I\u2019ve assembled.  I enjoy what I\u2019m doing so annually we review a succession plan, the Board approves it and we march forward with that plan every year and evaluate it every year.  ", "Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill", "", "Okay, so nothing changed when you sent about doing the search?  It was \u2013 that didn\u2019t prompt a further review of anything as far as succession goes? ", "Tom Toomey", "", "It was part of the evaluation process and we reached the conclusion that Mr. Herzog was the best candidate today and for the future.  ", "Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill", "", "Okay, perfect.  Thank you.  ", "Operator", "", "And our next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky of RBC Capital Markets.  Please go ahead.  ", "Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets", "Good afternoon, guys.  I also appreciate the disclosure there in the three-year plan.  Just a couple quick bookkeeping questions.  First, you gave what you expect to spend in 2013.  What\u2019s kind of the outlook for development starts and redevelopment starts in \u201913? ", "Harry Alcock", "", "Mike, this is Harry.  We didn\u2019t give any guidance as to starts in 2013.  In \u201914 and \u201915 we have to start another \u2013 call it 500, 550 million to sort of reach the guidance that we\u2019ve given and so 2014, 2015 spend.  I can tell you that our existing pipeline, both in our owned land assets and our JV assets with Met Life, the total spend in that portfolio could be in excess of $1 billion.  We\u2019ve got additional redevelopment projects we\u2019re looking at.  So we certainly have a sufficient pipeline to backfill the existing projects.  ", "In terms of 2013, we didn\u2019t give any guidance.  I\u2019d be surprised if we started a lot, although we\u2019re working on a number of projects and the exact timing depends on when we complete the entitlements and permitting process with the various cities.  ", "Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay.  Jerry, in your prepared comments, did you give January trends? ", "Jerry Davis", "", "I didn\u2019t, but I will.  January, our new least rates were up \u2013 or rates on new leases were up about 2.5%, that compares to 1.7% last January.  And then our renewals were up 5.9% in January and that\u2019s down from last year when it was pushing 7.  ", "Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay.  And the occupancy on the year-review basis? ", "Jerry Davis", "", "Occupancy is up slightly in January.  Today, I think it averaged out 95.5 in January and today we\u2019re at 95.4%.  I would expect for the first quarter it will end up in that 95.5% range. ", "Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets", "That\u2019s helpful.  And just finally, the G&A increase looked a bit large.  Tom could you walk through the components of what drilled the increase there in G&A? ", "Tom Herzog", "", "Yeah, Mike, Tom Herzog here.  The G&A, first of all, I don\u2019t want you to be confused by the G&A.  We have said in the past that some of that occurred.  The tax number used to be met into that and then in the beginning of last quarter when people realized there was confusion here, that was discontinued.  So now the G&A and the tax benefit are broken out separately, which you\u2019ve probably seen.  So when we look at the 2012 G&A relative to the guidance that was given at the beginning of the year, you\u2019ll find that the tax number is broken out, that we\u2019re pretty much right on in that number.  ", "As we look to 2013, we\u2019re up \u2013 call it 2, $2.5 million, this is the basic stuff.  We\u2019ve got normal personnel increases.  We had certain comp items for folks in the field that had a great job in 2012 and then miscellaneous and technology type items make up  the rest.  So no big [inaudible] and line item made up that change, but it comes to about a penny.  ", "Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay.  I\u2019ll take a look at that.  The tax benefit then, I just \u2013 it\u2019s been elevated the last couple of years.  Is the \u2013 looking forward over the next couple of years given your outlook, should we expect that to come down pretty substantially as you kind of move out of that business? ", "Tom Herzog", "", "Well, I would put it this way; in 2012, the first quarter of \u201912, there wasn\u2019t a benefit recorded because the sales hadn\u2019t been made and it was being backed off against the valuation allowance adjustment that took place.  In 2013, so it was running about $3 million a quarter in \u201912 with nothing in Q1.  In 2013, that number is going to be more in the vicinity of \u201911 to \u201913 million.  And then as we go forward from there as some of the development projects start to stabilize and some of the additional sales start to earn in, you\u2019re going to see that tax benefit structure decline and that\u2019s what you see in that guidance on Page \u2013 whatever it is, 16 or 17 of the three-year strategy package, you see a decline for those reasons as development starts to earn in.  ", "Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets", "Appreciate the color.  Thank you. ", "Tom Herzog", "", "I should just note one thing though so that we don\u2019t have confusion, we\u2019re not intending to move out of that business in the TRS.  We\u2019ll continue to own assets in there, develop assets so that tax benefit is an ongoing item and you can see the that [inaudible].  ", "Operator", "", "Mr. Toomey, there are no further questions at this time. ", "Tom Toomey", "", "Well, thank you, all, for your time today. I know it was a lengthy prepared remarks, but I think we have a lot to give you today and certainly the team\u2019s going to be available for follow-up calls.  But as you can see today, what we have accomplished is we provided a three-year road amp.  We\u2019ve enhanced our disclosures.  We restated our strategic priorities.  We certainly gave you a case of why UDR is a good investment today and in the future.  And lastly, I add, I think we have the right team to execute this.  So with that, thank you for your time today and we wish you the best.  ", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Dave Bragg", "Haendel St. Juste", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to UDR's First Quarter 2013 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, I'd like to turn conference over to Chris Van Ens, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Christopher G. Van Ens", "Thank you for joining us for UDR's first quarter financial results conference call. Our first quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed earlier today and posted to our website, www.udr.com. In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements.", "I would like to note that statements made during this call which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risk and risk factors are detailed in this morning's press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.", "[Operator Instructions] Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered on the call.", "I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Thank you, Chris. And good morning, everyone, and welcome to UDR's first quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Tom Herzog, Chief Financial Officer; and Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our results; as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available to answer questions during the Q&A portion of the call.", "Multifamily fundamentals remain strong. Job growth continues at a slow and steady pace, while new supply remains manageable in the majority of our markets. Third-party research providers estimate that 5 new jobs are required to generate demand in 1 apartment home. Using this relationship, 18 of our 20 markets are expected to have more than sufficient demand to fully absorb the new multifamily supply that is forecast to come online over the next 3 years.", "Single-family housing is clearly recovering, but move-outs to home purchases remain contained at less than 12%, still well below the long-term average of 15%. From our investment perspective, the amount of capital looking to participate in the multifamily sector remains deep. This has kept cap rates stable, which in turn continues to propel above-average profit margins for development and redevelopment investments. Over the coming years, we expect the majority of these macro tailwinds to persist, especially for UDR, which owns a portfolio primarily concentrated in coastal gateway markets for multifamily renters who want to live and work where alternative housing options are relatively unaffordable and where long-term new supply pressures are below average.", "In February, we presented a 3-year strategic plan for the company. The plan focuses on driving high-quality cash flow per share growth over the coming years. We believe that cash flow growth is the primary driver of NAV per share growth, dividend growth and ultimately, total shareholder return. The team is highly focused on executing our plan.", "What does high-quality cash flow per share growth mean to UDR? First, growth that is driven by capitalizing on what we do best, operating our business to generate strong top line results but also controlling expenses in an efficient manner. Second, growth that is augmented by accretive investments. Currently, development and redevelopment are the most attractive of these pursuits. Our $1.2 billion pipeline, of which 43% is expected to be delivered in 2013, is nearly 52% funded and is comprised of projects in desirable locations that will help drive high-quality cash flow growth per share in the coming years. Lastly, growth that is achieved while realizing our long-term leverage objectives. As we addressed on our last call, we are comfortable with our current balance sheet but expect that organic NOI growth and the delivery of our development and redevelopment pipeline over the coming years will further deleverage the company. In addition, we will continue to look for other ways to improve our balance sheet metrics through non-dilutive activities over time.", "I'd like to congratulate Jerry and his operating team for strong results they produced in the first quarter and for great execution during the initial quarter of our 3-year strategic plan. 2013 is continuing to look like it will be another strong operating year for us. We are excited to share our success with you as it unfolds.", "With that, I will pass the call over to Tom Herzog.", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Thanks, Tom. There are several topics I will cover today: first, first quarter results; second, our balance sheet update; third, an update on insurance recoveries from Hurricane Sandy; fourth, a change to our income statement presentation; and lastly, our second quarter and full year 2013 guidance.", "Let me begin with our first quarter results. FFO per share was $0.35. After deducting a $0.01 benefit from Hurricane Sandy insurance recoveries, FFO as adjusted per share was $0.34. The $0.02 of upside versus the midpoint of our previous FFO as adjusted guidance was driven by a $0.01 from better-than-expected operations and another $0.01 from timing differences in G&A and other miscellaneous items. We expect these timing differences to reverse during the balance of the year. First quarter AFFO per share was $0.31 and benefited from $0.01 of lower CapEx spend than anticipated during the quarter, which again was due to timing. We continue to target $1,020 in maintenance CapEx per home in 2013.", "Turning now to the balance sheet. At quarter end, our financial leverage on a historic cost basis was 39%. On a market value basis, it was approximately 31%. Our net-debt-to-EBITDA was 7.3x, which remains on target with our plan. As a reminder, we anticipate that net-debt-to-EBITDA will peak at 7.5x toward the middle of the year and subsequently decline to 7.0x by year-end 2013 as non-income earning assets come online. We ended the quarter with $826 million of available liquidity through a combination of cash and undrawn capacity on our credit facilities.", "Next, an update on our insurance recoveries from Hurricane Sandy. Original damage estimate of $28 million to $32 million remains intact. To date, we have recovered $16 million or approximately 90% of the $17 million we have paid for hurricane damages incurred for rental income loss. Moving on, we have updated our income statement presentation in this quarter's and future 10-Qs and 10-Ks. Additionally, we conform Schedule 1 of our supplement to the income statement presentation in these filings. We adopted these changes to improve the flow of the schedule and increase comparability to how our peers' report", "On to 2013 guidance. We increased our full year FFO per share guidance to $1.36 to $1.42 from our previous $1.35 to $1.41 to reflect the $0.01 benefit from insurance recoveries in the first quarter. The full year FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance remains unchanged at $1.33 to $1.39 and $1.17 to $1.23, respectively. We did not raise guidance to reflect our first quarter operational upside as we are only 1 quarter into the year and are still within our initial guidance ranges. Our same-store expectations for the year also remain unchanged. We will revisit our guidance on our second quarter call.", "For the second quarter 2013, we are providing FFO and FFO as adjusted guidance of $0.33 to $0.35 per share and AFFO guidance of $0.27 to $0.29 per share. As a reminder, primary guidance assumptions can be found on Attachment 15, Page 25 of our supplement. Lastly, during the quarter, we raised our annualized dividend per share to $0.94, a 7% increase versus our 2012 dividend.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Jerry.", "Jerry A. Davis", "Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks, I will cover the following topics: first quarter operating results; an update on our non-mature communities, development lease-ups and redevelopment projects; and lastly, an update on our New York operations.", "We are pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. In the first quarter, same-store NOI grew 6.3%, driven by a 5.4% year-over-year increase in revenue against a 3.4% increase in expenses. Our same-store revenue per occupied home increased by 5.4% year-over-year, $1,448 per month, while same-store occupancy was flat at 95.5%. On a total portfolio basis, including our pro rata share of joint ventures, our revenue per occupied home was $1,569 per month. Sequentially, first quarter NOI declined by 10 basis points, representing typical seasonality for the first quarter. This was driven by a 0.8% increase in revenue and expense growth of 2.7%. Turning to new and renewal lease rates. In the first quarter, effective rental rate increases on new leases at our same-store communities increased by 2.2% on average and renewal rate growth remained strong at 5.8%. Annualized turnover in the first quarter decreased by 130 basis points year-over-year to 45.5%.", "Moving on to our stabilized non-mature communities, detailed on Page 8 of our supplement. These properties account for 40% of our total non-same-store NOI, excluding joint ventures, and they are performing slightly ahead of plan. Our in-progress developments and redevelopments are an important driver of our anticipated cash flow growth over the coming years. During the quarter, we spent $111 million on development and redevelopment projects, including $2 million on our recent work completed, Capitol View on 14th development in Washington, D.C.", "I'm pleased to report that our development lease-ups are on plan and our redevelopments are commanding the rental rate increases we underwrote. Lease-up specifics. Our 255-home, $126 million Capitol View development in D.C. is currently 69% leased and 56% occupied. The project is on schedule, on budget and leasing up on plan. To date, we have yet to feel any negative impact from impending new supply in the U Street Corridor of D.C. Our 391-unit, $98 million Fiori on Vitruvian Park development in Addison, Texas is currently 10% leased, with the first home just being delivered a little over a week ago. The project is on schedule, on budget and leasing up on plan.", "Our 467-home, $150 million residences at Bella Terra development in Huntington Beach, California, is currently 17% pre-leased and does not deliver its first homes until mid-May. The project is on budget, on schedule and leasing up ahead of plan. To date, we have not had to offer any concessions on the first 77 leases. Lastly, our 256-home, $65 million Domain College Park development, located across the street from the University of Maryland's business school, is currently 11% pre-leased and does not deliver its first homes until June. The project is on schedule, on budget and leasing up on plan.", "Turning to our redevelopments. First, the 583-home, $36 million Westerly on Lincoln redevelopment in Marina del Rey, California. As of quarter end, we have completed the redevelopment of 424 homes. On these homes, we have averaged a 15% rental rate increase. The property is currently 98% leased and 96.4% physically occupied. Demand remains strong at the Westerly. Second, our 706-home, $60 million  Rivergate redevelopment in Manhattan. As of quarter end, we have completed the redevelopment of 205 homes. On these homes, we have averaged a 12% rental rate increase. The property is currently 94% leased and 91% occupied. Lastly, our 964-home, $75 million redevelopment now called 27 Seventy Five Mesa Verde in Costa Mesa, California. As of quarter end, we completed the redevelopment of 220 homes. On these homes, we have averaged a 21% rental rate increase. Like all of our major redevelopments, 27 Seventy Five is truly a transformation project.", "Moving on to New York. On our last conference call, the update I provided was on our lower Manhattan communities, indicated that we expected to have occupancies and lease rates back to normal by the end of second quarter 2013. I'm pleased to report that this is occurring. Currently, occupancies at Rivergate, Hanover and 95 Wall are all comparable with pre-hurricane levels, and we are no longer offering concessions related to Sandy. I would like to thank our New York team for this impressive achievement.", "With that, I'll open up the call to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Jana Galan with Bank of America.", "Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Jerry, can you let us know what April is looking like for occupancy and new leases and the renewal rate growth and then what you're sending out for renewals?", "Jerry A. Davis", "Sure. Thanks, Jana. Currently, occupancy, as of yesterday, for the same-store portfolio was 96%, probably averaged a little above that 95.5% that we had in the first quarter. And in the month of April, new lease rate growth is currently coming in at 3.4% growth. And renewals are coming in at about 5.4%. We're sending out renewals right now, 60 days out, right up around that 5.7%, 5.8% range.", "Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And then, your D.C. results were better than I was expecting. I was curious, do you think it's due to maybe having less government-related tenants in your portfolio. Or anything that you can kind of surmise why D.C. is holding up really well for you?", "Jerry A. Davis", "I think it's a couple of things. First, I would tell you, I think, we have the best operating team in the industry in Washington, D.C. that helps us, every year, perform well above average. Secondly, I think our properties are located in submarkets that today are not seeing a whole lot of new deliveries affect them. There's 1 or 2 that -- submarkets we will feel the effect of new supply later this year, but we've been fortunate to this point to not really encounter that. And I'd say on the government workers, we do have 1 or 2 properties that have felt the effect of some of the sequester, but it hasn't been rampant throughout the portfolio.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Toti, Cantor Fitzgerald.", "David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Just a quick question. Some of your occupancy and turnover trends kind of bucked what we had seen in some other reports. Your occupancy stayed flat and your turn actually went a bit lower. Two questions, are there any specific regions where there was strength impacting those metrics? And number two, do you believe you left some rent on the table by maybe not being aggressive enough with the rent part of the equation?", "Jerry A. Davis", "I don't think we left anything on the table. I think our intent this year was to run the turnover roughly flat with last year, and we are still pushing renewals up to what the current market rate is, so I don't think we're really leaving any money on the table. And I would tell you there's a couple of markets where turnover decreased significantly. One was up in our Monterey Peninsula, another was -- which was down about 16%; Portland was down about 14%; and Richmond, Virginia was down about 7%. And then, we did see spikes in San Diego. It was up almost 20%. And a large part of that is we had a tax-exempt bond that matured about 1 year, 1.5 year ago that had 20% of -- that required 20% of the units to be low-income housing. That requirement went away at the end of last year, and we're in the process right now of retenanting those units with the conventional lease rates.", "David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then my second question just has to do with technology. And you guys are sort of at the forefront of pushing a lot of the online service to your tenants as far down as the phones. Do you think you've kind of maxed out the technology impact at this point? Or are there other things that you're working on that you think you might get some additional financial benefits from?", "Jerry A. Davis", "We definitely don't think we've tapped it out. There's -- online leasing should be rolling out. We've been beta testing it for the last 4 to 6 months. We're ready to do a full rollout as we go into leasing season so that'll be beneficial. We probably don't see it having the same penetration rate that we've achieved on our online renewals, which are up around 80%, but we think that'll help people make a decision, that 24/7 ability to lease a unit and enjoy self-service. The bigger impact though of what we're working on this year and then probably carry forward for the next 2 to 3 years is introducing technology into the service aspect of our business. Where we use handheld devices to enable our guys to get service requests mobile-y, to punch in and punch out their time on a handheld device, which will save us quite a bit of time. And we're also using different reports now that are in our property management system to better measure the effectiveness of all of our service teams. One thing that we've also started putting in several of our rehabs, as well as our new developments, are electronic locks that we find our resident base appreciates that and our service teams also appreciate it because there's not a need to go back and forth to the office to get keys or the need to re-key the lock every time somebody moves in or moves out, which is a huge time savings.", "David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Just one last question, if I can, Jerry. Have you guys experimented widely with trying to push through higher rental rates via the Internet-based applications versus sort of the traditional walk-ins and call-ins?", "Jerry A. Davis", "I'm not sure I understand the question. You're saying can I get higher rates because we have the electronic platforms for leasing?", "David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Yes. Well, I guess, have you ever experimented with trying different rates through the different channels? Let's say, a walk-in really wants the apartment, do you offer higher rates there? Do you try to push the higher rates through the Internet, where the customers might be more accustomed increasingly to closing deals? I guess, have you experimented with the different tolerance levels in the customer base?", "Jerry A. Davis", "No, David. We've never done that. Whatever the rate is that we get from YieldStar for the given lease term, we would honor that regardless of how the person found us.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Nic Joseph with Citi.", "Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "How did first quarter same-store revenue growth compare with your original expectations? It's early in the year, but I'm trying to get a sense where you're tracking relative to guidance.", "Jerry A. Davis", "Sure, this is Jerry again. It came in a little bit better, not materially. I would tell you the biggest surprise to us was fee income was higher than expected predominantly due to lease breaks, and that was caused not so much by people moving out for home purchase. As Tom said, that move-outs to home purchase was still at 11.8%, below our historical averages. But we believe it was more related to people needing to move for job transfers. So that was a little better than what we had expected, a couple of hundred thousand dollars, and we're hopeful that continues throughout the year, but it's hard to tell if it will.", "Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, then. How does traffic trend, I guess, in the first quarter and what you've seen in April relative to historical averages?", "Jerry A. Davis", "Traffic actually is almost exactly flat. It's up 3 basis points, if you will. And through the month of April, it's continuing to track pretty even with what it was in 2012.", "Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Great. And then finally, you mentioned earlier, Tom, that development remains very attractive. So can you give us some numbers around kind of where the development yields are trending, initial yields, versus where you're seeing transaction cap rates in those markets?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Sure. We -- on an untrended basis, we won't start a project unless we have sort of a meaningful variance to spot cap rates. That's going to be at least 100 to 150 basis points. As we've looked at our trended results of between 6% and 6.5% where the average spot cap rates in those markets are perhaps 4.5%, we've got 150- to 200-basis-point variance on our expected yield versus spot cap rates in those markets.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.", "Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research", "Jerry, can you talk about where first quarter, on the expense side, came in relative to expectations for snow removal and the other sort of seasonality things like utilities, et cetera?", "Jerry A. Davis", "Sure. Expenses actually came in pretty close to budget. We were a little bit under, I think, utilities expense due to the first part of the season being a little warmer than normal and many of our markets was down. Snow removal really didn't affect me much on a same-store basis because most of the snow that hit us was up in the Boston area. And the impact of that I felt more in my MetLife JV assets. The one -- I've got 3 assets up there that are in my fort, that are in my same-store, one is actually an urban property with no snow removal costs. So snow removal was not a big player in my numbers.", "Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then, Tom, just back to the development question. I mean, you're sitting here, just on the development side with $1 billion pipeline. A lot of it's going to be delivered this year. When you look out and sort of see how the market is, sort of pricing development or underpricing development opportunities, is it a situation where you think about it and you steer the pipeline down or just let it burn down from projects coming off or you look at it as an opportunity and going to continue to maintain a sort of $1 billion development pipeline going out the next year until the economy starts weakening?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "So Rob, first, we operate in 20 markets, and each market has its own cycle, with respect to the size and the annual spend on our development pipeline. First of all, is you're going to look at what our cost capital is versus what the opportunity is. And as we articulated in our 3-year strategic plan that we published in February, we'd like to keep the numbers somewhere between $300 million and $600 million on an annual spend basis. Projects typically take 3 years. So you can see that we're probably going to average right around $1 billion, $1.2 billion in total pipeline over the next 3-year period. We think we have enough in the shadow pipeline in the right markets that are stacking well up on the supply/demand equation for us, and we'll continue to execute at that level. We'll wait and see how the cost of capital changes that, how cost of building deals changes that and the individual markets before announcing more starts.", "Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then one for Harry. Have you been seeing any changes in the environment for dispositions, given the rumblings about changes at Fannie and Freddie?", "Harry G. Alcock", "Well, there continues to be tremendous demand for product in the marketplace. Cap rates, in general, for -- I  mean, both for A and B product are flat or in some markets, are even down recently. I think more of the B market product is migrated down even more so than the A recently. The market fundamentals are still good, interest rates are still good, and there's a lot of demand for product in the market right now.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Just a first question is on the mid-Atlantic. If you look on Page 18, you have your new lease rates versus the renewals. And in the mid-Atlantic, Baltimore, Richmond, Norfolk, the new rates were negatives, while the renewals were positives. And conceptually, I understand that you can push rents more on renewals. But as you think about the -- going out the balance of this year, do you expect this trend to continue or do you think that new rates you'll be able to make positive? Or what's going on in those 3 markets that's causing it? Is that sequester? Is that just more competition?", "Jerry A. Davis", "Yes, Alex, this is Jerry. I guess, first, I'd start they're smaller markets for us but still irrelevant. The question, I don't think it is sequester. I think it was just timing of what was happening with the expiring leases and what was happening with some of the new leases. What happened in the case of Richmond, for example, we had 1 property that had quite a few corporate leases roll-off late in 4Q and early 1Q. And those are typically shorter-term leases with premium prices, and we reloaded with 12-month leases on conventional renters. I can tell you in the month of April, Richmond, for example, new lease rates are up 2.1%, so they're not down anymore. In Norfolk, that's a military town, and again, you'll have cycles with folks going out, folks coming in, things like that. I would expect new lease rates growth there to stay low. But again, in the month of April, it was flat, right at 0. And then in the case of Baltimore. Baltimore is a pretty weak market right now. There have been some government job cuts that have affected Baltimore, and there's also some new competition in a few of our submarkets, including Carlson, [ph] that have made it more difficult to push new rate on incoming people. And unfortunately there, I do have to report that in the month of April, I'm still negative at negative 1.6.%", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then, for Mr. Herzog, I didn't want to say Tom and have confusion. Is -- on running the operating assets through the TRS through RE3, is there a time limit of how long you can run those through or this sort of accounting or tax say, \"Hey, if you're operating, you have to move them back into the regular REIT?\"", "Thomas M. Herzog", "No, there's no time limit on that, Alex.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. So they can ...", "Thomas M. Herzog", "From a -- go ahead.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "So indefinitely, you'll be booking these tax benefits or at a certain point, that somehow they reverse out or it burns off?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Well, it gets into a tax strategy conversation, that's probably a little deeper than we'll get into on this call. But when we think about the type of assets that might end up in there, it would be, solvent assets were one optionality. There could have been some assets that had certain improvements that might have had the 2-year rule attached to them historically or condo-type assets that we've decided since to keep down in the TRS. It is producing this benefit. You will note from the 3-year strategy document that we do show that benefit ticking down over the next couple of years in 2014 and 2015. So I do see us -- seeing that number reduce over time through some tax strategy that we'll be employing over the next couple of years.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. And just to finish up there, does it make these assets more advantageous to sell or when it comes time to figure out which assets you want to prune, it's no different picking these assets versus other assets?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "It's really no different. There are strategies that we can employ that allow us to have a similar outcome.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Karin Ford with KeyBanc.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Just on the 11.8% move out to home purchase stat. Jerry, can you just give us what the sequential quarterly comparison is on that versus last quarter?", "Jerry A. Davis", "Sure. Yes, last quarter, Karin, it was 13.4%.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay, helpful. And then just, Tom, just your thoughts on the single -- competition from the single-family market. It sounded like from your comments that you're continuing to think about it. Just wondering if you're feeling -- as we keep getting more and more positive data points on the recovery in the single-family market, that you're feeling increasing concern from competition there. It doesn't sound like it's manifesting itself in the stat yet, but is there something you're thinking about in the quarters ahead?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Yes, Karin. A couple of points on this. I guess, first, I'd say, we've all lived through a period of time where single family was almost a predator of the apartment industry through lax lending and programs that were probably just not, and turned out to be, not right. I don't see that horizon turning, and that was a big fueling engine towards a lot of our results over the last decade, is fighting back homes. If you look over even a longer period horizon, I think homes will start to get back to the 1 million, 1.2 million start number. That's going to be concentrated a lot in the prior homebuilding markets. This exposure of this portfolio today doesn't quite carry the same exposure it has historically at all to that type of marketplace competition. So it seems to weigh less on our mind as a direct competitor because we're just not in those markets that much anymore. And so going future, I don't believe the housing policy in America, that what derailed us for the financial crisis is going to come back into vogue. And I'd see a nice balance, with a healthy recovery in the single-family market, driving jobs. We'll benefit from some of that, and I like our position on a long-term basis.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Paula Poskon, Robert W. Baird.", "Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Jerry, just a follow-up on some of the expense commentary on Page 15 in the supplement. Just wondering what is sort of causing the huge swing or discrepancies between some of the submarkets within even the same region. So for example, Monterey expenses were up 10.5%, but San Diego was down 9.5% or similarly, Dallas is only up 4% but Austin, over 13%. So kind of what's driving those kinds of discrepancies within regions?", "Jerry A. Davis", "Well, Paula, frequently, most of the outliers tend to come from real estate taxes.  Now there are some situations where it's lower or it's something else. For example, in the Monterey Peninsula, the bulk of that increase came from an increase in personnel because we are running that portfolio in the first quarter of last year with quite a few staff openings from natural turnover, plus in the fourth quarter of 2011, as the positions turned, we elected to keep them open for a prolonged period of time. Because it's our slower time of the year, we waded deep into the first quarter to really feel the need to reload that position. But I can tell you as I look at the reasons for all of either large increases or decreases, 80% of the time, it's real estate taxes, either something that happened this year where the valuation increased or last year, we potentially had a refund.", "Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "That's helpful, Jerry. And Tom, just a big-picture question for you. It's been a tremendous 5-year period of activity for UDR. Playing Monday morning quarterback, do you wish you had done anything differently? Or did everything pretty much play out according to plan?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Well, Paula, I'm not one to kind of look in the rearview mirror and try to drive the ship towards the future based on what I would have done differently or not. I think we had a good 5-year period. I think we executed. We communicated. Probably, could have done a better job of communicating our activities, the long-term vision. And that led us to generate the 3-year plan. And clearly, articulate here is where the portfolio is, here's where the portfolio is headed. And we're extremely focused on executing that plan. And so I don't \"Monday quarterback\" a lot other than maybe the Bronco's safety and letting the ball get over his head. But with running the business, we're very focused on that plan.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.", "Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Tom, first question. Just we're basically approaching May right now. As we think about disposition timing relative to your guidance, are you guys marketing anything right now and how do you expect that to play out? As well as additional development starts for the year. I know your guidance previously did not include any additional starts.", "Harry G. Alcock", "Mike, this is Harry. We -- even though we have some dispositions in our guidance, we're working on getting those projects in the market now. Again, as I mentioned earlier, there is terrific investor demand for the type of product we're going to be selling, so we don't anticipate any issues achieving our guidance. Second part of the question with respect to development starts, I think it would be -- it's unlikely that we're going to have any this year. Just given where we are in the entitlement and design process, I wouldn't expect any new starts until early next year.", "Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Just following up on that question then. As you think about -- I mean, consistent with your 3-year plan, kind of developed -- delivering kind of $300 million to $600 million annually. I mean, if you don't start projects in '13, it kind of leaves a hole there in terms of '15 deliveries. How should we think about kind of backfilling the pipeline, if that is? Or is it more -- can you guys take a kind of sit-back approach here looking at potential acquisition opportunities in kind of '15 and '16?", "Jerry A. Davis", "Mike, we've looked at that '15, a little bit of drop-off, and it will probably drop to the $300 million in that year would be kind of the run rate at this point. That doesn't mean that something might come out of the woodwork but I doubt it. With respect to acquisitions in that window of time, we always look at the acquisition markets, but we're going to weigh it against our cost of capital and weigh it against what we think we can do with the asset. And it's hard for me to forecast out what's going to be the environment in '15 given all the variables. But we continue to always examine it under that light.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "So Tom, just kind of a first big-picture question. With Avalon and EQ Irvine, Archstone, do you see this sector kind of going the way the health care REIT sector has gone to a couple of very large companies and then a smaller rung. Or do you think that it's getting closer to a time where M&A, public-to-public M&A, could start to make sense in the space, to get bigger companies?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Rich, it's hard for me to speculate on public M&A in this space. You know what it takes to be successful in that frontier, which is a cost of capital advantage, a G&A cut savings. And I just don't know how those line up in other people's minds. We're focused on our 3-year plan. We'll continue to execute on that. With respect to the debt markets and taking companies private, you're seeing large pools of capital rates. That's probably one of the things that they are looking at is same REITs are cheap compared to private market valuations, leverages are out there and it's abundant and it's an attractive rate. That seems to be probably where I would tilt conversation more to -- than I would towards M&A activity.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. So you don't feel any kind of anxiety about not being very large, relatively speaking, as a company?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "No, I think, Rich, very good question. We weighed, as part of our 3-year strategic plan, about the size and scope of our enterprise. And what our research indicated to us is the top 25 REITs have a distinct and a very tight bandwidth of cost of capital, and it's not very advantageous once you get out the top 5. So our focus and plan over the 3 years was to remain in the top 25 REITs in terms of equity and enterprise value, and we think that plan will sustain us in that range. And don't see the ambition toward getting in the top 5 and trying to create a cost of capital advantage. So I think we thought through that process. We'll continue to monitor the market and how it shifts. But that seems to be the historical trend. And I think it's probably going to be one that will project to the future very well in our view.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Another big picture, if I may. Have you ever worried or do you worry about any kind of regulatory pressures entering the system? You guys, as an industry, did very well pushing rents when we're in the midst of a recession. I'm curious if taking the foot off the accelerator a little bit from a rent perspective and maybe making your money through lower turn, lower CapEx is a model you think that we could be someday approaching as a means to not have that regulatory conversation start to happen. Is that something you would consider?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "No, we continue to monitor it. And I will say that Washington, no one ever sleeps while they're in session. On a state and local level where we do see, from time-to-time, fights on rent controls, it seems, in the end, cities are looking at it from a longer-term perspective and realizing rent control environments do not bring new innovative product to their space, and they resist that. And they want that new innovative because they want to attract the younger, more vibrant workforce. And in our markets, we think that will win out over time, so I'm not overly concerned about rent control in the current environment. Trading off, turnover and rent increases, Jerry weighs that every time he prices a unit. And so we're always looking at it and saying, \"We want this much traffic. We need to get this price point.\" We're going to always try to maximize the value of our assets, and if we feel like a market has reached a point or an asset has reached a point, we'll look at the alternatives. I mean, our job is to allocate capital, get the most out of it. And when that is exhausted, move on and find another place for that capital.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. And then last question, maybe for Tom -- I'm sorry, Mr. Herzog. The issue of holding assets in the TRS, could you just remind me if you can quantify what the kind of benefit is to FFO from doing that, if any? I just don't remember. Is there like a flow-through that you get because of that strategy?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Yes. We have, in our guidance, a number, $12 million for 2013. It was in at, I think, $9 million for 2012 so that is the benefit that does flow through.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "That's just a tax benefit. Is that right?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "It was a tax benefit, correct.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Do you take it out when you look at operating FFO or whatever you call it?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "No, we don't. We did take out the removal of the valuation allowance last year. That was a carve-out that occurred in the first quarter, and that had been reduced from the FFO, the core FFO and for that matter, the FFO itself. But in the exact sense of itself, it does flow through.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "It smelled a little bit like Archstone when they were booking gains because they did things in the TRS into FFO. I mean, is that kind of the path you want to go down from an FFO definition perspective? Any thought about just taking that out? It's a small number, why bother with it anyway?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "It's been something that was in our numbers, from a comparability perspective. We'll keep it in there. It is part of our run rate. Again, I do see that declining over the next couple of years, so we'll continue to present it as we have.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors.", "Dave Bragg", "I just wanted to follow-up on a couple of comments that you made and ask a question on it. Tom, you mentioned that the amount of capital in the multifamily space remains deep. Harry, I think you observed flat cap rates continuing, but we'd all agree that NOI growth outlooks are moderating. So to what extent do you observe that buyers are continuing to lower their return requirements? And are you noticing that from your JV partners specifically?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "This is Tom. I'll take a first shot at it, and let anybody else clean up on it. What I think of this is, first, there's lots of long-term yield-oriented investors out there that are interested and have been underexposed to multifamily and are gaining an appreciation for the asset class and are growing their asset base. And I think second buyers, the levered buyer who's taking advantage of extremely low rates continues to be deep and hunting a lot of the B-type portfolio, where they could add extra leverage. The institutional-quality, coastal A buyer, low-levered buyer, it's a safe haven for money in their view, and probably will continue to be buyers in the future. So I don't think they're overly concerned about a degregrading [ph] NOI curve when they look at the long-term alternatives and believe that coastal, high-quality urban product has a long-term growth trajectory, which is probably going to be more prevalent as we see costs rise for replacements, as well as NOIs. So I think they're in for the long-term haul, and I would expect the asset class to do well, not just in the public space, but in the private space.", "Dave Bragg", "Okay. And speaking of rising construction costs. It seems as though yours were pretty well contained with the exception of Mission Bay. A bit of an uptick there. Is that project-specific? And while we're touching on that, can you just comment on the supply outlook for that submarket?", "Harry G. Alcock", "Dave, this is Harry Alcock. With respect to Mission Bay specifically, that was project-specific. There's couple of reasons for it. One is we intentionally slowed the rate of unit deliveries, given that first units are scheduled for delivery in October so that added something to our carry costs. Second as we went through and assessed the project, we found that we could get paid for improving the quality of the product in a manner that will allow us to standout from our competitor. So we did things like added AC, we upgraded the unit interior finishes and we upgraded our wireless system. We did this whole thing in a lower cost environment, meaning that we expect that our costs, even with these upgrades, will be lower than competing developments or these changes did force a change in our overall reported development cost.", "Jerry A. Davis", "And Dave, this is Jerry. I think you had asked about supply coming. And what we're seeing is somewhere in the 1,000 to 1,500 units coming through the end of 2014 down in that Mission Bay submarket.", "Dave Bragg", "Okay, that's helpful. And on this project specifically, where do you see your rents on a per square foot basis coming out?", "Harry G. Alcock", "Well, we're going to be well above $3 a foot, well above $3.50 a foot. When we begin our lease-up here in the next 3 to 4 months, we will again look at rent expectations. As you probably know, the San Francisco market has been very, very strong. These units have continued to reprice, and we'll look at it again, but we'll be above $3.50 a foot.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.", "Haendel St. Juste", "So 2 questions. I want to go back to the comprehensive 3-year strategic plan that you laid out on last quarter's call. I'm curious how some of your near-term outlook on sources and uses could change if your stock continue'  to trade below NAV. In conjunction with attractive unsecured bond market pricing and the relatively attractive pricing for well-located, good-quality assets. So just thinking how some of the numbers you laid out could change against a backdrop that I just laid out.", "Thomas M. Herzog", "This is Tom Herzog. When we look at the assumptions in the 3-year strategy, we spoke to a certain amount of equity issuance, some bond offerings, some sales, and those all are ways to generate capital. And I'm going to add to that proceeds from joint venture transactions, where we might bring a partner in. And I think as we look outward, first of all, we've got conversations going on, on a number of fronts in some of these areas. And so what we end up doing is going to be dictated by the outcome of those conversations. As far as the bond markets, they definitely do look good. Rates look favorable. From a stock perspective right now, we're trading at a discount. As we indicated in the last call, we're very unlikely to want to issue stock at a discount to our NAV. So all those factors will come into play, and we'll see what transpires over the next several months. For now, we have not modified those assumptions in our 3-year strategy, but certainly, over the next quarter or so, I would imagine we'll have a better insight into what that will look like, that we'll be able to provide to you.", "Haendel St. Juste", "Okay. And one more here, specifically on asset sales. We've seen a number of your public peers sell some D.C. assets recently at pretty good pricing. Curious how you view your current D.C. exposure today in light of those recent asset sales, but also against the backdrop of moderating growth and the supply wave?", "Jerry A. Davis", "I'm sorry, Haendel, our D.C. asset sales?", "Haendel St. Juste", "Curious -- we've seen Equity, Avalon and Lehman Brothers sell assets in D.C. here over the last few weeks, few months. And so I'm curious how you think about your D.C. portfolio in light of the attractive pricing that's available against the backdrop of the slowing growth we're seeing in D.C. and the mounting supply wave that's coming into D.C.", "Jerry A. Davis", "I think we look at our portfolio sort of on a regular basis to decide which assets we're going to sell. We expect to find very strong pricing in many of our markets. And typically, if you're going to sell an asset, you'd prefer to sell an asset that has sort of robust, expected short-term revenue and NOI increase as opposed to assets that, just from an investor standpoint, have slightly lower. I mean, your pricing simply is going to be better. Does that answer your question?", "Haendel St. Juste", "To a certain degree. But just more curious as to we've seen others pare back their exposure there. Just curious as to your -- not just the portfolio and its prospects, but just do you feel that it might be a good time to pare back and capitalize on some of the full -- the rather full pricing that people appear to be getting for D.C. assets?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Hendel, this is Toomey. With respect to the portfolio, I articulated earlier a little bit of our strategy about the size of the enterprise. And how we expect it to be over the next 3-year period. And from that, what we drove down was a submarket ranking of our portfolio, and from there, really look at it and said, \"How much do we want to have in D.C. to have a balanced portfolio?\" Today, we're at that target. What we will always look at is the pricing of assets, the use of capital. We'll weigh it as time goes by. We're not really kind of trying to tie markets in our overall philosophy. What we're trying to do is buying the best submarkets with long-term cash flow appreciation and value. We think we have a great portfolio in D.C. that fits very well in many of those submarkets, as you can see in Jerry's recent market performance relative to peers. And it's taken us a decade to assemble this portfolio. We're a long-term holder. We're not going to flip it out when market conditions are just right for a day. We're a long-term holder. We're comfortable where we're at, and we think there is other places where we can maximize our capital utilization and recycling in D.C. in this current cycle right now.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. For closing remarks, I would like to turn the conference back to Tom Toomey, President and CEO.", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Well, thanks, all of you, for participating on today's call. Certainly, you can see we feel very good about our business after 1 quarter.

Welcome to UDR's Fourth Quarter 2013 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded today, Tuesday, February 4, 2014. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Chris Van Ens, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Christopher G. Van Ens", "Welcome to UDR's Fourth Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. Our fourth quarter press release, supplemental disclosure package and updated Three-Year Strategy overview document were distributed earlier today and posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, www.udr.com.", "In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in accordance with Reg G requirements.", "Prior to reading our Safe Harbor disclosure, I would like to direct you to the webcast of this call located in the Investor Relations section of our website, www.udr.com. The webcast includes a slide presentation that will accompany our Three-Year Strategic outlook commentary.", "On to our Safe Harbor. I would like to note that statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met.", "A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in this morning's press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.", "[Operator Instructions] Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered on the call.", "I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to UDR's Fourth Quarter Conference Call. On the call with me today are Tom Herzog, Chief Financial Officer; and Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our results, as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available to answer questions during the Q&A portion of the call.", "My comments will be brief.", "First, all aspects of our business continued to perform well in the fourth quarter, which concluded in outstanding 2013. Apartment fundamentals in the majority of our markets remained favorable and we have strong momentum going into 2014, as is reflected in our guidance, which is above Street estimates.", "Second, we met or exceeded all first year objectives as presented in our initial Three-Year Plan that was introduced last February. Following Tom's and Jerry's remarks, we will update you on a new Three-Year Plan, which covers the period from 2014 through 2016.", "Finally, I'd like to thank all my fellow associates for their hard work in producing a great year for UDR. We look forward to 2014.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Thanks, Tom. The topics I will cover today include: first, our fourth quarter and full year 2013 results; second, a balance sheet and debt maturity update; third, a development and redevelopment update; fourth, an overview of fourth quarter and post year-end transaction; and last, a first quarter and full year 2014 guidance.", "I'll begin with our fourth quarter results. FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $0.36, $0.35 and $0.30, respectively. Full year 2013 FFO per share was $1.44, inclusive of $0.05 of Hurricane Sandy insurance recovery. Our 2013 FFO as adjusted per share was $1.39, inclusive of $0.01 of Hurricane Sandy business interruption recoveries relative to lost rental revenues in 2013. And full year AFFO per share was $1.23.", "Moving onto the balance sheet. At year end, our financial leverage on an undepreciated cost basis was 39%; on a fair value basis, it was 32%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 7.0x, consistent with our expectation at the beginning of 2013.", "Moving ahead, we will continue to manage to BBB+ credit metric while gradually deleveraging our balance sheet through nondilutive actions.", "From a liquidity perspective, our balance sheet remains in good shape with $930 million of available funds at the end of the fourth quarter, consisting of cash and credit facility capacity. Including extensions, we have $312 million of maturing debt in 2014 at a weighted average interest rate of 5.3%. 140 -- $184 million of this was paid off by the revolver on January 15. We intend to refinance these obligations in the unsecured markets during the second quarter of 2014.", "Turning to development. Before I provide an update, I would like to remind everyone how we define our pipeline. Our development pipeline includes all projects that are pro-rata ownership share outlined on Attachment 9 or Page 21 of our quarterly supplement. This equates to a $1.2 billion pipeline at year end, 64% of which has been funded.", "We completed 3 projects at $275 million of development during the fourth quarter at a weighted average spread between expected trended yield and current market cap rates of approximately 185 basis points. Of these completions, Bella Terra in Huntington Beach and 13th and Market in San Diego are estimated to perform at or above the upper end of our targeted 150 to 200 basis point trended range. Fiori, a Vitruvian Park community in Addison, Texas is coming in below our targeted range, though will still be accretive to earnings and NAV.", "Our remaining pipeline, $300 million of which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2014, is trending as a whole within our targeted range.", "During the quarter, we announced 2 new projects, both in core markets. The first, 399 Fremont, a $318 million development in San Francisco, broke ground in mid-January. 399 Fremont is a 51-49 development partnership with MetLife. UDR's share of the project equates to $162 million. The second is Steele Creek, a $108 million development in Denver, which broke ground in the fourth quarter. Steele Creek is being constructed under a participating debt structure, which is a new structure for UDR, but the economics are advantageous. There's a substantial equity piece in front of our participating loan, we are paid 6.5% current and we'll receive 50% of the upside upon subsequent purchase of the asset by UDR or sale to a third party.", "As to future development projects, we are carefully underwriting opportunities. In addition to our land bank outlined on Attachment 11 or Page 23, we recently acquired for $78 million the land for the development of Pacific City, a fully entitled 516-home community located in Huntington Beach, California. The site has immediate access to the Pacific Coast Highway and is only 3 blocks from the Huntington Beach pier. Looking ahead, we expect to announce a couple of new starts in the second half of 2014.", "On to redevelopment. We increased the scope and budget of our Rivergate redevelopment in Manhattan. The revised budget is $98 million and includes limited scope renovations on additional units, the addition of 33 homes as some large floor plans are split into 2 homes, upgraded corridors as well as other revenue-generating opportunities.", "At 27 Seventy Five Mesa Verde in Orange County, we are choosing to table for the foreseeable future the redevelopment of 216 homes that were in the original scope of the project given current demand trends in that particular submarket.", "Next, we sold $132 million in noncore assets in the fourth quarter. We exited the Sacramento market and disposed of a noncore asset in the Boston metro area. The average age of the Sacramento assets was 31 years and the 3 communities were sold at a weighted average cap rate of approximately 6%.", "In addition to the sale, we consolidated our 13th and Market and Domain College Park joint venture development as we assumed the role of managing partner in both ventures during the quarter.", "Following year end, we closed on the sale of Presidio for approximately $49 million, a noncore community located in North County, San Diego. The 27-year-old property had an average revenue per occupied home of $1,485 in the fourth quarter and was sold at a 5.4% cap rate.", "On to 2014 guidance. Our 2014 FFO and FFO as adjusted guidance per share are $1.47 to $1.53. Our 2014 AFFO guidance is $1.30 to $1.36 per share, an 8% increase at the midpoint over 2013 and includes $1,100 of maintenance CapEx per stabilized home.", "There are a number of moving parts, but the primary drivers of our expected AFFO growth from 2013 to 2014 of $1.23 to $1.33 at the midpoint includes mature and nonmature NOI growth of $0.08; development and redevelopment earn-in, net of funding costs of $0.03; and a reduction in development and redevelopment [indiscernible] of $0.01. These benefits are offset by $0.01 in dilution from expected recycling of noncore assets via 1031 transactions and $0.01 from higher CapEx.", "In 2014, we anticipate same-store revenue growth of 3.5% to 4.25%, same-store expense growth of 2.75% to 3.25% and same-store NOI growth of 3.75% to 5.0%.", "Other primary assumptions can be found on Attachment 15 or Page 27 of our supplement.", "First quarter 2014 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance are $0.34 to $0.36, $0.33 to $0.35 and $0.30 to $0.32, respectively.", "Finally, we are increasing our 2014 declared dividend by 11% year-over-year to an annualized $1.04 per share from $0.94 per share in 2013.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Jerry.", "Jerry A. Davis", "Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks, I'll cover the following topics: first, fourth quarter and full year 2013 operating results; second, the performance of our core markets during the fourth quarter; third, a brief update on our development lease-ups; and lastly, market performance expectations for 2014.", "We're pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. In the fourth quarter, same-store net operating income grew 5.4%, driven by a 4.5% year-over-year increase in revenue against a 2.4% increase in expenses.", "Our same-store revenue per occupied home increased by 4.2% year-over-year to $1,509 per month. Our same-store occupancy is 96.2%, was 30 basis points higher year-over-year.", "For the full year 2013, same-store revenue grew to 4.9%, expenses increased 2.6% and NOI grew by 6%, all exceeding our original forecast at the midpoint from last February.", "Turning to new and renewal lease rates. Fourth quarter effective rental rates on new leases increased by 1.3%. Renewal rate growth remained strong at 5.2%. San Francisco, Seattle and Portland performed well, while the Mid-Atlantic region struggled. Further details can be found on Attachment 8(NYSE:G) or Page 20 of our supplement.", "Annualized turnover in the fourth quarter decreased by 220 basis points year-over-year and was 80 basis points lower on a full year basis. Lower turnover for the fourth quarter was the result of our efforts in 2012 to move lease expirations out of the fourth quarter and into the second and third quarters. This was done because new lease rate growth is typically more than 200 basis points higher in those quarters than in the fourth quarter.", "Rent, as a percentage of our residents' income, held steady at roughly 17%. Move-outs to home purchase were up 50 basis points year-over-year at 13.9% in the fourth quarter.", "Next, we'll talk about quarterly performance in our primary core markets. New supply in metro D.C. continues to be an issue with significant deliveries expected in 2014. While we are not immune to the negative effects of new supply, we continue to believe our diverse mix of A and B product, as well as less direct submarket exposure to new supply, will help us fare better than many of our peers in 2014.", "New York City experienced some pricing pressure in late 4Q 2013 through mid-January of 2014 as we anniversaried off of Hurricane Sandy. With many units out of service throughout Lower Manhattan and Zone A during late 2012 and early 2013, pricing was abnormally strong in unaffected properties on the island. In the fourth quarter of 2013, all of these apartments that were off-line last year were fully recovered. So 12-month leases commanded less pricing power throughout the city. We have cycled through this issue and expect to see normalized demand over the remainder of 2014.", "Orange County and Los Angeles employment growth is improving, and with limited new supply, both markets are expected to perform well in 2014.", "We achieved 90% stabilized occupancy at our 467-home Bella Terra development in Huntington Beach in December and we're currently 96% leased. This is just 7 months after accepting our first unit, which means we averaged 60 move-ins per month and have yet to offer a concession.", "San Francisco remains very strong with expected 2014 job growth of more than 3%, primarily consisting of higher-paying professional jobs. We're seeing good demand throughout the city, the Peninsula and Silicon Valley with some moderate pricing pressure in North San Jose where new supply is more prominent.", "Channel, our new development in Mission Bay, is 43% leased just one month after opening its doors at higher rates than initially expected. New supply is coming to downtown Seattle. The job growth is expected to absorb it. Our A and B properties in metro Seattle continue to perform well.", "Boston was one of our better markets in 2013. Currently, it is at an unseasonally slower period of the year and it has been negatively affected by abnormally poor weather over the past 45 days.", "Lastly, Dallas is generating a significant number of jobs right now, but is also facing heavy new supply. We are feeling some effects from supply in Uptown and Plano, but believe Dallas will be an above average market for us in 2014.", "Turning to development. During the quarter, we completed 725 homes and spent approximately $76 million. As of the end of 2013, we had spent $800 million on our $1.2 billion development pipeline.", "Bella Terra in Huntington Beach, Channel at Mission Bay in San Francisco and 13th and Market in San Diego comprised $371 million in aggregate estimated cost. Weighted average effective rents are currently 10% above plan and leasing velocity is 16%, ahead of expectations. Each of these lease-ups continues to go well.", "Los Alisos in Mission Viejo, Domain College Park across the street from the University of Maryland Business School and Fiori at our Vitruvian Park JV in Addison, Texas comprised $201 million in aggregate estimated cost. Weighted average effective rents are 3% below plan, while leasing velocity is 19% below where we would have expected at this point. As the spring leasing season arrives, we expect these -- that leasing at these projects will pick up.", "Still, all in, we're comfortable with how the lease-ups are progressing in aggregate.", "Finally, I have a couple of comments regarding market revenue growth expectations in 2014. We expect San Francisco and Seattle to be among our best-performing markets. Southern California, Texas and the Northeast are expected to grow in excess of the 4.25% top end of our portfolio same-store guidance. These markets comprise over 50% of our total NOI. The Mid-Atlantic region is expected to be our weakest region once again. Page 13 of our updated Three-Year Strategic outlook has additional information on our market growth expectations.", "With that, I will remind those listening that there is a link to our updated Three-Year Strategic document on the Investor Relations page of our website. We'll pause for a moment so that everyone can gather the Three-Year Plan materials.", "I will now turn the call back over to Tom Toomey to present our updated Three-Year Plan.", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Thanks, Jerry. Let's move on to our 2014 to 2016 Strategic Plan. Last February, we communicated that the heavy lifting of our portfolio and balance sheet repositioning was largely completed. At that time, we rolled out our 2013 to 2015 strategic plan. As we measure our actual 2013 results against the plan, I'm pleased to tell you that we met or exceeded each of our 2013 goals. We view our updated plan merely as an extension of last year's plan, given that strategic priorities are unchanged.", "We have 4 primary strategic priorities, which you will find on Page 3. These are: one, investing our shareholders' capital in accretive growth opportunities that improve our portfolio; second, continuing to generate best-in-class operating results; third, drive cash flow, dividend and NAV growth; and fourth, continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. We believe successful execution of these priorities will optimize total shareholder return for our investors over time.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom to discuss the details of the plan.", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Thanks, Tom. Please turn to Page 4 of the strategic outlook presentation. As Tom mentioned, we met or exceeded all 2013 primary objectives in our original plan. First, we completed approximately $400 million of accretive development in 2013 and expect that our remaining pipeline will continue to create value. Second, we ended 2013 ahead of all original annual guidance expectations for same-store and cash flow growth. In addition, during 2013, we raised our dividend by 7% and we'll raise it an additional 11% in 2014. Third, all of our primary year-end balance sheet metrics were in line with our expectations set forth at the outset of 2013. We continue to manage the BBB+, Baa1 metrics.", "Please turn to Page 5. Development remains accretive and will continue to be a primary mean to which we improve our portfolio and grow our company. Our primarily coastal and urban pipeline of $1.2 billion will be completed over the next 3 years, yet sized less than 10% of our enterprise value and at 64% funded. The remaining spend of $440 million will come from either equity issuance or sale of assets.", "We continue to target annual spend in the range of $400 million to $600 million per year and a trended spread versus cap rates of 150 to 200 basis points. Recently, we have tightened our underwriting standards to reflect rising costs and less robust forward rent growth assumptions. Fewer deals will pencil in today's environment, but we are still finding accretive opportunities.", "Please turn to Page 6. On this page, we provide Seattle pipeline statistics. Our pipeline is primarily coastal and urban. Including our land with MetLife, our Seattle pipeline totals $1 billion to $1.3 billion at 100% ownership. 85% of this potential pipeline is owned in partnership with MetLife. Our current ownership share in 7 UDR/MetLife I JV land parcels is just 4%. This provides optionality at the conclusion of the entitlement processes for these parcels. When assessing the optimal size of our development pipeline, we weighed balance sheet risk, drag to our earnings stream and AFFO and NAV accretion from the successful completion of current and potential projects.", "Please turn to Page 7. In 2014, we anticipate our development projects will generate $0.05 of FFO per share drag and $0.025 of accretion. Upon stabilization of each project at our targeted trended spread, we expect annual FFO accretion of $0.06 per share and continued growth thereafter. Cumulative NAV accretion is estimated at $2.10 per share during the construction and lease-up phases of our development.", "Please turn to Page 8. Our operations remains strong as exhibited by the chart in the middle of the page. We have consistently produced better top line growth over an extended time period than the multi-family average. Though we are not sitting idle. Jerry and his team continue to improve our operations. Our focus on technology, and more recently, our emphasis on driving repair and maintenance efficiencies are 2 examples. These investments are enhancing our margins and continue to improve our residents' experience. Moving forward, we expect to generate strong operating results as evidenced by the same-store growth assumptions presented over the life of the plan in the chart at the bottom of the page.", "Please turn to Page 9. A primary tenet of our Three-Year Plan is to drive AFFO, NAV and CVNI growth. We anticipate 2014 and 2015 being good years. Looking at the chart -- at the top chart, AFFO per share growth is forecasted at 7% to 9% in 2014. I discussed the 2014 drivers in my earlier remarks.", "Growth in 2015 is expected to be similar to 2014. Our 2016 expectations are negatively affected by fewer development starts in 2013 and higher interest rate assumptions. However, our crystal ball gets hazier the further out we look.", "The bottom 2 charts show expected NAV per share growth and CVNI, both assuming a flat cap rate environment. Applying our next 3 years' expected growth to our 2013 NAV per share implies an NAV of approximately $36 in 2016, a 30% increase over 2013. We anticipate annual CVNI of approximately 12% through 2016. This is consistent with our long-term average historical growth. However, historical cap rate compression contributed significantly to CVNI whereas, going forward, accretive development returns are expected to help drive CVNI.", "Please turn to Page 10. We continue to focus on net debt-to-EBITDA, leverage and fixed charge coverage when evaluating the strength of our balance sheet and anticipate our metrics will further improve over the life of the plan. Same-store growth and development earn-in are the primary drivers of our forecasted improvement in net debt-to-EBITDA and fixed charge coverage.", "Please turn to Page 11. Pages 11 and 12 provide our 2014 guidance and 2015/2016 cumulative expectations.", "Please turn to Page 13. Our 2014 growth assumptions for our markets are presented on the map. The West Coast and Northeast are expected to grow at above -- at an above average rate in 2014, while the Mid-Atlantic is likely to continue to struggle, but is still expected to perform better than our peers due to our 50-50 mix of As and Bs in D.C. and less direct exposure to new supply.", "Please turn to Page 14. As Tom indicated earlier, we view this update as a continuation of our previous Strategic Plan. In the charts, the midpoints of our cumulative Three-Year expectations for the 2013 to '15 time period are relatively similar or improved when compared to our updated plan for these years to our previous plan.", "I'll now turn it back over to Tom for final remarks.", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Thank you, Tom. I've had the pleasure of being UDR's CEO for 13 years now. Our mission over the first decade was to reposition the portfolio and the balance sheet. The last couple of years we have spent finalizing the transition of the previous decade, as well as positioning the company for strong cash flow growth.", "The next decade will continue to focus on long-term cash flow growth, which is the focus of this plan. In our view, this plan remains the best avenue for creating value for our shareholders. Our team remains highly focused everyday on executing it.", "From time-to-time, during discussions with our investors and analysts, we were asked, what differentiates UDR from our peers? I believe there are several value-creation drivers that are applicable to the multifamily space, and currently, UDR is uniquely positioned to take advantage of each of them.", "First, we have the necessary skill to garner cost of capital and G&A efficiencies, but are small enough that moderately-sized transactions still move the value-creation needle.", "Second, we have a best-in-class operating platform.", "Third, we have substantially and accretive development program.", "Fourth, our portfolio is primarily bicoastal, but diverse enough to generate strong results in a variety of economic environments.", "And lastly, we have a unique relationship with a Fortune 50 company in MetLife that affords us favorable capital along with opportunities unavailable to many others.", "I will conclude my remarks by observing that the most vital component of successful execution of our plan is our people. I'm fortunate to have in place an experienced and dedicated team, of customer-focused associates and believe we will achieve outstanding results against each of our priorities we have set forth today.", "With that, I'll open up the call to Q&A. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup.", "Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "In terms of the equity issuance assumed in 2014 guidance and the Three-Year Plan, if your stock continues to trade at discount, will you forego that equity? And if so, how do you expect to replace that capital?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Nick, Tom Herzog. Yes, if we're not trading at or above NAV, we will forego that equity issuance and would replace it with additional asset sales from our capital warehouse or noncore markets.", "Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then, Jerry, can you give the new and renewal rate growth by month for January than where renewals are going out for February and March?", "Jerry A. Davis", "By every market?", "Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "No, no. Total, total portfolio.", "Jerry A. Davis", "Oh, sure. January, new rent growth was 0.1%. The lows were once again the Mid-Atlantic where it was in the 4s, down 4%. We did have some strength in the Pacific Northwest, as well as San Francisco where it was up around 5% to 6%. Then renewals in January were signed at 4.9%. We're sending out 5% to 5.2% for the remainder of this quarter. I would add, we do expect new lease growth for the quarter to average out to about 1.3%. It does look like it's going to accelerate the following 2 months and that compares to about 2.2% in the first quarter of last year. We think renewals will average for the first quarter of this year 5% and that's down from about 5.8% last year.", "Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then where's occupancy at the end of January?", "Jerry A. Davis", "At the end of January, it was about 96.1%, 96.2%. As of yesterday, after we had some month in move-outs, it was 95.9% and that's 20 basis points higher than the same time last year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "The first question is on slide -- I just turned it, on Slide 7, Tom. You guys talk about $1.2 billion development pipeline that should be about $0.06 accretive. If my quick math, which is always a dangerous thing, is right, that seems to imply about a 1.3% spread. Last week, Avalon talked about a 250 basis point spread on their development program verse [ph] funding source. So can you just comment a little bit more? Is this just adding in cushion just because it's a forward projection and therefore you have no way of knowing where disposition pricing may be or equity pricing may be? Or is this just -- or is there something else going on here?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "No, Alex, as we look at the development program, that $0.06 is based on our current portfolio, which we'd call it, it's in the middle of the range, between the 150 to 200 basis point spread. And if you run that math, you'll see the drag that results from it. You'll see the accretion that builds in that, at the point of stabilization, it will produce that $0.06. So that is based on pretty much right down the middle at 175 basis point spread from the cap rates in those corresponding markets. That's how the math will work.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. So it's 175?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Yes.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. And then...", "Thomas M. Herzog", "It's actually just -- it's slightly -- it's just slightly higher than 175. I think we're running more like just maybe 10 basis points higher than that on average across the modeling that we've done on our portfolio currently, but just call it in that range. It will be about $0.06.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. So the $0.06 is not the 175, the $0.06 more reflects the impact of timing?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Timing, but probably call it 180 to 185 basis point spread.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. Next question is for Mr. Toomey. Putting on your big picture hat, if you took a read of the Essex-BRE proxy, it looks like there were only 4 companies that were sort of interested in BRE and only 1 bid. In your view, looking over the history of M&A in REIT land, is it your view that it's typical that M&A only comes down to maybe 1, maybe 2 people who actually throw in bids? Or you think it's a reflection of where pricing is today or companies' hesitancy to engage in deals because of where stock prices are?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Well, Alex, I've been at it a long time even through the '94 window where we started out with 36 public companies. And there, it was a race to get larger and it was a cost of capital multiple game. I think what you have today is 10 companies that are very well run, they're very efficient, there's not a lot of upside in the companies and so that brings down how we can create value for the future investor to really cause capital advantage and that shrinks the pool of potential buyers. I think there's probably more value to be brought in the private space and that's where people are headed today and you can see it in their accumulation of portfolios. So I think these are just well-run companies, hard to see a lot of upside in it and that just shrinks the pool of buyers. That's all I observe.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS.", "Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "A couple of just quick modeling questions. One, could you give the capitalized interest estimate for 2014?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Yes. We've got that. I think that's something that we normally don't lay out in detail, but you can take what we had last year and then we speak to the change in cap interest from 1 year to the next. So I think you can back into it.", "Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. Sorry, what was the change in cap interest this year versus last year you said, you talked about that?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "It's $0.01 on the development and redevelopment projects.", "Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, got you. And then on D.C., I was hoping to get a little bit more detail on what your same-store revenue expectation is for the market this year?", "Jerry A. Davis", "Sure. This is Jerry. Our expectation is in 2014, we, like everyone else, will see a deceleration in D.C. due to new supply. We do continue to believe D.C. will be positive, albeit a low positive revenue growth, probably call it in the 1% to 2% range. What we think we have that some of our peers don't is locations that are less indirect path of new supply, as well as a portfolio that is a little over half of B quality rather than A and those definitely don't go head-to-head as much. We have 2 or 3 markets where new supply is coming at us, one's out in Manassas, one is the U Street Corridor and the third one is in Woodbridge. But many of our properties that are within true Washington D.C. are not in the same neighborhoods as the new supply. But I can tell you, you see it in the supplement where we show what new rents were in fourth quarter, we have seen a deceleration in what we can get on new rents, but we are continuing to see renewals go out in the 3% to 4% range and we are holding occupancy.", "Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then just one last question on the Three-Year Plan. It looks like, based on some of the development spend projections, that you're going to start -- I guess, target to start roughly $1 billion of additional development. And what I'm wondering is going back to that $0.06 FFO benefit once stabilized on the current $1.2 billion development pipeline, I mean, is that going to be a similar type of FFO benefit if you do, in fact, start $1 billion -- a little over $1 billion of development?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "You've got to remember that if we take the $1.2 billion pipeline, that's completed over a period of about 3 years, 2.5 to 3 years, let's say. So we assume $400 million to $600 million of spend per year. You're correct that the $0.06 is the completion of the existing $1.2 billion development. We had starts at the end of 2013 of about $250 million. We expect a couple more projects to be announced probably the latter half of 2014, but we haven't announced a specific dollar amount of new development starts in 2014 at this date yet. But we're still underwriting to the 150 to 200 basis point trended spread over cap rates, so the kind of accretion that you would see for the types of projects that we're approving on a relative size basis would be similar.", "Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I guess I was just trying to figure out. I mean, if the development spending is supposed to total $1.5 billion from 2014 to 2016, you have about $450 million left on the existing pipeline. That seems to imply about $1 billion of incremental starts.", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Yes, you guys go to our Seattle pipeline page and you'll find in...", "Unknown Executive", "Page 6.", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Page 6. Yes, Page 6. If you took the ownership effective numbers and assume that the UDR/MetLife numbers were at 50-50 by the time we [indiscernible] development, along with our 100% owned stuff, you get an ownership effective number in the $600 million to $750 million range, plus you've got Pacific City on top of that. So those -- we do have already a Seattle pipeline in place on top of what's already under development. So for the time frame that we're looking at, I think, we're in good shape for what we're speaking to of $400 million to $600 million per year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Just looking at Page 8 of the slides. It looks like your '15, '16 same-store revenue growth expectations are roughly in line just a little bit below what you're expecting for '14. Can you just talk about what fundamental underpinning gives you the confidence that revenue growth will stay steady here for 3 years and what you think the biggest risk to that are?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Yes. Again, this is Tom and I'm going to -- Herzog and I'm going to pass it to Jerry. But Karin, a variety of different things. And the further out we go, of course, the harder it is to make these estimates. But we've looked at the AXIO data, the Moody's data, all the different pieces that you guys write and have put our own views toward that, we've got an improved job market that should more than offset the new supply estimates in our -- the vast majority of our markets over the next 2 to 3 years. In the markets that are being hit harder, like a D.C., a Seattle and a Austin, our specific locations within each of these markets has sheltered us from the rent deceleration experienced by some of our peers. We see supply flattening out in the latter half of '14 and first half of '15 due to the higher construction costs, interest rate, the less explosive rate growth. And another point that I think is worth making is just take a look at what's happened with single-family housing. If you took a home 12 months ago and then looked at the year-over-year increase in value, it's about 12%, higher in some of our markets, but 12% across all markets. And if you took mortgage rates, it's up -- they're up 120 basis points from a 3.5 base. Add that together, do the math, that's about a 30% increase in mortgage payments. That, along with social patterns that continue to favor rent-in, we're just seeing that the growth is going to continue to be favorable. So when we look at a 3.9% 2014 growth, kind of flattening out to 3.75% in '15. '16 is kind of a long ways to look out, but we're not seeing anything that looks different than that, but again it's hazier, we feel pretty good about it. But Jerry, maybe more on some specifics as to how you see it?", "Jerry A. Davis", "Sure. Hi Karin, just a few things I would add to what Tom Herzog said. First, when we look out into '15 and '16 and what's projected for job growth, we look in our core markets and we see that job growth is projected to be 20 to 30 basis points higher in our core markets. In addition to that, we see that new supply growth is probably going to be a little below average in '15 and '16 after being above the national average in '13 and '14. Also, when we go back and look at what percentage of households are renters, in our core market, it's 42% compared to 35% as a national average. So we see those stats and it's encouraging. One other thing is, when you look at an urban platform that we've really moved towards, many of our residents don't own cars. They rely on public transportation. And one interesting tidbit I picked up a few weeks ago at the National Multi-Housing Conference was that transportation costs are the second largest cost component of these households. So when I look at a suburban household of renters that have 2 drivers, you're probably talking transportation cost when you include car payment, insurance, gas, repairs, tolls, parking, things like that, are well over $1,000 a month. Most of my residents don't have that cost. And in addition, when I look at my percentage of rent to income across all of my markets, it typically is falling out anywhere between 15% and 20% regardless of the market. So we do feel that those urban renters, if you're getting normal pay increases, let's say 2% to 3% across-the-board, will better be able to handle increases over time than our suburban peers.", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Tom, anything you'd add?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Yes. Karin, I think it's a very good question. And when I back up and look through all the detail that Tom and Jerry go through to build this up, what you realize about our '14, '15 and '16 outlook, I'd throw this observation at it. '14 and '15 are going to look very much alike, in our view. Well then why do we have a lot of high comfort around that aspect of it, it's clearly that we have high visibility on new supply, we have a very good feel about employment picture about our individual markets. And so, we feel very good about the '14, '15 aspects of it. And as you get out to '16, it's very hard to ask our site teams to build up a projection, to understand supply, growth dynamics. And so we ended up defaulting to a lot of third-party analysis to arrive at '16. And I think that's a relatively conservative view, but one that is easily explained. And as I would take it away from your chair, I'd say, these guys feel very confident about their '14, '15 forecast and they're going to look a lot alike at this point in time. And '16 is just a wildcard that's a long time off into the future and certainly, as we get closer, we'll have a better visibility and, we hope, a more optimistic view of it.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "My second question just on guidance, question for Jerry. On Page 13, you give a lot of nice market-specific information. Are there any of your markets that you're expecting to accelerate from a same-store revenue growth perspective versus 2013?", "Jerry A. Davis", "Yes. I'd tell you, there's a few that could accelerate slightly. Right now, Orlando is very strong as we enter this year. I could see it holding up well. I'm hopeful, although I say this every year about Orange County and L.A., we've had modest results there the last year or so. We've had a good start in January of this year, and I think those potentially could be a little bit better. And the other one that just continues to chug, even though it's a very small market for us, is Portland.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "And would Boston potentially be in that category as well, or because you had a good year in '13, maybe not?", "Jerry A. Davis", "No. It will not be. I'll tell you, we killed it in 2013. I want to say our total full year revenue growth was upwards of 8%, if I remember correctly. And to replicate -- it was 7.7%. To replicate this year, things would have to turn around quite a bit. It's going to be a good market, but it won't be as great as it was last year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Bragg with Green Street Advisors.", "David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to follow-up on Nick's earlier question, and I'm hoping that you can point us in the right direction as it relates to the equity issuance assumptions that you have in '15, '16. If it's an unfortunate circumstance that the stock is not there for you over that time period, can you just walk us through what the alternatives are, whether it's significantly more dispositions than you plan here or higher leverage?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Yes. Dave, thanks for that. It definitely is not higher leverage. That's not the direction we're going. We have the benefit of having a $1.2 billion capital warehouse portfolio that we're in no rush to sell, but yet, those are assets over time that we'll prune in a $300 million non-core portfolio. When I think about equity issuance, of course, we think about it on a cost of equity. But when you look at it on an annual cost, as it might apply to this plan, it's probably right around a 5% cost of -- an annual cost of funds on an AFFO yield basis. You compare that to sales and assume that we've got a fixed cap NOI cap rate, and that would include some sprinkling too, of some non-core assets in core markets. That equates to about a 5.5% cash flow cap rate, so not terribly different than what the equity would look like to the bottom line of our plan in that particular year. So it comes down to this. We've got $1.5 billion of stuff that over some period of time, we intend to prune and put into more higher-growth assets, development assets, the type of assets that Harry's producing. And so if we're not able to issue the equity, that's fine, we will sell assets. But I will remind you guys one thing -- or at least express to you one thing, we've done studies. In 63% of the time over the last decade we've traded at a premium to NAV, and there's only been 1 year in the last decade that we have not, that was 2013. So we do expect that sometime during the period of the plan, we probably will trade above NAV and we'll utilize that opportunity to continue to grow the company, which is something that we would intend to do over time as well.", "David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And my second question is on Rivergate. How do the changes there affect your -- the yield that you expect to achieve on -- or that you are achieving on that asset?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Yes. Let's take Rivergate for a minute, Dave. Rivergate was acquired as an acquisition rehab asset. And with that, as we think about that, we target a stabilized yield in excess of what we could acquire a similar asset for that didn't require the rehab in that same market. Inclusive of this expanded budget, we believe we'll trend to about a 5% yield on a fully-stabilized basis some time in 2016, which we feel really good about. So that's just kind of the background. Harry, what might you add to that?", "Harry G. Alcock", "Dave, this is Harry. So just to speak specifically about the rehab. Our initial budget was $60 million. That was to rehab about 400 of the units that the prior owner hadn't touched; cure a lot of exterior items, the full exterior of the building; all new windows; a brand-new lobby, which we finished; all new AC and heating systems, that type of thing. We finished that, and in the course of [indiscernible] having the property and operating it for the past 2.5 years, we found a number of additional opportunities to generate additional revenue and enhance our return. So this really is a phase 2, and sort examples of those items are create a second floor amenity area in space that was previously unused, we're going to split an entire stack of large 1-bedrooms, 950-square foot 1-bedrooms, and split them into a combination of a 450-square foot studio and a 500 square-foot junior 1-bedroom, which gives us a new entry point in the building. We have 11 homes with very large terraces which is a unique amenity in this market that we're going to increase the rehab scope. We're going to add washers and dryers to 194 units. So the point is, we think we're going to add, for that $38 million, get another $375 or so in additional rent and generate about an 8% return on that incremental $38 million in spend. I'll remind you that in the 2.5 years we've owned it, the average rents at acquisition were about 3250. We've increased rents nearly 30% at that building. The rehab units are generating rents in excess of 4,300 today and we've got another 375 to go as a result of the Phase 2.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Bennett with Zelman & Associates.", "Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "Just wanted to go back to the Shadow development pipeline for a second. I was just wondering if you had any color regarding your land parcels in California and Seattle in terms of the submarkets where those land parcels are located versus the new supply that's coming online now? And as the markets, as well as what's planned over the next couple of years and the level of competition you might be expecting within those submarkets?", "Harry G. Alcock", "Sure. This is Harry. I'll go ahead and sort of walk through those in general and, I guess, there's a number of different answers. But to walk through, we've got 4 properties -- 5 properties, actually. On Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles from Santa Monica to Koreatown, which represent a big chunk of it. An awful lot of the new supply in the L.A. area is downtown. None of these are downtown. So these happen to be in submarkets that are not experiencing the rate of supply you're seeing in Los Angeles on the whole. We've got 1 of the land parcels in Bellevue, Washington that is -- again, Bellevue is, I think, there's 2 projects under construction now. There's a couple more on the drawing board. Bellevue, again, is not getting nearly the same level of new supply as downtown Seattle is. We do have 1 property in Irvine that we could start later this year. The City of Irvine does have a fair amount of new supply. We think we'll be kind of right in the middle, perhaps slightly ahead of the overall supply in that marketplace. But that is going to be something that we will deal with when we're releasing those projects up. We've got 1 property on El Camino in Mountain View. Again, the City of Mountain View has just delivered 2 brand-new product -- projects. Those are the first new projects that have been delivered in that city in a long time. There's a couple of others that are coming online. The point is, we're -- this is not an area where we expect a tremendous amount of new supply. It's just very difficult to get these types of sites and title that takes a long time. And we feel very good about the types of assets that we'll be starting over the next 2 or 3 years.", "Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "Got it. That's helpful. And just one more. Jerry, in terms of your expense growth guidance over the next few years, it's ranging around about 3%. I'm just curious, given the expense savings programs that you put in place for the past few years, if you quantified what sort of savings that you're generating in the next 3 years?", "Jerry A. Davis", "Well, we continue to find new opportunities to save money, especially on the repairs and maintenance side. As we make our service associates more efficient, it will enable us to continue to bring third-party cost in-house, as well as we think, by doing more preventive maintenance and doing a better job at move-in and during the residents' time period with us, we're hopeful, although I can't back this up yet, that we'll be able to drive resident turnover down. But as I look at 2014, like you stated, we have expense growth projected at 3%. And if I had to break that down, we're looking at about 6% for tax increases next year. While 35% of our company is in California or Oregon where you have caps on valuation increases, those will come in somewhere in the 2% to 3% range. We're going to feel some pressure, again, next year in Washington, D.C., where taxes are projected, currently, to be going up close to double digits. It's high single digits, and D.C. is about 14% of my total same-store pool. And then when you look at the rest of the company, which is about half of it, they kind of all blend in to about a 6% growth. So we're seeing taxes going up, based on valuations, about 5%. And then, we did receive some refunds last year that translate to the total expense going up about 6%. As you look into the other components, we think insurance is going to be roughly flat with last year. We're seeing utilities probably coming in about 4%. We're keeping our eye on the State of California for future years with severe multiyear drought conditions that have been happening. That could, in the future, have an impact on water rates. To date, we really haven't seen that in any of our markets. But 2014, our expectation is, our repairs and maintenance expense will be negative growth once again. This past year, it was down about 4%. As we were able to bring more work in-house, we think it will be down 2%. In '14, we see personnel going up in that 3%, 3.5% range. And we still think we can become a little more efficient in the office, as well as on the marketing side and drive down our administrative and marketing cost about 2%. And I really don't see anything as we go out further years, and I think our '15, '16 projection is to be in that 3% range. I would say, upside risk is probably more in the utility side. I think taxes will start to moderate as valuations are fully built in. We think some municipalities may start looking to raise levy rates in the future if they can't get on valuation. Nobody in 2014 that we're looking at do we see expectations that rates will go up. But I do think this efficiency in repairs and maintenance has another year or so.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "So I'd like to go back to Boston for a minute. We're seeing a meaningful amount of supply specs to come online over the next year or 2 there, particularly in the city core. And given your more urban footprint in Boston, can you talk a bit more about your expectations for your Boston portfolio, specifically in 2014? And can you give us some broad color on proportionately what proportion of your portfolio there is urban versus suburban and then A versus B?", "Jerry A. Davis", "Sure, Haendel. This is Jerry. We really don't have that much urban. We have 1 property, several hundred units in the Back Bay, Garrison Square, that we've owned for several years. We have 2 same store Properties up in the North Shore that are more B quality. And then as you go down to Braintree in the South Shore, we have 1 same-store property. We have various properties that we own with MetLife that are scattered around the suburbs, but we really have only 1 that's in urban core. And it is interesting. For the first time since we purchased that 3, 3.5 years ago, it's having a bit of a struggle right now. I think some of it is due to new supply. I think the other part of it that we've experienced sort of last 45 to 60 days is pretty bad weather in that New England area that's made it difficult for people to get out and shop for apartments. But the new supply is coming in that downtown area. Predominately, we think our 1 core asset, which is more of a brownstone 4-story property, will be fine. But it's been hurt a little bit. And right now, I would tell you, the strongest submarket that we see in Boston and it's been this way for the last 6 to 9 months has been down on the South Shore.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Appreciate that. So looking at the Northeast forecast here where you have Boston and New York effectively a similar forecast, can you perhaps give us a sense as to -- well, scratch that, scratch that. I want to go to D.C. for a second. I think that's more important here for me. Can you give the same relative assessment of D.C.? Your portfolio -- you mentioned earlier about your D.C. portfolio benefiting from some of these. Can you talk a bit more about your relative urban, suburban, A versus B? And then any sense of delta in revenue growth expectations there that you are forecasting for this year?", "Jerry A. Davis", "Sure. Some of this will be kind of off the cuff, but the B portfolio is probably about 60% or so of our total D.C. holdings when you look the Metro D.C. area. If I was doing the math in my head, I would say probably 50% to 60% is outside of the Beltway, or in the suburban portions of D.C. We have a couple of deals that are wholly-owned, our A product that are in the line of new supply. Most of that is in the U Street Corridor. The Bs, projected, will go up in that 3, probably 3% revenue growth. And this is with the exception of Manassas. That's a B product that we are getting dinged up pretty good from new supply out there. And I would say the As that are within the Beltway are probably flat to negative 1% as far as revenue growth projections.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Great. And just one last one if I may. Can you guys talk a bit about the near-term opportunity for redevelopment within the portfolio? The numbers in the book are grouped with development. Can you parse out the redev and your sort of opportunity in the portfolio today for redev and any type of commentary on returns, et cetera?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Yes, Haendel, again, what we do is we look at redevs 2 different ways. We've got the acquisition rehabs, where we seek a yield, and then we have the redevelopment of an asset that's on book. So we'll seek 7% to 9%. We've probably got, out of the, call it, $400 million, $600 million that we're doing per year, maybe 10% of that is redev. We've got on the books right now or on the pipeline right now, Rivergate is the only one that has any substantial spend left and 27 Seventy Five winding down. So it's not going to be a big number to us. And as far as what's in our portfolio right now, we're looking at a couple of opportunities. But it's not going to be a huge part of our pipeline.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Paula Poskon with Robert W. Baird.", "Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Going back to the 4 tenets of the updated strategic plan, accretive capital allocation, operational excellence, cash flow growth and balance sheet health. I must confess it sounds more to me like a mission statement that really any REIT ought to be guided by as opposed to a strategic plan for a finite period of time. So I was wondering if you could provide more specificity on some of the execution elements of each of those tenets? For example, what might be an example of a continued enhancement to the best-in-class operating platform?", "Jerry A. Davis", "I'll take that -- oh, sorry, Tom.", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Yes, Paula, I think it's a very fair question. And I would agree with your initial assessment that these should be the 4 tenets of any strategic plan and direction. And clearly, you can see we build our plan around supporting those, we measure them, we report to our board and discuss them constantly. As I think about it, what doesn't get discussed when strategic plans are put forth is the prioritization and the trade-offs. And hopefully, from this Three-Year Strategic Plan, you can see that the trade-offs that we're making are -- portfolio improvement is important, but cash flow growth, NAV growth is our paramount driver and focus of this Three-Year Plan. And I would tell you, the last decade, the strategic priorities probably started with capital -- really started with portfolio. I mean, we just did not have the right assets in the right markets and we had to move all of that out and away, and that took a decade. I'll tell you, it took a lot longer than I thought, but I'm glad where we're at. So I would agree that we've toggled between those 2, and now are focused really on the cash flow and dividend per share growth, as well as the NAV per share. The other aspects, operational excellence, Jerry will give you some more specific. But it's always been a strong tenet of the company. You look year-in and year-out, we're always in the top part of the pack and we measure it by market and how we perform, and that's how our site teams are compensated, is how they perform head-to-head in markets. So I feel like there's a lot of still potential there. This industry continues to grow and do well. But there's more room in that area and Jerry give you spec. On the balance sheet, it's hard to put the balance sheet in the last decade as the first priority when we had so much work to be done on the portfolio. And you can see the last couple of years, it's come into focus. We think we're on the right path. And it would be a derivative of growing the cash flow and the NAV and the balance sheet will improve as time occurs. So that's -- the trade-off of the 4 are always critical in what we discuss about which lever to pull over what period of time and constant measure and monitoring of it. And so, I hope that helps a little bit. Jerry?", "Jerry A. Davis", "Yes. There's been quite a few things over the last 4 or 5 years that we've done on operational excellence that we'll continue. And I will tell you, we never stop looking at ways to grow our margin and to provide a better customer experience. And it goes back years ago when we first started doing electronic marketing, then we moved to electronic payments. We just made our office staff much more efficient. And then we looked more at the direct resident. We got online renewals, online leasing going. Then really about 2 years ago, we started looking at our maintenance teams and determined we were still doing things old-school, the way we've done them since the 1980s. And in addition to technology, we've put up performance standards for our teams and expectations. We've rolled out better ways to order parts, to transport parts and have mobile shops that go with our guys so they can become more efficient. And it's allowed us, really, if you would assume that our NIM cost should be going up 3%, we were down 4% this past year. It's enabled us to cut those costs by about 7%. We expect this year to have comparable-type results with a downward expectation of repairs and maintenance, and we think we can play this out for a few more years, with probably the final piece of this coming still a couple of years down the road with electronic locks, and we think will be an amenity to our resident as well as make our people more efficient. And on the expense side, over the last, really, last 1.5 years, we started looking at other opportunities to generate revenue out of our existing resident base. And some of that was on things, we call them rentable items, storage, parking, garages, things like that, that we looked, we only had occupancy in those types of places of 40% to 45% to 50%. We drove that occupancy up to 70%. We think we can continue to drive it over the next couple of years. And lastly, we're looking at other opportunities that will help our residents get by. Some of that is flexible payment plans or biweekly payments. Things like that, that we've realized that a portion of our residents struggle to budget their own income and they would just like a lot of people to pay their mortgages biweekly, people would like to be able to pay their rent biweekly, and we've rolled that out this year. And so far, in the states where it's allowable, we've seen pretty good acceptance of this and people do see it as a benefit that, I think, will help us not only stay in good graces with our residents, but I think it's also going to help them manage their money better and we're hopeful that it will help drive down our bad debt. But it's things like that, that we're just keeping our eyes open, watching competitors, watching other industries, listening to our customers. And I think the next step that we are really going to look at is what do our customers, how do they feel about us, ratings and things like that, and be able to respond more quickly and provide better customer service.", "Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "That is very insightful.", "Thomas M. Herzog", "And I might add one thing, Paula is when think about the other 2 pieces of this that haven't been spoken of, Harry's side of the business, where we're developing assets, providing accretive returns, driving additional CVNI and growth for our shareholders, we think is important -- very important, but there's -- and you're seeing the results of that now as the deliveries are starting to occur. But if you play that through for the balance of the $1.2 billion pipeline, we had a couple of questions earlier about equity issuance and what happens if we don't issue equity. Well, you'll see on this balance sheet page that we have on Page 10, we speak to different metrics. And if we issued no equity, all we did was stay -- or at least we just stayed at a leverage-neutral basis, we would still drive our net debt to EBITDA down to a 6.2x, just with the delivery of Harry's development projects, which, again, we've spoken to wanting to delivered to BBB+ or operate to BBB+, Baa1 metrics. And so, that all ties into the plan mechanically as we speak to each of the 4 tenets that you alluded to.", "Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And my second question is just on the assets that are being marketed for sale in Tampa and Orlando. Can you just talk what was it about those specific assets versus the others you have in the market that teed those up for sale? And on a housekeeping perspective, have those already been classified as discontinued ops?", "Harry G. Alcock", "Paula, this is Harry. I'll answer the first part of the question. Tampa and Orlando are both within our capital warehouse. Our universe will also sell a few non-core assets this year for a number of reasons. As we go through and rate the assets having to do with expected cash flow growth, having to do with future capital needs, having to do with expected buyer response, having to do with a number of sort of operational issues, those are the 4 assets that rose to the top of the heap and the assets are of a size that will satisfy our necessary sales volume for the year, combined with a few others that we'll put in the market later this year.", "Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And are those in discontinuum?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Yes, the second part of your question, no, they have not been included in discontinued ops. Until we get hard dollars down, our policy has been not to do that, which I think is fairly consistent with the way a lot of other REITs handle that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.", "Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Just to follow -- I think you mentioned a couple of development starts. Can you give the dollar volume that you're looking for in terms of starts so we can kind of see the [indiscernible] out of the pipeline? And then a question just as it relates to leverage. The leverage, just as you provided on 10, look like they don't include the JVs. If you look at going for -- as you look at the business plan for '14, then going forward to '16, can you talk about leverage in the context of how you're looking at managing the -- your holding on balance sheet versus the JV and whether you see leverage come down the same amount for the total entity on a proportionate basis?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Yes, Herzog here. I'll start with this and then Harry will jump in on the developments. But the development starts for 2013, $250 million ownership effect at between Steele Creek and 399 Fremont. A couple of more starts in the second half of 2014 because Harry's working on a variety of different entitlements and we're doing a lot of underwriting right now to make sure we meet the return hurdles that we have in place. We have not yet set forth a number as to what that might look like for the balance of 2014. Anything you'd add to that, Harry?", "Harry G. Alcock", "Yes, I mean, we do have 3 assets that, depending on the timing of the completion of the design and various reconstruction activities that we think we could start this year, those types of numbers could be another couple hundred million in UDR's share of incremental development starts this year. And again, as you know, we just started 399 Fremont in San Francisco.", "Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "The one you bought in the first quarter, would that be a '14 start, and would that be a wholly-owned, just given the size?", "Harry G. Alcock", "It is wholly-owned, and it -- I think it's unlikely that it's a '14 start.", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Mike, this is Toomey. We won't start a deal until we have a GMAX in hand and 100% drawings. In that timeframe, on most deals, if you even have entitlements, is still a year.", "Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "You had mentioned...", "Thomas W. Toomey", "If we don't have entitlements it could string out for many. So we're just trying to be thoughtful in making sure we can nail the returns and price it against cost of capital with the right fact patterns. So we're in no hurry to start putting things into the ground that we don't have all the facts on-hand.", "Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I appreciate that. And then Tom, could you address the JV leverage versus on balance sheet?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Yes. I don't think the numbers, Mike, will be too different than what some of you guys have published. But looking forward, so if we were, let's just say, fixed charge, we're in the mid-3s in 2014, net debt to EBITDA in the mid-6s, debt-to-asset cost of, call it, the high-38s, probably 39%. If we take the pro rata joint venture debt and assets, we're looking more like the very low 3s for fixed charge, net debt-to-EBITDA is about a 7, so it still looks pretty good, inclusive of pro rata debt, and then the debt to asset cost [indiscernible] probably about a 42 [ph] or something like that. Those are the rough numbers that we put together based on the joint venture activity.", "Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I appreciate that. Then just as a follow-up. Can you just give us a sense? In your guidance, you've identified a decent amount of acquisition volume. Is any of that identified? And in the same sense in terms of dispositions, should we think about that kind of going throughout the year match funding or would you expect that to be all lumped together at one point?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Well, I would say that we certainly, internally, have looked at a pool of assets that we would seek to liquidate. Harry is going through that now, testing the market. So we wouldn't seek to individual assets at this point. But Harry, maybe you can give a little bit more color on how you're are looking at that.", "Harry G. Alcock", "Yes, we -- I mean, on the acquisition side, we did -- we acquired the land parcel. And then in Orange County in January, in terms of other acquisitions that fall within our guidance, as always, we'll speak to those once we have something to talk about, meaning the hard contract and a deal that's ready to close. On the sale side, we have the 4 in the market I talked about and others will come in the market throughout the year. This continues to be a very liquid disposition environment, transaction environment. This is a year, if you look at 2013, there's over $100 billion in trade. So the disposition environment continues to be very liquid.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "First, public service announcement. CVNI is NAV plus dividend. I did not know that. Many thanks to Chris. I doubt many people on the call knew that. How do you get NAV equal CVNI, Tom? What is...", "Thomas M. Herzog", "How do I get NAV equal CVNI, is that what you're saying?", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "No, NAV plus dividend is CVNI?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Yes, it's NAV is -- it's actually not that. It's the change in NAV plus dividends reinvested at the then NAV, creates CVNI.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay, got you.", "Thomas M. Herzog", "It's kind of the old Warren Buffet tick changes in NAV plus dividends is just -- is reinvested back in at NAV.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. The mention of issuing stock once you get over NAV, why does that not put a ceiling on the stock if you're basically going to say you're going to raise equity since you're above NAV?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Well, it doesn't necessarily mean we will raise equity above NAV, but we certainly might. So I wouldn't say that as putting a ceiling on a stock.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. And then, the last question, maybe big picture, for Toomey. It was brought up a while ago about M&A. What do you think about with all this work you've done to put yourselves in high-barrier markets, you probably don't feel like you get properly valued for all the work that you've done to put 80% of your portfolio on coastal high-barrier markets. What about UDR as a seller, if the right price came along. Is that in the mindset there?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Well, I think we can't control that and the market will be what it's going to be. And what we can do is grow our business, grow our cash flow, grow our NAV. And if the chips fall and there's an offer, that's what you have a Board of Directors for and a management team that has an alignment of interest with the shareholders. And we'll conduct ourselves accordingly. So we don't seek it out. I think it's a consequence. And for us, we can only put forth our plan, execute on it. We think it's the right plan and are excited about the plan.", "Operator", "I would like to turn it back over to management for closing remarks. Please go ahead.", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Well, a brief closing. First, thank you for your time today and, certainly, for the -- a very good set of questions. Clearly, we have put forth an updated Three-Year Plan. We feel good about that plan. You can see through the transparency of it, what we expect to do. Like '13, we feel good about that execution, have the right resources in the room, the right environment. And are excited about not just performing at it, but exceeding it. And we will see many of you at investor conferences throughout the part of the season, and look forward to seeing you and discuss it in more detail and the rest of us will get to work and execute.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

Welcome to the UDR's First Quarter 2014 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded today, April 29, 2014. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chris Van Ens, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Christopher G. Van Ens", "Thank you for joining us for UDR's first quarter financial results conference call. Our first quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed earlier today, and posted to our website, www.udr.com.", "In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements.", "I would like to note that statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met.", "Discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in this morning's press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.", "[Operator Instructions] Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered on the call.", "I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to UDR's first quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Tom Herzog, Chief Financial Officer; and Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our results, as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.", "My comments will be brief and focus on 5 topics. First, all aspects of our business continue to perform well in the first quarter. Operations is hitting on all cylinders, and our development completions and return in aggregate are meeting or exceeding the expectations.", "Apartment fundamental in our markets remained favorable, and our momentum entering the prime leasing season remained very positive.", "Second, our first quarter results came in at the high end or beat our initial guidance ranges provided in February on both earnings and same-store basis. Much of 2014 has yet to unfold, but we feel good about where we are, and we'll reevaluate and update you on our full year guidance on the second quarter call.", "Likewise we are in line or slightly ahead of the expectations set forth in our 2014 to 2016 strategic plan. We continue to view the plan as a solid roadmap for long-term value creation and remain fully focused on its execution.", "Third, we completed $295 million of accretive coastal development during the quarter. Maintaining a consistent development pipeline improves our portfolio quality and geographic footprint, and remains a primary driver or expected cash flow growth in the coming years. We are excited about the $566 million of development projects we have completed over the past 6 months, as well as the $183 million that is expected to come online during the remainder of 2014.", "Fourth, we completed the migration of the final 8 operating assets out of our original UDR/MetLife I joint venture with another set of transaction. After 3 years of hard work, this brings the operating community portion of the UDR/MetLife I joint venture to a close. Over this time, we have been pleased with the progress made in increasing our ownership interest to 50% in 16 of the original 26 condo-quality communities that are located in our core markets. And we are excited about the continued expansion of our relationship with the stable long-term partner in MetLife.", "I'd like to acknowledge Warren and Harry for their hard work that created a mutually beneficial outcome for both UDR and Met. Tom will provide further details on our investment to date, including our current estimated IRR.", "Fifth, we are making progress on our planned dispositions for the year, and while it is early to provide details, pricing has come in favorably versus original expectations. Tom will provide an update on our capital sources and uses in his prepared remarks.", "And finally, I'd like to thank all my fellow associates for their hard work in producing another strong quarter for UDR. We look forward to the remainder of 2014.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Thanks, Tom. The topics I will cover today include: First, our first quarter 2014 results; second, a balance sheet and debt maturity update; third, a development update; fourth, an overview of first quarter and post-quarter transaction; fifth, our second quarter and full year 2014 guidance; and last, I'll provide clarification on UDR's guidance relative to future equity issuances.", "First, our first quarter results. FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $0.36, $0.36, and $0.33, respectively. Each of these earnings metrics were at or above the high end of our guidance range provided in February.", "Moving on to the balance sheet. At quarter end, our financial leverage on an undepreciated cost basis were 39.9%. On a fair value basis, it was 32.0%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 7.2x, but is forecast to trend to the mid-6s by year-end. We will continue to manage our balance sheet to BBB+ credit metric.", "Our balance sheet remains strong, with approximately $630 million of cash and credit facility capacity at quarter end. In the first quarter, $184 million of 5.1% debt matured was temporarily pointed on our revolver. On April 1, we paid off an additional $129 million of 5.5% debt. We intend to refinance these obligations in the unsecured market later this quarter. The only remaining debt maturing in 2014 is $34 million of secured debt that comes due in December.", "Turning to development. During the first quarter, we completed 3 projects containing 891 homes for $295 million at a weighted average spread between expected trended yield incurred market cap rate of approximately 220 basis points. Of these completions, Channel Mission Bay in San Francisco is expected to yield well above the upper end of our targeted 150 to 200-basis-point trended range.", "Domain College Park, which is across the street from the University of Maryland Business School and Los Alisos, which is located in Mission Viejo, California, are expected to come in 20- to 25-basis-points below our targeted range. But will still be well accretive to earnings than NAV both with solid double-digit IRRs projected at the point of stabilization.", "Of our remaining $671 million pipeline of projects still under construction, $183 million of which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2014, we've continued to trend near the midpoint of our targeted range. In total, our $1.1 billion development pipeline is 65% funded.", "As to future development projects, we continue to carefully underwrite opportunities, and look for new land sites. In the first quarter, we closed on the previously announced $78 million Pacific City land parcel, a 516-home project located in Huntington Beach, California, and 3 blocks from Huntington Beach Pier.", "We're currently completing the design process and expect to break ground in early 2015. Looking ahead, we also expect to announce 2 to 3 new starts in the second half of 2014 and will range from $100 million to $150 million in total.", "Next, our first quarter and post-quarter transaction. In January, we sold for approximately $49 million Presidio at Rancho del Oro, a 27-year-old 264-home community located in North County, San Diego. The community's fourth quarter 2013 average revenue per occupied home was $1,485 per month, and the sale was transacted at a 5.4% cap rate.", "As Tom mentioned, we have several assets for sale currently in the market and are on track in moving forward with the planned disposition set forth in our guidance. Pricing on such transactions looks to be a bit more favorable than our original expectations.", "In addition, during Q1, we sold our minority interest in 2 small UDR/MetLife I JV operating community to MetLife, and received cash proceeds of approximately $3 million. The 2 communities had a combined market value of approximately $85 million with an average cap rate of 3.8%. First quarter revenue per occupied home for the 118 homes in these assets averaged $4,817 per month.", "Subsequent to quarter end, we increased our ownership interest from 12% to 50% in the remaining 6 operating assets in the UDR/MetLife I JV for a payment to MetLife of $82 million and contributed to assets to the UDR/MetLife II JV. These 6 assets had an aggregate market value of approximately $505 million with an average cap rate of around 4.8%. The 6 assets comprise 1,523 homes with first quarter average revenue per occupied home of $2,563 per month, are all recently constructed communities located in Los Angeles, San Diego, Dallas, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and Boston.", "Let me now take a step back and provide some context from life-to-date activity of the UDR/MetLife I JV since its formation in November 2010. When we entered into the venture it comprised 26 recently constructed high-quality operating assets with 5,748 homes, and 11 potential development sites with UDR acting as the property manager. UDR owned approximately a 12% interest in the operating assets, and a 4% interest on the land parcel.", "Since then, we have engaged with MetLife in 4 ownership swap transactions, as well as other activities wherein we increased our ownership interest from 13% to 15 -- 50% in 16 of the original 26 operating assets, encompassing 3,932 homes and contributed them to the UDR/MetLife II JV.", "We sold the minority interest in the remaining 10 operating properties to MetLife. The JV is sold or swapped 4 of the original 11 land parcels, including the sale of one parcel through a third-party. We recapitalized certain operating communities as debt matured, and the JV made distributions of available net cash generated for the joint venture partners.", "Let me show to you some key takeaways how we currently view the economics of the deal. We estimate that UDR's current 50% share of the assets and UDR/MetLife II JV, excluding Columbus Square, is valued at approximately $460 million versus cumulative investments over the 3-year period of around $340 million. The annual IRR computed for all cash flows, along with the fair value of the real estate holdings at April 2014, is over 18%.", "As a reminder, UDR/MetLife JV I still holds 7 land parcels for which we own 4% interest for a total investment of $6.6 million. These assets provide us the opportunity to participate with Met and the development of well-located land for a total basis of approximately $180 million. We're in various stages of the evaluation and entitlement process on these land parcels, and we'll provide updates as those plans are finalized.", "We are very pleased with the value that has been created to date with these ventures and with our strategic relationship with MetLife. This relationship will allow us to continue to jointly own an outstanding portfolio of high-quality assets in our core markets, and develop the remaining land parcels over time while earning management and development fees. We've continue to look forward to additional value creation opportunities with MetLife going forward.", "On to 2014 guidance. First quarter earning metrics and same-store results came in at or above the upper end of our original guidance expectations and the momentum was good. But given how early it is in the year, we are maintaining our full year 2014 FFO and AFFOs adjusted per share guidance of $1.47 to $1.53, and AFFO guidance of $1.30 to $1.36 per share. In addition, we are maintaining our full year 2014 same-store guidance with expected revenue growth of 3.5% to 4.25%, same-store expense growth of 2.75% to 3.25%, and same-store NOI growth of 3.75% to 5.0%. We will revisit both our earnings and same-store guidance ranges during the second quarter call.", "Other primary full year guidance assumptions can be found on Attachment 15 or Page 25 of our supplement. In this page, you will note, we reduced our 2014 acquisition guidance by $100 million at the midpoint, raised our 2014 disposition guidance by $100 million at the midpoint, and reduced our acquisition disposition cap rate spread by 50 basis points at the midpoint based on current pricing and the potential basket of assets to be sold.", "Second quarter 2014 FFO, and FFOs adjusted per share guidance is $0.36 to $0.38, and AFFO per share guidance is $0.31 to $0.33. Also, during the quarter, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.26 or $1.04 per share when annualized, an 11% increase over 2013. This represents the yield of approximately 4% and 166 uninterrupted quarterly -- quarter ended dividend.", "One final item I would like to address. The topic of UDR potential issuing new equity seems to receive a lot of attention during the last couple of months. In a public presentation at the Citi Conference, we made a point to clarify that our commitment to not issue an equity as a discount to NAV does not imply that we will issue equity immediately upon trading at NAV. We have a $1.4 billion portfolio of capital warehouse and non-core communities that we plan to sell over time for strategic reasons. And the proceeds from such sales are capable of fully funding our development plan for the next few years. Accordingly, we do not currently need new equity capital. However, when our stock again, trades at a premium to NAV, we will, of course, consider accretive opportunities as they arise. The equity issuances set forth in our 3-year strategic plan provide a placeholder for such opportunity.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Jerry.", "Jerry A. Davis", "Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon. In my remarks, I'll cover the following topics: First, our first quarter operating results; second, the performance of our core markets during the quarter; and last, a brief update on our development lease-ups.", "We're pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. In the first quarter, same-store net operating income grew 5.6%, driven by a 4.5% year-over-year increase in revenue against a 2.2% increase in expenses. As a reminder, fourth quarter of 2013 revenue and NOI growth was similar at 4.5% and 5.4%, respectively.", "We are encouraged by our continued ability to keep expense growth in check, especially given the difficult winter, we experienced, in the Eastern portion of the U.S. All in, first quarter winter-related expenses were approximately $530,000 above initial expectations. Offsetting this were lower repairs and maintenance and personnel expenditures, as we continue to gain efficiencies through our investments in technology and process improvement, as well as slightly lower property taxes as a result of a few prior year refunds.", "Our same-store revenue per occupied home increased, by 4% year-over-year to $1,520 per month, while same-store occupancy of 96.2% was 45 basis points higher year-over-year. Our total portfolio revenue per occupied home at quarter end was $1,687 per month, including pro rata JV.", "Turning to new and renewal lease rate growth. First quarter effective rental rates on new leases increased by 1%. Renewal rate growth remained strong at 5.1%. San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, and Austin performed especially well, while the Mid-Atlantic region continue to struggle. Further details can be found on Attachment 8E or Page 18 of our supplement.", "Annualized turnover in the first quarter decreased by 120 basis points year-over-year. As was the case in 2013, this decrease was attributable to our ongoing focus on lease expiration management and the lengthening of our average new lease term. We continue to move lease expirations from the first and fourth quarters into the higher demand second and third quarters where we can realize better rate growth.", "Our average new lease term reached 11.9 months in the first quarter of 2014 versus 11.6 months in 2012 and 2013. The lengthened term helps us in the following ways: First, in geographies where new supply is pressuring fundamentals, like Washington, D.C., we are better able to maintain occupancy in the market, in general; second, our churn costs and vacancy loss improve as fewer apartments turnover annually; and finally, longer tenures Drive higher occupancy, which allows us to proactively be more aggressive on rates and fee increases. This focus on intensive lease management should continue to benefit our current and future year results.", "Next, rent, as a percentage of our residents' income, held steady at roughly 18%. Move-outs to home purchase were up 230 basis points year-over-year at 14.1%, but still below our long-term average of 14.5%.", "Moving on to the quarterly performance in our primary core markets. Orange County and Los Angeles, which combined represents 16% of our total NOI, continue to improve and are expected to perform well in 2014. Our 467-home recently developed Bella Terra community in Huntington Beach continues to be a rocket ship, and is currently 97% leased with rents 10% above up pro forma estimates.", "Pricing power in New York City, which represents 13% of our total NOI, improved meaningfully as the quarter -- first quarter progressed, and we continued to feel good about the city's prospects during the upcoming prime leasing season.", "New supply in Metro D.C., which represents 13% of our total NOI, continues to hamper fundamentals, but our diverse mix of A and B products, as well as less direct submarket exposure to new supply will help us fare better than many of our peers in 2014. We are still expecting positive full year revenue growth of approximately 1%.", "San Francisco, which represents 10% of our total NOI, remains very strong, with employment growth continuing to be driven by high paying professional job. Demand is robust throughout the city, Peninsula, and Silicon Valley. In North San Jose, we are experiencing some pricing pressure due to new supply. Our 315-home Channel Development in Mission Bay is 70% leased, just 4 months after opening its doors and at higher rates than initially expected. Like Bella Terra, Channel is a home run.", "Seattle, which represents 7% of our total NOI, remains a very good market for us. Supply is coming, the jobs are as well. Seattle has added over 40,000 jobs since March of last year, enough to absorb new product thus far.", "Lastly, Boston, which represents 5% of our total NOI, is emerging from its typical seasonally slower period of the year. The winter was brutal, but we are seeing a seasonal pickup in leasing.", "Turning to our new -- our development lease-ups. Channel at Mission Bay in San Francisco and 13th and Market in San Diego comprised $218 million in aggregate estimated cost. Weighted average effective rents are nearly 11% above plan and leasing velocity of 13% ahead of expectations. These lease-ups continue to perform well.", "Los Alisos in Mission Viejo, Domain College Park across the street from University of Maryland Business School; and Fiori at our Vitruvian Park JV in Addison, Texas comprised $199 million in aggregate estimated cost.", "Weighted average effective rents are 1% below plan, while leasing velocity is 17% below where we would have expected at this point, primarily due to Fiori -- as the prime, excuse me, leasing season gets into full swing, we expect the demand of these projects, especially Domain College Park, and Los Alisos will pick up. We are seeing strong leasing activity at all of our lease-ups in April. In fact, each one of these properties is achieving at least one lease per day thus far. All in, we remain very positive on how the lease-ups are progressing in aggregate.", "With that, I will open the call for Q&A. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Jana Galan with Bank of America.", "Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I was wondering if you can give some color around the changes to transaction activities for 2014? Was that largely led to what you would accomplish in the first quarter? Or just are you seeing less potential acquisitions out there?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "It's Tom Herzog. As far as the transaction activity, we reduced the acquisition number down by $100 million at the midpoint. We increased the disposition guidance by $100 million at the midpoint. Equity, we just clarified that, that drove to $150 million and the cap rate spread, we just tightened up by 50 basis points. As it pertains to the reason for the changes, the acquisitions, we've got the Pacific City that was purchased in January, we're using that as one of the reversed 1031s, reduced in [ph] April acquisitions. Dispositions we raised, that created a couple hundred million of extra cash flow. We've got the joint venture contribution that we described that comes in as a net $79 million and then we have Steele Creek that comes in at about $60 million that we expect to fund during the year, leaves a little bit of extra cash flow in the mix. So those are the moving pieces that we have.", "Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And you mentioned the $1.4 billion of non-core in potential dispositions, just given the strong demand for apartment assets, would you potentially increase that disposition number further?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Well, I mean, as far as the dispositions at the range that we've set, there really isn't going to be reason likely to increase the disposition number. We do have, of course, the capacity to do that if we needed to. But we're not expecting at this time that will be modified.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup.", "Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "You mentioned that the pricing for the planned dispositions has been better-than-expected. Have you seen any increase in condo conversions in your markets?", "Harry G. Alcock", "Nick, it's Harry Alcock. First of all, none of our assets that are in the market are going to be sold to condo converters. But in terms of the question itself, we're starting see a little bit of condo activity on existing operating assets creep into a couple of markets, New York was first, we're starting to see a little bit of it in San Francisco, and we're seeing more of it in those 2 markets on land sites where the -- many of the buyers are going to develop for a condo use.", "Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And in terms of guidance, what are you assuming on the price in for that unsecured bought issuance this quarter?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Well, we've -- it's to look at what current pricing is, Nick, this is Tom Herzog again, on the 10-year, we would assume it's somewhere roughly into the vicinity of 4%. If we went with the 7-year, it's more in the vicinity of 3.5%. We've got our guidance number in a little bit lower than that. So we've got a little bit of upside if we get to [indiscernible] between now and [indiscernible].", "Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And finally, what's the timing of the potential development start to MetLife I JV?", "Harry G. Alcock", "Nick, it's Harry Alcock. The first couple of sites could start as early as later this year. We've got another 2 to 3 sites that could start in 2015, and then the remaining 2 or 3 would potentially be further out.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Derek Bower with ISI Group.", "Derek Bower - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Given the MetLife funds carry higher leverage, can you speak to what your pro rata leverage metrics look like, pro forma the transaction? And how do you expect leverage, including the JVs to trend relative to your guidance in the 3-year plan?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "As far as leverage on the MetLife joint venture or just leverage in general, as, I think, you're aware, we see our net-debt-to-EBITDA is the one I'll focus on, taking down during the year, probably on a consolidated basis and in the year somewhere around 6.5, and then further taking down during the period of our 3-year plan down to about 5.7. As to -- with the inclusion of JVs, we would see that number coming in at somewhere in the mid-6s by the end of the year. The impact of the MetLife swap was quite negligible to the look through, if you will, net-debt-to-EBITDA number somewhere around 0.4x. The transaction itself on the 6 assets came in at I think 56% leverage on that particular component bumped up against our actual leverage in the company and when you do the math on all that, it really does not make that big of an impact.", "Derek Bower - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Great. You've talked in the past about your desire to increase your ownership stake in the MetLife funds, so now you've done that into Fund II. Can you speak to your desire intent to further increase your stake or own the remaining assets outright?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "This is Toomey. Our intent in a short-term with Met is to continue to expand the relationship on a 50-50 basis with the development pipeline. And beyond that, we're comfortable right now at a 50-50 relationship on the operating assets, and we'll continue to always have dialogue with Met on a range of topics. And so we're comfortable where we're headed.", "Derek Bower - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Great. And then just lastly, Jerry, how much more work is left to rightsize lease exposure schedule? And are you having these concessions to do so? And how should we think about the impact of these efforts on 2015 growth?", "Jerry A. Davis", "Sure. Yes, we're continually moving lease expirations to get into the higher traffic months, which is -- which occur in the second and third quarter. A lot of the work has been done. So I think the impact in 2015, it'll be a little more of a normalized year as far as occupancy affected by these lease expirations changing, as well as new lease rate growth. Really not using concessions to achieve this, actually concessions, when you look at first quarter of '14 versus first quarter of '13, are down 29%. So haven't had to use that, it was really more through lease expirations. One thing we have seen is our resident base is selecting, on their own, to go a little bit more with longer term leases. We've offered up in some of our markets, such as DC and some of the Texas markets up to 14-month lease terms, and we found people opting more for these. This has expanded our average lease term from 11.6 months to 11.9, which has helped to drive down turnover. One thing it has done is when you look at new lease rate growth in first quarter, we are at 1% so far in April, we're at 2.5%. Short-term leases tend to have a bit of a higher premium, so they will help new lease rate growth. So we've seen a little bit of an impact on that. But even though people are selecting those longer term leases, we're finding people that need to move for jobs or select to move for home purchase, they will pay a lease break fee, and we've seen our fee income actually go up 7%. So while we are not overly happy with our new lease rate growth of 1%, which is about 120 basis points lower than it was in the first quarter of last year, we understand why it's happening, we think it has helped us push occupancy up to that 96.2% in the quarter, I would tell you today, our occupancy is at 96.8%. So we're running very high occupancy, probably given up a little bit of new lease rate growth, but it's really more resident selection.", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Just before we move on to the next question, I want to clarify one thing. Your question on the net-debt-to-EBITDA with the JV pro-rata debt, I think I said 6.6% at the end of the year, I meant to say at the end of the 3-year strategy period. At the end of the year, it'd be more like 7.4x. So 6.6x at the end of '16, 7.4x at the end of '14.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Just some quick questions here. One, on the increase in the disposition guidance, how does this compare to the dividend? Does this mean more pressure on paying out the dividend or there is sufficient weather coverage or ability to shelter the gains?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Yes. No, Alex, this is Tom Herzog. The dispositions had nothing to do with gain capacity or ability to cover the dividend. Yet literally, it's just -- it was cash flow decisions that we made. So nothing to do with the dividend.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Right, right, to the point that by increasing dispositions, you're not changing the trajectory of what you think the dividend growth is going to be like?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "No.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay, okay. And then, Tom, just you made your comments on equity issuance downplaying that. I mean, there's still some in the guidance, but it sounds like from your comments, it's not going to happen. So over the next 3 years, as we think about the development program, is it just -- should we just factor in sort of like amount of dispositions, so as we're modeling it out as the development's deliver, we sort of have an offsetting amount of dispositions, is that the way we should think about it out or is there, I guess, a different way?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "No, that's a good question. How we think about the dispositions is that the development program will be funded with these dispositions. And so as far as looking beyond that, I don't think there's a lot more to say. As far as equity issuance is in the plan, those are more of a placeholder. I kind of look at it this way. The cost of issuing equity is probably, call it, what, 4.85% on a yield basis and the cost of dispositions may be call it 6% and the cap rate are 5.5%, I think, is probably the vicinity of what we have in our -- built into our numbers. So there's not going to be much impact on the FFO as a result of -- if there's movement between those 2 numbers. So if there's fewer equity issuances, that's offset by disposition. So I just put that way. Those 2 numbers are relatively [indiscernible].", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. And then just lastly, while we have to wait for updated guidance on the second quarter, would you -- should we just assume that there'd be increased disposition guidance? Is that more towards the back part of the year like fourth quarter? Or we should be expecting some pretty big trades in the upcoming few weeks, months?", "Harry G. Alcock", "Alex, this is Harry. We closed one deal in January. I think the next 2, 3 deals could close in the second quarter and the balance will be the second half of the year.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Just a question for Jerry on same-store revenue growth. You didn't see any deceleration really from fourth quarter to first quarter. How much deceleration are you expecting here in the back half of the year? I know you have more difficult to occupancy comps, but it sounds like you're running pretty far ahead. Should we -- is your expectation that we should see same-store revenue growth trend down from 1Q levels for the balance of the year?", "Jerry A. Davis", "Yes, Karin, I definitely think it will trend down from the level we had in the first quarter. But we're just now entering our prime leasing season. So far, things have been going well. Our traffic and applications have held up a little bit better than last year. Turnover, as we've disclosed in the supplement, is down 120 basis points. And I can tell you, as through the month of April, it's down -- April versus April of last year another 130 basis points. Occupancy levels today are very high at 96.8% on the same-store pool. But we do have more difficult comps and I think you will see a deceleration. If I had to -- again, we're not updating guidance at this point, but if I had to handicap it right now, I'd say we'd be above the midpoint rather than below the midpoint of our full year guidance. Then we just like to see how the next 2 to 3 months play out before we update guidance.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Can you -- did you tell us where renewal notices are going out for, I guess, June and July?", "Jerry A. Davis", "They're averaging right about 5.5%.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful.", "Jerry A. Davis", "And I can tell you in the month of April, we achieved 5.7%.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Great, that's helpful. And then just last question is on -- do you have an estimate of if there'd be a change to the same-store growth if you backed out any kitchen and bath activity, this quarter?", "Jerry A. Davis", "Yes, I mean, if we look at -- let me actually take a moment on that because here's how we think about it. So first of all, we don't have any camp Bs that are in place at the current date, but we do have revenue enhancing spend. And, I think, when you think about revenue enhancing spend, you need to look at it based on probably 3 pieces of data. The first one is the amount of capital spent, which I think as you know, we've disclosed in our 3-year strategic plan. The second is expected return that you get in the first year and in subsequent years. Third, I think, one has to consider the rollover effect of those enhancements that are dropping off from prior years. So in our case, we spent $10 million in 2013, we'll bump it a little bit in 2014. I think it's up to $11 million is the number. As I said in the past, and Jerry said, we typically underwrite to around 20% year one cash on cash return because these are relatively short life improvements often 10 years or so. And we seek to get an IRR hurdle of at least 200 basis points in excess of our WAC [ph]. The impact of $10 million of spend in the year of the spend is probably about 15 basis points on same-store. And if you took a 4 years worth, you're probably at 30 basis points. But because we've been doing this for a long time and the rollover effect occurs on I'm guessing that the same-store growth is probably closer to 0 because there's as much rolling up that's coming on. One other point that I'd make around this is the impact of redevelopments, which we would heard a lot about recently. And especially major redevelopments like a 2775 or a Rivergate and just to be clear, we do not include these in our same-store sales. And these projects are typically, call it, $70,000 to $100,000 per door, usually stripping them to the stud, so major projects and those are excluded from our same-store results all together. So if anybody has desire to want to dig deeper to how we do these calcs and how we look at it, I'm glad to take any of those questions offline.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.", "Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Tom, I know you didn't update guidance, but you just inject the $79 million in the joint ventures. If you were to update guidance, what kind of lift we would we expect on the joint venture by and there just given the mark-to-market on the debt there?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Mike, this is Herzog again. The impact of the swaps themselves had a very slight positive impact in 2014, it'll be a bit more positive in 2015, but not enough to be probably adjusting your numbers for. Harry, I know you looked at those 2, I think, it was quite small, I don't think we have any...", "Harry G. Alcock", "It'd be in the fractions of pennies rather than full pennies.", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Yes.", "Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. Second, question, the 3 plants starts for the back half of the year, do you hold the parcels on those already?", "Harry G. Alcock", "We do. 2 of those 3 are MetLife parcels and the other's a wholly owned deal in Los Angeles.", "Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And with those, you'd buy in the 46% you don't own and go from there on the pari passu, will you fund the development cost or how would you fund that?", "Jerry A. Davis", "Yes, that's the expectation that we would develop those on a 50-50 basis with Met.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And finally, you get the debt maturing in the Texas joint venture. Obviously, Texas has been strong performer over the last couple of years. Just can you give us an update on what you're thinking is on the Texas joint venture, whether there's a plan to marketing any of those assets or just to extend that debt maturity?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Michael, this is Toomey. I think the intent in our conversations with our joint venture partner is when the debt is prepayable to expose those to the market and see what pies, we feel good about the prices of those assets at this time. And the job that Jerry and his team have done in running them. So they'll probably be able to be sold some time early next year.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our next question is from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Question on development. Understanding you're seeking yields 150, 200 basis points of bulk market cap rates. Given that we're late in the cycle and the recent, I guess, softness that your domain, Los Alisos and Fiori. Wanted to know whether you considered raising your return requirements for new development starts?", "Harry G. Alcock", "Haendel, this is Harry. First of all, clearly, cost are rising, land prices are rising, but rents were also rising. So, I think, yields are generally flat. We don't intend to increase our yield requirements per se, but we will take all of those factors into account in underwriting these deals. And won't start a new deal until we hit those threshold, which is the 150 to 200 basis points. So it's true, not all deals are going to pencil today, clearly, less than what would have penciled 2 to 3 years ago.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. Can you talk more specifically, you talked about -- you seemed more optimistic on domain in Los Alisos, but more muted on Fiori perhaps can you go into -- am I reading that correctly, first of all? And then maybe can you talk a bit about the Fiori asset, what you're seeing there? Is it pricing that's the issue, is it weak demand, is it supply in uptown, can you talk a bit more about that?", "Jerry A. Davis", "Haendel, it's Jerry. Fiori, as most of you know, is in Addison, Texas. We built a product that was comparable to what is built typically in uptown, about 10 miles north up in Addison. We priced it very similar to uptown assets and we're getting the pricing, the velocity just hasn't been there. We would attribute a large portion of that to general weakness in the uptown market today where a lot of these lines have been coming online. And that's kind of prevented us from getting the pricing we would have like to get in Fiori. We recently have cut pricing at Fiori to get leasing velocity back on track. In fact, this month, we had 40 gross leases in the month of April. Our expectation is to continue with it. One other sign of encouragement for Fiori is, Toyota announced yesterday, they're going to move their headquarters from Torrance, California to Plano, Texas and add about 4,000 to 5,000 jobs. Plano is about 5 or 6 miles north of Addison. We have about 1,200 heads up in Plano, as well as the 1,000 or so units at the Vitruvian Park that we think will really help us out there, too. But a lot of it has been softness in uptown due to new supply, some of it has been due to, we were introducing a new price point to the absent market and the leasing velocity has been just slower than we expected.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Appreciate that. We haven't talked much about it lately, it seems. But A versus B performance in your portfolio this past quarter, is there any discernible performance and any thoughts as we head into decreasing season here?", "Jerry A. Davis", "These are a little bit stronger, but it's not enough to really call anything on. What you typically find is in some markets, if your product is A and it's near-new supply, it's obviously, going to be competing more against lease-ups that tend to have higher concessions. But overall, Bs are less than probably 70 basis points better on pricing and, as far as occupancy, my entire portfolio was occupied at a very high level right now.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. One point of clarification you mentioned, I see that the first quarter same-store expenses in Northeast were, I guess, pretty far below expectations. You were talking earlier about some lower RNM costs and maybe some tax, realty tax benefits. Was that primarily the reason for the Northeast portfolio, the low year-over-year expense -- increase in expenses over there something else there?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "No, I'm glad you asked. It's really 2 things. One, we've done a good job of hedging our heating costs up in the Northeast, about 90% are hedged, so that put a collar, if you will, on some of the utility expenses. The second thing is we get hit pretty hard last year with snow removal up in Boston. And typically in Boston, you buy a contract on the number of inches of snow that can be removed. We bought this year an unlimited amount of snow removal for a fixed-rate and we locked in that rate for the next 3 years because of that. And because of the harshness of the winter and especially up in Boston. We didn't have as much of snow removal cost up there, as you would've expected.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of David Bragg with Green Street Advisors.", "David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Could you please share some of the specifics on the new Huntington Beach development deal? It looks like a really interesting site and it'd be great to hear your expectations for the total cost, rents per square-foot, and the yield on today's rents.", "Harry G. Alcock", "Dave, it's Harry. I think, we acquired the site for $78 million, it's zoned for 516 units. We're still in the midst of the design process. The design will ultimately sort of determine the costs and the rents we expect, I think, we're probably a little bit early to start talking about those. We expect to start the project probably in some time early next year, and we'll talk about it more once we completed our work.", "David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. All right, We'll circle back then. How about on 399 Fremont now that, that one has started. How is that one looking in terms of rents per square-foot and yield on today's rents?", "Harry G. Alcock", "David, it's Harry again. Yes, we're well underway on that one. The costs numbers are published. We expect to spend approximately $318 million development as -- is going fine thus far. We expect that one to finish in late '15, early '16. Rents today should be somewhere in the neighborhood of $5.25 per foot and we'll trend up from there. We expect to stabilize yield on that one somewhere in the low-6s.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Tom Toomey. Please go ahead, sir.", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Thank you, operator, and thank all of you for your time today. The closing remarks, I guess, I would say this. We're very excited about the position that we're in. With the leasing season upon us, the teams are pretty focused. And certainly, seen the traffic and the operational platform is running on all cylinders. So we're excited about that. I thought we had a very good quarter all the way down the line on all metrics and clearly, are performing at our 3-year plan or ahead of our 3-year plan and I would expect us to continue that trend for the balance of the year, and we look forward to seeing you guys in NAV [ph]. With that, operator, we'll end the call. Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the UDR's First Quarter 2014 Conference Call.

This call is being recorded. And now, I'll turn the call over to your host Chris Van Ens. Please go ahead, sir.", "Christopher Van Ens", "Thank you for joining us for UDR's second quarter financial results conference call. Our second quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed earlier today and posted to our website www.udr.com. In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements.", "I'd like to note that statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although, we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in this morning's press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.", "When we get to the question-and-answer portion, we ask that you'd be respectful of everyone's time and limit your questions and follow-ups. Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered on the call.", "I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.", "Thomas Toomey", "Thank you, Chris. And good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to UDR's second quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Tom Herzog, Chief Financial Officer; and Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our results, as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.", "First, all aspects of our business continue to perform well in the second quarter. Operations are strong throughout our portfolio, our aggregate development pipeline is meeting or exceeding expectations, and our balance sheet is solid. In short, we continue to check all the boxes with regard to the key components of our current three-year strategic plan published last February.", "We are just over halfway through 2014 and the macro environment for apartment demand in our markets has been slightly better than we initially expected. These markets continue to generate superior fundamentals relative to the national average. Against this backdrop and in conjunction with our strong 2014 results to date, we raised our full year earnings and same-store forecast in today's release. Tom will discuss details in his prepared remarks.", "While it is too early to comment on 2015, we will re-price approximately 30% of our apartment homes in the third quarter. And if current trends hold true, we expect another strong year for apartments and UDR. Jerry will provide further details on our forward operating strategy in his prepared remarks.", "Second, we closed on $81 million of dispositions during the quarter, had better pricing than originally contemplated. Additional sales have closed in the third quarter. Tom, will provide further details.", "From a big picture perspective, continuing to fund our accretive development pipeline with non-core dispositions is a trade off and is working. Later this year, we plan to market additional assets and anticipate strong demand, given the depth of acquisition capital in the marketplace. We are confident in our ability to execute upon our disposition guidance of $350 million to $450 million in 2014.", "Third, we are forecasting two or three additional development starts during the remainder of 2014, with anticipated cost to construct of $200 million to $325 million, depending on actual starts activity. The starts will be in our core markets and may include Orange County, San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles. At least two are anticipated to be with MetLife in a 50-50 ownership structure. Like our current pipeline, these new projects will help drive strong NAV and cash flow growth for UDR and its shareholders.", "Fourth, we successfully issued $300 million of 10-year unsecured debt during the quarter at an attractive 3.75% coupon. This issuance points to the strength of our balance sheet, which continues to improve. And finally, I'd like to thank all my fellow associates for their hard work in producing another strong quarter for UDR. We look forward to the remainder of 2014.", "And with that, I will turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas Herzog", "Thanks, Tom. The topics I will cover today include: first, our second quarter 2014 results; second, our balance sheet and debt maturity update and additional details on our $300 million unsecured offerings; third, a development update; fourth, an overview of second quarter and post-quarter transactions; and last, our third quarter and full year 2014 guidance.", "First, our second quarter results came in better than expected on both earnings and same-store sales growth. FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $0.39, $0.39 and $0.34, respectively. Quarterly same-store revenue, expense and NOI growth remained strong at 4.4%, 1.7% and 5.5%, respectively.", "Moving on to the balance sheet. At quarter end, our financial leverage on an undepreciated cost basis was 40.5%. On a fair value basis, it was approximately 32%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 6.9x and is forecast to trend to the mid-6s by yearend. We will continue to manage our balance sheet to BBB+ credit metrics. Our balance sheet remains strong, with approximately $650 million of cash and credit facility capacity at quarter end.", "In the first half of 2014, $312 million of UDR debt matured at an average rate of 5.3%. We refinanced this debt in June with a $300 million 10-year unsecured offering, priced at an attractive yield to maturity of 3.79%. We have no remaining debt maturing in 2014 that cannot be extended at our option.", "Turning to development. Our under construction pipeline totaled $671 million at the end of the second quarter. For these developments we are projecting approximately 170 basis point weighted average spread between expected trend of yields and current market GAAP rates. When including our $416 million of development that was completed in a lease up at quarter end, our pipeline totaled $1.1 billion and had an expected spread of approximately 180 basis points.", "Both of these measurements point to the accretive nature of our pipeline and the strong cash flow generation we expect, as income comes online. In the fourth quarter, our 173 home Beach & Ocean development in Huntington Beach, California, and our 332 home DelRay Tower project in Alexandria, Virginia, will each completion at a combined budgeted cost of approximately $183 million.", "Preleasing at these two assets is on plan and both will enhance the quality of our existing portfolio. In total, our $1.1 billion development pipeline were 72% funded at quarter end, with the balance continuing to be funded through non-core assets sales. As for future development projects, we continue to carefully underrate opportunities and look for new land sites.", "As Tom indicated, we expect to start an additional two to three developments in the second half of 2014 with MetLife, all in our core markets and with trended spreads in our targeted range of a 150 basis point to 200 basis points.", "Next, our assets sales. In late June, we closed on the sale of two communities in Tampa for approximately $81 million. On July 1, we sold one community in Orlando for approximately $50 million. Combined these sales were transacted at a 5.6% cash flow cap rate. By the end of day tomorrow, July 30, we expect that the sale of two Norfolk Virginia area communities will be completed for approximately $47 million at a 7.5% cash flow cap rate.", "With these dispositions, we will have sold approximately $225 million of non-core assets in 2014 thus far at a blended cash flow cap rate of 6.1%. Combined, these assets had an average revenue for occupied home of approximately $1,120 and averaged 25 years old.", "Our 2014 guidance currently contemplates an additional $125 million to $225 million in dispositions by yearend as well as $100 million to $150 million of 1031 acquisitions. We are making progress with these transactions, and we'll provide further details, as they become available.", "Additionally, subsequent to the end of the second quarter, the company received proceeds totaling $36 million from the prepayment of a B note it held. The note was secured by class A property in Los Angeles, with a maturity date in 2022.", "The prepayment of this note resulted in a net gain of approximately $8.4 million or $0.03 of FFO per share, which will be recognized in the third quarter. The gain positively impacted the company's full year 2014 FFO per share guidance, but will have no affect on FFO as adjusted or AFFO per share.", "On to third quarter and full year 2014 guidance. Second quarter earnings and same-store sales growth remained strong. As a result of our positive first half 2014 and third quarter to date operating results and income related to the prepayment of the B note, I referenced earlier, we are increasing our full year 2014 FFO per share guidance at the midpoint by $0.04 to $1.52 to $1.56 from $1.47 to $1.53. We are increasing our full year FFO as adjusted per share guidance by $0.01 at the midpoint to $1.49 to $1.53 from $1.47 to $1.53, and AFFO per share guidance by $0.01 at the midpoint to $1.32 to $1.36 from $1.30 to $1.36.", "Regarding same-store expectations, we are increasing our full year 2014 same-store revenue growth guidance to 3.75% to 4.25%, up 12.5 basis points at the midpoint, reducing our expense growth guidance to 1.75% to 2.25%, down a 100 basis points at the midpoint and raising our NOI growth guidance to 4.5% to 5.5%, up 62.5 basis points at the midpoint. We also increased our full year same-store occupancy guidance by 50 basis points to 96.5%.", "Other primary full year guidance assumptions can be found on Attachment 15 or Page 27 of our supplement.", "Third quarter 2014 FFO per share guidance is $0.39 to $0.41, inclusive of the additional income from the prepayment of the B note on July 16. FFO as adjusted per share guidance is $0.36 to $0.38, and AFFO per share guidance is $0.31 to $0.33.", "Finally, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.26 in the second quarter for $1.04 per share when annualized. This represents a yield of approximately 3.6% and will be our 167th straight quarter of paying the dividend.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Jerry.", "Jerry Davis", "Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks, I'll cover the following topics: first, our second quarter portfolio metrics, leasing trends and an overview of our current operating strategy; second, the performance of our primary core markets during the quarter; and last, a brief update on our development lease-ups.", "We are pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. In the second quarter, our same-store revenue per occupied home increased by 3.8% year-over-year to $1,586 per month. Our same-store occupancy of 96.8% was 60 basis points higher on year-over-year and sequential basis.", "Our total portfolio revenue per occupied home at quarter end was $1,733 per month, including pro rata JVs. Our revenue growth during the first half of the year has been 4.5%, as a result of a 50 basis point improvement in occupancy and a 3.9% increase in the rent per occupied home.", "As Tom stated earlier, our revised full year revenue guidance is 3.75% to 4.25%, which implies a second half deceleration. Let me be clear that while we do expect lower revenue growth in the back half of the year, it is the result of two factors.", "First, we had exceptionally strong occupancy in the second half of 2013 that averaged 96.3%. Therefore, we do not expect the same level of occupancy pickup in 3Q and 4Q of 2014 that we have benefited from in the first half of this year.", "Second, today we are pushing rents harder than we normally would at this time of year, because of our very high occupancy levels, which today are close to 97%. While this will result in a slightly lower closing ratio on perspective residents and may cause some existing residents to move out, we are willing to sacrifice some near-term occupancy to strengthen our rent growth in 2015. Through our many strategic initiatives implemented over the past several years, we have the necessary platform to efficiently manage our portfolio moving forward.", "Turning to new and renewal lease rate growth, detailed on Attachment 8G our supplement. Second quarter effective new lease rents increased by 3.6%. Renewal rate growth remained strong at 5.5%. San Francisco, Seattle, Boston and Nashville performed well, while the Mid-Atlantic region continued to struggle.", "As a quick reminder, our realized renewal rent growth in a quarter typically is slightly higher than the rate we initially send out to our residents. For July, renewal rate growth is currently 5.1%, and I would expect third quarter renewal growth will be in the 5% range.", "In the first quarter of 2015, we believe likely that our revenue growth will stop decelerating. We base this on supply and demand projections in our submarkets, the strong occupancy trends we are currently seeing and the rate level at which we are currently able to sign and renew residents.", "Regionally, the Mid-Atlantic with the exception of Metro D.C. is beginning to improve modestly. We expect our southeastern markets to remain stable, as new supply is offset by strong job growth. The same hope is true for our Texas markets.", "We are confident that the northeast will hold up well, but certain submarkets may face some supply issues moving forward. The west should remain strong, as job growth, especially in the tech sector, continues to enable us to drive rent growth.", "Next, annualized turnover in the second quarter increased slightly by 20 basis points year-over-year. The increase was partially attributable to our ongoing focus on lease exploration management.", "Over the past couple of years, we have concentrated more leases in the high demand second and third quarters. This active management should continue to benefit our current and future year results. Further details for these metrics can be found on Attachment 8G or Page 20 of our supplement.", "Rent as a percentage of our residents' income held steady at roughly 19%. Move-outs to home purchase were up 50 basis points year-over-year at 13.9%, still below our long-term average of approximately 15%.", "Moving on to quarterly performance in our primary core markets. These markets represent 65% of our same-store NOI and 70% of our total NOI. Orange County and Los Angeles, which combined represent 16.5% of our total NOI, continue to slowly improve.", "As many of you are aware, we are lengthening the average term at 1,447 home Newport Beach community, the Coronado's. This will better position the community long-term, as it will stabilize year round pricing and mitigate seasonal occupancy and rent growth fluctuations.", "However, short-term, this change hurt our second quarter new lease rate growth in Orange County as the Coronado's account for roughly half of our same-store units in the market. We will benefit later in 2014 and in 2015 for this strategic move.", "New York City, which represents 12% of our total NOI improved sequentially as new lease and renewal rates averaged 3.3% and 6.2% growth, respectively. And occupancy averaged 97.1% in the second quarter. New York remains a good market. With occupancy above 98% currently, we have positioned ourselves well for a strong third quarter. As a reminder, 95 Wall, which we had excluded from same-store results due to Hurricane Sandy, was included in the second quarter same-store home account.", "Metro DC, which represents 13% of our total NOI had occupancy of 97.4% and effective rent growth of 90 basis points in the second quarter. A strong result considering the ongoing concerns many have for this market. The encouraging results is attributable to our mix of approximately 40% A and 60% B product, as well as less direct submarket exposure to new supply.", "We believe these factors will continue to help us fare better than many of our peers in 2014. Our B assets in the market experienced revenue growth of 1.4% in 2Q, outperforming our A assets by 30 basis points. We are still expecting positive full year revenue growth of approximately 1% in DC.", "San Francisco, which represents 11% of our total NOI, continues to generate extremely strong results due to high quality employment growth and a general housing shortage in the city proper. In June, new lease rate growth reached to 11% with renewals up 8%. Our July numbers are just as strong.", "Seattle, which represents 6% of our total NOI, is another market that has thus far more than adequately absorbed additional multi-family supply. New lease rate growth reached nearly 10% in June and renewal growth continues to be at the top-end of our portfolio. For July renewals are been achieved at 7%.", "Boston, which represents 6% of our total NOI, accelerated throughout the quarter and for a tough winter with new lease and renewal rate growth of 8.1% and 6.9%, respectively. We expect our suburban locations will continue to outperform as they are less directly impacted by the new supply has being delivered into the downtown core.", "Lastly, Dallas, which represents 5% of our NOI, is performing in line with our initial budgeted expectation. Uptown continues to perform well, even with significant new supply coming on line. Our North Dallas has begun to see some new supply pressures. Fortunately, Dallas continues to enjoy very strong job growth.", "Turning to our developments. First, our projects that were stabilized for full quarter. Demand at our 467 home, $150 million Bella Terra community in Huntington Beach remains fantastic. The property hit 90% leased in only six months and is currently 97% occupied with rents well ahead of pro forma estimates at $2.55 a square foot.", "Next, our projects recently stabilized or in lease up. Channel at Mission Bay, our 315 home, $145 million development in San Francisco and 13th & market, our 264 home, $73 million development in San Diego continue to perform well.", "Weighted average effective rents are 10% above plan. Channel, in particular, is outpacing initial expectations after hitting 90% occupancy in June, just six months after opening its doors and effective rent, 18% above budget. The property is currently 97% leased and 95% physically occupied.", "Los Alisos at Mission Viejo, California; Domain College Park across the street from the University of Maryland Business School and Fiori at our Vitruvian Park joint venture in Addison, Texas comprised $199 million in aggregate estimated cost. Weighted average effective rents are approximately on plan. Currently Fiori is 92% leased, Domain College Park is 99% leased and Los Alisos is 79% leased. Domain College Park and Los Alisos should both hit 90% physical occupancy within 13 months of opening. All in, we remain very positive on how our recently completed and end lease up developments are progressing in aggregate.", "Finally, a quick update on our development communities that are not yet open. It's still very early, but pre-leasing at Beach & Ocean, our 173 home, $51 million development in Huntington Beach and DelRay Tower, our 332 home, $132 million project in Alexandria, Virginia is progressing well. Beach & Ocean will open in October and it is currently 16% pre-leased. DelRay will welcome its first residents in August and it is currently 19% pre-leased.", "With that I'll open the call for Q&A. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We'll hear first from Nick Joseph with Citi.", "Nick Joseph - Citi", "In terms of funding the remainder of the development spend, how do you internally weigh decision between selling additional assets and issuing equity at this price?", "Thomas Herzog", "Nick, this is Tom Herzog. We still have a view that funding the remaining development through sale of non-core assets is how we would intend to fund that. As it pertains to issuance of equity, as we've been saying since the beginning of the year, trading at a premium and having accretive use for the funds that we will consider as an option, but as far funding development it is intended through the sale of non-core assets.", "Nick Joseph - Citi", "So when you say accretive use of funds, so you're putting development aside, is that really only acquisitions?", "Thomas Herzog", "It would be acquisitions or other, but excluding development.", "Nick Joseph - Citi", "And then could you talk about what has driven the increased occupancy? And if that was an active decision that you targeted within your revenue management system?", "Jerry Davis", "Nick, this is Jerry Davis. We really started driving occupancy up probably about nine months ago. And it's really a couple of factors. We really didn't do any of it within the pricing system. I think when you look our rent growth and renewal growth, it's comparable to most of our peers, but we have seen a pickup in occupancy.", "And there is really a two or three primary drivers of that. One, starting in fourth quarter of last year, we brought in-house, what we call an outbound call center, and all that is, is a small group of people that go through a discarded leads from our sites, that our sites folks have just determined that they are not hot leads, and we try to resurrect those.", "And even though the hit ratio on those is relatively small, we found we've been able to pick up over 250 incremental leases, so far in the first seven months of this year. And when you look at that over the entire portfolio not just the same-store, that's probably at least a 40 basis points or 50 basis points pop to occupancy that was done with nothing to do with pricing.", "The other factor and we've been working on this for a couple of years is continuously driving to reduce the number of days an apartments sits vacant between when the prior resident moves out and the current resident moves in. Two years ago, we were about 26 days to reoccupy unit, our goal this year is to get it to 22 days. We hit 24 days last year.", "And we think we can continue to drive that down further by becoming more efficient on turning apartments, as well as putting more of an emphasis on pre-leasing, notice to vacate units instead of just vacant units. And I would remind you, everyday we can cut off of our average days vacant about $1.05 million of additional revenue drops to our bottomline.", "Nick Joseph - Citi", "Where do you think that 22 days could eventually get to?", "Jerry Davis", "I think we can get it probably to the mid-to-high teens. We're currently, when you break it down between turn time and time to reoccupy after the unit is made ready, we've gotten turn time down to a little under seven days. And the amount of time to get it occupied after its ready is about 15 days. Those numbers fluctuate and there's some seasonality this time of the year.", "My goal for the month of August is to get to 15 days of total vacant days. But when you get to the winter months, they can get up to the mid-to-high 20s. And I do have some tight markets that I typically can run at about 10 days such as San Francisco and pockets in New York.", "Operator", "And next you will hear from Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.", "Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley", "Tom Herzog, a question for you. So I guess some clarity on the FFO per share guidance here. Curious on, it looks like you were raising the full year as adjusted guidance by just $0.02 here when you're already $0.04 ahead on the first half so far year-to-date. So curious on perhaps what's holding you back from a slightly larger increase here? Is it fairly down to conservatism or is it perhaps something that we're not fully appreciating like, well, anything that we're not fully appreciating?", "Thomas Herzog", "When we look at the first half, we came in at about $0.75 of FFO as adjusted and we have $0.76 in the second half. The reason that the growth is in a little bit bigger in the second half, well, there is a couple of things you probably expect. We issued that unsecured debt in June and then we've got the dispositions in the second half of the year. So it's kind of in line with what we expected.", "As to the beat that we had in Q1 and then Q2, just a little bit of conservatism, probably both into the guidance for the first two quarters, as each of those quarters came up, as they were both early in the year and a little bit of uncertainty. So there is really nothing beyond that.", "Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley", "And a follow up. So it sounds like, well, your recent dispositions have been in your call it warehouse markets, where you've capitalized on what looks like to be pretty good pricing for those assets. I'm curious as you look ahead, when you talked about some thoughts on near-term asset sales. Would you consider perhaps broadening your perspective and selling some assets, some of your better quality assets in your core urban coastal markets, given what seemed to be pretty full asset pricing here? And we're starting to see some condo converted stock get back into the marketplace.", "Harry Alcock", "I think as Tom mentioned in his prepared remarks today, including the B note payoff, we closed about $225 million year-to-date. We've got another $47 million scheduled to close this week. A couple of properties in non-core capital warehouse markets in Virginia Beach that will get us to a little over $270 million. That leads in order to hit midpoint of our guidance another $125 million or so.", "We will at times consider selling properties in core markets, particularly non-core properties in core markets. We're aware that condo pricing is starting to manifest itself a bit in certain markets in New York City and San Francisco, we're not looking to do anything specifically today, but that potentially is an opportunity in the future.", "Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley", "And Harry, while you're on, just one more follow-up on that front. The B assets you sold, curious as to the type of buyer that showed up, were there more institutional buyers? Were there just a greater number of buyers? I'm just curious if there was any retrading or you're effectively getting your full price?", "Harry Alcock", "The three Florida assets, where we received 20-plus bids on each of those. It's just a very broad buyer base, mostly kind of local and regional syndicators. But there is a lot of folks that are selling for those types of assets, they're leverage buyers. It's a very deep and liquid market right now. There were no retrades on those three.", "The two Hampton Roads assets, the buyer base is a little bit different. It's more of a local type buyer typically. We get several bids, but we're not going to reach the 20-type buyer range. But again, it's going to be a leverage buyer, and there was no retrade of any kind on those either.", "Operator", "We now move to a question from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill", "Two questions. First, did you say the rents on the Beach & Ocean deal are $2.55 a foot?", "Thomas Toomey", "I did -- No. Alex, the $2.55 a foot was actually on the Bella Terra deal.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill", "If you could just comment on the rents that you're getting at Beach & Ocean, and then what you expect for the Pacific City site?", "Jerry Davis", "Sure. I'll start with the Beach & Ocean. We're currently getting $2.69 market rents per square foot at Beach & Ocean. And I would tell you, we'll accept our first units their in October, and we've already pre-leased 16% of the property. We're still in design for the Pacific City deal. So we haven't finalized rent levels at that property at this point.", "Harry Alcock", "Alex, if I can jump in a little, I can tell you, this is Harry, with certainty we're going to get well above $3 a foot rents at that project. It really is a unique piece of dirt in Huntington Beach adjacent to 200,000 square foot retail center that will open in about a year. Tenants include Apple Store, Equinox, really unique type of project.", "Next to it, the hotel site has started construction. The hotel operator will be a resort-boutique type operator that operates the properties like the Bacara in Santa Barbara. So we're really going to have a very, very unique product offering there.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill", "And then on the B note, do you guys have other of these B note investments out there? Do you see this as a business line the way you guys used to look at the RE3, the merch business? Do you see this as a way to put capital out to try and get accretive returns or was this a one-off?", "Thomas Herzog", "It was a one-off. It was class A asset in L.A. that over time it would have been a nice asset to own. So it was a one-off. We don't have any further assets like that in our portfolio at the current date.", "Operator", "And Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch has the next question.", "Jana Galan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "For Jerry, I am sorry if I missed, can you give us an update on rent as a percent of income? And then maybe give a little bit more color on how much this number ranges within your portfolio and how that compares to prior peaks or your historical average?", "Jerry Davis", "The percent in second quarter in total was 19%. It's actually a hair under. That's up a little bit over the last year or so, when we were more in the 17% to 18% range. And I can tell you, I don't have good information on historical numbers related to this, and I don't know if they would be valid anyways, given how much UDR's portfolio has changed over the last seven years, the totally different type of product and resident base. It ranges from mid-teens to mid-20s, but the majority really do come in between that 18% and 22%.", "Jana Galan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And then just following up, I heard your As versus Bs performance in D.C., but do you have that for the portfolio?", "Jerry Davis", "I sure do. For the last couple of months on new leases, Bs have outperformed to As, somewhere in the 40 basis point to 50 basis point range. And on renewals Bs are getting about 20 basis points to 30 basis points better. So call it a blended 30.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Nick Yulico with UBS.", "Nick Yulico - UBS", "First question on the development pipeline. You talk about, I think you said it was 170 basis points is the spread right now between the yield and cap rates. I think that was for the projects that were completed, but not stabilized. Is that right?", "Thomas Herzog", "That's actually for the ones that are under construction, that are in the pipeline. The 180 basis point is for the entire $1.1 billion pipeline, including those that are completed.", "Nick Yulico - UBS", "So for the ones that were completed, I think you guys are saying something similar as far as the spread in the first quarter. So the ones that are completed, are they sort of performing the same way that they were you thought in the first quarter or have you got any uplift in yield from any of those projects that have been completed now?", "Harry Alcock", "I'll start and Herzog and Jerry can chime in, if they have any additional input. But remember, these are stabilized yields that we're calculating. So mostly those stabilized yields are calculated one year after completion. So these are sort of 2015 and into 2016 are the measurement periods. So in the last quarter we for the most part have not updated any forecast associated with those dates. But the assets are continuing to lease up as expected and that the forecast have remained largely unchanged over the last quarter.", "Jerry Davis", "I would agree with that. Lease up velocity over the last 30 days has been strong throughout the development portfolio. On Page 21 of the supplement, we show leased occupancies at these properties and they continue to strengthen. I can tell you for example, Channel Mission Bay, a San Francisco property today is 97% leased, and I'd remind you that we expected our first residents just seven months ago in December.", "Bella Terra is 99% leased. Domain College Park, which has been a little slow to lease up, because it caters to the Smith Business School at the University Maryland, it's 99 % leased today, and 30 days from now once school returns, it will be at about 98%. So we'll have achieved over 90% occupancy in about 13 months, because we accepted our first building last year in June or July.", "And then when you get down to 13th & market, which is our property in the East Village, downtown San Diego, leased occupancy today is 81%. We accepted our first units there last fall and that's another property that we fully expect to hit stabilized occupancy over 90% within 12 months.", "And I stated earlier to Alex that Beach & Ocean are property that will open its doors in October in Huntington Beach. We've already pre-leased 16% of the units there. And the DelRay Tower, our property in the DC area, where we renovated and added density to existing property, we opened that property later this week and we've already pre-leased 21% of the units there.", "So leasing velocity is good. And I would tell you, the ones that's been a little bit slower than normal, we tend to lease up in 12 months or less on average, but Fiori, our property in Vitruvian Park, which at about month 14 -- I mean 18 right now, is 92% leased. So we're about to hit stabilized occupancy there.", "Nick Yulico - UBS", "And then I know you guys like to quote these projects in relation to where the yield is versus market cap rates, but it would pretty helpful to get a sense for where you think the absolute stabilized yield is for this pipeline right now. And then if you could talk about then as well, since it sounds like the new starts are to mostly be in California, what the yield would be on those projects?", "Harry Alcock", "Nick, its Harry Alcock. The yields for the pipeline, the 180 basis points are about 6.1%. And then the future projects in California, again, we'll announce those once we start the project. But I think you could assume something relatively similar.", "Operator", "And we'll get the question from Rich Anderson from Mizuho.", "Rich Anderson - Mizuho", "So Tom, I don't know if you mentioned this, but how did you -- I kind of got on a little bit late, how do you feel about floating rate debt at 17% and maturing debt in 2015 at 14%? Are you comfortable within prospect of higher interest rates or just if you could comment on your strategy?", "Thomas Herzog", "Well, let me hit the floating rate debt first, I didn't hear the second part. So floating rate debt, we're somewhere between, call it, 10% and 20% or even 15% to 20%, we're comfortable in that range, especially multi-family where you've got a lot of resets or quicker reset on rents. So there's some correlation in that respect. So we're comfortable with that range. What was the second part of your question?", "Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities", "Maturing debt in 2015?", "Thomas Herzog", "Again, we're comfortable with the -- we've got about $500 million maturing. Its $300 million or so in January, and then the balance of that I think is in December. It comes in at a rate of somewhere around 5.6%. And as that refinances, it probably comes in a lower rate. So it's a pickup in our model depending on how that plays out. But we're comfortable with that.", "Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities", "And then the second question, I don't know if this was brought up either, but Tom Toomey in the beginning said you're doing a better job in dispositions and getting a better rate than you thought going in. Can you quantify what that is and what the driving factors are you think are behind that lower or that better cap rate, disposition cap rate?", "Harry Alcock", "Rich, this is Harry. I mean couple of things. One, demand for these assets have been very strong, as I mentioned earlier in the call. And there really, given the demand and the competitive environment for these assets, there simply are no retrade, which there haven't been in our experience this year, which candidly is a bit unusual.", "Remember, we expose a number of assets to market, the mix of assets sometimes impacts cap rates, but primarily it's just a very favorable sales environment. And an environment in which interest rates, if you recall, have actually floated down, which also impacts pricing.", "Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities", "I guess, my question is you mentioned in New York and San Francisco starting to see some condo pricing, but that has not played a role yet in that number. Is that correct?", "Harry Alcock", "Correct. There is condo interest whatsoever for the assets that we're marketing.", "Operator", "We'll now move to a question from Derek Bower with ISI Group.", "Derek Bower - ISI Group", "Jerry, I had a follow-up on the call center. Do you think this program can maintain that 40% to 50% lease per month hit rate that it seems to be having this year? And if so do you think that means occupancy can sort of normalize in a mid-96% range going forward?", "Jerry Davis", "I don't see why it cannot continue at that rate, Derek. The only thing I could see changing, but I think we would still be able to keep that occupancy, if my people on the ground maybe keep these leads alive a little bit longer. I think they have a lot of things to work on and some times you do just have some traffic that falls off the radar that these people pick up.", "But yes, I think the new norm, especially given the portfolio that UDR has today and the markets it has today and the quality it has today, it's probably going to continue to run 50 basis points higher than we did a year ago. I think this is a new norm.", "And the good thing, I would tell you because of the boost in occupancy that that team gave us, is it's put us in a position about three months earlier to have very high occupancy. This morning, when I was looking to my dashboard, I'm between 96.8% and 96.9% physical occupancy at my same-store portfolio. When you have that kind of occupancy at this time of the year, it gives you the ability to push rate a little bit harder.", "I'll give you a quick example. I look back last year, and when I looked at my June market rents and my July market rents, I had started decelerating by about $10 per unit from June to July last year. When I look at June to July this year, my market rents per unit accelerated $10. That's about a $20 or a little over probably 120 basis point increase in what I'm going to be able to push rents at.", "And we're willing to let occupancy slide down a bit. Its still be in that mid-96 level to set ourselves up for higher rent growth today than we normally would have been able to get. And the reason we did that as we think it's going to help propel us in not just fourth quarter, but it set us up at least through the first two to three quarters of 2015 with strong revenue growth.", "Derek Bower - ISI Group", "And are there any markets where it sounds like you might be more aggressive with rate later this year? Are there any concentration in your portfolio?", "Thomas Toomey", "I think San Francisco and Seattle and Portland, the Pacific Northwest as you can see on Page 20 of our supplement, we're already getting very high-single digit new lease rate growth. I tell you what's been encouraging, I had in my prepared remarks, and a lot of people have asked about Orange County, because Orange County when you look at my supplement, we had new lease rate growth that was a negative 0.5% in the quarter and our revenue growth was up 4%, which was pretty disappointing in my expectation as it's going to be at the low end of my peers.", "What we were doing there was fixing the Coronado's where we had really catered over the last five to 10 years to a lot of short-term leases. What that created was a lumpiness in my revenue stream where I would peak in the spring and summer, but then fall down drastically in 4Q and 1Q. We've been pushing more for longer-term leases, which hurt our occupancy a bit and also took down our new lease rate growth. We think it's going to pay dividends, not just into this year, but also going into '15.", "But what's really encouraging is when I do go back and I look at how much my market rents have gone up from June to July. They've gone up $25 per unit in just the last month, which is over 2%, and my occupancy today in Orange County is 95.9%. So I think it was a painful strategy that we had to go through in the first half of the year to restabilize Orange County, but I think it really will set us up for a good end of this year and a strong 2015.", "Derek Bower - ISI Group", "And then, just the last one, on Fiori, obviously that seems like velocity has picked up there on leasing. I know you guys cut rate back in April, have you had a cut rate again over the last three or four months or is that from the seasonality and you cut rate once and now you're just starting to see a pick up in demand?", "Jerry Davis", "No, it's really more of a one-time cut. Effective rates today are about $1.80, that's about where it was when we did the original cut. What you're really seeing is just a normal seasonal pickup that occurs in Dallas. The last two to three months we've been grossing 40 to 45 leases per month there and netting somewhere in the 35 range.", "And so Dallas is a tough market, especially at the end level. You've got new supply that's coming in both [Technical Difficulty] Plano area. So we're kind of getting squeezed on both side as we introduce this new price point in that Addison market.", "One thing we're encouraged by and this won't help us all at once, but we think it will over time, is the Toyota headquarters building that moved from Torrance, California is up in Plano, which is probably only a 10 or 15 minute drive from Fiori, and we think we're going to be able to capture some residents from that relocation.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from David Bragg with Green Street Advisors.", "David Bragg - Green Street Advisors", "Jerry, did you say earlier that D.C. is improving modestly? And if so, can you elaborate on that?", "Jerry Davis", "D.C. is stable. I wouldn't say it's necessarily improving and I think we're really going to have challenges over the next nine to 12 month as is new supply continues to come and job growth continues to be moderate. We've been stable. We had 1.3% revenue growth in 1Q, it was 1.2% growth in 2Q.", "What I can tell you is the differential that we have experienced between our best performers and worst performers has tightened. In the first quarter my best performing property was a deal out in Fairfax County. It was a B quality asset that had 5% revenue growth. And my worst performer was a stabilized property in the U Street corridor, that's right across the street from our Capital View development. And now it had about a negative 4% revenue growth.", "This quarter my best performing property was that same Fairfax County property and it had positive revenue growth of 3%, but my worst performing property was a property inside the beltway on Columbia Pike that was at negative 2%. So it still is a submarket-by-submarket deal, but I think D.C. is going to continue to be the struggling market for another nine to 12 months.", "David Bragg - Green Street Advisors", "And also, I think you said earlier that you expect a pause in the deceleration of revenue growth to occur in the first quarter of '15, is that right?", "Jerry Davis", "Yes.", "David Bragg - Green Street Advisors", "And what type of economic environment does that assume? Does that assume a continuation of the type of job growth that we've seen so far this year?", "Jerry Davis", "Yes. I think if things continue as they are today, Dave, adding 200,000, 250,000 jobs a month, when that supply continues to come where we're seeing from AXIO that it's going to hit our submarkets. We're comfortable that things next year probably going to look kind of similar to what they are right now, and the deceleration will probably continue through the back half of this year for us. That is going to be predominantly due to us not being able to pick up any gains in occupancy, because we hit high occupancy late last year, and today we're trying to push rents. But we think it's really a continuation of what we're seeing today.", "David Bragg - Green Street Advisors", "And two more quick ones for Tom Herzog. First, Tom, on Attachment 5, there a really high margin is implied within your stabilized non-mature pool. I realized that's small, but want to ask you, what's driving that?", "Thomas Herzog", "Dave, let me look at the details of that, we could take that offline. Let me call you back after the call. There is nothing down there, but I do want to take a look at that and answer it after the call.", "David Bragg - Green Street Advisors", "And last one for you is, can you please just explain your cash flow cap rate methodology? Walk us through management fee, CapEx, what NOI we're talking about and is that consistent across the Florida sales and the Virginia sales?", "Jerry Davis", "We're taking a full cash flow cap rate approach. We take 2014 NOI. We're using real CapEx not the $300 to $500 dual version of it. So $1,200 a door and then 3% management fee, so very much of a straight on cash flow cap rate approach.", "David Bragg - Green Street Advisors", "And that's consistent across all of the dispositions you've talked about today, Virginia, Florida, anything else. Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And now moving to the next question, that will come from Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.", "Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets", "Jerry, did you actually give what the July new lease number was? And then also you broke it out between A and B, could you talk about what you're seeing urban versus maybe some of the suburban assets there?", "Jerry Davis", "Sure. I'll give you the first one. July new lease rate growth in total was 4.1%, which is up a bit from May and June. Both May and June were 4%. So it's continued to accelerate. And as we look out into the month of August we have visibility of what market rents are on those units that either have not been leased yet or have been pre-leased. I would expect August to be roughly in that range too. And then, renewals in the month of July came down a bit, they were 5.1%, and I would expect renewals over the next quarter or so to be in the lows.", "And then, you asked about urban and suburban, we typically track it more A, B and things like that. I will tell you, we look at urban and suburban, I'm going to let Thomas Toomey address this in a second, but just when do you look at the growth rates, urban As and suburban As for us, they are both right about 4.1%. This is more on the revenue growth for the second quarter, not new lease rate growth. And then, our best performing segment was really the suburban Bs, which came in the 4.7% range. But I'm going let Tom a minute about how we look at urban and suburban and our view on that.", "Thomas Toomey", "Yes, Mike. One thing we found and we keep reading through everybody's research is there's lines between urban and suburban seem to be blurred in our view, because you're seeing a lot of these cities are really connecting both of those areas of their communities through enhancements in their transportation systems and jobs are moving around that transportation hubs. And so it's hard for us even when we look at particular cities to draw a distinction between urban product and suburban product.", "What we're really more focused on as a company and where we allocate our capital is really kind of get more focused on our submarkets and where we think rent to income levels are supported, supply constraints might be greater, and the prospects out into the future.", "And so you take Manhattan, which we've stepped into probably four years ago, we really looked at the market and said, we wanted it would be a B product in Manhattan. And then we thought over the long-term, that's where the greatest potential for either redevelopments or steady cash flow growth over time. And always felt that an A in Manhattan would be a tough deal, because that's a renter by unique standards and would be very frugal in terms of where they always move to the next new great deal.", "And you contrast that where Bella Terra in Huntington Beach, the submarket to us was really attractive, because nothing had been built in 20 years. And it's very clear after putting up a 500 unit community, and Jerry leases it practically out in eight months that that was a good identified opportunity.", "And so you will find us going forward and probably doing a better job of communicating it, is trying to articulate clearly why we think the submarkets that we're building in and the product that we'll have in that market, where it's positioned, and why we think over the long-term it creates greater value.", "And so we're not trying to marry ourselves to an A product or B product or an urban or suburban, we're really trying to throw a very careful dart around a particular submarket and a particular product that we think over the long-term really generates the right returns. And I think that's what we are challenged to do and communicate in the future and you will see us do a better job of that.", "Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets", "Just as my follow-up then, probably for either Tom there. Given the pricing we're seeing in the market, we've seen a decent amount of compression in some of the B markets there, some of the B or secondary markets. And also, just given the appreciation in shares today, realize you guys put out the three-year plan. But is there any thought to potentially accelerating that especially with $553 million of debt maturing. Is there any thoughts rather to maybe accelerating some of that deleveraging? I know you had set out a gradual deleveraging plan, but just in light of the current capital environment.", "Thomas Toomey", "Tom will add some, but I would tell you this. I think asset pricing had some to room to run. The capital is stacked pretty darn deep, cash flows are growing, availability for leverage is still out in the marketplace at very attractive prices. So we think there is some room to run these asset prices, and by no measure calling a top on pricing. So I think we're going to continue to just expose assets, see where pricing comes in. If we feel like we're reaching a toping mechanism, we'll certainly revisit our strategy and our plan.", "Thomas Herzog", "I think Tom covered it. As it currently stands, Mike, we still do think that that matching the sales of non-core against development is the right approach. But certainly as conditions change, we'll revisit that. But that's currently where we stand.", "Operator", "And now we'll here from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo.", "Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo", "Thanks guys, and Jerry, thanks for your remarks on the D.C. market. I know that you think there is going to be some more choppiness there for another nine to 12 months, but are there submarkets within D.C. that you feel might have already seen the worst?", "Jerry Davis", "Well, it's hard to tell. There is still more supply coming. I can tell you I'm a little encouraged for example at U Street. Again, we have Capital View and a property called View 14 that is in my same-store pool, that when I compare to last year, it's a bit better. I can also tell you it's interesting when I look at D.C. and I look at market rents compared to what they were a year ago. We're about within 1% of where they were a year ago, and they're actually 4% higher than they were at year end.", "So there are some submarkets that I think have been fairly stable, when we look out it Woodbridge, when you look at some of our properties in the district around Logan Circle and places like that, things feel fairly stable. But again, wherever the new supply is going to continue to come out of the ground, I think you're still in for tough sledding.", "Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo", "Any discernible change in how buyers in that market are underwriting assets there?", "Harry Alcock", "The truth is there is still a lot of demand for apartments in the good D.C. locations and pricing of recent trades reflects that. Buyers inevitably here are going to contemplate that the next year or two is going to be, call it, flat in terms of revenue growth. But the good product still has a plenty of buyer demand.", "Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities", "I guess maybe switching to Boston, if I could. Jerry, how are you thinking about Boston as supply comes into the market in the next two or three years? And then how would you compare that outlook for the market compared to what we've already seen in D.C., do you think it's going to be a similar impact or better or worse?", "Jerry Davis", "Yes. I'll start, and then I'll probably throw it over to Harry, since he looks more out in the future of the pipeline. I think what you're going see is this first wave of new supply, and what we show is it's going to grow by about 7,000 units in 2014, quite a bit in the CBD. Yes, that's about a 1.7% increase in supply.", "And we felt over the last couple of years that the downtown area was actually slightly under supplied and could absorb quite a bit. And we're actually seeing that. We're holding up fairly well throughout Boston. Even our one property in the Back Bay I think had revenue growth of about 5%. So it's holding up.", "I think it's definitely going to get choppy in some of the submarkets as they come. We have a property that we're pretty excited about down in the Seaport area. We love our location. It's going to be delivering in later in the first quarter. But there is going to be other supply that comes in proximate too and it's probably going to be to some degree a competitive world with some of the other new product coming.", "But we like the job market in Boston, whether it's education, tech, financial. We think Boston can probably act more like Seattle, which had a lot of new supply as well as in Austin that had a lot of new supply, because you have high-quality jobs that are there to absorb it.", "And I think that's one of the big differences when you compare to D.C. is, you had a situation where D.C. had excessive new supply, where you're adding 3% to 4% over the last couple of years of new product, and you had job growth that was basically zero. So I look at it with that kind of a difference. So we're a little more optimistic about Boston being more similar to Seattle and Austin than it is to a D.C. But Harry, anything you'd add?", "Harry Alcock", "I think you hit it. The main point is that there is a lot of good jobs being created in Boston, whereas in D.C. job growth is largely flattened out. If you just look at the jobs coming into the submarket adjacent to our Pier 4 project, in Seaport, that we'll begin delivering early next year, we spend over 2 million square feet of office that has either been delivered in the last year or is under construction, 70% or 75% of that is already leased.", "Companies like Vertex relocating into the Seaport, taking 1.1 million square feet, which is 3,000 or 4,000 jobs. Goodwin Procter is taking 4,000 square feet in an office building right next to our Pier 4 project. So you do have an unusual amount of job growth that we expect will fuel demand for the apartments that are being delivered over the next couple of years.", "Operator", "And now we'll hear from William Kuo with Cowen and Company.", "William Kuo - Cowen and Company", "Just a point of clarification. As I look at the full-year guidance, it looked like at the midpoint revenue growth was revised up 12 bps. Occupancy was revised up 50 basis points. Does that imply that rent growth expectations came down a bit?", "Jerry Davis", "Not really. This is Jerry. The occupancy increase in guidance was really much more related to how well we've done in the first half of this year. We were able to hit 96.8% this quarter. I think year-to-date occupancy is 96.5%. Our expectation was really that the first half of the year we would probably be in the low 96%. We weren't as confident at that time that this outbound call center would be so successful. So it's really a continuation of the same occupancy we've had.", "And I would tell you the increase in occupancy that we had in the first half of the year really was able to help fuel the revenue growth, because we actually came in a little bit under in the first half of this year in rent growth based on our original plan. So basically what I'm saying, I think occupancy continues roughly where it is. And you probably see a slight deceleration or flatness, if you will, in rent growth.", "William Kuo - Cowen and Company", "And then secondly, again, with the guidance, G&A went up about $1 million at the midpoint, and it looked like $0.6 million of that was from the long-term incentive plan. Is there something else making up that difference or is it more just a rounding thing?", "Thomas Herzog", "We had a couple of things going on in the G&A. There was about a $1 million of timing in the first half. We just had an acceleration of about a $1 million from what we would have in the second half. And the second thing is we did bump the guidance up at the midpoint, [Technical Difficulty]. You're correct, part of this is just delta based on performance. The other small amount is just miscellaneous other items.", "Operator", "And we'll hear from Nick Yulico of UBS.", "Nick Yulico - UBS", "Just a follow-up on the G&A question. Can you just quantify, I mean, if it is going up by whatever it was one at the midpoint. I mean was the savings in the same-store property operating expenses an offset to that?", "Thomas Herzog", "The G&A up by $1 million, it has no connection really with the same-store operating expenses at all. It's just two totally separate things.", "Nick Yulico - UBS", "And I'm just still a bit confused as to I mean the same-store NOI is better, the bond deal you got execution like you thought you would, the asset sales sounds like it have been a little better, the G&A is kind of an offset to that. And as it seems like again your FFO going up $0.01 and your adjusted FFO, it just seems like there will be more of a benefit from how the same-store did?", "Thomas Herzog", "Well, we said a couple of things. So same-store has improved with better results on the development as far as timing, the lease up on that. G&A is an offset. We did have some timing on the interest expense, where we've got the bond offering that occurred late in the June timeframe, we've got some timing on the sales. So when you factor all those components in, that's what's driving the $0.01 improvement.", "Operator", "And this will conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I'll turn the call back over to Tom Toomey for closing remarks.", "Thomas Toomey", "Thank you for all of you, for your time and the comprehensive dialogue on the call. In summary, it was a very good quarter. We started out that way. We feel great about the quarter. It's a great time to be in the apartments business again.", "And lastly, I'd say, we're very focused on our plan and in particular about building a strong 2015. We feel like we got a lot of right momentum, a lot of right operating strategies, execution on the development activity, the financing front. So we feel really great about the business and are looking forward to getting this year behind us and getting into '15.", "With that, we'll sign off. And wish you to have a good happy summer.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Operator", "Good day, and welcome to UDR's 3Q '14 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Chris Van Ens. Please go ahead.", "Christopher G. Van Ens", "Thank you for joining us for UDR's Third Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. Our third quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed yesterday afternoon and posted to our website, www.udr.com.", "In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements. I would like to note that statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met.", "A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in yesterday's press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.", "[Operator Instructions] Please note that there is another multifamily REIT call that begins at 2 p.m. Eastern so our call will be kept to 1 hour. Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered on the call.", "I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to UDR's third quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Tom Herzog, Chief Financial Officer; and Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our results, as well as senior officers Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.", "First, all aspects of our business continue to perform well in the third quarter and remain in line with or ahead of the key targets outlined in our most recent 3-year plan. With 2014 largely wrapped up, we're fully focused on setting the company up for a strong 2015.", "In short, but without providing forward guidance at this time, we expect 2015 to look relatively similar to 2014, meaning that operating fundamentals should remain very favorable and development highly accretive. Both of these will help drive cash flow and NAV growth in 2015.", "Nationally, multifamily fundamentals remain strong. The vast majority of our markets continue to experience outsized demand relative to supply, while single-family housing challenges persist due to changing demographic trends, strict credit standards and low inventories.", "We do not expect these dynamics to change anytime soon, but we'll be monitoring the recent news that the GSEs may loosen credit standards.", "Against this backdrop, and in conjunction with our strong 2014 results to date, we raised our full year earnings and same-store revenue forecast in today's press release. Tom will discuss the details in his prepared remarks, while Jerry will address the success we achieved pushing rental rates during the quarter to benefit 2015.", "In fact, even when faced with higher supply in many of our markets than at 1 year ago, our advantageous product mix and strong submarket locations resulted in combined new and renewal lease growth of 4.8% this quarter, 30 basis points above that achieved in third quarter 2013.", "This acceleration is more noteworthy when considering that Jerry and team accomplished this, while maintaining high occupancies during the quarter.", "Moving on. The third quarter was successful for UDR in a number of fronts. First, and as previously announced, we closed on $97 million of noncore multifamily dispositions at better pricing than originally contemplated. Proceeds will continue to fund our accretive development projects.", "Second, we are under contract to sell all the communities in our Texas joint venture or approximately 3,400 apartment homes, of which we own 20% plus a promote and fees. We have received hard money and the sale is scheduled to close in January 2015 for approximately $400 million in total proceeds. We expect to achieve a strong return on this investment although the loss of the management fees will negatively affect our 2000 earnings by around $0.01. We will provide additional details when the transaction closes.", "Third, we completed $121 million of 1031 acquisitions in Seattle, a market where we were under-allocated from our NOI perspective. The addition of the newly constructed high-quality community satisfies our acquisition guidance for 2014.", "Fourth, we issued approximately $100 million of equity at or around consensus NAV during the quarter, which will primarily be used to fund our accretive $92 million Steele Creek participating loan investment in Denver. This use is consistent with our past commentary, that is we will consider issuing equity to fund accretive growth opportunities when our shares trade at or above NAV after fees.", "Fifth, we started $125 million, 381-home development during the quarter in Irvine, California and a 50-50 joint venture with MetLife. We will continue to develop with Met as we work through the remaining 6 land parcels in joint venture 1. In the fourth quarter, we will complete the development of 2 wholly owned projects for a total cost of $183 million. Jerry will speak on our pre-leasing progress, which is going quite well.", "Sixth, we've received a credit upgrade from Moody's to Baa1 and changed outlook from S&P to BBB+. Tom will provide additional details on these items in his prepared remarks. However, from a bigger picture perspective, these achievements continue to advance the strategic initiatives outlined in our 3-year plan and emphasize our ongoing commitment to generate long-term, high-quality cash flow growth, while also continuing to improve our portfolio and balance sheet.", "In conclusion, I'd like to thank all my fellow associates for all their hard work in producing another strong quarter for UDR. We look forward to the remainder of 2014 and to a great 2015.", "And with that, I will turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Thanks, Tom. The topics I will cover today include: first, our third quarter 2014 results; second, a balance sheet and credit ratings update; third, ATM equity issuance during the quarter and intended use of proceeds; fourth, a development update; fifth, an overview of third quarter transactions; and last, our fourth quarter and full year 2014 guidance.", "First, our third quarter results came in at the high end of our previously provided guidance. FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $0.41, $0.38 and $0.34, respectively. Quarterly, same-store revenue, expense and NOI growth remained strong at 4.4%, 2.9% and 5.1%, respectively.", "Moving on to the balance sheet. At quarter end, our financial leverage at an underappreciated cost basis was 39.2%, and on a fair value basis, it was around 31%. It will trend lower by year-end. Our net debt to EBITDA was 6.7x, and we are on track to reach the mid-6s by year-end. Given this ongoing improvement, Moody's recently upgraded our senior unsecured credit ratings to Baa1, and S&P changed their outlook to BBB+. The improved ratings will result in approximately $1 million in annual savings on our revolver and term debt, in addition to tighter spreads on future unsecured debt issuances.", "Looking forward, we have $325 million of 5.25% unsecured debt maturing in January 2015 and another $188 million of 5.9% secured debt maturing in December 2015. Current rates look very attractive, and we continue to feel good about our ability to refinance this maturing debt.", "At quarter-end, our liquidity, as measured by cash and credit facility capacity, was $755 million. Next, as Tom mentioned, we issued approximately 3.4 million shares of common stock during the quarter, using our at-the-market equity program. The shares were issued at a gross price of $29.95 per share and net price of $29.36 per share, for net proceeds of approximately $100 million. The net price stacked up well against our consensus NAV during the quarter, and the proceeds will be used primarily to fund our accretive $92 million participating loan investment in the Steele Creek development property located in the Cherry Creek area of Denver.", "Turning to development. At quarter-end, our under construction and recently completed pipeline totaled $1 billion or 73% funded. Inclusive of our $422 million of stabilized, non-mature developments for wholly owned and JVs, the estimated trended spread on our development projects was 190 to 195 basis points at quarter-end. During the quarter, we started 1 development project in a 50-50 joint venture with MetLife. The Residences at 2801 Kelvin is located in Irvine, California, where we have 381 homes at a projected cost of $125 million at 100%. In the fourth quarter, our Beach & Ocean development in Huntington Beach, California, and our DelRay Tower project in Alexandria, Virginia, will reach completion. These projects consist of 505 homes at an aggregate cost of $183 million. Both projects are actively pre-leasing and will enhance the quality of our existing portfolio.", "As to future development projects, we continue to underwrite opportunities and will take advantage of our land bank. In the fourth quarter, we expect to start 2 additional development projects, at least 1 of which will be in a 50-50 joint venture with MetLife. Both will be in core California markets with aggregate projected spend of approximately $200 million to $220 million and have trended spreads in our targeted range of 150 to 200 basis points.", "Next, transactions. In July, we closed the sales of an Orlando community, 2 communities in Norfolk and a small commercial asset in Glendale, California, for an aggregate $108 million. In total, the multifamily communities were sold at a weighted average cash flow cap rate of 6.2% or $101,000 per home, contained 963 homes at average rent per occupied home of $1,050 and were on average 20 years old. Our 2014 guidance currently contemplates an additional $115 million to $165 million in dispositions by year-end. We're making progress with these transactions and will provide further details as they become available.", "A portion of our third quarter dispositions were classified as 1031 transactions for tax planning purposes. With these 1031 proceeds, we purchased 2 newly constructed Seattle communities, Lightbox and Waterscape, for a combined $121 million. The communities were acquired for a weighted average stabilized cash flow cap rate of 4.5% and contained 358 homes. Lightbox is in the University district adjacent to our existing Kennedy community, which will result in operating efficiencies. And Waterscape is located in Kirkland, near Google's expanding Seattle campus. Both assets represent excellent additions to our portfolio.", "Onto fourth quarter and full year 2014 guidance. Third quarter earnings and same-store sales growth remained strong, and we're increasing our full year 2014 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance by $0.01 each at the midpoints. FFO per share guidance was raised to $1.52 (sic) [$1.54] to $1.56, FFO as adjusted to $1.51 to $1.53 and AFFO to $1.34 to $1.36.", "For same store, we are increasing our full year 2014 revenue growth guidance to 4% to 4.5%, up 25 basis points at the midpoint and increasing our expense growth guidance to 2.25% to 2.75%, up 50 basis points at the midpoint. The 5% midpoint of our NOI growth guidance did not change, although we did tighten the range by 25 basis points on both ends to 4.75% to 5.25%.", "Other primary full year guidance assumptions can be found on Attachment 15 or Page 27 of our supplement.", "Fourth quarter 2014 FFO and FFO as adjusted per share guidance is $0.38 to $0.40. AFFO per share guidance is $0.33 to $0.35.", "Finally, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.26 in the third quarter or $1.04 per share when annualized. This represents a yield of approximately 3.6% and will be our 168th straight quarter of paying a dividend.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Jerry.", "Jerry A. Davis", "Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon. In my remarks, I will cover the following topics: first, our third quarter portfolio metrics, leasing trends and the success we realized in pushing rental rate growth this quarter; second, the performance of our primary core markets during the quarter; and last, a brief update on our recently completed and in lease-up developments.", "We're pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. Our same-store revenue growth of 4.4% was driven by an increase in revenue per occupied home of 3.8% year-over-year to $1,619 per month, while same-store occupancy of 96.8% was 60 basis points higher versus the prior year period.", "Total portfolio revenue per occupied home was $1,779 per month, including pro rata JVs. Our revenue growth through the first 9 months of the year has remained strong at 4.4%, as a result of a 50 basis point improvement in occupancy and a 3.8% increase in revenue per occupied home. We see this strength continuing into the fourth quarter.", "Turning to new and renewal lease rate growth, which is detailed on Attachment 8(NYSE:G) of our supplement. As Tom mentioned earlier, blended new and renewal lease rate growth was 4.8% during the quarter, 30 basis points higher than the 4.5% growth we generated in 3Q 2013. While a portion of this acceleration was due to the tailwind provided by still robust market fundamentals, our elevated occupancy of 97% at the end of the second quarter allowed us to push new and renewal rate.", "Our 5.1% third quarter renewal rate growth was comparable to previous quarters, while we grew new leases by 4.5%, approximately 80 basis points above 3Q '13's rate. This is a complete reversal from what we experienced earlier in 2014 when our first quarter new lease rate growth lagged the first quarter of 2013 by 120 basis points. As such, our greater focus on pushing new lease rate growth in 3Q, when combined with sticky occupancy and annualized turnover that declined by 450 basis points year-over-year, has set us up well to take advantage of further pricing opportunities in the fourth quarter and in 2015.", "During the fourth quarter, we expect the typical seasonal slowdown to occur but believe there's plenty of gas left in the tank to continue pushing the rate as evidenced by our current same-store physical occupancy of 96.8% and October new lease rate growth that is 100 to 150 basis points higher than that of October 2013, all with comparable renewal rate growth.", "Market-wise, San Francisco, Seattle, the Monterey Peninsula and Portland performed well, while the Mid-Atlantic region continued to struggle. On the expense front, we increased our annual same-store growth forecast by 50 basis points at the midpoint. This was primarily the result of higher-than-expected insurance claims at a couple of our communities and higher property-level incentive compensation as a result of our strong rental rate growth and increased bonus compensation related to the ongoing successful implementation of our repair and maintenance efficiency initiatives.", "Next, rent as a percentage of our residents' income held steady at roughly 19%. Move-outs to home purchase were up 50 basis points year-over-year at 14%, still below our long-term average of approximately 15%.", "Moving on to quarterly performance in our primary core markets. These markets represent 66% of our same-store NOI and 71% of our total NOI.", "Orange County and Los Angeles, which combined represents 16.5% of our total NOI, continue to slowly improve. On our call last quarter, I discussed our strategy to lengthen the average lease term at our largest property in Orange County, which represents roughly 50% of our same-store asset pool in the market. This strategic move had a negative effect on 2Q occupancy and new lease rate growth. I'm pleased to report that our third quarter occupancy increased by 100 basis points to 96%, and our new lease rate growth improved to 4.5% from second quarter's negative 0.5%. We will benefit in 2015 from this move.", "New York City, which represents 13% of our total NOI, generated new lease and renewal lease rate growth of 4.5% each with occupancy of 97.7% during the third quarter. New York remains a good market, and with occupancy currently above 98%, we are anticipating a strong fourth quarter.", "Metro Washington, D.C., which represents 13% of our total NOI, had occupancy of 97.1% and revenue growth of 0.1% in the third quarter, a strong result considering the ongoing concerns many have for this market. As we have stated throughout 2014, we believe our relative outperformance versus peers results from our 60% B portfolio in D.C. and less direct competition from new supply in our submarkets. We expect these factors will continue to help us to fare better in the fourth quarter and 2015.", "We are still expecting positive full year 2014 revenue growth of just under 1% in Washington, D.C.", "San Francisco, which represents 12% of our total NOI, continues to generate extremely strong results due to high-quality employment growth and a general housing shortage in the city proper. For the quarter, new lease rate growth exceeded 10%, with renewals up 8.6%. Our October numbers remain strong.", "Seattle, which represents 6% of our total NOI, is a high new supply market that has held up well due to elevated employment growth. New lease rate growth exceeded 8% in the third quarter, and renewal growth continues to be toward the upper end of our portfolio.", "Austin, which represents 5.5% of our total NOI, had good third quarter revenue growth of 4.7%, driven in part by high third quarter seasonal new lease and renewal rate growth of roughly 7% each. We expect our suburban locations will continue to outperform as they are less directly impacted by new supply that is being delivered in the downtown core, although move-outs to home purchase have recently been affecting us in the south shore markets.", "Lastly, Dallas, which represents 5% of our NOI, is performing in line with our initial budgeted expectations, but we have recently begun to feel the effects of new supply in uptown and in North Dallas. Fortunately, Dallas continues to enjoy strong job growth.", "Turning to our recently completed and in lease-up developments. In aggregate, our California developments continue to perform well. Demand at our 467-home, $150 million Bella Terra community in Huntington Beach and our 315-home, $147 million Channel Mission Bay community in San Francisco remains fantastic. Both properties hit 90% leased in less than 7 months, with rents well ahead of pro forma estimates. 13th and Market, our 264-home, $73 million lease-up in downtown San Diego, and Los Alisos, our 320-home, $87.5 million lease-up in Aliso Viejo, California, are generally on plan but have been battling new supply. Beach & Ocean, our 173-home, $51 million lease-up in Huntington Beach, ended the quarter 35% leased and we welcomed our first residents in mid-October. In D.C., both our 256-home, $63 million Domain College Park lease-up in College Park, Maryland, and our 332-home, $132 million DelRay Tower lease-up in Alexandria continue to perform below expectations due primarily to ongoing market weakness. Despite this, we remain confident in these communities' long-term prospects and for D.C. in general.", "With that, I will open the call up to Q&A. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Just a question on the ATM usage in the quarter. You mentioned -- obviously, you used it for Steele Creek, which you consider to be an accretive use of the capital. Do you guys see additional accretive uses for ATM capital based on where you could issue stock today? And should we expect to see more ATM issuance in coming quarters?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Karin, this is Tom Herzog. Yes, good question. As far as accretive uses, there will be other accretive uses. I mean, the fact is, from a development perspective, we've always spoken to that being accretive, but that's funded through noncore sales. But as we think about just funding sources in general, there are really 3 different types of funding sources, as you know. There's equity, there's debt, there's sales and there are merits to each depending on market conditions. So as we look out into the future, certainly, we have to take into account market conditions at those times as to which of those funding sources makes the most sense for us and our shareholders. So we still like funding development with noncore sales. We like the match funding aspect to it. But we don't rule out the possibility that with the right market conditions, that we would consider other sources of capital as well, including equities. So we have to wait and see what it looks like as circumstances dictate in the future.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "My second question is, you mentioned the sale of the Texas JV. Could you just talk about what drove the decision to make the sale at this time and what your expectations are for your remaining Texas portfolio?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Karin, this is Tom. With respect to that sale, what drove it, the debt maturity is coming up for prepayment. We looked at the value and the IRR returns that we saw we're achieving at this point in time. And with the partnership with Fannie Mae concluded, it would be best to expose it to the market and we had a price that was very attractive to us and to them. And so we think it's going to be a good execution and a good benefit for UDR.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Do you expect to exit those markets entirely over time?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "No, I think we're very comfortable with our exposure in Austin and Dallas and then see those as dynamic markets. We like our submarket and product fit. And we're all very comfortable about where we're at on the investment side, but we do like those markets.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "A couple of questions on the operations, I guess, for you, Jerry. The gap between new and renewal has narrowed from about, let's see, 190 bps at 2Q to about 60 bps this quarter with a meaningful pickup on the new lease side. First, what was that gap for October? And then also, how do you think that relationship evolves over the next new weaker seasonal quarters? And perhaps can you give us some regional insight on the October numbers?", "Jerry A. Davis", "Sure. I'll start with the gap in October. It's actually our current new lease rate growth rate in October is projected to be probably a hair under 3% and renewals will be about 5.1%, so it's about 200 basis points. This is normal seasonality, as you know. New lease rate growth tends to fluctuate with the bell curve and below in the first quarter and fourth quarter and then it peaks up in the second and third, so you would expect the gap to compress. Probably more importantly, I mean, you picked up what was it last quarter and what was -- what is it in October. But when we looked at what the gap was a year ago, because we think that's more important to look at, last year in the third quarter, the gap was 180 basis points, and this quarter, it was 60 basis points. And really, what we're trying to do, Haendel, we may have spoken about this before, is we've been focusing more on driving up new lease rates because we think that sets a new market rent for our properties. When you set those new market rents, we think it makes it easier as you go forward to achieve higher renewal growth. So it's hard to continuously have a large gap between renewals and new and it will eventually put a ceiling on what you can get on renewals. We thought this was the best strategy to have. And I think when we look at our total revenue growth and when you look at how much better new lease rate growth is doing, both in the third quarter as well as so far this quarter, we're pretty optimistic about strength as we go into the remainder of the year and especially into 2015. The part that really surprised us, we said last quarter on this call that we were willing to take a reduction in occupancy to achieve this higher new lease rate growth that's at higher markets. And what we saw was we had no drop-off in renewal -- in occupancy. Part of that was because turnover dropped the 450 basis points and it gave us the ability to continue to push new rate. Even though our closing ratios came down a bit, we didn't have to close on every one. People that were just price shopping chose to go live somewhere else and we were able to elevate that. So we think it's going to pay off in the long term. Now you had another question about...", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Some regional insight...", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Some regional insight into the new versus renewal for October.", "Jerry A. Davis", "Yes, you've seen -- again, I told you October versus 3Q is down about 140, 150 basis points in total. You've seen less of a drop in the West, where it stayed -- the total western part of the United States is at 5.3%. There were probably at about a 6%, 7%. So it did drop but it's still very strong. The southwest, which is our 2 Texas markets, are coming in closer to a 2%. The Mid-Atlantic region is the one that's suffering the most right now. It's at a negative 2%. That's made up of Washington, D.C., Baltimore and Norfolk and Richmond. All of those are negative with the exception of Richmond. Currently, in Washington, D.C., we're showing new lease rate growth that's about negative 2.7% and that compares to negative 1% in September. So you're seeing that typical seasonality of drop. Baltimore has probably turned more negative than we would have expected based on how well we did there last quarter. Last quarter, we had new lease rate growth that was positive 1.8%, and today, it's down at negative 3%. So we have been feeling the effects not only of the seasonality but of also some new supply. Then the other one that drops and I think this is predominantly seasonality, maybe a little bit new supply, but -- is Boston. Boston went from being up on new lease rate growth in the third quarter at 6.9%, and in October, it's 1.8%. While that seems alarming, when I go back and look at how I did last October in Boston, it was sub-2% also. So that's a typical seasonality. Everything else has stayed pretty much the same or has had that typical 150 basis points drop with 2 exceptions to the upside. New York City stayed stable with where it was in the third quarter at 4.5%, and our Orlando market actually picked up its pace. It was at 5.4% in 3Q and it's up to 6.3%. And then on renewals, like I said, Haendel, those stayed fairly stable year-round. So the 5.1% has stayed exactly the same in October.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And you brought up occupancy, which is sort of my follow-up. You guys ended the quarter here at 96.8%, unchanged from last quarter, your highest level in, looks like, 15 years of operating data that we have in front of us here. Despite your turnover being -- your turnover is down about 250 basis points, as you noted. You're pushing new leases more aggressively as you mentioned during the quarter. So my question is, looking back, perhaps do you feel like there is some opportunity left on the table in retrospect by not pushing more? And then I guess heading into, again, 4Q, 1Q, do you expect to maintain a similarly low turnover, high occupancy levels?", "Jerry A. Davis", "I think occupancy will probably drop a bit. We do have 1 or 2 seasonal markets like our Monterey Peninsula that will just naturally bring it down. I think renewals, did we leave money on the table? We had a strategic -- we made a strategic decision really to go after new to reset that mark that would help us on renewals later. I think you're going to see renewal growth probably strengthen a bit as the rest of this quarter goes and not drop from its 5.1%. But we are definitely more focused on taking care of our existing residents, watching probable effect of what it does to our NOI stream. But we do feel the strategy, more than anything, Haendel, sets us up for 2015. It's paid off better than I expected in 2014 but it definitely set us up to go into 2015 probably as strong or stronger than we finished last year.", "Operator", "Next will be Nick Joseph with Citi.", "Nicholas Gregory Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "What was the difference in performance of A and B class assets across the portfolio? And then you mentioned D.C., but are there any other markets where that variance was pronounced?", "Jerry A. Davis", "Really, Bs for the quarter, Nick, in new and -- a blend between new and renewal growth was about 110 basis points better than As. As we look at the month of October, that compressed to about 60 basis points. And again, we think that goes predominantly to the effect of new supply on A and not on B product. D.C. was probably the most pronounced. I will tell you, in our Seattle markets, we got A product both in the city of Bellevue as well as downtown Seattle. While they've done well, our suburban product that's more of a B-caliber asset in Renton as well as down south near Tacoma and some of the suburbs up north that cater to the Boeing plants have done a bit better.", "Nicholas Gregory Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then you talked about the Seattle acquisitions and increasing your exposure there after being underweight. Are there any other markets that you're either over- or underweight relative to your longer-term targets?", "Harry G. Alcock", "I think -- Nick, this is Harry. I think if you look at the markets where we're allocating capital and you'll see markets like Boston in particular where we're completing a large development project, San Francisco Bay Area, again, where we're developing 399 Fremont, we tended to allocate capital to markets in which we want to grow our presence and we're selling out of the markets in which we want to reduce our presence.", "Nicholas Gregory Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. But nothing jumps out other than kind of that slow growth through development or selling on the margin, not new markets jump out as either overweight or underweight kind of where the portfolio is today?", "Harry G. Alcock", "That's right.", "Operator", "And our next question -- [Operator Instructions] And we'll go to Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors.", "David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Tom, in your opening comments, you alluded to Fannie and Freddie's plans to expand mortgage credit. But can you share your thoughts on the potential impact to your business?", "Thomas W. Toomey", "David, it's really early to tell what's going to come of this. As we look through the portfolio of things that come off on the surface, we have a very small 3-bedroom portfolio that would be probably potentially exposed, but I don't feel that -- I don't feel much exposure at this point to political rhetoric. We've got 4 months after the election to seat Congress. They're going to have time to sit down and look at this and think about what they really want to do. They have to answer questions about risk retention and how that will be handled. And so this is probably going to be a story for the third quarter of next year is about time they get their act together and come out with some clarity.", "David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And as it relates to dispositions, you -- it looks like you'll exceed your disposition plans for 2014. And now that we have a potential reacceleration in single-family housing plus more multifamily activity in the second half of this year from Fannie and Freddie, is this a ripe environment for you to go beyond the 6, I think you have -- sorry, $400 million to $600 million dispositions penciled in for 2015 and '16, given the risks on the single-family side plus a robust disposition environment, might we see you go nicely beyond that range?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Dave, this is Tom Herzog. Our disposition guidance, obviously, for this year came in about where we expected it with a couple of minor adjustments that we've made. As we look to '15 and '16, again, we're really looking at it, that we've got 3 different sources of capital. We have to -- as we go forward to make the optimal decisions for our company, our shareholders, we have to look at where equity prices out at, what debt looks like, what the different objectives around those are and then look to sales proceeds additionally. And with that, do we have assets that are noncore that we would like to liquidate early or recycle? Those decisions come into play. So we're not ready yet to specify how much each of those different buckets we'll include. And I don't even think that's something, when we set guidance at the beginning of the year, that we want to get too specific on. I think that there's a general capital need and it's more directional and then decisions are made throughout the year as conditions become known. So we'll certainly start the year with the type of capital need that we have as a whole and some directional guidance. But as far as specifics, that probably comes later.", "Operator", "And we'll go on to Jana Galan with Bank of America.", "Jane Wong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "This is Jane Wong for Jana. I was wondering if you could provide some outlook for 2015 in Washington, D.C., what you're expecting there.", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Well, I'd say this -- and again, this is Tom Herzog and I'll turn it to Jerry for something directional. But as far as providing guidance for 2015 at this point, that's something we're going to save for our fourth quarter call. We've got great momentum going into the end of the year. And as Tom Toomey has indicated, we expect '15 as a whole to look a lot like 2014. So we're very optimistic, but not providing specific guidance. But kind of directionally, Jerry, any comments you'd make on D.C.?", "Jerry A. Davis", "Yes. I guess, generally, I would say we would expect D.C. next year to be slightly worse than this year. I'd remind you this year we're going to have positive revenue growth of somewhere between 0.5% and 1% with meaningful decline. We think it's a submarket-by-submarket situation in Washington, D.C., and just as we've outperformed there, really, over the last several years because of our mix of A and B product with B staying about 60%. While we are affected by supply, it's not quite as much. We're optimistic that next year we'll see more job growth that will help to absorb those new units that are coming on. But I don't think you're going to see it be meaningfully different than what you saw this year.", "Jane Wong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great. And then just one more quick question. Thank you for the color on the spreads to cap rates for your development yields being towards the upper end of your range, but can you talk a little bit about prevailing cap rate trends in your markets, any changes? And for the 2 starts in California, you expect the 150 to 200 basis points spread. But kind of what are the prevailing market cap rates there today that you see?", "Harry G. Alcock", "This is Harry Alcock. I think that, in general, in the types of markets where we're developing cap rates of -- remain the same to perhaps come down slightly. The types of cap rates that we're looking at for our California starts, the Irvine property, for example, is around 4.25%. Most of them are going to be between kind of in that 4%, 4.25% cap rate type range. So these are quality properties in high-quality locations as measured by having very low cap rates.", "Operator", "And we'll go to the next question from Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.", "Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Jerry, just going back to your positive comments about leasing strengthening in October, the uplift you're getting from the leasing efforts. As we think about the earn-in going into '15, is it reasonable to expect the earn-in in 2015 to be actually higher than it was going into '14? And then Tom, is your -- I know you're not providing guidance for '14 -- I mean, for '15 rather. But as you think about the preliminary budgeting, just on the expense side, anything that stands out to you at this point?", "Jerry A. Davis", "This is Jerry. I'll go first. We've looked at it and it's -- the earn-in to '15 is very similar to what it was last year, which leads back to what Toomey said in his initial comments, that '15 to us is looking quite a bit like '14, both -- as far as job growth, supply and all that stuff coming to hit us. But where we are in the ground right now is, again, we're doing better on new lease rate growth. We've been pushing that over the last 4 to 5 months. We're going into the year with probably higher occupancy than we went into last year. So you probably won't see next year us get as much of a pickup in occupancy, if any, but we do think we're going to see the same type of strength in pushing the rate as we saw last year.", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Okay. Mike, Herzog here again. As far as budgeting on the expense side, we're well through the process so I have a feel for that. There's nothing dramatic coming up on the expense side that you need to be concerned about.", "Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "That's helpful. And just as my follow-up question. As we think about dispositions, any governor on that just related to taxable net gains just because you had the 1031s in the quarter? I know you're working through some of those noncore and warehouse assets; you've held them for quite some time. How do you -- can you talk about kind of how you manage the process of tax gains versus issuing equity as we think about funding kind of going forward?", "Thomas M. Herzog", "Yes, good question. The 1031s in 2014, those are mainly sales out of the TRS, so that avoids any cash taxes as we're recycling some of those assets. As far as sales out of the REIT, we have to take care to watch our gain capacity and that is something that the team here is very tuned into, and it is a limiter on how much, frankly, we can sell or any REIT can sell. So that does definitely enter into our calculus.", "Operator", "And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the conference back over to Mr. Tom Toomey for any additional or closing remarks.", "Thomas W. Toomey", "Well, again, thank all of you for your time, and as we started this conference call, we feel really good about the business. We feel great about the business plan. '14 is a good year for us. We're very focused on '15 and the execution. It looks, at this point in time, to be a very similar year to '14, and we feel very proud about that and that's driven by solid fundamentals by a team working very well together on a good plan and execution. And we know that we'll see a lot of you next week at NAREIT and we'll let you get to your next call. Thank you for your time again today.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Our fourth quarter press release, supplemental disclosure package and updated two year strategic outlook document were distributed yesterday afternoon and posted to our Investor Relations section of our Web site, www.udr.com.", "In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements. Prior to reading our Safe Harbor disclosure I would like to direct you to the webcast of this call located in the Investor Relations section of our Web site www.udr.com. The webcast includes a slide presentation that will accompany our two year strategic outlook commentary.", "On to our safe harbor, statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in our press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.", "With that I will turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.", "Tom Toomey", "Thank you, Chris and good afternoon everyone and welcome to UDR's fourth quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Tom Herzog, Chief Financial Officer; and Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our results, as well as senior officers Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.", "We will present our updated two year strategic outlook following prepared remarks.", "In 2014 we again met or exceeded all primary objectives of our plan and to-date have meaningfully outperformed versus our initial full year plan and last year's update. Tom will address this outperformance in detail later in the call. In short 2014 was another great year for UDR. We continue to see strength in all aspects of our business.", "A quick recap of our team\u2019s accomplishments during the year. First, operations continue to run on all cylinders and delivered strong same-store results across the board with 5.2% NOI growth. Second, the 480 million of developments we delivered in aggregate leased up well with rents and trended spreads hitting our targets. Third, we accretively funded our growth through the sale of 368 million of well priced and well timed non-core dispositions and 100 million of equity issued at a premium to consensus NAV.", "Fourth, we continue to improve the quality of our portfolio growing portfolio revenue per occupied home by 7% year-over-year. Fifth, we further improved our balance sheet metrics hitting the marks for leverage and net debt-to-EBITDA we set forth at the beginning of 2014. Our successes were recognized with a credit rating upgrade from Moody's to Baa1. Last we grew cash flow per share by 10% a strong rate which resulted in 11% dividend increase and meaningful NAV per share growth. We continue to believe that growth in these two metrics translates into strong total shareholder return overtime.", "As we enter 2015 we feel very positive about the business and our prospects. Multi-family fundamentals remain firmly in our favor. Steady job growth capable of absorbing forecasted new multi-family supply and augmented by stagnant single-family housing market remains our base case scenario. Secondarily, the majority of new multi-family construction lending is concentrated in the heavily regulated banking industry making it easier to turn off capital sp\u0115kt it if necessary.", "Our balanced geographic mix of A and B quality communities should continue to generate strong operating results. Our submarket locations are top-notch with better than average walk scores versus the peer average in the vast majority of our markets. Our development pipeline is expected to generate the incremental cash flow and value creation we originally forecasted. Expected additions to the pipeline in 2015 are also forecasted to be highly accretive and we will continue to improve our debt metrics.", "In the nearly 15 years that I have led UDR, I do not remember being more upbeat about our prospects. We believe that 2015 and 2016 will look a lot like 2014 and that January results only solidify this belief. There remains a lot of runway for growth at UDR and we have the right plan and the team in place to capitalize on those opportunities.", "With that I would like to express my sincere appreciation to all my fellow UDR associates for their hard work in producing another strong year of results. We look forward to a great 2015 and I will now turn the call over to Tom.", "Tom Herzog", "Thanks, Tom. The topics I will cover today include, our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results, our balance sheet, debt maturity and capital markets update, our development update, our transactions update and our full year 2015 guidance. Our initial 2016 expectations would be addressed in the upcoming three year plan commentary.", "First, our fourth quarter earnings results were in line with our previously provided guidance. FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $0.40, $0.39 and $0.34, respectively. A couple of items to note when moving from NAREIT FFO to FFO as adjusted in the quarter. First item, we removed certain legacy assets out of our TRS in 2014 in a tax efficient structure. Completed in the fourth quarter this resulted in the recognition of a 5.8 million one-time income tax benefit that was included in FFO. We excluded this benefit from FFO as adjusted and AFFO. Note that we're forecasting 3 million to 5 million of run rate tax benefit in 2015 relating to remaining communities in the TRS versus the 9 million recognized in 2014 net of the one-time fourth quarter benefit.", "Second item, we backed out a $2.2 million after-tax impairment from FFO as adjusted related to the 50% sale of our 3033 Wilshire land parcel to Metlife. Our seven year whole period on the parcel and cost capitalized subsequent to acquisition led to the write-down, but we can earn back this impairment if certain written hurdles on the development are met. Fourth quarter same-store revenue, expense and NOI growth remained strong at 4.2%, 1.9% and 5.1% respectively. For full year 2014 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $1.56, $1.52 and $1.35 respectively. Full year same-store revenue, expense and NOI growth of 4.3%, 2.5% and 5.2% exhibited continued strong demand for apartments and were above our initial expectations provided last February.", "Next the balance sheet. At year-end our financial leverage on an undepreciated cost basis was 38.6%, on a fair value basis, it was around 30%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 6.5 times inclusive of pro rata JVs it was 7.4 times, all metrics improved as planned.", "On the capital markets front. 325 million of 5.25% unsecured debt matured in January. We intend to refinance some or all of this debt in the first half of 2015. We did not issue equity during the fourth quarter despite trading above consensus NAV as our capital needs were met through asset dispositions. In January we issued 78 million of equity net of fees through our ATM at a premium to consensus NAV. Moving forward we will consider all capital options when funding our growth and will utilize the most advantageous source depending on our strategic objectives, market conditions and pricing. At year-end our liquidity as measured by cash and credit facility capacity was 763 million.", "Turning to development. We completed two development projects located in Alexandria, Virginia and Huntington Beach, California for 184 million in the quarter. Both are leasing well and bringing a differentiated product to the respective submarkets. We also commenced construction of our 107 million, 3033 Wilshire development in Los Angeles and a 50-50 joint venture with MetLife. In addition, we increased our ownership to 50% in two UDR/MetLife I JV land parcels, Crescent Heights and Wilshire La Jolla both located in Los Angeles. Additional details are available in our fourth quarter press release. At year-end our underway development pipeline totaled 875 million with 72% funded with an estimated spread between stabilized deals and market cap rates near the upper-end of our targeted 150 to 200 basis point range. As for future development, we continue to underwrite opportunities and we\u2019ll take advantage of our land bank.", "Next, transactions completed in the fourth quarter. We acquired a future development land site in Boston Proper for 32 million through a 1031 transaction. We believe this deal will generate significant value and should commence construction in 2016. Regarding dispositions, we sold three wholly-owned non-core communities in Long Beach, California, Port Orchard, Washington, Puyallup, Washington for 91 million at a weighted average cash flow cap rate of 5.5%. The weighted average IRR for the dispositions was 12%.", "We also sold MetLife a 49% interest in our 110 million, 13th & Market property in San Diego and a 50% interest in our recently started 3033 Wilshire land development parcel in Los Angeles, for an aggregate total of 62.5 million. 13th & Market generated a strong IRR of approximately 16%. In January we completed the disposition of our 20% interest in our Texas, JV. We expect to ride net proceeds of 43 million on the sale inclusive of promote and disposition fee of approximately 9 million. These will be recognized in the first quarter and full year 2015 NAREIT FFO but excluded from FFO as adjusted and AFFO. This disposition was well timed as it eliminated our exposure at Huston, reduced our exposure to Dallas and generated a strong IRR of approximately 14%. Additional transaction details are available in our fourth quarter press release.", "On to the first quarter and full year 2015 guidance. Full year 2015 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share is forecast at a $1.60 to a $1.66, a $1.58 to a $1.64 and a $1.41 to a $1.47 respectively. For same-store our full year 2015 revenue guidance is 3.75% to $4.25%, expense 2.5% to 3% and NOI 4% to 5%. Average 2015 occupancy is forecast at 96.5%, other primary full year guidance assumptions can be found on Attachment 15 or Page 27 of our supplement. First quarter 2015 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance is $0.41 to $0.43, $0.38 to $0.40 and $0.35 to $0.37 respectively. Finally we declared a common dividend of $0.26 in the fourth quarter or $1.04 per share when annualized. With our release today, we\u2019ve increased our 2015 annualized dividend to $1.11 per share, 7% of our 2014\u2019s level and represented a yield of approximately 3.3%.", "With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jerry.", "Jerry Davis", "Thanks Tom, good afternoon. In my remarks I\u2019ll cover the following topics. First, our fourth quarter portfolio metrics, leasing trends and the continued success we realized in pushing rental rate growth again this quarter and into January. Second, the performance of our primary markets during the quarter and expectations for 2015 and last, a brief update on our recently completed and in lease-up developments.", "We\u2019re pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. Our fourth quarter same-store revenue growth of 4.2% was driven by an increase in revenue per occupied home of 3.6% year-over-year to $1,631 per month while same-store occupancy of 96.7% was 50 basis points higher versus the prior year period. Total portfolio revenue per occupied home was $1,795 per month including pro rata JVs. A robust full year same-store revenue growth of 4.3% was driven by a 60 basis point improvement in occupancy and a 3.8% increase in revenue per occupied home. We see strong rate growth continuing in 2015.", "Turning to new and renewal lease rate growth which is detailed on attachment 8-G of our supplement, we continued to push rates in the fourth quarter. New lease rate growth totaled 2.1% or 80 basis points ahead of the fourth quarter of 2013, renewal growth remains resilient improving 10 basis points year-over-year to 5.3%. This year-over-year acceleration was accomplished with only a 10 basis point sequential decrease in occupancy. Importantly, our leasing momentum continued into 2015, with January new lease rate growth of approximately 350 basis points ahead of January 2014 and strong renewal growth of 5.2% during the month. This when augmented by stable current occupancy of 96.5%, the 2% rent growth that is already built into 2015 as of the end of 2014, the continued strength in multi-family fundamentals and the additional $100 of discretionary income the average American has on a monthly basis due to gasoline prices has resulted in us starting the year slightly ahead of what we initially budgeted three months ago.", "Next, rent as a percentage of our residents\u2019 income rose slightly to 18%. Move-outs to home purchase were up 120 basis points year-over-year at 15%, in line with our long-term average. Importantly our full year 2014 resident turnover rate declined by 140 basis points versus 2013, even with the renewal increases at a robust 5.3% only 5% of our move-outs gave rent increase as the reason for leaving in the fourth quarter.", "Moving on to quarterly performance in our primary markets. These markets represent 65% of our same-store NOI and 71% of our total NOI. Orange County and Los Angeles combined represent 16.5% of our total NOI. Orange County posted sequential revenue growth of 60 basis points and continues to outperform our budgeted expectations early in 2015. Los Angeles is slightly weaker due to our heavy concentration in the Marina Del Rey submarket where we\u2019re encouraged by new job growth in the immediate area specifically from Yahoo. Our current expectation is that both of these markets will generate revenue growth greater than 4.5% in 2015 slightly in excess of 2014.", "New York City represents 13% of our total NOI. Our downtown assets posted strong revenue growth of 5% in the fourth quarter. We expect continued strength in 2015 as technology, finance, media and advertising employers expand in Lower Manhattan. Although our 2015 forecast revenue of 4.5% is expected to slightly decelerate versus 2014. Metro DC which represents 13% of our total NOI posted positive full year revenue growth of 50 basis points. We expect slightly better full year revenue growth in 2015 above 1% currently. As we will continue to benefit from our diverse exposure of 50% B assets and 50% A assets located both inside and outside the Beltway.", "San Francisco which represents 11.5% of our total NOI shows no signs of slowing down as renewal and new lease rate growth in January point to another strong year from Northern California. Revenue growth is expected to increase 6% to 7% in 2015 a slight deceleration from the 8.2% growth we realized in 2014. Seattle which represents 6.5% of our total NOI benefited from strong growth from suburban B assets that are less exposed to new supply than A assets downtown. Although new supply will challenge us somewhat in Downtown Seattle and Bellevue we expect 2015 to be similar to 2014 or roughly 6% growth.", "Boston which represents 5.5% of our total income should continue to see supply pressure downtown but our suburban assets in the north and south shore markets should fair relatively better in 2015. Long-term we like the downtown market and look to continue to grow through development in the submarket. During 2015 revenue growth forecast of between 4.5% and 5% right in line with 2014. Last Dallas which represents 5.5% of our NOI posted 4.2% year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter. We expect new supply pressure in Uptown and Plano in 2015. January results indicate that these submarkets are performing slightly better than initially budgeted expectations. The 2015 revenue growth is still projected slow to roughly 3% from 4.4% in 2014. As you can see on attachment 7-B of our supplement, our 467 home Bella Terra located in Huntington Beach California and our 255 home Capitol View community located in Washington DC will join the same-store pool in 2015.", "Turning to our recently completed and in-lease up developments. Beach & Ocean, our 173-home, $52 million lease-up in Huntington Beach was 53% occupied at quarter-end and as of today is 67% occupied and 79% leased, after welcoming our first residents just four months ago. We\u2019re currently offering one month of concessions at this community and leasing has been very strong in January with 35 applications taken during Huntington Beach\u2019s slow season. Los Alisos our 320 home $88 million lease up in Mission Viejo, California was nearly 90% occupied at quarter-end. We are on-budget and meeting our lease-up expectations.", "Finally, DelRay Tower, our 322 home $132 million lease up in Alexandria, Virginia remains challenged by the weak DC market. But we\u2019re confident in its long-term prospects. We are currently offering concessions of two plus months in this oversupplied submarket in order to hold rate and maintain leasing velocity to reach our budgeted occupancy. Of note, in a typical development project a one month concession through the lease up period is fairly standard. When a submarket is seeing lease ups offer less than one month it normally indicates excess demand versus supply and vice versa when lease ups are offering more than one month. If you ever want to gauge submarket strength, shop a sampling of lease ups in the area to see what level of concessions are being offered.", "With that I will remind those listening that there is a link to our updated two year strategic outlook document on the Investor Relations page of our Web site. We will pause for a moment so that everyone can gather the two year outlook materials as we will lead you through the document page-by-page.", "I will now turn the call back over to Tom Toomey.", "Tom Toomey", "Thank you Jerry and I hope all of you who have the presentation up will go page-by-page with our comments directed to those highlighting the page numbers we are on. Starting with Page 3 a couple of high level thoughts. First we view this year's update as a continuation of last year's plan with a few minor tweaks. We believe this continues to be the right plan for UDR and here is why. The plan primarily objective is to drive high quality cash flow growth while incrementally improving our balance sheet and portfolio. In another words consistent sustainable growth that is funded in a safe low risk manner. We believe that successful execution of these objectives will drive strong total shareholder return.", "With solid apartment fundamentals as a backdrop in 2015 and '16, we believe that UDR still has a long runway of accretive growth ahead, whether that growth comes from operations where we work daily to drive efficiencies through our organization or external growth where we are still finding plenty of development opportunities that create significant value. We will continue to capitalize on the opportunities available to us. So how have we performed versus the plan presented in 2013 and 2014? In short we have met or exceeded all primary operational and financial objectives previously set forth.", "Some of this upside resulted from strong fundamental backdrop I referenced earlier, but a focus on excellence and execution listening to and serving our customers and continuously improving the business process from the C suite to our community level staff also played a major role. Growing cash flow to optimize shareholder return while also ensuring a great customer experience at our communities and making UDR a great place to work are our most important objectives and we will remain fully focused on executing them.", "With that I will turn over to Tom to discuss the details of the updated outlook.", "Tom Herzog", "Please turn to Page 4 as Tom mentioned earlier we have met or exceeded all the primary, financial and operational objectives to-date as set forth in our previous two plans published in 2013 and 2014. In particular our same-store growth over the past two years has outperformed and along with our successful development deliveries have served us the primary driver of our better than expected cash flow growth and improving the leverage metrics.", "Turning to Page 5 perhaps the most important driver of UDR's value creation strategy is our best-in-class operations. We are continuously implementing revenue growth and cost efficiency initiatives throughout the organization to improve how we do business. As is evident on this page, we have generally produced better top-line growth in our primary markets which comprise approximately 71% of our NOI over the past one and three year periods. But market wins represent the true measure of our operational accomplishments. Win in a market is defined as ranking first among peers and same-store revenue growth in a quarter. The chart at the bottom of the page illustrates our success since 2008 wining a larger percentage of our markets than the peer average in each year. This is a testament to the organization that Jerry and the team have built and the culture of continues improvement that has promoted inside UDR.", "So how have we maintained our operational advantage and how do we intend to keep it in the future? Please turn to Page 6 many listening to this call are familiar with the primary revenue generation and expense control initiatives we have implemented overtime. These along with potential future initiatives are presented in the table on this page, importantly all of our growth and efficiency initiatives have one thing in common, they either provide our customer a wanted service or allow our associates to their jobs better. Our past initiatives which primarily focused on moving customer services online were a significant success current initiatives as will become evident on Page 7 should continue to drive our bottom-line for years to come and our list of potential future initiatives is extensive. Operation has been and will continue to be a significant competitive advantage for us. This not just because of our superior block and tackling in the field but also because of the creativity our operations team employs to continuously improve the business.", "Please turn to Page 7 this page lists some of our operational projects that have been implemented over the past couple of years and their potential impact on our NOI. As is evident we have made solid progress on each initiative to-date and our bottom-line has benefited greatly. As we look into 2015 and 2016 there are still opportunities to increase the efficiencies as these initiatives further.", "Finally we launched a new Web site at the end of 2014. This is a third major revision of udr.com and represents a complete rebuild of our online presence. It is a result of several months of research including the input from customer focus groups that indicated their preferences in an online shopping experience. The new Web site features elements such as online appointment scheduling, enhanced neighborhood, information and comparison shopping tools all of which are available through any device that customer chooses. To-date we're exceeding our initial targets for the site by converting a higher than expected amount of traffic to community visits.", "Turning now to capital allocation and development on Page 8 development remains the vital component of our value creation strategy. While not as many deals pencil in today\u2019s environment development remains accretive and will continue to be a primary means through which we improve our portfolio and grow our Company. Our underway and completed non-stabilized developments totaled 875 million and was 72% funded at year-end. Most of this pipeline is concentrated in our primary coastal markets. In 2015 we expect to deliver over 225 million of projects. Our annual targeted spend of 400 million to 60 million per year and our targeted trended spread versus cap rates of 150 to 200 basis points have not changed. While construction costs continue to increase so do rents.", "To mitigate market risk we employ a few tactics. First prior to the development commencing, we demand full drawings and GMAX contract thereby locking in costs. Second we diversify our geographic exposure, our goal is to commence a new development in a target market as the previous development is leasing up. Third, we utilize conservative top-line growth assumptions to underwrite our projects. In 2015 and '16 we will continue to mine our current land bank as well as add new land sites such as our Graybar site in Boston. We're planning four to five starts in 2015 which include one large fully owned project Pacific City and three to four smaller 50-50 JVs with Metlife. As of year-end 2014 our Shadow pipeline was approximately 1.2 billion at our pro rata ownership and represented 400 million to 500 million of value creation assuming current spreads.", "Please turn to Page 9. We anticipate that our under weighing completed developments as of 12/31/14 will average $0.035 of drag offset by $0.055 of accretion annually in 2015 and 2016. Upon stabilization which occurs at different periods for each project the pipeline is expected to generate accretion of $0.08 per share with growth thereafter. On an NAV basis we expect our pipeline to generate $2.5 per share at stabilization approximately 35% to 40% value creation over cost. Page 10 exhibits some of our recent developments.", "Please turn to Page 11. As focused as we're on operations and development, maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet to optimally fund our business is just as important. We exceeded the balance sheet metric goals provided in our 2013 and 2014 strategic plans and we expect further improvement in 2015 and '16. This has also been acknowledged by the rating agencies in 2014 we received a credit upgrade from Moody's to Baa1 and revised a positive outlook from S&P. On the capital markets front our 2015 and '16 capital needs will be funded through a combination of asset sales and new equity and debt, the mix of which will depend on availability and pricing at the time the capital is needed.", "Please turn to Page 12. The primary objective of publishing this plan is to illustrate how we intend to drive high quality cash flow and NAV per share growth in 2015 and '16. In 2014 our AFFO per share growth was a very strong 10%, in 2015 and '16 AFFO per share growth is expected to average in the 5% to 8% range which will continue to be driven by favorable same-store growth, development earn in and favorable debt refinancings versus in place debt. This was somewhat offset by higher trending interest rate assumptions, a lower tax benefit from our TRS and potential dispositions. We expect the business to drive 8% to 10% NAV growth in both 2015 and '16.", "Please turn to Page 13. This page provides our '15 guidance, initial '16 expectations and detailed modeling assumptions. In 2016 we're expecting solid same-store and cash flow growth based on still strong third-party job growth expectations against moderating new multi-family supply growth in our markets. In addition, our expected asset sales in 2015 combined with our 2016 entrance to our same-store pool will enhance our same-store mix toward high growth markets. And finally Page 14. Our 2015 top-line growth assumptions for our markets are presented on the map. We expect the West Coast to Northeast to grow at a rate above the portfolio average, the Mid-Atlantic will continue to struggle but it's still expected to outperform relative to our peers due to our 50-50 mix of As and Bs in DC and less direct exposure to new supply inside the Beltway.", "With that I will open it up to Q&A. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go to our first question from Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jana Galan", "Can you discuss the strategic positioning of the Metlife transactions in the fourth quarter in January, are you fine tuning your geographic exposures or were you looking to back fill the 2016 development pipeline? And then do you expect to continue growing with MetLife maybe in joint venture III?", "Tom Toomey", "This is Tom. With respect to Met, we established this relationship many years ago and see its still as a strategic benefit for the enterprise and that brings us opportunities, we discuss them and we\u2019re going to continue to undertake that on a go forward basis. With respect to the quarter, you really have a series of transactions here where we bought in the two land sites that were part of the land bank that Met owned, we'd started at 4%, bought up to 50%. We typically do that and we\u2019ll probably look at those other remaining sites in the future after we have a pretty good clarity about the product, the zoning and the good use of capital.", "On the other side, we sold an interest of 49% of our San Diego community which is right across the corner from Strata, and as a result felt that was a good alignment of interest at a great price and welcome Met into that asset and feel that that\u2019s a good investment for both parties. And lastly with the development site that we had for about seven years in Koreatown in LA and looking at expanding our deployment capital across the platform, we thought it was a good addition by having Met come to that.", "So on the future; I think we take them as we go. I know that we\u2019ll look at the land sites as we get them zoned and more detail around and about investing in them.", "On a Met JV III, I don\u2019t know if I see that, I like our 50-50 platform that is in Met JV II, it\u2019s a good alignment of interest and we\u2019ll continue to have ongoing conversations with Met.", "Jana Galan", "And Jerry, can you guess the new renewal if that's for January, and renewal asks for February and March?", "Jerry Davis", "Sure, January new leases reprised at about 3.6% higher than the prior residential we\u2019re paying. I would tell you that is actually about 350 basis points higher than we were last January. Renewals in the month of January were at 5.2%, which is slightly above where it was last January, call it 10 to 15 basis points. And as we look out over the next two months, we see an acceleration in renewal rate growth, currently on about half of the renewals being fine that we would expect for the month of February, we\u2019re up in the 5.5% to 5.6% range. And as we look at, call it 20% to 25% of March renewals that we\u2019d expect to have completed. Those are actually pushing north of 6% right now. So, you see an acceleration actually in renewal growth which is making us very optimistic and it\u2019s also has shown us that new lease rate growth is probably going to follow.", "We spent, much of the last six months setting ourselves up to have outsized rate growth, and we did that after we achieved high occupancy in 2014. We've been pushing market rate on new leases mostly to set a new mark so that we come in later and start realizing that on the renewal side. So our renewal growth has lagged a bit over the last four months or so as we look out over the next three to four months, we\u2019ll start to see that acceleration on the renewal side up also.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citigroup.", "Nick Joseph", "Tom you mentioned the long run rate for growth and the outlook expect same-store growth in 2016 generally in line with 2015. Can you talk about what gives you the confidence that growth in this cycle will remain above historical trend and can you talk about the largest risk to that base case?", "Tom Herzog", "Nick, its Herzog. When we look at 2015 and 2016 I think we said it looked a lot of like 2014. We continue to see good fundamentals across our market. We use third party data and our individual market knowledge when considering what we think 2016 growth will look like, and arriving at these numbers. And we\u2019ve looked in third party data providers both jobs and supply, we have a tendency to use Axion, Moody's. From a jobs perspective and I know lot of you have these numbers, but we fell 1.9% job growth in 2014. Looks like it\u2019s probably going to be at least according to the data providers 2.1% in '15 and probably going to 2% on '16.", "When we look at supply on the other hand, in '14 we're at somewhere around 1.5 or expecting '15 to be somewhere around 1.5% growth and it probably declines a bit and '16 the 1.2%. As we've used this data historically, we've a tendency to look at the jobs to supply kind of 5:1 ratio, but we look at them market-by-market to make them more specific. And in 2014 we had a positive ratio of 1.2, meaning that there would be more new relative jobs to supply. In 2015 we see that ratio according to the data experts being about 1.4 or 1.44. In 2016 it is yet higher but probably will be tapered back down a bit as the full supply comes to pass.", "So as we relate that to our hard markets, job growth looks better than the national averages with slightly higher supply growth. So we\u2019ll call that maybe a push, but still as a whole very net favorable, all the same things you\u2019ve heard also formations, demographic trends, home ownership we see a lot of runway when we look into 2016, so we feel favorable about it.", "Jerry Davis", "Yes, I would add one thing Nick, this is Jerry. In addition to all of the national end market factors that Herzog just spoke about. I would include Harry has been developing a pipeline in high rent growth markets, many of which properties will go into our same-store pool as we go into 2016. And at the same time as we use some sales to pay for the development pipeline those sales will probably come more from our slower growth markets, you\u2019re going to net out with new higher growth properties coming in and slower growth properties being sold.", "Nick Joseph", "And then with regards to the Boston land site that you purchased. Can you talk about what was attractive about that site? And how it fits in with your existing Boston portfolio?", "Harry Alcock", "Sure Nick, this is Harry. First of all its 32, it\u2019s located in the South end of Boston which is a dynamic location, it's sort of an edge location now but there are is a lot of new activity in that area including a 50,000 square foot whole foods across the street that just opened two blocks from Tufts Medical Center, it's a seven minute walk to the Back Bay of Boston. As we've talked about in the past we want to sort of complete one project in a market and then some point there after start of new one, we\u2019re going to complete our Pier 4 project in Boston during 2015. We would expect to start the Graybar project in 2016, meaning we'll be delivering sometime in late '17 or early '18, $32 million price to center 600 units or 55,000 unit land basis we found attractive as well.", "Nick Joseph", "And then finally Jerry just in terms of the DC outlook. It sounds like you\u2019re expecting '15 to be better, slightly better I guess than '14. When do you expect actually start to get pricing power in that region?", "Jerry Davis", "I would tell you actually Nick it\u2019s starting to come now. I won\u2019t call it power, but I will tell you this; we feel like we bottomed in the fourth quarter and our rent was negative 0.6%. I\u2019ve got early indications and I\u2019ve actually seen my January numbers and they actually popped back in positive territory. But we are seeing new lease rate growth in the B product, mostly that\u2019s outside of the Beltway, its going positive. Inside the Beltway new lease rate growth is still slightly negative, and renewal growth in both of those product types are in the 3% to 3.5% range.", "I would tell you this too, when I look at that 0.6% or so that I\u2019ve realized in the month of January and I bifurcated between Bs outside the Beltway for the most part and As inside the Beltway, the Bs outside the Beltway are probably coming in at about 2.5% positive and my As inside the Beltway are about a negative one in a quarter. So there is still a difference between who is adding the new supply, but again we feel better about DC. We think it will accelerate slightly from where we came in last year, and we definitely feel like the negative revenue growth that we put up in the fourth quarter was our bottom.", "Operator", "Next to Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Karin Ford", "Jerry I guess just a question on the 2015 same-store revenue guidance. It sounds like you've got 2% already earned in as rent-roll. You\u2019re having a really good January; the same-store pool is getting better. I\u2019m just curious as to why the mid-point of guidance on revenue is a deceleration from what you saw in 2014 given all those factors.", "Jerry Davis", "That\u2019s a good question Karin. I would tell you when we look at what makes up revenue growth it\u2019s really two components; first is rent per occupied home and the second is change in occupancy. Last year we had a change in occupancy of a positive 60 basis points, and as we look into 2015 we see a decrease in occupancy down to 96.5 which is 20 basis point drop. The more important factor we\u2019re looking at is rent per occupied home and we have been driving rate for the last six months and we see that actually increasing by 40 basis points.", "Now you\u2019re right the mid-point of our revenue is about 30 basis point deceleration from last year, most of it coming from no occupancy benefit. But I'd tell you we are very encouraged with where we stand in the month of January and what it looks like going forward. We currently have a loss to lease of 3.4%. A year ago my loss to lease was 1%. So it\u2019s 240 basis points higher. So that gives us hope and really good prospects for the next couple of months gaining that.", "I would also tell you when I look over the last four or five years, we've seen market rents typically go up sequentially each month from January through August then we start to get some of it back each month. We have not seen any month that we did not have a gain in market rent, December of 2013. So it's continuously grown over that time period. And like I said, when I look at how January had started, we're very encouraged by the way we're performing today. And compared to what we budgeted just three months ago, we're excited about '15, we think things look very strong right now.", "Tom Toomey", "Karin before we get into the next question throws out again. Speaking to the '14 or '15 same-store guidance, I'd like to add to it we had a few different pieces that were issued that indicated that folks thought that our AFFO growth looked a little bit light compared to the strength of the business, and I'd like to address that for just a moment. If you looked at consensus, its showing and this is for 2015, it's showing $1.63. But I will remind you that when you look at consensus, it's always in mix bag. Some are going for FFO, some FFO is adjusted and some their own creation of what they believe the appropriate funds from operations. So that\u2019s how we've heard a measure. But we're at $1.61 against the $1.63.", "As you guys are modeling, I would ask you to consider there are couple of items to just make sure it's in your model. One is last quarter we had mentioned that upon the sale of the Texas JV which was obviously a favorable transaction for us that reduced our FFO as adjusted by close to a penny per share. And the second thing and it's something that we mentioned about a year ago, I mentioned about a year ago that we're going to be moving certain TRS assets out of the TRS up into the REIT through some tax structuring, and that was going to reduce the tax benefit. That\u2019s about a two penny difference as well. So you add those two together that's $0.03, that equates to about 2%, and that would certainly bridge the gap plus the penny probably against consensus no matter how you measure it.", "And the other thing as we show 5% to 8% FFO adjusted growth during the 2015 year $0.03 equates to 2%. So that would equate to 7% to 10% growth. And as you know from our strategic plan we've indicated strong cash flow growth has been one of things that we're working hard toward 7% to 10% growth rate is certainly consistent with what we've been seeking to accomplish. So I just wanted to add that in as you're considering remodeling.", "Karin Ford", "I think you mentioned also Tom in your opening remarks that the strategic plan was essentially unchanged, but as there were some minor tweaks. Can you just give us a quick summary and so what you think the tweaks were from last year's plan to this year's?", "Tom Toomey", "I'm really minor in scope and nature, I think you are going to continue to see us with our development spend which is probably a little bit less than it was in prior year's asset sales last year exceeded plan, this year we put forward some guidance as total capital requirement the mix may change upon that. That\u2019s probably where I think the tweaks are.", "Karin Ford", "And then just last question is on the operating initiatives that you guys are so successful on last year. How much of that NOI benefit do you think you guys have harvested? And are there additional initiatives that you're planning to implement for 2015?", "Jerry Davis", "Yes Karin this is Jerry. I think there is still lag on quite a few of the initiatives we started last year. And if you looked at page seven in the two year strategy. We started out on reducing vacant days if you will. Back in 2012 when we were averaging about 26 days we so far cut five days off of that and we're down to averaging 21 days in 2014. We're going to try to get a few more days off of that this year and our long-term goal today is 18 days, but we\u2019re going to reassess when we get to that point. So we still think there is some room to pick up some reduction there.", "The biggest item or one of the big items is increasing staff efficiency. We first looked at this several years ago, we deemed our maintenance teams were probably inefficient about three to four hours a day where they are soundly walking from place to place, and we've introduced technology and standards. If you capture a 50 minutes of that which adds about an annual almost $3 million to NOI, we think there is another 1.5 hours to two hours to get. So we think we're only 40% of the way there this year. And I can tell you as I look at the components of what make up my expense growth next year, our expectations as our NIM expense is going down again for the third year in a row by a little over 1%. So there is some juice there.", "Then the third large initiative that we'll continue this year that we started last year was our outbound call center, what we called in the two year document resurrecting discarded rental lease. We picked up 400 incremental leases last year we feel from this group which boosted our occupancy about 50 basis points. We increased the size of that group but our intent is not to increase the occupancy, it's actually to increase traffic which will probably result in a lower closing ratio at the site, but we think it will drive rates. So we're not going to have to be the cheapest place to live, we can hold out here quality, high paying renters, drive rate more. Whereas last year was an occupancy pickup, we think this year it's going to be more of a rate pickup.", "I would say there is a few things we're working on, that are in this document. It is hard to tell if we'll make much money in this year but its problems we know we have to solve and that's the resident package lockers or delivery systems, electronic locks we've been working on for several years haven't come up with a good solution but we think when it does it's going to be staffing efficiency as well as add amenities to the residents.", "And we pick another big one that we've really, we've dedicated some resources here in our Denver office too is reputation management by not doing -- we think we need to get our scores better even though they are better than the average for the industry, we realized a lot of our demographic looks at that metric before they make a buying choice. So we want to work to get our scores up but more importantly we want to listen to what our residents are saying about us and make the UDR community a much better place to live.", "So those are the things that are one the immediate pipeline. I can tell you we've got about 50 to 60 different items. Some may take years to prepare implementation but we'll tell you about those once we get them rolling.", "Operator", "Next question will be from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.", "Rich Anderson", "Just real couple of quick ones, first. Did you mention this one-time infrastructure repair cost and what that was?", "Tom Toomey", "No I didn't.", "Rich Anderson", "And what is it, and when is it?", "Tom Toomey", "Yes it is going to be throughout 2015, it pertains to two projects that we have; one that involves re-piping and one that involves a garage structural repair that's fairly significant. They are both one-time, they are both not going to add or provide a return. And so we felt it appropriate to break it out separately in Schedule '15 which is where you'll find that guidance. And I know your next question is going to be, are we going to include that in our recurring CapEx? And the answer is no, because of the one-time nature of it and the non-recurring nature.", "Rich Anderson", "So will it be ratably throughout the year or specific quarters or what? Just for modeling purposes.", "Jerry Davis", "Rich this is Jerry. I think you are going to see first quarter is more planning, I think the bulk of the spend is going to come in the last three quarters.", "Rich Anderson", "Next question is just on the 1031 exchange; by buying land I wasn't aware you can get satisfied with the 1031 exchange requirements. Is there something you have to do with that land in a specific period of time to satisfy that tax issue? Or is that legal -- not legal or just buying land enough or they would like exchange?", "Harry Alcock", "Rich this is Harry. The 1031 works or function the same whether it's an operating asset or a land asset, both work equally as well.", "Rich Anderson", "I wasn't clear on that, so. And then maybe a big picture question for Toomey or whomever. But a lot of shifting around some complexities, with things moving from one bucket to the MetLife relationship. Do you foresee some of those kind of moving buckets some of that moving, activity slowing down in future periods does create some create some noisy situations in certain quarters. So I was just wondering if you could comment on that and what the kind of long-term objective is and where you want to get to in terms of your ultimate relationship with MetLife?", "Tom Toomey", "Well certainly with respect to Met, I think the long-term goal about four years ago was try to move it to a 50-50 platform. And as you can see every quarter we chip away at that, the remaining aspect to get there is probably about six parcels of land that are currently going through rezoning efforts. And so over probably the next year or two years you will see us evaluate those as to more clarity about the investment opportunity is understood, and they'll move to a 50-50. And at that point I think we pretty much have completed what I would call hand over Met UDR transition will be done, Rich and I think that's a great position to be.", "You can see we took steps to simplify the organization this quarter with certainly the sale of the Texas JV and realizing a great return. So I think these well might add some complexities Tom has done a fabulous job of laying out the path, the value created in each of them. And we think that\u2019s a continual effort going forward, but certainly things that have been worth undertaking and certainly a benefit to our shareholders.", "Rich Anderson", "So maybe some moving parts, some noise for this year but then it starts to die down and you get to where you want to be?", "Tom Toomey", "Yes sir.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Dave Bragg of Green Street Advisors.", "Dave Bragg", "And Jerry I wanted to follow up on a point you made earlier which is that your asset sale and rolling of new assets into the same-store pool could move the needle a little bit. So just to help us to have a clear perspective on what '16 could look like relative to '15? How much does that impact your '16 revenue growth if you think about the same-store pool this year, what\u2019s that growth rate in '16?", "Jerry Davis", "Dave, I don\u2019t have the exact number, I can tell you as we\u2019ve looked at potential dispositions and the assets that are going to come in, we think it\u2019s going to be fairly de minimis, call it 10 to 20 basis points probably at most.", "Dave Bragg", "And then question for Herzog, when we look at page 11 of the plan, you have debt equity in sale proceeds group together. Your peer AvalonBay provides a constant capital heat map which really provides their view of relative attractiveness of each of those three sources. Could you talk about that from your perspective and how you\u2019ll balance that with your leverage targets?", "Thomas Herzog", "Sure Dave. We don\u2019t provide heat map but we do in the same kiosk. So, here is how I think lets out. If we look at the three different sources, first look at just cost of equity. If we're showing equity we do it against AFFO yields, just for the per share, so I don\u2019t mean the true cost of equity including growth but the per share cost against AFFO, call it somewhere between 4% and 4.5% cost in that particular year. If we look at sales proceeds, we just look at the cap rate on a cash flow cap rate basis and again ignoring growth. That could be -- it depends on what assets were signed it could be a sub four, it could be six, 6.5 maybe seven. But that\u2019s the type of range dependant on what it is, we\u2019re selling that in which market, which assets, et cetera.", "When we think about that, we could be issuing debt at call it three, 3.5 today on a 10 year basis. When we look at what it could be in 2015, maybe we say four, maybe we'd say less. So that\u2019s anywhere from 3.3 to four in the current year for newly issued debt. So, when we think about the most attractive source of capital, we have to take into account, we trade in at a premium to NAV, what do sales proceeds look like? Do we have assets that we would really like to liquidate and from a debt metric perspective, however we\u2019re thinking about our leverage, our net debt to EBITDA, fixed charge coverage et cetera. And as you know over the last couple of three years, we\u2019ve leaned toward issuance of less debt or at least keep it neutral, so that we can improve our metrics, we\u2019ve not been a big issuer of equity because the good portion of that we\u2019re trading at a discount, that as we look at it today, frankly we have three very attractive sources of capital and we\u2019ll definitely take into account our debt metrics and we\u2019ll look at each of those, every time we consider, which source of funds we want to utilize.", "Dave Bragg", "And last question is just back to Jerry. Of course you noted your reduced exposure to taxes but just talk about your broader thoughts on the impact of lower oil on Dallas and on Denver?", "Jerry Davis", "Sure, I would say Dave from what we\u2019re seeing and what we project to see, these are diversified economies and we don\u2019t see much of an impact to us. I would remind you, in Denver we only have one 50-50 owned assets, so it will have minimal effect on us. And then Dallas to date we see nothing, I would tell you even the January is been a bit stronger than I would have expected three months ago. So, I think when you look at everything that Texas has going for it outside of Huston, the other two markets, they will have some effect from oil prices but not nearly as much.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Ian Weissman with Credit Suisse.", "Ian Weissman", "My questions have been asked and answered, thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.", "Michael Salinsky", "Hey, good afternoon guys and just follow to Dave\u2019s question just as we think about dispositions there. How much can you sell in 2015 without pushing up a need for special dividend?", "Tom Toomey", "We\u2019ve got a decent gain capacity, but Mike it depends on the blend of assets that we sell. You can look at what we\u2019ve sold in 2014, they weren\u2019t all in non-core markets, we had certain assets that we chose to sell in Seattle. We had assets in Florida; we had assets in Norfolk, we had an asset in California. So it depends on which assets we choose to liquidate and what the gain on that is. But we\u2019ve also got the clawback rules in a variety of different things. So we\u2019re not bumping up against any issues around that right now. If we chose to fund our entire development pipeline in 2015 from sales proceeds [indiscernible].", "Michael Salinsky", "Second question I think you mentioned three to four stretch with MetLife one on balance sheet. Could you give just kind of a dollar amount as we think and then just as you\u2019re looking ahead to '16 there thinking about the capital sources and uses, how much should we expect kind of to start there, just kind of building out the pipeline there.", "Tom Toomey", "Can you repeat that second part Mike? I missed it.", "Michael Salinsky", "You gave a number of starts but I'm just thinking in terms of dollar amounts, how much should we kind of -- what\u2019s the dollar amount there just given MetLife for probably three to four of the starts.", "Tom Herzog", "Yes, hold on a second I\u2019ve got that number here. The starts in '15 will be somewhere around 400 million in total, so that\u2019s the start number.", "Tom Toomey", "Mike, that\u2019s UDR's share. So we expect to start our Pac City project in Huntington Beach in 2015. We also expect to start a 50-50 JV, 155 units in Mountain View the early part of '15 and then we have two or three others that could start in 2015 UDR share would be 400 million to 500 million.", "Michael Salinsky", "And finally just the leverage metrics you gave in the strategic outlook don't include your share with JVs. Just given the asset sales into the JV as well as the client commitments with MetLife. Just could you give us kind of an update where you think those metrics kind of play out relative to wholly owned portfolio over the next two years?", "Tom Herzog", "Let me just start with 2015. We\u2019ve got net debt to EBITDA, in fact let me just me actually go to the range numbers rather than what I have in my model. So, net debt to EBITDA, we\u2019re showing 5.8 to 6.2 the same number with JVs would be somewhere around 6.8, and in 2016, I\u2019m triangulated in a couple of schedules here. Net debt to EBITDA dropped to somewhere, I\u2019m not going range just one, just call it a mid-point of about a 5.4 and it would drop inclusive of JVs to somewhere around 6.4.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Derek Bower with Evercore ISI.", "Derek Bower", "Just a couple of quick ones. Tom can you comment on the reasons for delaying the financing of the January maturity? And maybe what the revolver balance stands today?", "Tom Herzog", "Yes, the revolver balance, it\u2019s just over 400 million. We\u2019ve got some proceeds that will be coming in and we\u2019re looking at a couple of potential different sources of capital. So it\u2019s sometime in the first half that we expect, we\u2019ve already got a piece of that debt hedged. So that plays into our thinking as well. So with variety of different things we\u2019re thinking about as we think about the timing of debt.", "Derek Bower", "And then just given the West Cost concentration of the pipeline. Are there any East Coast markets that you\u2019re actively looking for land sites today?", "Harry Alcock", "Derek this is Harry, we just acquired a land site in Boston for large a projects that we\u2019ll start next year. We are actively looking for traditional sites in Washington DC possibly in New York, in addition to the West Coast assets.", "Derek Bower", "Jerry, sorry if I missed this, but where is occupancy today or the end of January?", "Jerry Davis", "Both cases into January and today it\u2019s 96.5.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Dan Oppenheim with Zelman & Associates.", "Dan Oppenheim", "I was wondering if you can talk Tom about the outlook and potential risks to it, how much of the lower turnover that you\u2019re seeing has occurred for past few years? You think is due to the shift in the markets where you are into better customer service and satisfaction. How much you think is cyclical sort of it could present a risk in terms of expenses also in terms of unit to that way.", "Tom Toomey", "I would tell you, I think a lot of is our markets I think when you look at it with our mix of As and Bs, the Bs really hasn\u2019t been moving out as much because they\u2019re not being tempted by the new developments. So that helped somewhat. I would tell you too that we\u2019ve done a better job of lengthening lease terms, few couple years ago our average lease was probably around 11 months and its gotten closer to 12 months and it doesn\u2019t sound like much. It will reduce the number of explorations you're going to have in a any given year by several percent that will help drive it down to. I think our turnover is going to continue at a low level. Our expectations right now is probably be pretty stable with where it was last year we continue to see build outs to home purchase slightly below long-term averages. And we don\u2019t see that picking back up and as far as exposure to new development properties we sell to lot of that last year we don\u2019t see a getting much worse.", "Dan Oppenheim", "In terms of the 10 year trends we're talking about that in terms of the new lease. How much of that is influenced most the regional mix of lease exploration in terms -- and January clearly would want to have few of those and some of the colder snowier markets. Is there any mix that you saw in terms of just how these aspirations are in January for some of the Northeast versus West Coast markets?", "Tom Toomey", "We work to keep it down pretty much on a national basis, because there is very few markets honestly where you are going to do better in January. California I will tell you, you want heavier concentrations in the middle two quarters. So it's going to hurt you almost as much as it does place like Boston. So I don\u2019t think there is a significant differentiation across the portfolio, I would tell you though that first in fourth quarter we like to keep our explorations down to about 21% per home account in each of those quarters. And then it gets up into third quarter high as the low to mid 30s.", "Operator", "Next to Ryan Peterson with Sandler O'Neill. Ryan Peterson your line is open. Please go ahead with your question.", "Ryan Peterson", "Just back to your outlook on dispositions, given the pricing on Gables recently are you encouraged to sell more of your Sun Belt assets?", "Tom Toomey", "This is Toomey. I think we'll keep with the discipline that\u2019s worked for us for so many years. We're exposed a lot to the market; we'll see where pricing comes in, the certainty around the buyer and execute accordingly. So I think it always gives us a boarder perspective of the cost of selling assets and we'll continue to do that. I don\u2019t think there is any particular focus on market or an asset I think, we have them ranked, we list them all we'll see where they come.", "Ryan Peterson", "And then just one other quick question. Can you discuss all the hurdles that you have on the Wilshire development to kind of recoup with the impairment that you took there.", "Tom Toomey", "We likely said if we meet certain return thresholds on that, we will back the 2.2 million. But we have a partner involved here, so we're not going to disclose those details.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from William Kuo with Cowen and Company.", "William Kuo", "Just on View 34, I was wondering if you could talk about that look like the completion day was pushed back two quarters.", "Harry Alcock", "William this is Harry. I'll talk; it really was a function of the final element in the building is completing the roof top. We had a few delays in the permitting last summer and just decided intentionally to push the completion of that piece of the project into 2015 which will allow us to complete the balance of the project and give the tenants a rest, this thing's been under construction for two plus years. So we expect to start that here sometime in the next 30 to 45 days and complete it in the second quarter.", "William Kuo", "And then just a follow up on Texas on Page 14 of the outlook it looks sub 3.5% revenue growth for '15 which is a bit of deceleration from 4Q. Is that a bit of conservative built in there? Or that\u2019s kind of what you guys are seeing on the ground in terms of renewals and new leases that you're getting.", "Jerry Davis", "This is Jerry. I don\u2019t its conservatism, I'll tell we are feeling the effects of new supply that has hit Austin especially hard over the last year, 1.5 years. We were able to avoid it for the most part last year. But I would remind you we have a small portfolio there, so four same-store assets, one of them is surrounded by new supply and it's definitely feeling it a couple of them are B assets that even there is new supply they paired well last year but they're is starting to feel it. And then one is a B plus product, it's close to the South Lamar project that have been coming up just South of Downtown Austin and it's feeling it.", "So I probably feel a little better today about Dallas honestly from my portfolio then I do Austin, we've had a good start to the year in Dallas. But Austin is a bit concerning. Now I would tell you they've been good strong markets for the last couple of years but even absent anything from oil new supply is affecting our portfolio there.", "William Kuo", "Just finally in light of the kind of cost saving initiatives you guys have been doing. I was wondering if you could comment on the differential between the expense growth in the same-store portfolio and in the JV portfolio. Is there something different there or you just aren't able to kind of roll these initiatives into the JV?", "Tom Toomey", "When you look at it our JV full year the expense growth has been about 5.7%, that's for the MetLife and that compares to our 2.5%. The bigger component honestly this is, I mean real-estate taxes. They comprise over 30%, 33% in both pools and you are just seeing more pressure in some of the markets where the JVs are. In addition it could be that last year and I don't have the details of top of my head, sometimes it's affected by tax refunds, it is tax rates and valuations but it's predominantly taxes.", "Operator", "We will take our last question from Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.", "Haendel St. Juste", "A couple of quick ones here for you guys. So curious looking at your portfolio map, we've talked a bit in the past about your warehouse markets. And just going through the list here of some of those markets, looks like you have maybe about a billion or so depending on what cap rate sort of assumption people use of what I deem sort of non long-term warehouse type assets. Curious in terms of your near-term contemplated asset sales, I am assuming the majority of these the sales are in those sort of warehouse markets. And then as a follow-on, why not accelerate the asset sales in those markets a bit given the rising supply, hearing from the home builders that they are picking up their starts and given the strong asset pricing in those markets?", "Tom Herzog", "Well just in general I will start and if Tom wants to add something. Let's talk about capital warehouse for a minute. So we've got certain non-core assets and capital market warehouse assets. In the capital warehouse markets I think for the past year or so we've made it pretty clear or a bit longer than that that these are markets that right now are most of them are doing pretty well, we're not in rush to liquidate those assets and some of them are actually producing some pretty strong returns and we don't think we've exhausted their value creation potential.", "So when we look at and I think I am repeating a little bit what I said earlier or what Tom said earlier that when you look at the 2014 sales there was a diverse mix, some out of Norfolk non-core, some out of Florida that's capital warehouse we have couple of assets that we pruned out of Seattle and one of San Diego just as an example. So we will choose the assets that we feel that have exhausted the value creation potential and from time to time those will also be non-core capital warehouse. That's where we're with that Haendel, Tom anything you would add to that.", "Tom Toomey", "I think a couple of points to add Haendel and thanks for the question. First I think every company has a certain pool of assets, they are below average and probably over a long-term will liquidate. We've elected to kind of identify what that proposed markets to help our shareholders understand where we are going to be strategically. We've never put a timeline on it, we think it's an economic decision and in that context as long as we're executing our strategies and making good economic decisions we will arrive at that date sometime in the future and be happy with the result. So if it comes along and the world changes economically or asset values materially change one way or another, then I think we could think about acceleration. But right now we're happy with the pace, the redeployment of capital and driving long-term cash flow growth.", "Haendel St. Juste", "And while I have you just curious on the decision to pare back the three year outlook to two years but certainly it was well received implemented a few years back, clients so far certainly appreciate the view on your look on how you would be running your business or expectations over the next couple of years. I now there is probably not a lot of certainly or maybe valuing then guiding the third year, but it did provide a bit of comfort to some folks. Just curious how you sort of balance those considerations when you guys were contemplating cutting back the three year to a two year plan?", "Tom Herzog", "Haendel it's Herzog here again. During the last year I and others on the team here had opportunity to speak to numerous investors and one of the things that we heard from investors is there was a lot less value to that third than there was certainly the second year. And because the numbers just get fussier the further out you go. And there were also comments made that by providing the second year it gave more clarity to what those numbers are rather than blending them with the third year. So we asked a variety of different investors how they felt about it and the majority said you know what we would prefer a two year plan, and so with that we moved to a two year plan accordingly. And we don't think we lose a whole lot of -- it provides you more clarity as to why we\u2019re thinking about 2016 and so we see some benefit in that and certainly our investors let us know that they felt the same way.", "Haendel St. Juste", "Appreciate that, and last one I don't know you guys mentioned or, would you be able to mention just curious on the Met benefit, Met impact to your same-store pool of the new entrance of pool this year, the new assets? The new entrance into your same-store pool just curious as to what benefit they might have on your same-store revenue for full year '15?", "Tom Toomey", "Yes, Haendel its probably fairly muted it\u2019s really just two properties that are coming in, residences of Bella Terra and Huntington Beach and in Capital View in Washington, D.C. So the volume of additions is very small and when you look at those two markets they probably blend down to about where the mid-point of our guidance is.", "Operator", "That concludes today\u2019s Q&A session. I\u2019d now turn the call back over to our moderator Tom Toomey.", "Tom Toomey", "Thank you for your time today and certainly your questions. In closing, we\u2019re happy with 2014 and certainly the progress we made against our long-term plans. As we look at 2015 it\u2019s off to a great start and I repeat a great start. We see a long runway for growth in the company and for the business and so we\u2019re very excited about the prospects not just '15 but beyond that. And we know we\u2019re going to see many of you in the conference seasoned as it unfolds, certainly don\u2019t hesitate to reach out and talk to the team about what our progress is. With that, thank you again for your time today.", "Operator", "That concludes today\u2019s conference call, thank you for your participation.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Shelby Noble. Please go ahead.", "Shelby Noble", "Welcome to UDR\u2019s first quarter 2015 financial results conference call. Our first quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed yesterday afternoon and posted to the Investor Relations section of our Web site, www.udr.com. In this supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in accordance with Reg G requirements.", "I would like to note that statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although, we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in yesterday\u2019s press release and included in our filings with the SEC. And we do not undertake the duty to update any forward-looking statements.", "When we get to the question-and-answer portion, we ask that you'll be respectful of everyone's time and limit your questions and follow-ups. Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered.", "I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.", "Tom Toomey", "Thank you, Shelby and good afternoon everyone and welcome to UDR's first quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Tom Herzog, Chief Financial Officer and Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our results, as well as senior officers Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.", "The first quarter of 2015 was another great quarter for UDR and our business is firing in all cylinders. As a result of great execution from operations, exceptional lease up velocity and a new strategic investment, we increased our full year same-store and earnings guidance ranges. In short, we continue to execute on our previously communicated 2 year strategic plan, with transparent strength of fundamentals and our diligent capital allocation we feel great about the plan and our ability to deliver on it.", "The following four topics highlight our first quarter. First, our operations outperformed versus our initial expectations and historical norms due to exceptional new lease rate growth, strong renewal rate growth and a continued focus on containing cost. These trends continued as we move into our prime leasing season in the second quarter. Second, our development lease-up continue to perform very well. We are exceeding our budgeted lease up absorption and realizing rents in excess of our initial projections at Beach & Ocean in Huntington Beach and our 100 Pier 4 in Boston Seaport area.", "We expect to complete 326 million of a previous development in 2015, which will continue to drive our cash flow and NAV growth. Third, subsequent to quarter-end we entered into a joint venture agreement with The Wolff Company in a portfolio of five communities that are currently under construction. The venture will provide UDR with a pipeline of over 1,500 new homes with an accelerated delivery schedule and anticipated completions beginning in 2015 and ending in 2017. All of the communities are located in core coastal markets including Metro Seattle, Los Angeles and Orange County. Tom will address the economics and the benefit to UDR in his prepared remarks.", "Fourth, we are increasing our full year same-store and earnings guidance ranges to reflect the strength evident in our operations and the accretive nature of the venture that I just mentioned. Better operations and the venture contributed a penny each versus previously announced guidance. Lastly, our prospects look fantastic as we enter the second quarter. Our mix of A and B quality communities in northern and suburban locations should continue to generate strong operating results. As I indicated earlier April trends were well above our initial forecast and May looks like it will continue to accelerate. There remains a long runway for growth at UDR and we have the right plan and team in place to capitalize on the opportunities.", "With that, I\u2019d like to express my sincere thanks to all my fellow UDR associates for their extraordinary work in producing another strong quarter of results. I\u2019d also like to welcome Shelby Noble to the UDR team as our new Head of Investor Relations and express my gratitude to Chris Van Ens for all his hard work and along over the past 3 years. I know he will be very successful working with Jerry on the operating team. We look forward to continued success in 2015.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Tom.", "Tom Herzog", "Thanks, Tom. The topics I will cover today include our first quarter results, our balance sheet and capital markets update, our development update, recent transactions and our revised full year 2015 guidance. Our first quarter earnings of results were at the upper-end of our previously provided guidance ranges. FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $0.43, $0.40 and $0.37, respectively. This was driven by better than expected first quarter same-store revenue, expense and NOI growth which were strong at 5.1%, 2.5% and 6.2% respectively. Jerry will provide additional color in his prepared remarks.", "Next, the balance sheet. At quarter-end our financial leverage on an undepreciated cost basis was 37.5%, on a fair value basis, it was around 28%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 6.4 times inclusive of pro rata JV\u2019s it was 7.3 times, all metrics continued to improve as planned. At quarter-end our liquidity as measured by cash and credit facility capacity was 517 million. On the capital markets, as previously disclosed we issued 109 million of equity net of fees through our ATM program during the quarter, the shares were issues at a premium to consensus NAV.", "Turning to development. We commenced construction on our 155 home $99 million Domain Mountain View development in Mountain View, California in a 50-50 joint venture with Metlife. At quarter-end the pro rata share of our underway development pipeline totaled 838 million and was 73% funded with an estimated spread between stabilized yields and market cap rate and at the upper-end of our targeted 150 to 200 basis point range. As to future development we continue to underwrite opportunities with a bicoastal focus and we anticipate the size of our pipeline to be in the targeted range of 900 million to 1.4 billion by mid-year.", "On to recent transactions. As previously announced, we completed the disposition of our 20% interest in our Texas JV. We realized net proceeds of approximately 43 million on the sale inclusive of a promote and disposition fee of approximately 9.6 million. These were recognized in the first quarter but excluded from FFO as adjusted and AFFO. This disposition was well timed as it eliminated our exposure to Houston, reduced our exposure to Dallas and generated a strong IRR of approximately 14%.", "As Tom mentioned subsequent to quarter-end we entered into a joint venture agreement with The Wolff Company to invest 136 million for a 48% interest and a portfolio of five communities that are currently under construction. Our investment is based on an initial all-in price of 559 million. We are discussing a fixed asset with our partners that we may add before closing which would represent an approximate 20% increase to both our initial all-in price and investment. This transaction is beneficial on a variety of ways.", "First, we received a 6.5% preferred return on 136 million investment. So the transaction would be immediately accretive to FFO and avoid their earnings drag associated with typical development projects. Second, assuming all five of the communities are acquired, we estimate NAV creation of approximately 80 million at current market cap rates. Third, this transaction increases our exposure to high quality communities located in our core coastal markets for multifamily supply demand fundamentals appear favorable for the foreseeable future.", "Fourth, the JV is less risky than a typical development as construction is already underway on all five of the communities. Our partner has provided certain guarantees the 136 million to be paid represents our entire reported investment in the venture and there is no promoted structure to our partner. Fifth, four of the five communities are located within a mile of an existing UDR community, thereby enhancing similarity with anticipated operations and valuations. And finally, with lease up starting on average in seven months we\u2019re able to take advantage of current fundamental market strength.", "Additionally, given our accelerated ability to exercise our purchase options ranging from 22 to 36 months from today, we view this transaction as having elements of a financing arrangement with an option to purchase rather than simply a traditional joint venture. We are excited about the accretive nature of this transaction, additional details are available on our first quarter press release and the West Coast Development joint venture presentation posted on our Web site.", "On to the second quarter and full year 2015 updated guidance. We increased our full year FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO guidance ranges by $0.02 at the midpoint due to stronger than expected operations and accretion from the development joint venture. Full year 2015 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share are now forecast at $1.63 to $1.67, $1.61 to $1.65 and $1.44 to $1.48 respectively. For same-store we have increased our full year 2015 revenue growth guidance by 50 basis at the midpoint to 4.25% to 4.75%. Expense growth is unchanged at 2.5% to 3% and increased our NOI growth forecast by 75 basis points at the midpoint to 4.75% to 5.75%. The increase was driven by strong new and renewal rate growth, total occupancy and lower turnover. Second quarter 2015 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance is $0.39 to $0.41, $0.39 to $0.41 and $0.34 to $0.36 respectively.", "From a sources and uses perspective we have updated our sales proceeds and debt and equity issuance guidance at the midpoint from 775 million to 825 million. This net 50 million increase is the result of an increase in our acquisition guidance to account for the development joint venture transaction mentioned earlier and the removal of 75 million of assumed land acquisitions. As to funding our capital needs for the year, to-date we received 43 million from our Texas JV disposition. We issued 109 million of equity on our ATM and have 65 million of assets under contract for sale. Assuming a 300 million bond offering late in the second quarter we have only 250 million to 300 million of remaining capital funding needs for the year.", "As we outlined in our call last quarter, we will continue to utilize the most advantageous source of capital to fund these needs typically either through asset sales through equity issuance at or above NAV. Other primary full year guidance assumptions can be found on Attachment 15 or Page 25 of our supplement. Finally, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.2775 per share in the first quarter or $1.11 per share when annualized, 7% above 2014\u2019s level and representing a yield of approximately 3.3%.", "With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jerry.", "Jerry Davis", "Thanks, Tom and good afternoon. In my remarks, I\u2019ll cover the following topics; first, our first quarter portfolio metrics, leasing trends and the rental rate growth we realized this quarter and early results for the second quarter. Second, how our primary markets during the quarter and last a brief update on our development lease-ups. We\u2019re pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. In the first quarter same-store net operating income grew 6.2% driven by a 5.1% year-over-year increase in revenue, that was above our expectations and a 2.5% increase in expenses. Our same-store revenue per occupied home increased by 4.6% year-over-year to $1,659 per month. Our same-store occupancy of 96.7% was 60 basis points higher versus the prior year period.", "Total portfolio revenue per occupied home was $1,836 per month including pro rata JVs. Our first quarter revenue growth was well above our original forecast and was driven by widespread strength across our markets. Stable job growth, limited impact from new multi-family supply, a single family housing market that is still finding its footing, significant demand from new Millennial households and incremental demand from empty-nesters are all helping.", "Turning to new and renewal lease rate growth which is detailed on Attachment 8-E of our supplement. Our ability to push new lease rate growth continued to outpace historical precedent during the first quarter by wide margin, we grew in the lease rates by 4.2% in 1Q, a full 320 basis point ahead of the first quarter of 2014. Renewal growth also remained robust at 5.7% in the first quarter or 60 basis points ahead of last year. In April, these trends continued with new lease and renewal rate growth of 6.3% and 6.8% respectively. Our leasing success in conjunction with stable, sequential occupancy and lower year-over-year turnover gives us plenty of confidence that demand is more than sufficient to continue pushing rates higher throughout the upcoming prime leasing season. These factors also served as the primary drivers of our sizeable 50 basis point increase in same-store revenue guidance at the midpoint.", "Next, rents as a percentage of our residents\u2019 income decreased slightly to 17.2%. Move-outs to home purchase were flat year-over-year at 14% in line with our long-term average. Even with renewal increases at a healthy 5.7% in the first quarter, only 6.8% of our move-outs gave rent increases the reason for leaving.", "Moving on to quarterly performance in our primary markets. These markets represent 65% of our same-store NOI and 71% of our total NOI. Orange County and Los Angeles combined represent 17% of our total NOI. Orange County posted year-over-year revenue growth of 5.8% and is outperforming versus our budget expectations thus far in 2015. Our Los Angeles portfolio is concentrated in Marina Del Rey and Playa Vista submarket and continues to be impacted by new supply in the submarket. As a result, our first quarter year-over-year revenue drove 3.8% lag versus the overall LA market. However, we still expect full year same-store revenue growth of just under 5% for Los Angeles.", "New York City represents 13% of our total NOI. Our downtown assets posted combined rent growth of 6.5% in the first quarter while maintaining occupancy at just under 98%. Lower Manhattan remains attractive as the result of limited new supply, strong job growth in the technology, finance, media and advertising fields and low housing affordability which limits move-outs to home purchase. Metro DC which represents 12.5% of our total NOI posted year-over-year same-store revenue growth of 1.9%, compared to a negative 50 basis points in 4Q of 2014. We are forecasting 1.5% to 2% revenue growth in 2015, as we continue to benefit from our diverse 50-50 mix of A and B assets located both inside and outside the Beltway.", "San Francisco which represents nearly 12% of our total NOI shows no sign slowing down as new and renewal lease rate growth in the first quarter and April point to another strong year for the Bay area. Same-store revenue growth in the first quarter reached 9%. Submarket-wise results were more mixed with our Downtown properties posting 5% top-line growth due to the impact of new supply and compared against 11% growth at our properties on Peninsula and in the Silicon Valley. Seattle which represents 6.5% of our total NOI continue to benefit from the strong growth inherent in our suburban B assets which are located in submarkets which are less exposed to new supply. Long-term we continue to like the Downtown Seattle submarket and believe that the ongoing creation of new jobs by companies such as Amazon, Facebook and Expedia will continue to drive demand in Seattle\u2019s urban core.", "Boston which represents 5% of our total NOI continues to see new supply pressure Downtown. Our suburban assets north of the city and to a lesser degree those on the south shore should fair relatively better in 2015. Last, Dallas, which represents just over 4.5% of our NOI posted 4.4% year-over-year same-store revenue growth in the first quarter. We expect new supply to pressure our Uptown and Plano communities in 2015. For the full year we expect revenue growth to modestly decelerate from our first quarter results and come in around 4.0%.", "I\u2019ll turn now to our recently completed and in-lease up developments, which you can find on Attachment 9 or Page 19 of our supplement. These three properties represent $400 million or roughly 48% of our pipeline. Beach & Ocean, our 173 home $52 million lease-up in Huntington Beach was 91% leased and 85% occupied at quarter-end. We are ahead of budget and exceeding our lease-up expectations. Asking rents today are just over $3 per square foot or $0.30 ahead of budget. I\u2019d like to remind you this property is located three miles from our Bella Terra project that was stabilized a year ago and it\u2019s just a mile from our oceanfront development site Pacific City which we plan to start at the end of the second quarter.", "DelRay Tower, our 332 home $132 million lease up in Alexandria, Virginia remains challenged by the weak DC market. But we\u2019re confident in its long-term prospects. We are currently offering concessions of about two months in this oversupplied submarket in order to hold rate and maintain leasing velocity to reach our budgeted occupancy. Long-term, we believe in the DelRay submarket where we built an exceptional property. Lastly, we\u2019re extremely pleased with the first three months of leasing of our 369 home $218 million 100 Pier 4 development in Boston\u2019s Seaport District. We\u2019ve taken over 120 applications in the month of March and April well above our expectations. At quarter-end the property was 31% leased as of today it is 50% leased 17% occupied asking rents of 4.70 per square foot are ahead of original underwriting.", "Pier 4\u2019s waterfront location is surrounded by new office building construction and is only a five minute walk to the Downtown Financial District and Boston\u2019s South Station Train hub. Several major employees are relocating to the Seaport district including Goodwin Procter which is relocating its Boston headquarters in 2016 and taking 380,000 square feet, State Street Bank which is relocating from the Back Bay taking 485,000 square feet and PWC which is slated to take 334,000 square feet as well. We\u2019ve experienced exceptional leasing demand ahead of these transformational events and are excited as the area continues to attract new potential residents.", "April results came in well ahead of plan, as we look ahead to the next few months we see continued and improving pricing power and stable occupancy. All-in we had a great first quarter and we remain very positive on the outlook for multifamily fundamentals and our ability to execute during the peak leasing season and throughout the remainder of 2015.", "With that, I\u2019ll open up the call to Q&A, operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi.", "Nick Joseph", "Can you talk about how the development JV was sourced and what the benefit is to your partners for executing the transaction at this time?", "Harry Alcock", "Nick this is Harry, Wolff was in the market looking for capital partners and given our sort of recent experience with Steele Creek we started talking to them about a similar type structure which is how this thing evolved from our partners perspective I assume there are a number of benefits that they could communicate but I know specifically they\u2019ve got a couple of benefits, one they get to return money to an open-ended fund and redeploy it and secondly they were specifically over allocated on the development front to certain of these markets.", "Nick Joseph", "And then stabilized estimated yield of 5% on current rents or on trended rents?", "Harry Alcock", "That\u2019s on trended rents we have grown rents up 3% on average over the next couple of years through stabilization.", "Operator", "Next would be Jana Galan with Bank of America.", "Jana Galan", "Jerry I appreciate you\u2019re going to the core markets, it sounded like DC and Dallas revenue growth are expected to decelerate as we make our way through the year but every other market looks to be are gaining\u2026?", "Jerry Davis", "Now that is true, actually DC will be close to flat we expect DC for the full year to come in between 1.5% to 2% we\u2019re starting to see the Downtown area as I said in my remarks get closer to the same types of growth as we saw in the suburbs over the last year or so they\u2019re roughly even in that 1.5% range today. A big part of that is most of those assets last year were combating against the lease ups and therefore I have an offer I am going to have free of concessions when those have gone away. But the rest of the portfolio as you noted we are seeing a continuing growth in revenue when we first gave our guidance back in early February we felt our numbers were realistic given our economic data at the time, even though at that time we were seeing a lot of the operating trends on the ground that were showing strength, that was a little early in the year as we got further into the year we've seen the rate growth continue to accelerate sequentially and just as an example I would tell you that in the month of February our blended rate growth between new and renewals was 4.9% in March that grew to 5.6% in April it's jumped up to 6.6% so it has been going up 50 to 100 basis points a month even though we don't expect that pace to continue we do anticipate that the growth will continue to go higher just not the same level of increases each month", "But I can also say in the month of May I would expect it to be higher that was in April with 6.6 I\u2019d also like to point out that we sent out renewals for the month of June and renewals in June are averaging at over 7% portfolio wide but there is a fairly wide disparity between the strongest markets which are the West Coast where renewals are pushing very high single-digits in the Sunbelt and Mid Atlantic are at the bottom those are about 5% renewal increases right in the middle close to the midpoint of what we are sending out is the Northeastern markets of New York as well as Boston so big disparity and I would remind you that typically we realize very close to what we have sent out so the seven should be a pretty good strong number.", "Today also just to get this out of the way our fiscal occupancy is 97% and what's really impressive to me and this really speaks to the broad success or strength of the rental markets that we\u2019re in we don\u2019t have a single market that has fiscal occupancy today less than 95.8% and when I look at our new lease rate growth in April our blended rate growth in April compared to the month of March 90% of my markets are higher in April than they were in March. So, going back to what you said we see continued strength and it's virtually across the board.", "Jana Galan", "And then just following up Tom had mentioned that you maybe adding a one project to the West Coast Development joint venture and Harry you said The Wolff Company was over allocated to Southern California I was just curious if there is opportunity to add more to the JV?", "Tom Toomey", "Yes. Just in and Jana you are talking about the land development JV or about Wolff? Yes we have five assets that are included in the JV currently there is a sixth asset that is currently being considered by both parties and we may add that prior to closing so yes that would be a West Coast asset as well.", "Jana Galan", "And any other opportunity to work more with them?", "Tom Toomey", "We do have a pipeline of additional development opportunities that is something that we would discuss with them once we move forward.", "Operator", "Next would be Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.", "Steve Sakwa", "Just a couple of quick questions on The Wolff side just to be clear with the five and the potential sixth was that kind of the entire current existing pipeline or did they have a portfolio of 15 and you went in and in effect pick out these five or six assets?", "Warren Troupe", "Steve. This is Warren. They recently had a portfolio of 10 that they presented to us and when we looked at the 10 the six that we've been talking about are the ones that we thought had the promise for us.", "Steve Sakwa", "And then I guess for Tom Herzog if you kind of think about NAV and consensus NAV I mean we're hearing more companies kind of using consensus NAV as the maybe the justification for issuing equity the companies don't always provide kind of their own views on NAV but just how do you -- it is just I guess to the extent that there was a large disparity between your own internal and consensus, how do you sort of rationalize that and is there a at which you probably would not issue equity in?", "Tom Herzog", "Yes, Steve. Certainly we look at consensus NAV it is an easy number for us to speak to, because it's produced by a sell side analyst, but we absolutely do our own NAV internally every quarter and then we bump that up against consensus before we consider issuing equity so that definitely comes into our capital. Did I answer your question on that?", "Steve Sakwa", "Yes. I mean we could sort of chat offline about it. It's just I guess to the extent that your NAV was 35 and consensus was 32 and the stock was at 33 you would be above consensus below your own number it may justify that we issued above consensus the duration below your own estimated value and so just trying to sort of get your arms around that or how should we should be thinking about that?", "Tom Herzog", "So I would put at this way we do look at our internal NAV and we run it for a purpose to determine whether we believe internally a transaction would be accretive or dilutive and more certainly if we had concluded that it would be dilutive to us we would not do the transaction so we do look at our own NAV when we consideration equity as well.", "Steve Sakwa", "And I guess just one last question for Jerry I mean DC looks like it turned the corner I don\u2019t want to put the carts before the horse here. But how you\u2019re just feeling DC it seems like the supply is being absorbed better than people thought. Is there a chance that DC surprises further to the upside there?", "Jerry Davis", "Steve as I look at my original plan DC is one of my most positive upside surprises along with Baltimore so the entire Mid-Atlantic area. The last quarter we stated that we felt so we had bottom in fourth quarter of 2014 in DC and then it was either going to plateau or start to reaccelerate the acceleration was a little bit sooner than we expect although we did expect it to go positive.", "I think it potentially could outperform even more we\u2019ll have to see if the jobs continue to come. But right now the new supply inside the Beltway is providing less resistance than it was last year. In fact I think on this call last year I had given some data points of what were my best performing and worst performing individual assets were in DC and I know my worse performing was at about a negative 4% growth and it was my View 14 property down on View Street and if I look at my first quarter results this year that same property has positive revenue growth 3.5%. So that U Street Corridor in particular where we\u2019ve bet pretty heavily with really about four properties within a mile up there are really performing well.", "Steve Sakwa", "And I guess that\u2019s the only market at this point you\u2019re worried about just downside surprised or is the jobs picture in the household formations just running so strong that there are very few markets where you kind of worry about downside surprise?", "Jerry Davis", "It is universal look so one when it will show occasional signs of some weaknesses in Dallas although the job growth continues to be strong we have felt the effect of new supply have been playing out where we have roughly one half of our same-store portfolio. But other than that the strength is across the board I think the Downtown San Francisco is impacted by supply as I stated in my prepared remarks that Downtown area is underperforming the Bay Area at about 5.5% to 6% if you call that underperforming. But Steve today we keep looking for when it is going to hit us that is negative and it\u2019s been hard to find. Earlier in the year we were a little concerned with Boston but then what came into reality similar to last year is it was a seasonal weather issue because as soon as March came around we saw a dramatic pick up in our rent growth, our occupancy which have stayed strong, got a little bit stronger and as evidenced by the success of our Seaport lease up Pier 4 we\u2019re very enthused by the strength of Boston even though there is significant development pressure Downtown.", "Operator", "And next will be John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.", "John Kim", "I had a question on the consolidation in the sector recently. Do you expect this trend to continue given the leveraged buyers in the market? And does this change the way you run your business at all? For example, do you want to get large or do you increase your economies of scale?", "Tom Toomey", "This is Tom Toomey and thank you for the question. It\u2019s an open-ended speculative question and in all frankness I\u2019d rather focus on what our strategic plan is, the execution of it and the delivery of the results. And so, while we sat around and observed what\u2019s going on we think our best plan is the one we\u2019ve outlined and the execution of it.", "John Kim", "So do you think that if you could figure the economies of scale would improve for your company?", "Tom Toomey", "I think it\u2019s a double edged sword. I mean I at one-time with a few other guys in this room ran a company that was 400 apartment homes. And to tell you the truth after about 200,000 doors you start having inefficiencies because you become a company that\u2019s run by spreadsheets and not the local knowledge of the particular real estate. And we like our size today and are more focused on what we derive out of the assets than what our G&A is relative to the size we don\u2019t see it as a problem today. We look at the results and the cash flow growth of the enterprise more than we do to the G&A aspect of the enterprise.", "John Kim", "I had a couple of questions on the mechanics of the joint venture, so just understanding the immediate the preferred return that you are getting is essentially a coupon that you\u2019re getting from your partner?", "Tom Toomey", "Well we get a 6.5% preferred return on our $136 million investment so I think you could describe it as a coupon, yes.", "John Kim", "And then you -- when this asset stabilizes the development stabilize the yield goes to 5%, 5.4%. So is that actually a little bit dilutive once the developments are complete?", "Tom Toomey", "Well it\u2019s not dilutive relative to our cost of capital but the question is that the 6.5% coupon that you realized sort of reverse to a 5.4% the answer is yes, so the returns do come down slightly as we -- as the properties come online.", "John Kim", "And your preference today is to exercise this\u2026", "Tom Herzog", "If I could just jump in, it's Herzog just to be clear the 6.5% prep on the investment balance until such time as the asset is considered stabilized which would be at 80% occupancy and until that date The Wolff partner will incur all operating losses minus interest or get any operating income during that period of time. Once we have been deemed stabilized on an asset to that definition, then we move into our sharing ratio of 48% to 52% from that point forward. So whatever the asset is yielding at that point will be what falls to the bottom-line and the stabilized numbers that Harry is speaking to at the 5.4 is what he is referencing. So that is the mechanics as to how that will play through the P&L over the life.", "John Kim", "And so the accretion really picks up once you exercise the options and is your preference right now is to exercise all the options on the properties or what\u2019s your view on the projects today?", "Tom Herzog", "Well, I think the benefit of having fixed option price is that when we get to that point and the property is stabilized, we can make a separate investment decision as to whether that option prices is a favorable and then make the decision at that time.", "Operator", "Next will be Dan Oppenheim with Zelman & Associates.", "Dan Oppenheim", "Was wondering about the increases on the renewals that you're talking about for May and June were you talking about the greatest increases in the West, it looks though there was a slight increase in turnover in some of the Western market where renewables were pushed a bit are you -- do you end up softening renewals based on turnover in any of the market how are you thinking about that in terms of how much you want to push the rents?", "Tom Toomey", "No we would not we really look at occupancy and generate the highest NOI based on rent increases turnover and things like that and what we\u2019ve seen as we pushed rates in places like Seattle, for example you\u2019ve pointed out. We had renewals of 7.4% in the first quarter, they went up to 8% in the month of April and turnover at 43% is not dramatically up from a 38%. But when I can reload it at 6.1% on new lease rate growth, I am okay with that trade-off. Our job is to increase the value of the real estate, and we believe we have to do it by driving rate growth by really whatever means is necessary and if you get to a point where you're having to dramatically cut new lease rate growth because you have pushed too many people out the back door that would tell me I am pushing too hard.", "But I am still able to get to 6.1% in Seattle. I've got occupancy today in Seattle that's north of 97%, place like Portland where it also increased 40 -- turnover increased 46%, we have 9% renewal growth and 8.1% new lease rate growth and my renewal growth in the month of April was 10 and my new lease rate growth was 12. That tells there is opportunity to do it. Sometimes people are moving because it\u2019s a transient workforce and when you look at places in the West, a lot or people have relocated from other markets, especially in the Millennials that are going to the West for the job opportunities. And they\u2019re just going to jump around a little bit more. So, we\u2019re not overly concerned with that today.", "Dan Oppenheim", "And then secondly wondering about the -- so The Wolff joint venture and just thinking about development overall here in the -- at this point in the cycle, given sort of what has happened in terms of the upward move in rents or in such couple of years, will you look for more opportunities to participate in development this way or a potentially putting a shorter time between putting the capital and sort of having building in lease-up than it would be if you were buying land given the land appreciation to the risk at this time?", "Tom Herzog", "Yes this is Herzog again. I\u2019ll start and let Harry pick up behind me. We still feel that if we pencil development deals in general, we're still targeting 150 to 200 basis point spread over market rates and we still see plenty of deals that meet those standard and that\u2019s true that not as many deals pencil today as might have penciled a year or two ago. But when we look at The Wolff deal, one of the things we really like is it is a much shorter period to stabilization because these projects are already well half underway and so we reach the goal a lot sooner. So as we think about this relative to our pipeline of 900 million to 1.4 billion with anticipated deliveries, of call it 350 million a year or $350 million of your spend. This ties in very much to the strategic plan that we have -- we\u2019ve previously communicated. So this definitely falls in line with the game plan that we\u2019ve had around development. Harry, anything you'd add to that?", "Harry Alcock", "No and I think you touched on it, that one of the things we looked at and liked about The Wolff transaction is that the initial deliveries whereas in a typical development deal when you are three or four years out from the time you start the planning process in The Wolff transaction initial deliveries are 11 or 12 months from now and stabilization follows about a year later so Wolff does get us there much more quickly.", "Operator", "And next will be Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.", "Rich Anderson", "So, I just want to make sure I understand that with 900 million to 1.4 billion of target range in your development that\u2019s just what you got now plus Wolff is that right?", "Tom Herzog", "Yes, what we have now plus Pacific City plus Wolff.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay. And regarding Wolff you said the all-in stabilized yield is estimated five if you pull the trigger on acquiring assets, does that mean you\u2019re buying a low four on the actual incremental deal because you\u2019re getting the 6.5 to start with?", "Tom Herzog", "No I think the math is, it\u2019s a, the 6.5 doesn\u2019t come into play in terms of calculating the stabilized yield. If you take the 5.4% that we\u2019re going to achieve for the first 48% it would be a mid for us for the incremental 52%. So we are assuming we acquired all five proprieties we\u2019d be somewhere in that 5% or low 5% range. That includes property tax reassessment in the California property so that sort of diluted the return somewhat but that\u2019s fully incorporated into the underwriting and the reality is that if we sell the property or two loan exercise on all of them and to monetize those gains and apply it against the retain fees that we would be at somewhere in the mid fives. And when we\u2019re talking about underwriting, we\u2019ve underwrote these things in a fairly conservative manner. We\u2019ve assumed revenue growth of roughly 3% per year for the next couple of years through stabilization.", "Rich Anderson", "So the total price is 597, right and that includes 136 that you\u2019re getting a 6.5% return on. So I can\u2019t imagine how the number is for the incremental amount above the 136 isn\u2019t something below five to get to an average an all-in average of five?", "Tom Herzog", "Rich, the 136, I\u2019ll say the same thing Harry said a little different though. The 136 million based on that going in price is -- comes in at a 5.4.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay, that actually, okay, I got you. All right, yes I got it.", "Tom Herzog", "I want to be real clear, and I\u2019d probably answer your question but just one other item to clarify. When we acquire the remaining portion that we don\u2019t own for those assets that we chose to exercise the option. You got to look at that as just we\u2019re acquiring at that point a new stabilized asset for that additional purchase price.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay.", "Tom Herzog", "So, when Harry speaks to the mid 4s that is on a stabilized asset.", "Rich Anderson", "And then Jerry, I can hear you\u2019re chomping a bit to say that DC has recovered but I mean is there any talk about adding to your investment thesis in DC at this point before we really recovers I mean whether it would be development or looking for assets or just nothing there right now that pencils for you at this point?", "Jerry Davis", "I\u2019ll start it to Harry in a second. One thing I will tell you Rich is, we\u2019ve been going and looking at opportunities to do renovation properties and we are in the midst of one out in the Fairfax County right now underwriting it with a hopeful start later this year when we think we can do some value-add. We also have some more modest renovation opportunities inside the Beltway but I know Harry has been looking at product inside the Beltway and I will let him give an update on that.", "Harry Alcock", "And Rich if you think about sort of a development strategy that we\u2019ve talked about historically it\u2019s a deal that we\u2019re going to have sort of one property under construction in each market at any given time. So as we for example finish our Pier 4 deal in Downtime Boston we just recently acquired a land site and in the south then with the expectation that we\u2019re going to start next year. As it applies to DC we have our DelRay property that is where we have completed construction and are in the midst of lease-up. Our hope and expectation would be that at some point in the near future that we have a new DC development asset that we can start to construct and we\u2019re actively sourcing those opportunities now.", "Operator", "And next will be Nick Yulico with UBS.", "Nick Yulico", "And Tom I was hoping to get a couple of questions on the guidance. What is the reason for interest expense now going down versus your prior guidance and can you just remind us the capitalized interest you expect this year?", "Tom Toomey", "Yes hi Nick, we took it from 1.25 to 1.30 down to 1.20 to 1.25, and just a couple of items on that, most of it\u2019s due to the delay in the bonds issuance. Just based on timing that we previously had in the plan and we\u2019re comfortable at this point pushing that back to the, towards the latter half of the second quarter. And a little bit of timing on cap interest on one of should development assets. So that's what makes up that difference. And as to cap interest, I could add it up out of the -- I want to say it\u2019s like $5 million of quarter. That's just from memory. I think that's right, but I can add it up and you can call me after the call if you like and I can verify that. But I think it's in that range.", "Nick Yulico", "Okay. Got it, thanks. And then just going back to the Wolff joint venture, can you just talk about why it sort of made sense to -- if you guys have been citing 150 to 200 business points as a spread on development in this deal, at the end of the day it's going to be 50 to 125 basis points. Why it\u2019s only made sense to take that lower spread and then just I guess separate from that on the future met life JV development, is that also sort of a lower spread than where you guys are doing stuff from balance sheet?", "Harry", "This is Harry. I think the whole question -- we view this really as a hybrid between an acquisition and a pure development. So if you think about it long kind of the risk return spectrum, you start all the way to the left where you have a fully occupied or nearly fully occupied property and operating results that are well known at a kind of a fore cap rate for these types of assets. And then you take it all the way to a pure development where the results won't be known from three years to four years from the time they just started sort of the designed process and go through the construction and lease up period and have full risk on construction and as well as lease up -- it didn't get somewhere in the 6% plus return on that when Wolff fell right in the middle where we'll be in the fives. We'll start initial occupancy in a year. Our partner has all construction and cost risk and so it really is a hybrid. In addition, rather than having the drag associated with the pure development deal, we did 6.5% coupon on our invested capital through the construction and lease up period.", "Oh I'm sorry, the second part of the question was MetLife. So the main Mountain View property that we just started, we haven\u2019t talked about returns, but that property we would expect to be at the very high end of our 150 to 200 basis points spread, probably above that. We have a couple other properties that could start in the MetLife portfolio later this year, two in LA and possibly a new phase at the [indiscernible] and we're still working through the design and the economics of those assets and we'll talk about it at the time but then we get there. The 3033 Wilshire deal that we started last year, again we would expect to be at the high end of our 150 to 200 basis points spread on the market cap rates, but we'll talk about that more as we get closer to completion. ", "Operator", "And the next question will come from Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.", "Alex Goldfarb", "I guess we'll continue the Wolff. So maybe this is for Warren. On the deal, the Wolff Company has the right to get a 6.5% preferred equity if you guys don't buy at least two of the five deals. The economics would seem punitive to you guys if you didn't. So apart from providing them comfort with here -- that you guys will take at least two of the deals, what are other reasons why you would not exercise that apart from obviously the market falling at or better, something like that?", "Tom Toomey", "Well. Alex, as Harry said, one of the things we really like is that we have the option and the ability to look once we get to the utilization and once we get to our window and we can look at the properties, making new investments and deciding which one we'd like. Wolff, one of the two of five which are really just to give them some comfort that we were going to perform, but as we said to one of your earlier questions, we initially started with 10 properties and went through the investment analysis and the joint venture hopefully will be safe towards the process negotiating for one final property. So I think from a real estate -- I think perspective Jerry and Harry feel very comfortable with the six that we have in the JV, and like I said, we'll be able to make that decision at the option time.", "Alex Goldfarb", "Okay. And then Tom Herzog, on the ATM in the press release and your comments, you mentioned the stock trading above NAV. Yes, above consensus NAV. Looking at SNL, the NAV right is around $33. At year end it was $31.50. You guys issued at like $32 - $30 gross or $31.16 set. So one, sounds dilutive to where or below where consensus NAV is. But second is a lot of companies talk about that chain, the issuance of the ATM, what they use, and I didn't hear you guys talk about it, but maybe that's the way you look at it. So should we expect that every time your stocks trades above $32 you guys are issuing ATM or is it truly a face of where you have investment opportunity that's above your implied cap rate than your issuing?", "Tom Toomey", "Okay, multiple questions there. Let me see if I can get them all. The first question was we issued at a net price on the $109 million at $31.64. That\u2019s correct. You got to remember we were issuing most of that at the very beginning of 2015. So the lease of January 6, January 12, that\u2019s when the majority of it occurred. So when we think of an average of what the consensus NAV was at that time, and you guys will recall that early in the year that NAV started to move fairly quickly. We had an average consensus NAV during the issuance period during the same time they were issuing these shares of $31.07. So on a net basis we came in at $31.64 and the consensus NAV was $31.07.", "I think the second question was, you note that we utilized the ATM -- I would -- and if our price exceeds that which allows us to issue at or above what we continue to do so, what I would reference back is the remarks that I made in the first quarter call when we spoke to our different uses of funds, which are set forth in that trader [ph] strategic document where we had development cost, we had certain acquisitions, spend and so we sort of bucket of funding needs for the year and we spoke to three sources that we would fund them with; and that was issuance of stock, sales of assets and debt. And we have executed to that as we had indicated we would and we said that we would identify what we thought the most favorable sources of funds to fund our needs and we have done that and we\u2019ll continue to do that.", "As we look at where we stand today after picking up the various fundings that we\u2019ve already completed, I guess it\u2019s probably important for me to remind you that a good portion has already been funded. We\u2019ve tweaked our guidance a little bit on attachment 15, but the changes are not major. You will see that when you compare the old attach from 15 to the new which provides our guidance. And we have already funded a 109 -- we started with a need of $825 million. ROE, it has adjusted for the latest adjustments. We funded 109 in the ATM. The Texas JV brought in 43. We\u2019ve got sales under contract of 65 and we\u2019ve got more out there that will go under contract. We\u2019ve got 300 million of debt that I\u2019ve already alluded to that will likely come in at the end of the second quarter. And what that really means is we\u2019ve got about $250 million to $300 million remaining for the entire year, which is a relatively small number for us as you know and we continue to state that we will use the most advantageous funding source for that purpose.", "Operator", "And then next will be Ian Weissman with Credit Suisse.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This is Chris for Ian. Monterey and Portland are essentially non-core markets that continue to generate very strong rent growth and have occupancy over 97, and I think in Portland\u2019s case 98%. Obviously when rent growth was increasing in the high single digit, it lowers the urgency to sell, but just curious about your thoughts about market timing or whether you\u2019re more like performance agnostic when it comes to exiting out of those markets?", "Jerry Davis", "This is Jerry. I guess I would start with -- you\u2019re correct. These two non-core markets are performing extremely well. And I would remind people that when you do look at our non-core markets, it\u2019s not always because they\u2019re underperformers. They just don\u2019t meet our strategic initiatives and plan. And I think at times it\u2019s best to actually exit a market when it\u2019s at the top. So in a second Harry will give you an update on some of the transactions that he is looking at in those markets. But today the operating teams are doing an extremely good job and markets that have good fundamentals. But again they don\u2019t fit our core strategic focus of these gateway markets that are bicoastal. Even though they\u2019re in the coast, our preference would still be for Seattle over Portland.", "And while the Monterey Peninsula market has done extremely well, the average rents in that market are fairly low. It caters more to an agricultural economy. And longer term we grow their CR assets in some of the other markets in the West Coast or East Coast but when you think about San Francisco, Seattle, Orange County, LA, a more comfortable long term.", "Harry Alcock", "This is Harry. I think I\u2019d just add that we will continue to chip away at these properties to meet our sales objectives, to just give you kind of an overview of the properties that we\u2019re working on now. We have two properties that are in central Florida that are under contract, one in Tampa, one in Orlando. And to your point on Portland, we have one of our three assets in Portland that's currently in the market. We\u2019re getting terrific investor interest and would expect to close that sometime in the third quarter.", "Unidentified Analyst", "So it sounds like you have a mix of assets out to market regardless of how those markets are performing. Now that you\u2019re said that you\u2019re kind of more -- you would tend more to sell assets that are performing well than those that are kind of laggard, is that kind of what I am hearing?", "Tom Toomey", "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what I -- if I said it, I didn\u2019t mean it in that context. What I was saying is just because a market is performing well, we\u2019re not going to hold on to it ride out strong NOI growth and wait till it starts to go on a down cycle. Jerry can get optimal pricing when there is still some upside opportunity. So we don\u2019t wait till the market is about to turn south to mark it for sale. That's what I meant to say.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And then I apologize if I missed this, but revenue growth came in at 5.1% for the first quarter. It sounds like things are accelerating over the last month. And then guidance is up 4.25 to 4.75. Just wondering where the drop is going to come from?", "Tom Toomey", "It's really occupancy. You look at the two components that really drive revenue growth, one is change in occupancy, the other is change in rent per occupied home. And then the first quarter it was 60 basis points of occupancy growth year-over-year and 4.6% growth in rents. We will most likely not have the opportunity in last three quarters of the year to see that same occupancy growth since we pushed occupancy last year up starting in 2Q to the high 96 levels. So it's predominantly going to come from rent growth. That being said, if I had to look at it today based on the trends, we\u2019re probably moving more to the middle to high side of our guidance number, then we are too below.", "Operator", "And next will be Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Jordan Sadler", "So just curious -- I'm coming back to Wolff one more time. Can you offer price versus development cost to Wolff? I'm curious about how the 559 compares versus their basis and ultimately sort of the premium replacement cost here?", "Tom Toomey", "I\u2019ll start with that Jordan. I think -- I don\u2019t know that we have the -- I know that we don\u2019t have the exact -- their exact cost numbers. Suffice to say this a premium to the resisting cost, but I think I'd point to that the 559 is $357,000 per apartment home and the 597 is prudent to be exercised the options on over -- and the remaining 52% on all five properties is $380,000 per apartment home. So neither of those are numbers that are alarming over the field, particularly rolled us from a new construction standpoint.", "Jordan Sadler", "And I guess there was a previous question surrounding this I think regarding the motivation of this at this point. As you guys are pointing to potentially $80 million of value creation, it seems like a pretty short window to get there. I think we\u2019re talking about lease-up commencing in as little as seven months for some of these. Can you maybe sort of talk about what the trigger might have been or why there is this opportunity for that amount of value creation in this relative to 136 million of principal in this shorter window of time in this environment?", "Tom Toomey", "So Jordan, the way that I think about it is rather than pointing to $80 million of $136 million, we get the point to $80 million on $597 million which is the total aggregate purchase price assuming we acquire all five assets. But what Wolff gets is -- again, I think I mentioned at the beginning of the call they get -- first they get return capital to their open ended fund, which is favorable for them, I assume on then assume many levels including the fact that they get to redeploy these assets.", "And secondly, Wolff has a robust pipeline of additional opportunities. In their minds they were over allocated on the development side to both Southern California and to Seattle and therefore they we having just sort of forego other opportunities. So from their perspective they get a couple of -- there is a couple of significant benefits to that.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This is [indiscernible] here. I had just one quick one as well. Jerry you may have touched on in a bit at the end of the last question, but given sort of where you guys finished in the first quarter, both top-line growth and same store NOI, and the accelerating trends you\u2019ve seen really into May and June, what\u2019s kind of held you back on raising the same-store growth even higher?", "Jerry Davis", "I guess just caution as we go further into the leasing season, and again we have visibility into June during the months of the third quarter you got another 30% of the properties, the leases that will reprised. Today again I am more optimistic that we're going to push towards the high-end than I am to the low end, but we have another couple of quarters later this year to take a look at it. But today I can\u2019t tell you anything that I see that's excessively negative.", "Operator", "And next will be Rob Stevenson with [indiscernible].", "Rob Stevenson", "No Wolff questions I promise. Just two quick ones here, Jerry how many projects or dollar value do you think you're going to put into the redevelopment pipeline this year?", "Jerry Davis", "We anticipate -- and these will all be later in the year. We anticipate --three to seven would be my estimate. There will probably be a handful of those that are in the $15 million to $20 million range, and then some that will be under $10 million. So you\u2019re not going to see any -- I believe we had guidance Tom for a redevelopment. So what was that number?", "Tom Toomey", "The spend is somewhere -- that's going to be as adjusted about $350 million for the year. That\u2019s development [indiscernible]", "Jerry Davis", "But we don\u2019t see any of the redevelopments we\u2019re anticipating right now Rob being of the size of some of the ones we've done over the last couple of years.", "Rob Stevenson", "Okay. So it\u2019s going to be less than $100 million of incremental assets going in there if I'm just using fixed project at $50 million gives me $90 million or something in that neighborhood will be the sort of upper end you think?", "Tom Toomey", "I think it\u2019s less than that I can\u2019t say it\u2019s probably more enough 50 range at the high end.", "Rob Stevenson", "Okay. ", "Tom Toomey", "And that would be start this year. A lot of the spend would actually be next year. ", "Rob Stevenson", "Okay. And then Tom Herzog. Just a quick one. With the $0.03 gap between FFO and FFO as adjusted in the first quarter, when I look at the full year announcement, does that mean that you're at this point not including anything else that would be a gap a between FFO and FFO as adjusted for the last three quarters.", "Tom Herzog", "Right.", "Rob Stevenson", "Okay.", "Tom Herzog", "Nothing of any significance. You can see that the couple of odds and ends in the -- attached from \u201815, but all the big stuff would be passed, which was really the Texas JV promote and dispo fee. ", "Operator", "And next will be Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.", "Haendel St. Juste ", "So I guess first for you Mr. Herzog, quick one on capital allocation. Help me understand the decision to raise the dividend by 7% during the quarter while you\u2019re selling about 109 million stock in your ATM. Is there after-tax issue or something I'm not fully appreciating there?", "Tom Herzog", "No, we just looked at our coverage, we looked at the growth of our AFFO, and as we\u2019ve lined out the last couple of three years, we wanted our dividend growth to largely reflect our AFFO growth. So nothing has changed on that front. It wasn\u2019t the tax issue. And we'll contaminate that as we think forward the next couple of years, as you look at our plan too, you\u2019ll see that our dividend growth coincides with our AFFO growth.", "Haendel St. Juste ", "Okay. And now that you fully liquidated the Texas JV with Fannie Mae, can share what the IRR was? We felt a cap rate of about 6% on recent sales assets but curious what the return of the likely investment was?", "Tom Herzog", "The all in IRR on it was 14%. ", "Haendel St. Juste ", "That\u2019s levered?", "Tom Herzog", "Yes.", "Haendel St. Juste ", "Okay. And you guys mentioned the four assets you chose not to pursue with Wolff. I\u2019m not sure if I missed it or not, but did you mention why you weren\u2019t pursuing those? Perhaps they were markets you don\u2019t want to exposure to? Was it a size issue? Maybe you don\u2019t want to take too big of a portfolio? Can you give me some sense as to you opted not to pursue the other four?", "Harry", "Haendel, this is Harry, -- take on the quality of the assets and their specific submarkets.", "Haendel St. Juste", "Okay. Last one, Jerry on Seattle -- recently the supply that hit downtown Seattle was -- you absorbed without much of impact. But now the fund shift over to Belvieu which is a much smaller submarket and some forecast suggest that Belvieu might -- they're seeing a 20% expense ratio on supply over the next couple years. And given that Belvieu is where you and a couple of your peers are effectively concentrated, curious on -- I guess you still have good pricing product today but your expectations for the market over the course of this year into next, thoughts on perhaps operating strategy. And would you guys perhaps consider culling some of your portfolio there, especially given not only the supply outlook but you guys acquired it looks like two asset, the Wolff link up.", "Jerry Davis", "We like Belvieu very much. Now there is job growth continuing that there even though Expedia is moving their headquarters over to Seattle from Belvieu we think it will get refurnished within downtown Belvieu which is a growing and vibrant city to be honest with you. We continue to see revenue growth so far this year north of 6%. We have a very high end A portfolio there, although as you stated there is significant new supply that is coming to that market. We think Belvieu caters a lot of the east side job centers, whether it\u2019s Microsoft or downtown Belvieu, or Google employers on the east side. I don\u2019t think we would be looking to downsize Belvieu. Two of our deals are MetLife JVs and then very high end we have the Element Steels which -- they're extremely well with the workforce in Belvieu and we have one property down in the downtown area Belvieu that's only about 80 units. That typically does very well although this year as you noted it surrounded by supply and it\u2019s probably suffering the most with revenue growth that\u2019s roughly flat compared to the 6% or 7% to the rest of that sub market.", "The two deals that we did we get in the Wolff transaction related to this are ones in Salt lake [ph] Union, which we're excited to have one downtown presence. Currently we really have one 50-5o JV deal with Met down there. That's probably the best property in all of downtown Seattle. This property provides us with -- I think of it is a dormitory for Amazon workers. It' surrounded right in the middle of the Amazon campus. So I think that is going to do extremely. And then other deal is then Columbia city which is probably 5 - 6 miles south of the downtown area. The thing we like most about that property is it's right on the LiveRail. It's directly across street and it's in an emerging neighborhood that we think has a ton of upside growth. And what we really like about that -- because a lot of our portfolio in Seattle is a product, this is a price point is about 65% to 70% of what downtown rents are. So it's a great alternative to those people that want to want to have more of an urban feel but can't afford downtown Seattle. So I know it's at long question about Seattle but we are very bullish on Seattle. You're right. That city, [indiscernible] new supply but the job growth was more than sufficient and we continue to be very excited about really growing our exposure in that market.", "Operator", "And next will be Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.", "Michael Salinsky", "Just to go back to Wolff a little fast, the assets you guys are requiring, are those in the same fund? And then as you look at Wolff -- obviously MetLife being a long term joint venture, I think you've characterized their [indiscernible] joint venture as an intermediate term. How would you characterize the Wolff joint venture?", "Unidentified Company Representative ", "Michael, t Wolff assets are all in one fund. And then as you know on this one it has a finite life. It's less than six years, and [indiscernible] periods start in this second year. So this is a lot different than what we have in terms of long term MetLife count joint venture.", "Michael Salinsky", "Alright. It's helpful. Then my follow up question, G&A guidance went up for the quarter and you brought in your corporate headquarters. Why -- I would have thought buying that in what have actually reduced unit. What was the reason for the G&A increase?", "Unidentified Company Representative ", "But we had the increased performance and FFO which impacted the LTI plan. And so that's what the net increases over time.", "Operator", "And next will be Drew Bewin [ph] with Robert W. Baird and Company.", "Unidentified Analyst ", "Hi, guys. It's actually for you Jerry, on the Marina del Rey concentration in Los Angeles. I was hoping you could talk about the growth in that area and what ultimately kind of gets that market out of the --and how the flattish environment -- it's then persisting and furthermore maybe talk about other operational improvements you're making elsewhere on the west coast to improve growth just beyond what the market is providing and to win more of those markets.", "Jerry Davis", "Sure. Yeah start on Marina del Rey, and as you pointed out, it has struggled. Our revenue growth -- this quarter my expectation will be the lowest in the sector at 3.8%. About 80 to 90% of our same store portfolio is in the Marina and when you look at the Marina it has been hit with new supplies down at Playa Vista which an adjacent sub markets, your buying company and several other operators have been building there over the last couple of years. And while it struggled last year and this year, our expectation is that as you get into 2016 and 2017, when the sliver comp [ph] beach really starts cranking out the jobs which are projected to be probably about 10,000, whether it's Google, Yahoo, [indiscernible], several other tech employers are coming to that sub market. We think our proximity to the jobs is going to more than offset what's been hurting us with our proximity to the new supply. So it's just a situation where the supply beat the jobs, and we would expect in 2016 and 2017 to see that get quite a bit better.", "As far as initiatives in the west coast, we were really run the same initiatives, whether it's east coast or west coast. One thing we have been doing down in our Orange County portfolio is investing some revenue enhancing dollars which Herzog requires and we comply with getting a 200 basis points over [indiscernible] IRR, which typically is about a 20% return on your money. But we're looking for opportunities to upgrade those 40 plus year old properties that we've maintained well but we haven\u2019t improved the functionality since we bought a lot of those assets back in the mid-2000s. So they were due and we've been putting some of that $30 million or so that we get guidance, revenue enhancing dollars since beginning the year. It's heavily growing into the west coast. As you look up into the San Francisco area where we had 9% revenue growth, on a situation there honestly as we don't have anything in the east bay, the downtown area, the jobs are coming, again commonly but I said about the Marina del Rey area. The financial district is going to have significant job growth over the next couple of years but that's also where the new supply is coming. We are fairly heavy in that some area. And then up in in Seattle, I think about 80% of our portfolio up there is a product, and even though new supply haven\u2019t hurt it too much, it has had an impact on it. So no real new initiatives, although we are looking for opportunities like I said in So-Cal to reinvest even more in our real estate to give our residents some of the things they\u2019re looking for.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And one follow up, shifting to the East Coast, as you look at markets like Boston and New York where obviously condos in the city are very pricey, people are -- they want to be in the city. Renting is still the most attractive option. Given the public transportation systems of both of those markets, there is always options that somebody really wants to get out if they\u2019re willing to spend like commute to save money. Are you seeing anything in those markets, whether it\u2019d move outs to buy ratios or sort of where people are interested in renting? It would indicate that there is some potential rent fatigue there.", "Jerry Davis", "We think our renting demographic wants to be in that urban core, and they have various things they have to spend money on. And when you\u2019re living in urban core, you get to cut down on your transportation cost, which can run upwards of $1,000 and they just make trade-offs. But that younger demographic that we\u2019re typically focused on in those urban markets have a high preference to be in the downtown locations, their entertainment, their jobs. And you'll always get few people that will move out to the next ring, whether it's in San Francisco going to Oakland, Manhattan going to Brooklyn or Jersey. Only one of those markets you brought up that I continue to see a fairly high new downtown purchases since the Boston market which historically since we benefited last three to four years has been one of our highest move out to home purchase markets at over 20%.", "Operator", "And next will be Connor Wagner with Greenstreet Advisors.", "Connor Wagner", "Jerry on DC last quarter you provided some good commentary on the split between the deals outside of the Beltway, how they are performing in the Asian side of the Beltway. Just wondering if you could update that for the first quarter and placed in April?", "Jerry Davis", "Deals outside-inside, as I stated I think earlier on the call, they\u2019re starting to compress to where either it's a B or it's an A or it's inside or outside, they\u2019re all getting more to the point where they\u2019re averaging between 1% and 2%. So the differentiation is tightening. My As actually were at about 1.9% revenue growth during the quarter and my B\u2019s we\u2019re about 1.2%. So the A\u2019s actually did pick up. And again I think that was because they had more supply pressure last year for concessions. We\u2019re keeping the price down. And honestly what\u2019s been interesting for the same reason is my urban product which is more of the inside of the Beltway, and revenue growth of high twos and my suburban was just slightly negative. So we kind of have flipped a little bit where the suburban A is starting to pick up steam.", "Then when you look at how does April looked, in DC my new lease rate growth was 0.8% in April. That\u2019s probably if I look back the first time, that number has been positive in the last year and half. So it did go positive at 0.8 and my renewal growth in the month of April in DC, and these are effective numbers, is 5.6%. So DC is starting to look a lot more like the rest of the portfolio. It\u2019s getting there.", "Connor Wagner", "Thank you. And then last one Jerry, on Austin we\u2019ve seen job growth decelerate obviously at the high number over the last year. Have you seen any slowdown in your portfolio or between the properties that you have that are more within city limits versus the suburban ones?", "Jerry Davis", "Well, haven\u2019t really noticed the job growth slow as well as far as the performance of my properties we have seen our downtown product, which competes with new supply as a rough patch at times. We have another property up north at the domain shopping center where new supply is also effective, even though it's kind of in a tech corridor. So we like it long term. But Austin is definitely a market that has seen a slowdown from last year to this year just as absorption of that supply is occurring. Although Austin goes through these waves where you will have new supply grow 10%-12% over a three year period. It will be difficult three years but then as soon as they eat that up, it takes off again.", "So -- but Austin right now, I just told you the good news about DC accelerating. When I look at Austin my new lease rate growth in the month of April is negative 0.3%, and that compares to about 2%-2.5% in the first quarter. So, we are definitely feeling some pressure in Austin today.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I guess I had a couple of just quick questions going back to the Wolff transaction. You talked about certain guarantees. What are those guarantees?", "Tom Toomey", "Jerry, do you want to take that one?", "Jerry Davis", "I can\u2019t.", "Warren Troupe", "This is Warren. The completion guarantee is under the construction loan and certain other non-recourse bad void guarantees.", "Unidentified Analyst", "What are the total construction loans and what are the terms in terms of the amount and maturity date and rate?", "Warren Troupe", "The average price for construction loan is about 210 and the total amount of construction loans, it's about 275 million and our UDR share would be about $140 million. So of that 2017 maturities would be approximately $173 million, 2018 maturities would be $39 million. Of those UDR shares will be 84 million in 2017 and approximately $19 million and 2018. All construction loans have two-year extension feature.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And then the all-in construction cost that they guaranteed, I take it, it's like $400 million. Is that what you said to Jordan before?", "Harry Alcock", "No, we didn\u2019t talk about the all-in construction cost, Michael. This is Harry. ", "Unidentified Analyst", "So what is the all-in -- I guess the $275 million of debt, 70% LTV is $400 million. Is that a fair?", "Harry Alcock", "Yes, the number is probably higher than that but we didn\u2019t -- we don\u2019t have that handy and we didn\u2019t speak to the all-in construction cost start. Our buy in price is 559 million. So what we did say is that construction cost is below our volume price.", "Tom Toomey", "And you're right that the partner is responsible for all cost overruns and the guarantees on the construction loans.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Do you guys have any involvement in the lease-up? Do you have any share of responsibilities at all and or was it just all-in there?", "Tom Toomey", "We\u2019re actually going to be the property manager for each of the properties and Jerry\u2019s team will be doing the lease-up on the properties.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And what\u2019s the guarantee in terms of that they are not going to try cost at a higher margin and higher profit in terms of -- rather than being effectively a merchant builder in this case, what\u2019s going to be the recourse that you have to make sure whether [indiscernible] spent is in?", "Harry Alcock", "Michael its Harry. They are a required facility to the documents to build the property in accordance with the approved plans and specs. These properties are all in a construction. We\u2019ve reviewed the plans and specs of -- we\u2019re going to hire a third-party construction manager to participate in the weekly OAC meetings, constructions meetings and get weekly reports or monthly reports from Wolff. So we\u2019re going to have sort of kind of an active oversight rule in that process.", "Tom Toomey", "One other thing I would mention is part of the due diligence process, Harry's team have actually now look at existing Wolff product. So we\u2019re familiar with their construction, we\u2019re familiar with their product. We have teams now have been meeting the Wolff people and going through finishes, going through layouts and so I think we\u2019re pretty comfortable that we're going to have a very active role and a very active voice in this whole process.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And then your 6.5 preferred return -- that's a -- is it a pit payment or is it actually a cash payment from Wolff on your equity?", "Tom Toomey", "6.5 is going to get paid Michael at the end -- at the time that we take the asset out.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And does that include equity or is that actually a preferred payment? It's actually overturn or is it go towards your equity to buyout the next piece.", "Tom Toomey", "Yes, it's actually a return on our investment. It's compounded as we go.", "Unidentified Analyst", "So it's a real return. It's not \u2026", "Tom Toomey", "It's a real return.", "Tom Herzog", "And then just one other guarantee that Warren might have spoken to us, and I think we spoke earlier, but keep in mind at any operating losses during that development period are included by Wolff up to the point stabilization. So that\u2019s another form of guarantee from our perspective.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And then outside of refinancing the debt, you're payment to them when you -- when these stabilize to own 100% is just the $38 million additional of equity and then are you blaming now [ph] you would have to fund then do a refinancing?", "Tom Herzog", "Yes, that\u2019s correct. We\u2019ve got debt that comes due. There's some delay on that and take a two to three years out as these options become exercisable and that debt comes due -- we can choose to fund that -- whatever the most advantageous way is. And keep in mind too that if we choose not to acquire one or two of the assets, that that can also act towards the funding. But as we talking, but we would be looking at all five assets as having appeal from a purchase perspective, but we\u2019re through a place out on that.", "Unidentified Analyst", "But your total, if you're on 136, you have to fund the difference between the 136 and the 597 outside any debt loans?", "Tom Herzog", "That\u2019s correct, after the debt is still.", "Unidentified Analyst", "So whichever ones we acquire?", "Tom Herzog", "Correct.", "Operator", "And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll now turn the conference call back over to President and CEO Mr. Tom Toomey.", "Tom Toomey", "Well first let me say thank you for your time today. It was very productive. And we appreciate your interest in UDR. As we started the call business is great and bordering on fantastic. You can obviously hear from the call our level of enthusiasm for where operating trends are headed and the opportunities that lie ahead and we\u2019ll continue to execute on our two year plan and believe that that is a great path for UDR and for our shareholders. So with that take care and we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter. ", "Operator", "Thank you. And that does conclude today\u2019s conference. We do thank you for your participation today.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Shelby Noble. Please go ahead.", "Shelby Noble", "Thank you operator. Welcome to UDR\u2019s second quarter 2015 financial results conference call. Our second quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed yesterday afternoon and posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, www.udr.com. In this supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in accordance with Reg G requirements.", "I would like to note that statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although, we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in yesterday\u2019s press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake the duty to update any forward-looking statements.", "When we get to the question-and-answer portion, we ask that you'll be respectful of everyone's time and limit your questions and follow-ups. Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered.", "I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.", "Tom Toomey", "Thank you, Shelby and good afternoon everyone and welcome to UDR's second quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Tom Herzog, Chief Financial Officer and Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our results, as well as senior officers Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.", "The second quarter of 2015 was a busy and fruitful one for UDR. As we continue to execute on our two year strategic plan. This quarter was highlighted by favorable capital allocation and ongoing impressive operating results.", "As a result, we have again increased our full year same store growth and earnings guidance ranges. The following four topics highlight the second quarter.", "First, operations continue to accelerate throughout the second quarter with strong new lease and renewal rate growth leading to over 7% effective rent growth for the quarter. This is an increase of almost 300 basis points year-over-year and over 200 basis points ahead of the first quarter of 2015.", "Second, our development platform continues to perform very well. Our two communities in lease up the $218 million development in Boston seaport and $92 million participating loan Steele Creek development in Denver are well ahead of budgeted absorption and rent expectations. Including Steele Creek in the West Coast development joint venture projects, we will complete $310 million of accretive development in 2015 and $377 million in 2016. All of which will continue to drive cash flow and NAV growth.", "Third, we entered into an agreement to acquire up to $908 million of apartment communities in the Washington DC markets in conjunction with the announced merger between home properties and Lone Star funds. This transaction will allow us to increase our exposure to a recovering DC market at favorable pricing. It is consistent with our strategic plan as it will be immediately accretive to earnings, we will be able to issue OPE units at or above NAV and it improves our balance sheet metrics.", "And finally, we are increasing full year earnings guidance in same store growth ranges for the second time this year to reflect the strength evident in our operations. Since issuing initial guidance in February of 2015, we have increased revenue and NOI growth expectations at the midpoint by 125 and 175 basis points respectively. Additionally, we now expect full year FFO as adjusted growth to be close to 9% as compared to 6% at the start of the year.", "In short, we feel great about the reminder of 2015 and while it\u2019s early we think 2016 is lining up to be another great year for UDR.", "With that, I'd like to express my sincere thanks to all my fellow UDR Associates for their extraordinary work in producing another strong quarter of results. We look forward to continued success in 2015.", "And I'll now turn the call over to Tom.", "Tom Herzog", "Thanks Tom. The topics I will cover today include our second quarter results, our balance sheet update, our development update, recent transactions and our revised full year 2015 guidance.", "Our second quarter earnings results were at or above the upper end of our previously provided guidance ranges. FFO, the FFO was adjusted and AFFO per share $0.41, $0.42 and $0.38 respectively. This was primarily driven by better than expected second quarter same-store revenue, expense and NOI growth which was strong at 5.4%, 1.8% and 6.8% respectively. Jerry will provide additional color in his prepared remarks.", "Next the balance sheet. During the quarter we've received an upgrade from S&P to BBB plus. At quarter end, our financial leverage on an un-depreciated cost basis was 37.5%. On a fair value basis, it was 28%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA were 6.2 times an inclusive of pro rata JVs it was 7.1 times. All metrics continue to improve as we had anticipated in our strategic plan. At quarter end, our liquidity as measured by cash and credit facility was $446 million.", "Turning to development, we commence construction on our 516 home, $342 million specific city development at Huntington Beach, California. At quarter end, the pro rata share of our development pipeline totaled approximately $1.1 billion and our equity commitment was 69% funded. Currently, the estimated spread between stabilized yields and current market cap rates is at the top end of our targeted 150 to 200 basis points range. Additionally, our pro rata share of preferred equity and participating loan investments and West Coast development joint venture and Steele Creek totaled $363 million at quarter end and our equity commitment was 94% funded.", "As to future development, we continue to underwrite opportunities for the focus and we anticipate the size of our pipeline to remain in our targeted range of 900 million to a 1.4 billion. On to recent transactions, as previously announced in May, we closed on the West Coast development joint venture with the Wolff Company. We invested a 136 million or 48% interest in a portfolio of five communities that are currently under construction in our core coastal markets.", "Second, during the quarter, we announced an agreement was Lone Star and Home properties to acquire up to six communities valued at 908 million in recovering Washington DC markets. The terms of the transaction are dependent on the number of home OP unitholders converting to UDR common OP units which we will know next week.", "If all home OP unitholders convert to UDR common OP units the transaction will be funded through a combination of 753 million common OP units issued at $35 per unit, the assumption of $90 million of debt and $65 million in cash. This transaction is consistent with our strategic plan and provide several benefits. First, we\u2019re able to select from homes entire portfolio and choose the specific assets the net our investment. These assets include the four newly constructed originally redeveloped properties and two properties which redevelop an opportunities. With our best-in-class operating platform, we hope to generate operating efficiencies and the acquired assets and there could be additional upside for the properties which we developed in potential.", "Second, if all home OP unit holders convert to UDR common OP units, the transactional positively impact our 2016 - metrics with that two assets improving by up to 175 basis points and net debt to EBITDA improving by up to 0.2 times.", "Third, the transaction will be predominantly funded with OP units to issue the in line with NAV and will have no associated the issuance cost.", "Lastly, the transaction will be accretive to FFO, FFO was adjusted in AFFO by up to one and half cents per share depending on the number of units issued and the assets acquired. A fewer than 100% of the home OP unit holders are like to convert will have the option to acquire less than the fixed properties will alternatively acquire some of the properties can 31 exchanges.", "We will issue a spate press release when we determine the number of OP units we will issue. More details on each transactions can be found under the presentation section of our website www.udr.com.", "Finally, we sold three communities containing 812 homes in three separate markets Orlando, Tampa and Portland for approximately 110 million. Sales were transacted at weighted average cash flow cap rate of 5.7% at an average monthly revenue per occupied home of $1190 and were 30 years old on average on the third quarter and full year 2015 updated guidance. We increased our full year FFO, FFO was adjusted and AFFO guidance ranges for the second time this year due primarily to stronger than expected operations.", "Our FFO guidance range increased by a penny of the midpoint and FFO was adjusted in AFFO guidance ranges increased by $0.2 at the mid points. Full year 2015 FFO was adjusted and AFFO per share and now for cash at $1.64 and $1.68, $1.63 to $1.67 and $1.46 to $1.50 respectively. The same store would be have increased full year 2015 revenue growth guidance by 75 basis points as the mid-point to 5.0 to 5.5% expense growth is unchanged at 2.5% to 3% and our NOI growth forecast is increased to 100 basis points as the mid-point to 5.75 to 6.75%.", "The increases were driven by strong in new and renewal rate growth and stable occupancy. Third quarter 2015 FFO, FFO was adjusted in AFFO per share guidance to $0.39 to $0.41 and $0.34 to $0.36 respectively. Other primary full year guidance assumptions can be found on attachment 15 or page 28 of our supplement.", "Finally, in the second quarter, we declared a quarterly common dividend of 27.75 per share or $1.11 per share when annualized. 7% above 2014 level and representing yield of approximately 3.3%.", "With that I'll turn the call over to Jerry.", "Jerry Davis", "Thanks, Tom and good afternoon. In my remarks, I\u2019ll cover the following topics; first, our second quarter portfolio metrics, leasing trends and the rental rate growth we realized this quarter and an overview of our current operating strategy. Second, the performance of our core markets during the quarter and last a brief update on our development lease-ups and redevelopment progress. We are pleased to announce another stronger quarter of operating results.", "In the second quarter our same-store per occupied home increased by 5.3 percent year-over-year to $1,703. Occupancy was up 10 basis points to 96.9%, this lead to second quarter revenue growth of 5.4%. Our total portfolio revenue per occupied home at quarter end was $1,885 and close to JV's and armature homes. Our revenue growth for the first half of the year was 5.2% year-over-year as a result of a 4.9% increase in revenue per occupied home and an occupancy game of 30 basis points. As Tom mentioned earlier we increased our full year revenue guidance range to 5% to 5.5%.", "Our strategy this year has been to drive rate growth which will benefit both 2015 just importantly 2016. In the first half of 2015 we experienced the slight increase in occupancy compared to 2014. For the second half of the year we expect the same occupancy pick up. We are focused on continuing interest rate which will benefit 2016 revenue and NOI growth. That being said we still expect to maintain occupancy levels in the mid 96% range.", "Turning to new and renewal lease rate growth which is detailed on Attachment 8-E of our supplement. Our ability to push new lease rate growth continued to outpace historical precedent during the second quarter by wide margin, we grew in the lease rates by 7.7% in the second quarter, a full a full 410 basis point ahead of the second quarter of 2014. Renewal growth also remained robust at 7.0% in the second quarter or 150 basis points ahead of last year. In July, these trends continued with new lease and renewal rate growth of 7.8% and 7.3% respectively. The strength in pricing and demand served us the primary driver of our sizable 75 basis point increase in the same-store revenue at the midpoint or 125 basis points from our initial guidance provided in February.", "Second quarter expense growth of 1.8% came in on plan and brings our year-to-date growth 2.1%, for the full year we still expect the expenses to increase 2.75% which implied second half growth is more than 3%. In the third quarter we will begin seeing the phase out before 21G real estate tax payments at our two properties in the financial district in New York City. The expense related to these two properties in the second half of 2015 will be $375,000. Real estate taxes in general tended to be the expense line to con-fluctuate the most ever the make of our plan.", "Moving on to quarterly performance in our primary markets. These markets represent 66% of our same-store NOI and 72% of our total NOI. Orange County and Los Angeles combined represent 17% of our total NOI. Orange County posted year-over-year revenue growth of 6% and is outperforming versus our budget expectations thus far in 2015. Our Los Angeles portfolio posted strong second quarter revenue growth of 6.0% and acceleration over the 3.8% revenue recorded in the first quarter and we expect full year same-store growth to be right around 6% NOI.", "Although, the portfolio is concentrated in the Marina Del Rey and Playa Vista submarket which continue to be impacted by new supply. We are seeing new jobs enter the market which is an encouraging sign for 2016. Company such as Facebook, Google, Yahoo and Microsoft are all taking up space in the Playa Vista submarket with hundreds of smaller startups getting up shop along the coast from Santa Monica to Playa Vista. As we indicated a couple a years ago, the jobs are finally coming to this growing tech hub in Southern California. New York City represents 13% of our total NOI. We saw revenue growth of 5.7% year-over-year in New York and expect full year revenue growth to be in the mid 5s. We continue to benefit from our B quality portfolio in the New York City submarket and are encouraged by the 600 basis point reduction in turnover year-over-year. We believe this is primarily due to low home affordability as the reason to move out for home purchase is less than 5%. We continue to see a long runway of growth potential in our New York City portfolio.", "Metro DC which represents 13% of our total NOI posted year-over-year same store revenue growth of 2.1%. We are forecasting full year revenue growth of just under 2% in 2015. Job growth is returning and then some sub markets supply everything. The best performing sub markets for us in the quarter were on down - circle sub market in Capital Hill. We will continue to benefit from our diverse 50-50 mix of A and B assets located both inside and outside the beltway. We released rates in July or coming in a 2% renewals are over 4%.", "San Francisco, which represents nearly 12% of our total NOI continues to show no signs of slowing down have seen by revenue growth of 9.3% in the quarter. New lease rates growth to-date July is 15.3% and renewals are at 10.5%. Our results were mixed cross our sub markets. Santa Clara properties posted revenue growth in north of 12% a property along with Peninsula strong revenue growth of 10% in our south of market properties which are competing against new supply came in at 6%. We're seeing a wide spread in performance between As and Bs with Bs outperforming As quarter by 270 basis points.", "Seattle which represents 6.7% of our total NOI posted 6.1% revenue growth in the quarter. Our portfolio continue to benefit from the strong flow inherent in our suburban B asset those located in rent and North Seattle which are sub markets that are less exposed to new supply.", "Long-term continue to like to Downtown Seattle sub market as evidenced by recent post development joint venture transaction and believe that the ongoing creation of jobs by companies such as Amazon, Facebook, and Expedia will continue to drive demand in Seattle\u2019s urban core. Boston which represents over 5% of our total NOI put a 5.5% revenue growth in the second quarter despite new supply pressure downtown. Our South Shore properties continue to see the least amount of new supply pressure followed by our North Shore downtown properties.", "Last, Dallas which represents just over 4.5% of our NOI posted 4.6% year-over-year same store revenue growth in the second quarter. Our Addison properties carried this market up Plano and Central Dallas lagged due to new supply that we expect we'll continue for the remainder of 2015.", "For the full year, we expect revenue growth to modestly accelerate from our second quarter results and coming around 5%.", "I'll turn now to our in-lease up developments, which you can find on attachments 9A and 9B or pages 21 and 22 of our supplements. And we recently completed redevelopment in 34. Our pro rata shares of these three properties represents over 400 - 100 tier 4 are 369 home $218 million development in Boston Seaport district with 69% leased and 57% occupied at quarter end and today its 81% leased and 65% occupied. The first move-ins in mid-March we are well ahead of our expectations on both rate and leasing volume. Asking rates a day of 477 per square ahead of our original underwriting of 430 per square foot. Currently we are leasing about 35 homes per month when the expected stabilized occupancy of 90% by October of this year.", "Steele Creek are 218 home participating loan investment of the Cherry Creek sub market of Denver its currently 60% leased and 45% physically occupied. The property is achieving rents in the 330 per square foot range versus initial underwriting with about 310 a foot. For the past two months our leasing velocity is averaging almost 30 applications per month.", "34, our 739 home $98 million redevelopment in the Murray Hills neighborhood New York City its currently over 97% occupied and has been over 90% occupied for the prior fourth quarters. We have $3 million remaining to spend as we complete the roof top potentially the elevator banks are given stabilized occupancy we re-muted from your redevelopment schedule on the supplement this quarter. As a reminder it will be added to our same store pool in the first quarter of 2015.", "As we sit here today I can tell you that July results came in well ahead of plan thanks to our physical occupancy today is 96.5%. The new growth in August is projected to be roughly the same levels they were in July at 7.3% and leasing remained strong. If we continued pricing power stable occupancies in almost all of our markets these factors leave us very confident for the remainder of 2015. More importantly the impact from our rate increases today will be the catalyst for what we believe to be another strong year in 2016.", "With that I will open up the call to Q&A operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go to our first question from Nick Joseph with Citigroup.", "Nick Joseph", "Just two quick operating questions for DC, you mentioned improvement in the results in the job growth if there\u2019s talk of supply picking up again, what\u2019s the markets you think that supply could most likely come to and if the supply doesn\u2019t categorize do you think DC could accelerate from here?", "Jerry Davis", "I\u2019ll start with that and turn it over to Harry about the sub markets where the new supply is coming. We actually as you said Nick we\u2019ve seen acceleration, we think we bottomed in four quarter of last year. As we look out to 2016 our expectation is revenue growth is going to accelerate from the roughly 2% that we\u2019re expecting this year. we look at what we built in on renewal it\u2019s renewals may come in north 4 and they\u2019ve continued to do that in the month of July at 4.3% and new continues to be north of 2 so on a blended ratio probably a little lower 3% so I\u2019d to guess today it would be higher revenue growth next year. we\u2019re seeing some new supply today that\u2019s continuing in our Del Rey sub markets which I mentioned in my prepared remarks, where having new suppliers reclaim that\u2019s to finish up the lease up there, while still getting away about a month, a month and a half free.", "That being said, the other location that we\u2019re located in we have a heavy presence along that new street, Logan Circle Port work is performing extremely well with revenue growth, 3%, 3.5% we would expect that one to continue to do well. As far as locations have new supply I know - tie this corner there\u2019s quite a bit new supply coming inside the Del Rey, Harry you want to take that?", "Harry Alcock", "Other sub markets have several projects in some of these newer neighborhoods around the ballpark in the Southwest Waterfront we\u2019re also getting to see a significant amount of new supply as Jerry mentioned around Del Rey in Northern Virginia we continue to see new supply in that sub market as well.", "Nick Joseph", "Thanks and then just in terms of occupancy you kept guidance of 96.5% which is 30 bps lower than what you saw in the first half and also 30 bps lower than the trailing 12 months are you expecting to give up some occupancy in the back half of the year to push rates or do you think that occupancy guidance could end up proven to be conservative?", "Jerry Davis", "Yeah it\u2019s going to be a - conservative we didn\u2019t think it was meaningful on that to change guidance but I do believe in the third quarter specially my occupancy would be less than it was last year as we drive to continue to push rate. But as I\u2019ve stated again at the end of my remarks we\u2019re at 96.5 today, I would expect for the next five months to run somewhere that 96.5 range which is probably a little bit of a decelerate or declined from last year but we\u2019re not going to drop off to the point well below 96 as we averaged 96.5 for the year.", "Nick Joseph", "Great thanks.", "Jerry Davis", "Sure.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go now to Haendel Juste from Morgan Stanley.", "Haendel St. Juste", "Hey I guess good morning out there.", "Jerry Davis", "Hi Haendel.", "Haendel St. Juste", "So a question here on pro-forma of the acquisition of the home assets in DC, DC will be about 18% of your NOI is that a level you\u2019re comfortable at? Are you inclined to add a bit more to region in covers or more inclined to call? And then second part of that question, it looks like the golden yield on the acquisition in some of the low fives. Just curious how you're underwriting NOI growth over the next couple of years as part of that acquisition.", "Tom Toomey", "Haendel this is Toomey, with respect to the comfort level around DC, we're comfortable with the 18% exposure I wouldn't see a climb to grow that above that level. Certainly we think the DC markets is obviously recovering values will continue to grow there. And at some point when look at calling some of the assets no particular time frame for that, but we're always looking to try to maximize the value and we think that market will rise DC probably '17, '18. Harry, you want to take the second question?", "Harry Alcock", "Sure in terms of underwriting assumptions, we property-by-property we assume revenue growth during the first year some more between 2% and 3% depending on the asset. One of the properties are at the park is completing lease up after their major redevelopment. That property we underwrote in the low-90s in the first year. It's currently around the mid-80s and push that up to 94% in the second year. So we have some second year upside on that asset in particular.", "Haendel St. Juste", "Okay, appreciate that. Are you looking or plus as we considering starting development projects in DC today and not to tie too much the question before I'm saying are you comfortable at the level where you're at 18% NOI. But just curious on your level of comfort to potentially pursue development opportunity in DC today.", "Harry Alcock", "Haendel its Harry, we don't currently have any land assets that are available for development in the short term. It is however a market that we would developing, it's a recovering market as we mentioned we typically like to have one property in each of our core development markets at a construction at any given time. And we're just completing the lease up of the --. We're hoping expectation of - sometime in the next year or two we will have another land asset that - and new construction started.", "Haendel St. Juste", "Okay and just as a follow up I'll have on the line Harry. Just curious the conversations with potential sellers here over the last couple of months with vigorous on peoples' mind. Any change in the number of opportunities we think come to the market and any change that - interactions with sellers.", "Harry Alcock", "Haendel its Harry. We haven't seen any significant change in the volume of opportunities available. There continue to be a significant amount of transactions. 2014 as you know that we're well over $100 billion on transaction volume. We expect 2015 to be something similar. In terms of interactions with the sellers it's a there is a lot of capital chasing these assets. If you don't we haven't had any interaction that would be unusual not sure exactly the question you're asking. But it continues to be very active transaction market.", "Haendel St. Juste", "Okay. Thank you for your time.", "Tom Toomey", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we go now to Dan Oppenheim with Zelman & Associates.", "Dan Oppenheim", "Thank you very much. I was wondering if you can talk about the idea of so the turnover. How much of that is being driven by just the upper view of front and just an ability to current resistance to handle that. You talked a lot recently about handlings of being happy with low conversion and pushing rents. Wondering overall that capital demand they're seeing in terms of the income qualifications for the residents.", "Jerry Davis", "Sure this is Jerry. I guess to start with we've seen move outs due to rent increase probably go 300 basis point over the last year or so from 6% of the reasons from new loan to little under 10%. So still with the level that we're comfortable with. And we look at total turnover in the quarter it was up 110 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year. The majority of the reason for that is we had a higher number of lease explorations in the second quarter when we had back in 2014 second quarter of about 350 leases. Probably two or three years ago we started an effort to move more and more explorations from first and fourth quarter and to the middle two quarters primarily because new lease rate growth those high demand time is typically 200 to 300 basis points higher and that\u2019s what it was this year when second quarter the lease rate growth was 7.7% compared to 4.2% in the first quarter of this year.", "So, we pushed it to that level, we also would expect third quarter which will have probably a 100 to 200 more exploration from we had last year to also have turnover at for higher than it was last year but then we\u2019ll get into the fourth quarter we would think turnover would be a little bit less than last year. So when you look at the entire year, turnover should roughly be flat with what it was last year. When you look at rent income, really have been seen much of the changes instruct a little towards in the high teens pushing 20%, I would tell you those. That is not as a soft number meaning. Half of my residents probably lived with on average three to five years our average ten year is something like 25 months.", "We only qualify people at the time so we don\u2019t qualify them, so over that three to five year period they\u2019ve been getting salary increases so I think any time you hear any others talk about rent income levels, you should realize, we don\u2019t go back in recertify the never income. I tend to love more as my turnover going up when I am pushing right, when I am looking California in the West Coast when has been pushing right the most over the last year, year and half, turnover is actually down in places like San Francisco, Orange County and locations like that on the year-to-date basis.", "And then the other thing I look at is if you\u2019re pushing too hard some people will be new when they turn into bad debt as they become a - infection. My bad debt has actually gone down year-over-year to the point this year it\u2019s at less than 0.2% of our gross potential rate so I look at those two metrics a little bit more because they are harder numbers and easier to measure and if we see a situation where either my bad debt starts to spike or my turnover starts grew up dramatically as in better indicator to me that I pushed too hard.", "Dan Oppenheim", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go now to Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hey, good afternoon. It\u2019s Austin in for Jordon. Jerry you mentioned that you feel like you have a long runway for growth in New York I was wondering if you could just provide some additional detail and your comments and what really gives you the confidence that with supply increases in 2016 in the burn-off of 421", "Jerry Davis", "Well, the main thing as the 421 is not my same store those 421 is that our Columbus square property which is a joint venture. On the same store side, what really gives me the most confidence is when I look at the right growth that I\u2019ve been getting this year and in New York we got 8.4% in second quarter on new, 7% on renewals, in the month of July I knew as it 9.3% so we see strength and incoming traffic and incoming residence rather, the other thing is two more properties in financial districts or the World Trade Center starting to be occupied and retail coming down there it\u2019s becoming much more of available space. And I guess thirdly, when we look at our portfolio there it\u2019s a deep product to the properties in financial districts one in Chelsea and then - 34 or the former - will come into same store in the first quarter which is finishing redevelopment there.", "Also our deep properties that none of them will compete the with the new supply that what we come into mid count of west, and there is going to be a different price points so we just have not seen the impact of new supply are feeling right now was will continue to not be directly affected. Our property of North Columbus square does feel a little bit of the effect of Herston Yards in Mid-Cont. West but it\u2019s still producing revenue growth in order to 4%. Now Harry do you want to talk about the supply in New York?", "Harry Alcock", "Well, there has been a lot of reports written that publicize the significant supply on number of permits pulled in May and June in New York City. The primary reason as developers will trying to get under the exploration of 421A program the program since is been extended but certainly not as developer friendly as with additional affordable housing units that some of them are going to be required. So we saw some more than close to 8000 units in Manhattan or - more than in the months of May and June. Even more and Brooklyn and somewhere in the neighborhood of 35,000 permits have been pulled in all the deferrals over the last couple of months.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thanks for the detail there. And then just on the capital side, I was wondering looking at their source of funds outlined in guidance for $750 million to $900 million. Does that contemplate the potential units issued for the HMA transactions?", "Tom Herzog", "This is Herzog, no it does not. But the home transaction there would be units in addition to that's been described in the sources we spoken to you earlier.", "Unidentified Analyst", "So then how would you really think about the mix of capital raising throughout the balance of the year to the extent you feel comfortable that the HMA deal is going to go through is currently structured.", "Tom Herzog", "Well if the fact was that when we look at our sources who uses for the balance of the year, we've got about $200 million to $250 million left to fund in total. And that's really unchanged when we spoke to last quarter. It will be some combination of sales, or it could be stock or could be debt whatever we conclude at the time if provides the best pricing and it's the best outcome for our investors. So as far as home, again the majority of that come through OP units that depends on how many of the home OP unitholders convert to duty units, as to what will actually look like. And we'll have those numbers sometime in the next couple of weeks.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thanks for the detail.", "Tom Herzog", "Yeah we've got some optionality obviously on whether we would kick from assets out of if we didn't have full conversion or do - ones or the - we're in good shape on that side.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we go now to Drew Bawin with Robert W. Baird.", "Drew Bawin", "Hi guys. Hoping you could talk through the unsecured debt market right now and what you're seeing in terms of spreads and what you should think about from modeling purposes in terms of the potential bond offering in the next couple quarters.", "Tom Toomey", "Yeah we day we raised the BBB plus by S&P and AA one by Moody's last year. The current spreads are probably in the range on a 10 year deal 160 to maybe upwards of 170 basis point all and spread including lesser concessions but probably closer to about 160 mark is my guess. So that's the spread what that - we're doing.", "Drew Bawin", "Okay, and just couple of guidance side. And certainly if you could talk through the increase in G&A expenses while as the large JV FFO guidance.", "Tom Toomey", "Yeah the increase in G&A is going to be just two things, we've had outperformance during the year against what we have set forth is our plan. And therefore the incentive programs payout at a higher rate. And that's what the increase in the guidance that we set forth on the cash run. 15 years for that. And then as far as the joint ventures that would then be the Wolff JV and then also the addition of Steele Creek some offset for the Texas JV and then there is a few other moving parts within that, but those are probably numbers.", "Drew Bawin", "Okay guys, that's helpful. Thank you.", "Tom Toomey", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we're going now to Dave Brad [ph] with Greenstreet Advisors.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you. Couple of questions on dispositions, first can you remind us what level of CapEx is reserved for in your cash flow cap rate?", "Harry Alcock", "Of the cash flow cap rate Dave this is Harry includes $11.50 per unit in CapEx.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Is that a consistent assumption anytime we see that from UDR is that the right number to apply?", "Harry Alcock", "Yes.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay thank you. And what's the disposition pipeline working like from here?", "Jerry Davis", "Well Dave it depends. We've got maybe another I guess I would back up. We put it into that tool we\u2019ve got 250 million left of fund at home and that\u2019s going to be some combination of sales debt inside. So again the funding means are not great, I hate to put a number on it because it could change during the year based on conditions.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay and you have been planning on a bond offering earlier in the year what\u2019s the latest on that front?", "Jerry Davis", "We\u2019ve been looking at ten year deal towards the end of last quarter and we\u2019ve got about two-thirds hedge rates now from a treasury perspective so we\u2019re looking on massive hurry on that. We bumped into the Greece and Chinese prices which has the market - that\u2019s choppy and too critical so probably better off to look to sometimes probably in the early parts of the third quarter so that\u2019s still part of the plan but we decided to push that again.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay and the last question is there anything qualitative you can share with us regarding the solicitation of home OPU in the quarters?", "Tom Toomey", "This is Toomey Dave, to compare the question this time we\u2019ll have an answer a couple of weeks and so we probably just be able to come out with a press release shortly thereafter with the facts and so speculating between now and then clearly doesn\u2019t reflects our focus.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Understood can you just explain to us how the process works?", "Tom Toomey", "I'm sorry David in terms of what?", "Unidentified Analyst", "Communication? Yeah the communication between UDR and OPU in orders?", "Tom Toomey", "We\u2019ve been working in conjunction with the Cape Of Home, and have been having the conversations meetings and dialog with the whole OPU dealers, unit holders both come and explain the trends actually among the home people as well as explain the options and have received a 700 page offering document so as you mind that it\u2019s clearly complex so we our day-to-day dialogue with them.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go now to Rob Stevenson with Janney.", "Rob Stevenson", "Good afternoon guys, Jerry in terms of the increase in the same store revenue guidance was there one or two particular markets that were releasing the back half of the year or thus far this year where it\u2019s really surprise versus where you started the quarter with progress?", "Tom Toomey", "Yeah that\u2019s a great question and really the bulk of the increase well let me put it this way, we only have one market that is not hitting the original business plan and that\u2019s not a material market its\u2019 Michigan Virginia, every one of my other markets is above plan and they vary to some degree. I would state the biggest surprises to original guidance have come West Coast, going from and mostly from Northern California up through the Pacific Northwest have helped perform by quite a bit to our original expectations.", "Also a following that the two Texas markets both Dallas and Houston are holding a better in the faith of new supply than we originally expected and when we get beyond that where there is so caliber rest of the some belt through the Mid Atlantic they are all doing better than original plan but the biggest drivers were Northwest.", "Rob Stevenson", "Okay. And then Harry would you think today in terms of construction cost you guys are starting with new developments I mean it\u2019s where, where the goods cost have been sort of six, 12 months ago on these projects versus today and where are you seeing the biggest upward push?", "Harry Alcock", "So from over the last couple of years we consistently saw double-digit cost increases I can tell you today as because we\u2019re looking to start new projects and are looking forward to the next four, six, eight, 10 months. The cost increases have moderated in fact we\u2019re starting to see decreases in certain materials, steel has come down 10% plus over the past years, lumber has come down 0.56% over the past year so as we look forward as cost increases have moderated we\u2019re now looking at sort of a mid-single-digit type cost increases, the labor market in certain locations continues to be challenging and is pushing back in some of these material declines. Though we've gone from kind of mid-double digit type increases mid-teens down to mid-single digits.", "Rob Stevenson", "Okay. And then just lastly in your urban core, what do you think these days in terms of both ground up condo development as well as condo conversions?", "Harry Alcock", "Rob this is Harry. So that really was the first market where that materialized the condo boom. It's manifested itself in land prices which has gone up significantly and so far few were apartment, projects will pent up projects will pencil now is for multi-family use. It's migrated a little bit to say Francisco where you are seeing for example a project right across from our 399 Fremont deal has been sold to a condo converter. The project has completed a lease up and now - so we are seeing that a little bit in San Francisco. In other markets we're not seeing it to California a little bit in Boston. But really a lot in New York. Some in San Francisco and then just small number in another markets.", "Rob Stevenson", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "Tom Toomey", "Thanks Rob.", "Operator", "And we go now to Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.", "Steve Sakwa", "Just one quick question, Tom. What's the actual Treasury lock rate that you have for the debt deal?", "Tom Toomey", "We came in at about let me check back on it. There is about 245 and there was like 20 basis points of forward carry.", "Steve Sakwa", "So kind of a Treasury and 265 plus the spread of 160 you talked about?", "Tom Toomey", "Yeah.", "Steve Sakwa", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Tom Toomey", "Yeah.", "Operator", "And now we go to Ian Weissman with Credit Suisse.", "Ian Weissman", "Just two questions and maybe you can give us an update on that potential 6th acquisition from Wolff and what sort of been the issue with finalizing that transaction.", "Warren Troupe", "Sure, this is Warren. We are currently negotiation on the sixth asset. We are hopeful that we will be able to consummate that within near future. The issue is that there is an already partner on the both side and we've also had to include them in negotiation which have been - over the last couple of weeks.", "Ian Weissman", "Alright. Okay and finally just it has been focused on DC in New York just turn to LA for a second both of you and Avalon reported a pretty nice jump in revenue growth in that market. It's only been a long time coming. Maybe you can just talk about some of the drivers in LA today and what you think sustainable growth is in that market?", "Jerry Davis", "Yeah, this is Jerry and you are right. We are excited to actually participate in some of the higher revenue growth this quarter after having a discipline 3.8% growth in its fourth quarter. We turned it rather 6%. This quarter our expectation full year revenue growth in Los Angeles for us will be more than 6% and really what's driven if we're UDR, I would remind you talk of our same-store portfolio and then we're going to double rate and there has been quite a bit of the new tech job coming in Playa Vista. Over the last two years we've had new equipment supply come to Playa. So it came the proceeded the job growth. But the jobs are finally starting to come.", "I think in addition to that what goes from Santa Monica into the down town area is helping dry grades in the West side. As another benefit we more recently seen in Marian Del Ray portfolio is rental rates in Santa Monica has been driving people just throughout head down the coast 5 or 6 miles to us. New supply is coming in LA right now. It's kind of shifted from that West side. It taking down town right now and we're seeing a little bit of pressure down there. But we're still optimistic about down town as this is becoming much more of a believable city with retail and night life and some job through. But again as I stated earlier, our same-store pool is heavily concentrated among the area and we're finally starting to see the job growth in some of our apartments.", "Ian Weissman", "And is there been a shift in cap rates in that market just now that the momentum is building.", "Tom Toomey", "Cap rates have been low in that market for some time. We haven't seen any noticeable decline in the cap rates today. They have been and continue to be very, very low the good product in Los Angeles area.", "Ian Weissman", "Okay I appreciate the color. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we go now to Brian Peterson with Sandler O'Neill Investments.", "Brian Peterson", "Thanks hey guys. Just a quick question back to unsecured, you guys even though given a consideration to shorter terms and then 10 years. Just start some peers speak about that and the relative pricing attractiveness and wondering whether you would have ever consider.", "Tom Toomey", "This is Toomey, yeah when we look at our debt maturity schedule, we've got a pretty good open slot with very little maturing and 10 years out. So we probably pick that window. And that being said we're looking at the price differential of really our overall governing element is to try to keep that level later maturity schedule.", "Brian Peterson", "Okay great. Thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And now we go to John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.", "John Kim", "Thank you. I had a question on your same-store expenses in your MetLife joint venture. They increased significantly during the quarter and much higher than your balance sheet assets. Was there a specific reason for this and is there something that may translate into your own portfolio given there is been overlap in geography.", "Tom Toomey", "No those are typically just related to real-estate taxes either increase this year or refunds last year. I can remember specifically on those what drove it to that level. But I'm pretty sure we did recognize some real-estate tax refund to some of the California assets last year. We may have got and hit with an increase in one of our Texas markets this year. So it\u2019s purely real-estate taxes.", "John Kim", "Okay. And then on the turnaround that you've had in DC on new leases. Can you elaborate if there is particular price point only this sub market that you're finding more success in recently?", "Tom Toomey", "Really it's interesting that are doing better than they did last year. A year ago the spread between - was probably 500 to 600 basis point is compressed in the point today. Where it's closer to what it is in our total company which is somewhere in the 100 to 150 basis point differential. As I stated earlier, we're finding some of that urban core A product downtown in Logan circle, Thomas circle and New Street which are right in the same general area are very strong. Our property in Arlington village is probably almost struggling property today because of their supply. And the B assets outside the beltway are continuing to do fairly well but I would say our strongest sub-market inside that way is that - corridor.", "John Kim", "Okay. And then finally on dispositions have you disclosed with your IRRs or economic gains are on the asset sales that you've completed this quarter.", "Tom Toomey", "We have not but we can now take it Harry.", "Harry Alcock", "It's Harry the three assets we sold this quarter those the weighted average IRR was around 11%. So we had kind of a 12% or 9% and then 11% for the three assets that sold. We're probably sold the Texas JV in the first quarter and about 14% so for the year we're at about 12% unlevered IRR for the asset base.", "John Kim", "All of those numbers you mentioned unlevered IRRs?", "Harry Alcock", "Yes.", "John Kim", "Okay great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll go now to West Causley [ph] with RBC Capital Markets.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hello everyone with the labor market tightening are you seen any turnover at the property level and also at the construction level.", "Jerry Davis", "I'll start with the property this is Jerry and then Harry can take construction. Turnout was up by here year-over-year and it's predominantly in the high apartment supply markets. So when look at DC Seattle places like that we feel depth of bit of pressure but nothing significant. I do think as we look into 2016, we're going to see a little bit more wage pressure. Whereas year-to-date our personnel expenses up about 3.5%, I'm guessing it's going to be about 100 basis points higher than that in 2016. Harry?", "Harry Alcock", "This is Harry. On the construction side, it's a very high labor market for construction management personnel. We've lost one person this year and they're in the process of replacing him we've added a couple of others as new projects have started. But it's a very competitive labor market.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Thanks a lot for taking the questions.", "Operator", "And at this time there are no further questions. I'll turn the call back to Tom Toomey for closing remarks.", "Tom Toomey", "Thank you operator and thank all of you for your time and interest in UDR. As we've gotten two quarters down in the year it's very good year for us. We looking forward to the second half with this continued strength and our performance. And certainly the team is remains focused on the strategic plan the execution of it and building to the strength of 2016 and then we think that's going to be a good year as well. So with that thank you and take care.", "Operator", "This concludes our conference.

(NYSE:UDR) Q3 2015 Earnings Conference Call October 27, 2015  1:00 PM ET", "Executives", "Shelby Noble - IR", "Tom Toomey - President & CEO", "Tom Herzog - CFO", "Jerry Davis - COO", "Warren Troupe - Senior EVP", "Harry Alcock - SVP", "Analysts", "Nick Joseph - Citigroup", "Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Ian Weissman - Credit Suisse", "Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley", "Nick Yulico - UBS", "Dan Oppenheim - Zelman & Associates", "John Pawlowski - Green Street Advisors", "Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets", "Ryan Peterson - Sandler O'Neill & Partners", "Aaron Hecht - JMP Securities", "Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities Company", "Operator", "Welcome to UDR's Third Quarter 2015 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Shelby Noble. Please go ahead.", "Shelby Noble", "Welcome to UDR's third quarter 2015 financial results conference call. Our third quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed yesterday afternoon and posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, www.UDR.com. In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirement.", "I would like to note that the statements made during this call which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in yesterday's press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements. When we get to the question-and-answer portion we ask you that you be respectable to everyone's time and limit your questions and follow-up. Management will be available after the call for your questions that do not get answered. I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.", "Tom Toomey", "Thank you, Shelby and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to UDR's third quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Tom Herzog, Chief Financial Officer and Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our results, as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.", "Let me start by saying the third quarter was fantastic on all metrics. With 10 months of 2015 complete, four things stand out to me. First, we set out a strategic plan in February and have exceeded it on all fronts. Second, we surpassed our expectations with exceptional operating results which Jerry will outline in his remarks.", "Third, we were presented with a couple of strategic problem-solving opportunities that we were able to take advantage of. Namely, the $559 million West Coast development joint venture and the $901 million Washington, DC acquisition. These both fell in line with our long-term goals.", "As they both were accretive to cash flow growth, we were able to issue equity at or above NAV and they were lowered our overall leverage metrics. And lastly, we sold or have under contract $800 million in gross assets, our share of which is $480 million. Let's turn to 2016 and the long-term outlook. As you know, the macro numbers around jobs, household formation, supply, et cetera, look very favorable for the foreseeable future. When we further analyze our specific submarkets and individual community dynamics, we believe that our portfolio of mix of A and B communities in our urban and suburban locations will continue to perform well throughout the cycles.", "I know the question on your mind of how 2016 looks. Jerry and the entire operating team have been working hard to position UDR for a strong result in 2016. Without giving forward guidance at this point, we expect 2016 revenue growth to be at least as good as 2015, but after eight years of sub-3% expense growth, we do expect pressure from payroll and taxes to lead to expense increases of just over 3%.", "All-in, with strong operating fundamentals and over $500 million of development in lease-up, we're in good shape to drive cash flow and NAV growth for 2016 and into the future. As promised, we will publish another two-year strategic plan in February 2016 that will outline what we can expect for our shareholders.", "With that, I would like to express my sincere appreciation to all my fellow UDR associates for an extraordinary work in producing another strong quarter of results. We look forward to the remainder of 2015 and to a great 2016. I'll now turn the call over to Tom.", "Tom Herzog", "Thanks, Tom. The topics I will cover today include third quarter results, balance sheet and capital markets update, recent transactions, casualty loss incurred during the quarter, 421-a and -g impact on New York property taxes and revised full-year 2015 guidance. Our third quarter earnings results were above the upper end of our previously provided guidance ranges. FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $0.42, $0.42 and $0.37, respectively. This was primarily driven by better-than-expected year-over-year third quarter same-store revenue, expense and NOI growth which were strong at 5.9%, 2.7% and 7.3% respectively. Jerry will provide additional color in his prepared remarks.", "Next, balance sheet and capital markets activity, in August, we issued $102 million of common equity at a net price of $35 per share. In September, we issued $300 million of 10-year, 4% senior unsecured notes with a yield to maturity of 4.03%. Inclusive of swap breakage fees, our all-in rate was approximately 4.5%.", "Subsequent to quarter-end, we amended and recasted our unsecured revolving credit facility which increased the size from $900 million to $1.1 billion, extended the maturity to January 2021 inclusive of the extensions and reduced our interest rate spread by 10 basis points to LIBOR plus 90 basis points. We also amended and consolidated our $350 million of term loans under the same facility, repriced the loan to LIBOR plus 95 basis points, a reduction of 20 basis points and extended the maturity date to January 2021.", "These transactions completed our debt and equity needs for the year. At quarter-end, our financial leverage on an undepreciated cost basis was 36.7% and on a fair value basis, it was 26%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 6 times and inclusive of pro-rata JVs, it was 7 times. All metrics have continued to improve during the year as we had anticipated in our two-year outlook. At the current date, our liquidity is measured by cash and credit facility capacity is $991 million.", "On to recent transactions, as previously announced in our October 7 press release, subsequent to quarter-end, we closed our Washington, DC acquisition. With this transaction, we purchased six communities valued at $901 million in a recovering Washington, DC market. The transaction was funded through a combination of $565 million of common OP units issued at $35 per unit, the assumption of $89 million of mortgage debt, $221 million of Section 1031 exchanges which are under contract and $26 million in cash. Additionally, we have another $66 million of communities under contract to sell. We expect to close these transactions in December and upon completion, will have exited the Norfolk market.", "Next, casualty loss incurred during the quarter. In late September, 717 Olympic, a 151-home community located in Los Angeles, California which we have a 50% interest through our MetLife II joint venture, experienced extensive water damage due to a sand pipe rupture. As a result, we had to fully evacuate the building. Until clean-up is completed and all safety measures are met, residents will not be allowed to reoccupy the building. We have arranged for them to live in furnished apartments in Downtown LA. The full extent of the damage is still being quantified and will be updated in our fourth quarter earnings release.", "As a result of the casualty, we expect to incur a $0.01 charge to FFO, of which is only $256,000 has been incurred as of September 30. While the joint venture's insurance policy has a $25,000 deductible, the $0.01 charge is attributable to business interruption and temporary housing for our residents which GAAP requires that we recognize as incurred.", "As this charge is expensed, it will be deducted from FFO, but added back to FFO as adjusted. We expect to recover a significant portion of this charge from the insurance providers and any subsequent recoveries will be included in FFO, but deducted from FFO as adjusted. Since 717 Olympic is owned by MetLife II JV, it has no impact on our same-store results.", "Next, I will provide an update on the tax impact of the 421-a and -g real estate tax programs which impact three of our New York City assets, 95 Wall, 10 Hanover and Columbus Square. Individual programs by property burn off in varying amounts over the next 15 years and the impact is based on future assessed values and levy rates which for the out years we cannot fully estimate.", "However, I will provide the impact for 2015 and projected impact for 2016 and 2017 and we will continue to update you over time as the valuation of levy rates become known and we determine the projected impact. For 2015, 2016 and 2017, 421-a and -g in New York City is expected to negatively impact our same-store expenses by 25 basis points, 45 basis points and 70 basis points, respectively and impacts the year-over-year AFFO by $240,000, $670,000 and $1.3 million, respectively.", "As a reminder, when we acquired these buildings, the 421 property tax impact was included in our underwriting assumptions. Notably, the rent growth for these properties has surpassed even our underwriting and all-in IRRs to-date in these investments are in the low to mid-teens. On to fourth quarter and full-year 2015 updated guidance.", "We increased our full-year FFO as adjusted and AFFO guidance ranges for the third time this year, primarily due to stronger-than-expected operations. Our FFO as adjusted per share and AFFO per share guidance ranges increased by $0.01 and $0.02 at the mid-points, respectively. Full-year 2015 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share are now forecasted at $1.65 to $1.67, $1.65 to $1.67 and $1.49 to $1.51, respectively.", "For same-store, we have increased our full-year 2015 revenue growth guidance by 12.5 basis points at the mid-point to 5.25% to 5.5%. Expense growth increased by 12.5 basis points at the mid-point to 2.75% to 3% and our NOI growth forecast increased by 25 basis points at the mid-point to 6.25% to 6.75%. The revenue increase was driven by strong new and renewal rate growth.", "Fourth quarter 2015 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance is $0.40 to $0.42, $0.41 to $0.43 and $0.36 to $0.38, respectively. Other primary full-year guidance assumptions can be found on attachment 15 or page 28 of our supplement. Finally, in the third quarter we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.2775 per share or $1.11 per share when annualized, representing a yield of approximately 3.1%. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jerry.", "Jerry Davis", "Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks, I will cover the following topics. First, our third quarter portfolio metrics, leasing trends and the rental rate growth we realized this quarter and an overview of our current operating strategy. Second, the performance of our core markets during the quarter. And last, a brief update on our development lease-ups.", "We're pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. In the third quarter, our same-store revenue per occupied home increased by 6.2% year-over-year to $1,792, while occupancy declined 30 basis points to 96.6%. This led to third quarter revenue growth of 5.9%. Our revenue growth for the first nine months of the year was 5.4% year-over-year.", "Turning to new and renewal lease rate growth which is detailed on attachment 8-G of our supplement, our ability to push new lease rate growth continued to outpace historical precedent during the third quarter by a wide margin. We grew new lease rates by 7.6% in the third quarter, a full 310 basis points ahead of the third quarter of 2014. Renewal growth also remained robust, at 7.3% in the third quarter or 220 basis points ahead of last year. This strength in pricing and demand served as the primary driver of our sizable 12.5-basis point increase in same-store revenue guidance at the midpoint or 137.5 basis points from our initial guidance provided in February.", "As Tom mentioned earlier, we increased our full-year revenue growth guidance range to 5.25% to 5.5%. Although we expect a normal seasonal slowdown to occur starting soon, we continue to see strong fundamentals and our strategy continues to be driving rate growth in order to help build in our 2016 revenue.", "Third quarter expense growth was 2.7% and brings our year-to-date growth to 2.3%. We increased the mid-point of full-year expense guidance by 1/8 of a point to 2.875%, due to increased insurance premiums and higher sight-level incentive compensation due to outperformance of property-level budgets.", "Moving on to quarterly performance in our primary markets, these markets represent 70% of our same-store NOI and 74% of our total NOI. Orange County and Los Angeles combined represent 17% of our total NOI. Orange County posted year-over-year revenue growth of 6.4% and continues to outperform versus our initial budgeted expectations.", "Our LA portfolio posted strong third quarter revenue growth of 8.2%, an acceleration over the 3.8% revenue growth reported in first quarter and 6% in the second quarter. The job growth we have spoken to in the west LA coastal communities from Santa Monica to Playa Vista is continuing to arrive and we continue see the Marina Del Rey submarket as a primary beneficiary of these new jobs. We expect full-year revenue growth of nearly 7% in 2015, quite an acceleration from what we had forecasted earlier in the year.", "New York City which represents 13% of our total NOI, saw revenue growth of 5.8% year-over-year. Continued investment and retail interest at the World Trade Center site supports our long-term view that there is a long runway of growth potential for our New York City portfolio. Metro DC which represents 13% of our total NOI, posted year-over-year same-store revenue growth of 1.6%.", "As I stated on the second quarter call, job growth is returning and in some submarkets, supply is easing. Importantly, we have continued to focus on growing market rent via new lease rate, pricing, when possible, as it translates into renewal pricing power as well. We still anticipate full-year revenue growth in DC of just under 2%.", "San Francisco which represents over 12% of our total NOI, continues to show no signs of slowing down, as seen by revenue growth of 9.2% in the quarter. Our Santa Clara properties continued to be the strongest with revenue growth of 12%, while our San Jose properties which are competing with new supply pressure, posted revenue growth of 6.2%. Our downtown San Francisco properties have strengthened to revenue growth of 7.9%.", "Seattle which represents almost 7% of our total NOI, posted 8.3% revenue growth in the quarter. Our portfolio continued to benefit from the strong growth inherent in our suburban B assets, primarily those located in Renton and North Seattle which are submarkets that are less exposed to new supply. We currently see full-year Seattle revenue growth coming in around 7.5% to 8%. Boston which represents over 6% of our total NOI, posted 5.7% revenue growth in the third quarter, despite new supply pressure downtown.", "Our best performance is in our suburban product, but our Back Bay property had strong revenue growth also, at 5.3%. I'll now turn to our in lease-up developments which you can find on attachments 9-A and -B or pages 21 and 22 of our supplement. Our pro-rata share of these properties represent over $400 million spent. 100 Pier 4, our 369-home, $218 million development project in Boston Seaport district was 92% leased and 90% occupied at quarter-end and today, is 95% leased and 93% occupied. With first move-ins in mid-March, we stabilized in seven months and asking rents today of $4.78 per square foot are ahead of our original underwriting of $4.30 a foot.", "Steele Creek, our 218-home participating loan investment in the Cherry Creek submarket of Denver is currently 86% leased and 75% physically occupied. The property is achieving rents in the $3.30 per square foot range versus initial underwriting of $3.10 per square foot. We have two West Coast development JV properties that began leasing during the third quarter. Katella Grand I, our 399-home, $138 million development project located in Orange County, is currently 12% leased, with move-ins scheduled to start in December and CityLine, our 244-home, $80 million development project in Seattle, is currently 6% leased and we expect first move-ins there in November, as well.", "We expect October new lease rate growth to come in between 5.25%, 5.5% and renewals to come in a bit over 7%. Same-store occupancy today is 96.5%. We see continued pricing power and stable occupancies in almost all of our markets. In fact, no market has physical occupancy today less than 95%. These factors leave us confident for the remainder of 2015.", "Given the impressive strength we have seen year-to-date, we will have approximately 2.75% of 2016 revenue growth [indiscernible] by year-end. In addition, we're working on a number of initiatives that are both good for residents and for UDR, including parking solutions and solar solutions. The impact of strong rate increases for the second half of 2015 will be the catalyst for what we believe will be another strong year in 2016. With that, I'll open up the call to Q&A. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. We'll go first to Nick Joseph with Citi.", "Nick Joseph", "Appreciate the commentary on 2016 same-store revenue growth being at least as good as 2015. What job growth and supply assumptions are baked into that outlook?", "Jerry Davis", "Nick, this is Jerry. It's basically similar job growth to this year. Call it 200,000 to 250,000 jobs per month. Nationally, when we look at how that affects our core markets, it would be down just modestly from about 870,000 jobs to 856,000 jobs in our markets. When you look at supply, it's looking for deliveries in 2016, 320,00, 325,000 jobs next year. But once again, when you look at our core markets, it's coming down about 20,000 -- I'm sorry -- not jobs, deliveries. It's coming down about 20,000 from what we experienced in 2015.", "Nick Joseph", "And then in terms of operational efficiencies, you guys have talked about a lot in the past. I wanted to get your take on the impact of package deliveries on the business and how you're dealing with it at your garden-style communities?", "Jerry Davis", "Sure. We've been looking at package deliveries, honestly, for a couple of years and been trying to find a solution that the carriers will be accepting of, as well as what will be best for our residents. And we think we found a few package locker systems that seem to work for us. To date, we've tested between eight and 10. Just about a month ago we ordered an additional 20 package locker systems.", "When we look at it and there have been studies done on this, a person can handle about 15 packages per hour, so the way we've looked at it, our average resident probably gets between four and six packages a month. You're going to save, 300 to, call it, 500 hours on average at a property per year in efficiency. We think our people are going to be able to take that time and either do a better job performing services or they will be able to tend to prospective residents better because the time that current residents were coming in to get their packages which are after work and weekends, is the same time our leasing office is most busy with prospective residents. The other thing we see is a huge benefit, especially in our garden communities that we don't have a front door, is our residents are going to have 24/7 access.", "Nick Joseph", "Then finally, can you give us an update on the potential sixth acquisition as part of the Wolff deal?", "Warren Troupe", "This is Warren. The sixth asset was held in a partnership with a third party and the structure has turned out to be too complicated so we've decided not to pursue it any further.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Austin Wurschmidt", "It's Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan. Just had a question on thinking about portfolio allocation going forward. You guys have a sizable chunk of the development pipeline in Southern California. As you start to think about the Wolff JV assets stabilizing late next year and into 2017, how are you thinking about your exposure to that market?", "Harry Alcock", "This is Harry. Our portfolio allocation in terms of development, our general plan is to have a diversified portfolio. So we have an asset in Boston that we're just stabilizing. We expect to start our 345 Harrison land site that we acquired last year for $32 million and that will be nearly 600 units and upwards of $300 million-plus.", "We have an asset in DC that we're just completing and so we generally would expect to start another project in DC sometime in the relatively near future. In terms of California, we're relatively heavily weighted in California from a development perspective. We're going to have several of these assets running through the completion and lease-up phase in 2016 and into 2017 and so naturally our development exposure to Southern California will lighten up and then we'll look to backfill in the ordinary course.", "Tom Toomey", "Jordan, Austin, this is Toomey. What I would add to it is my recollection is SoCal was one of the last areas to enter the recession and one of the last to come out. And so if you look at the recent job growth and supply dynamics, we think it's got a long runway to deliver and we're excited about the Wolff transaction, in particular, because we accelerated a lot of communities and development into lease-up to take advantage of what we think is a very strong market in 2016 and 2017. So we're well-positioned in that marketplace.", "Austin Wurschmidt", "And then just turning to DC, DC decelerated a little bit this quarter. I was just curious if there's anything submarket-specific and then what your outlook is for that market going forward?", "Jerry Davis", "This is Jerry. You're right. DC did decelerate slightly to 1.6% growth. Overall, though, we feel DC is stable and this year it will come in about a 1.5% to 2% revenue growth. As I look in the current -- as of today, my market rents are up 2.7% from where they were last October, so that's encouraging for growth in the future.", "A couple other things that I would think are worth noting. A few years ago, we talked about the differential between A and B product. In DC and probably two years ago, that difference was 600 to 700 basis points, where Bs were probably producing 3%, 3.5% revenue growth and As were negative 3.5%. Today, that has compressed down to about 50 basis points. So As are just 50 basis points behind B.", "A lot of our inside the Beltway is doing as well as outside the Beltway. Areas of new supply that have affected us, particularly at our Arlington properties are the new supplies happening in Crystal City, Rosslyn-Ballston and Potomac Yard. When I look at the 14th Street Corridor and we've got four assets in that Thomas Circle, Logan Circle area, we're seeing revenue growth that's approaching 3% there, so that is strengthening. But overall, DC feels pretty stable.", "The last thing I would add that probably had a modest effect on our deceleration this year is our DC team was spending quite a bit of time over the summer preparing to ensure a smooth transition of the six Home properties. That transition has paid off, as we took over those assets about three weeks ago and things are going well. And then as we look into 2015, again, our expectation is revenue growth at UDR for the DC portfolio will be just under 2% and as we look further out to 2016, it's going to go up modestly, call it mid-2%s.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Ian Weissman with Credit Suisse.", "Ian Weissman", "Just two questions, I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit more granularity on resurgence in Southern California, specifically Los Angeles which beat our forecast by at least 150 basis points and you were up 260 basis points sequentially. Can you talk about some of the drivers in LA today and how sustainable that growth rate is?", "Jerry Davis", "Sure, Ian. This is Jerry again. First thing, I would start off is remind you our LA portfolio is almost entirely concentrated in Marina Del Rey. We only have four assets in our same-store pool. One is in La Mirada, but the other three are in Marina Del Rey. What's really driving it is two things.", "About two years ago, up through about a year ago, you had a surge of new supply that was hitting Playa Vista and that was putting supply pressure on our Marina product. And that was being built really in anticipation of all the tech jobs that were coming to Silicon Beach, the area between Santa Monica and Playa Vista. Those jobs are now coming in and it's companies like Facebook, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Snapchat, YouTube, Twitter, Uber.", "So as these jobs come in, it's really driving demand extraordinarily in that Los Angeles submarket of Marina Del Rey and that's what's really propelling our growth. You look back to first quarter of this year, our growth was only 3.8%. In second quarter, it got up to 6%. In this quarter, it was well over 8%. Our expectation is it's going to go a bit higher than even what we did in third quarter, in fourth quarter. LA, honestly, for our same-store portfolio is one of the markets I'm most excited about for 2016 and it's being driven by that job creation in Playa Vista, Venice and that submarket.", "As you get more into Downtown LA, we have the one asset that we owned with MetLife. That area is feeling quite a bit of new supply and the growth there is not nearly at the level that our portfolio is. So I wouldn't read into LA in general, based on what our results are, because ours are focused on that one submarket.", "Ian Weissman", "And finally, just thinking about the Equity Residential deal who sold assets in South Florida, Denver, DC, Seattle and Inland Empire, you guys are the only other apartment REIT to hold assets in each of those markets. The market liked the deal. The stock was up on the news.", "It wasn't about G&A savings or even higher growth. It was all about the bid for B-quality assets in B markets. How should we think about your plans moving forward, just given what the capital that sits on the sideline and how aggressive it's getting in these markets? And what are your thoughts about accelerating sales in some of these non-core markets?", "Tom Toomey", "I would make four or five points on the subject. Just as a reminder, in 2008, we did sell one-third of the company as part of a larger portfolio repositioning because primarily we thought at the time assets were trading well above their replacement cost and as part of that transaction, we declared a special dividend. So we're not afraid of that type of transaction and have executed on it in the past, but today, we don't see that type of repositioning necessary.", "We've still got very good strong growth from our assets in those marketplaces. Second, I would add that we have a prudent capital allocation process in place. By using asset sales to fund development, we're largely removing any dependency on capital markets for our future growth. And as a reminder, our strategic plan which we continue to outline and update, is focusing on consistent cash flow growth. After you look at these transactions and realize the amount of dilution and how much growth you would have to compensate for in the future, they don't seem to be as penciling out at this time.", "But we'll continue to monitor the market and see what happens with respect to asset pricing and we're aware of a good action on Bs right now. You can see this last year we sold $800 million, our share, $480 million of them. Then we used those proceeds very accretively to fund our development pipeline. So we've got a good plan, we've outlined it and we'll do it again and we'll see how the market unfolds.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.", "Haendel St. Juste", "So Mr. Toomey or maybe Jerry, I would like to get some more color on a comment, I think it was you, Tom, who made it earlier on the call, that your revenue growth for next year can be on par with this year's but from a different angle. I look across the various key regions in your portfolio and expect another solid year, next year for sure, but expect to see some slight deceleration on the revenue side in New York City, Boston.", "There has been a bit of concern around San Francisco, not only with the recent Wall Street Journal article about the tech ideal slowdown, but also a little supply-related concerns in Bellevue, up in Seattle. Are you effectively counting on Southern California, Denver and perhaps DC to accelerate a bit from here, a bit more from here, make up for those decelerating trends in the other markets here?", "Jerry Davis", "First I would say, in Denver, we don't have any same-store properties, so we're not counting on anything from there. When we look at the entire portfolio, we see a few things happening. Probably there are two or three markets that we're penciling in that will most likely decelerate next year.", "First is NorCal, that's probably based more on our aversion to [indiscernible] than anything else. If I had to guess on any one market that I would presume would beat -- could beat my plan next year, it would probably be NorCal, because I don't see the fundamentals really coming down. You just don't think it can continue to pop at 10% growth.", "And I'll give you an example. Last year we thought the same thing. In the month of October, my in-place rents are 4% higher than I budgeted a year ago, so I thought it was going to happen last year. It didn't. It surprised. But we're counting on it to come down a bit, but it would still be our best market next year. The other markets that I see probably decelerating some next year are the two Texas markets, Dallas and Austin and that's really just supply-driven. We're starting to feel it already in Austin, especially our A product is starting to feel it more than it has because job growth was keeping up. Right now, job growth is still good, but the supply is hitting us.", "Dallas, pressures in uptown, as well as up in Plano-Frisco, are hitting us in some of our assets. Our B product, especially in the Addison area, are doing phenomenally well, very high single digits. But when you get down to Uptown, currently we're seeing about 3% growth. Don't see that improving a lot next year because of new supply.", "SoCal, as I stated earlier, very bullish on LA, at least our portfolio there. Orange County's going to hang in there and probably be slightly above average and do at least as well as it did this year. When I look at Seattle, you brought up Bellevue. There is new apartment supply coming there.", "There have been some jobs that have, like Expedia, that have gone over to the west side in Seattle, but an article came out yesterday about Salesforce just rented 75,000 square foot of office space that they will put 500 people in. That office location is directly across from our Met JV and it's about two blocks from our Elements communities.", "So we're feeling a little better today than we probably were a week ago about Bellevue. But the B product in Seattle is going to hold up very well. We're probably about 30% to 40% of the properties we have in Seattle are B. So we're optimistic about that. Boston, you brought that one up. Honestly, we've been pleasantly surprised this year. As I look at which one of our markets today is doing, again, better than I would have expected, Boston's picking up steam. We usually see a turndown. We moved some lease expirations from fourth quarter into third quarter, but it's allowed us to maintain occupancy where today it's 97%.", "My year-over-year market rent growth in my four same-store Boston properties is up 8.4% October versus October. And today, I've got a loss-to-lease of 3.1% in Boston. That compares to 0.3% last year. So Boston honestly doesn't feel that bad to me. So I look at those and the other two that honestly are probably going to do as well, if not a bit better next year, are the two Florida markets.", "Orlando has been surging and Tampa is not far behind it. The Mid-Atlantic, it's still going to be tough. It will be our worst performers, as I said earlier. DC is going to perk up a hair to mid-2%s. Baltimore, Richmond, we're not quite as optimistic there. It will stay below average. But overall, again, the Texases and NorCal would be the ones that I see coming down a bit, SoCal is going up, Florida's probably going up and the rest of them are about the same.", "Tom Toomey", "Haendel, this is Toomey. I would add this. My quote is revenue for 2016 is at least as good as 2015. And what I would point to, is Jerry and team have been really focused a lot about middle of this year on 2016, by pushing the rents which give us that carry-through. He mentioned in his prepared remarks, 2.75% of revenue is already in the books for next year. We think that trend could continue, but we'll play it out. They have just done an exceptional job of positioning us for 2016, a good number.", "Haendel St. Juste", "And just so I'm clear, Jerry, what, if anything, enters the same-store pool next year?", "Jerry Davis", "Actually, in our supplement, on page 11, at the beginning of the year, it will be full-year, Los Alisos which is Mission Viejo, enters in first quarter; Waterscape; and then also View 34, the old Rivergate property in Manhattan.", "Haendel St. Juste", "And then one more, if I may, a line of questioning I've preceded in the past. Just curious, your exposure to DC and Seattle, we've seen your [indiscernible] in lighten up in suburban locations in both markets. I'm curious about your current portfolios in both markets. Are you looking to lighten up a bit here, especially following the closing of the Home and Wolff deals?", "Tom Toomey", "This is Toomey. With respect to DC, we fully expect DC to be slightly better in 2016, but really, the rebound in DC's going to come in 2017 and 2018. And that's what our positioning is. So eventually, we're a little overweight in that marketplace, but we would like to catch the rent trajectory up when we look at pruning that particular area. The other market that was--?", "Jerry Davis", "Seattle.", "Tom Toomey", "Seattle? We're happy with Seattle. We've got a good mix of A, B marketplace. We're always looking at shifting some, but it will be so thin on the margin, it probably wouldn't matter in our view.", "Jerry Davis", "Haendel, we sold two assets in Seattle at the end of last year that were more in the Tacoma market. I agree with Tooney. We like the portfolio. We've got a decent mix of a couple of Bs to go with some urban As that are both in Bellevue and we're going to increase our exposure with the Wolff transaction down in South Lake Union. But Seattle is a market we're all pretty optimistic about, mid- and long-term.", "Haendel St. Juste", "I'm clear on Seattle, but just want to make sure I'm clear on DC. Sounds like you're happy with your portfolio, would consider selling, but just not a good enough time to sell yet, but something you would monitor over the next year, year to two years for potential culling, is that fair?", "Tom Toomey", "That's a fair statement.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. We'll go next to Nick Yulico with UBS.", "Nick Yulico", "You talked about expense growth next year likely going over 3% and you guys have had lower expense growth than that in the last couple years. Could you just talk a little bit more about what's driving the expense growth higher?", "Jerry Davis", "Nick, this is Jerry. I'll start and Herzog may jump in. He mentioned the 421-a real estate program that has started to affect us this year and it will affect us a little more next year. So a big part of it's real estate taxes. So when you look at what are the two components that we currently forecast would be north of the 3% growth rate, one's going to be real estate taxes which today our expectation, including the 421-as, is going to be north of 7%.", "When you factor in the impact in the Sunbelt markets, the positive real estate tax refunds that we got this year in the 421 programs at 95 Wall and 10 Hanover, that's about where it gets to. The other one that we anticipate putting some pressure on us is wage growth. In our markets, we've currently penciled in for it to be 4% in personnel growth.", "Nick Yulico", "And then what about repairs and maintenance? That's a line item you guys have done a really good job controlling expenses on. How much are you still able to keep that in check?", "Jerry Davis", "We think there's still initiatives that we've been working on for the last few years, that there's still a ways to go. This year, it will probably be very slightly positive. Next year, I still think it will be under an inflationary range and we're going to continue to find efficiencies with our maintenance teams to bring even more work in-house. So I don't think we're quite done with those initiatives yet.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Dan Oppenheim with Zelman & Associates.", "Dan Oppenheim", "Was wondering -- you guys haven't been so active on the redevelopment, much more in terms of just the development, but wondering from the communities acquired from Home, what the thought is, where some of those can add some redevelopment, but could have more and just where those assets? How do you think about it?", "Jerry Davis", "This is Jerry again. Harry may jump in after me if I leave anything out. When you look at that portfolio, there's three assets that are newly developed, less than four to five years old, the two in Silver Springs, one in Alexandria that really need next to no work done on them. Home did a good job redeveloping Arbor Park. That one needs very little.", "The other two, Newport Village and The Courts at Dulles, are probably where we'll focus most of our efforts over the next year or two. They both would benefit from some level of kitchen and bath upgrade. There's a bit of deferred maintenance and there's some touch-up we can do on the amenities at both of those properties.", "Dan Oppenheim", "And then as it relates to the expectations in terms of the expense side or in actually it also relates to revenue, how are you thinking about turnover as it's been fairly low as of late? What's the expectation in terms of what we're likely to see in 2016 for that?", "Jerry Davis", "It's going to go up 100 to 200 basis points from where it is this year. Last year, it was 51%. This year, it will probably be a hair over that. Next year, I got to believe it's going to go up another 100, 150 basis points, as we start hitting some people with affordability issues and they are going to move out because of rent increase. We've seen that inch up a bit. I don't see move-outs related to home purchase rising. We've seen move-outs because of money problems or skips and evictions, actually come down. So really the only category we've seen in some markets is some people are getting priced out of the community they live in today and they are having to move down a step.", "As we've seen this happen, we've been able to maintain occupancy levels in that 96.5%, so reload period is short. We've been able to take the number of days a units sits vacant down between 20 and 21 days from -- when we started looking at that three years ago, it was at 26 days. So turnover is going to again go up 100 to 200 basis points.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.", "John Pawlowski", "On the 1031 exchanges, could you share the cap rate on the four Virginia assets, as well as the Huntington Beach sale?", "Harry Alcock", "Sure. This is Harry. The cap rates on the four Virginia beach sales are going to be somewhere in the high 6%s, around 7%. That includes a 2.75% management fee and $1,100 per unit in CapEx. The Huntington Beach deal will be just under 5% and the fixed asset will be in the high 5%s, the Oxnard asset.", "John Pawlowski", "That's on forward NOI, correct?", "Harry Alcock", "It is.", "John Pawlowski", "And then just so I understand the new footnote on the 421 exemptions, the $70,000 higher New York real estate taxes, so this is the first quarter that those abatements started burning off or was the amount de minimis before 3Q?", "Tom Herzog", "This was the first year, this first quarter.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.", "Wes Golladay", "Quick question on the abatement as a follow-up, what is the total dollar amount of abatements flowing through the expenses right now for 2015?", "Tom Herzog", "We've given the amount of the AFFO impact which is the change. For 2015, it was $240,000 is the AFFO impact. So that's the amount of change year-over-year.", "Wes Golladay", "Do you guys have maybe a dollar amount? Since it is a line item that will abate, I just wonder if you had the actual dollar amount, but we could follow up offline if that's fine?", "Tom Herzog", "Okay. If you guys want to call on that to get details on that, I'm glad to give them to you.", "Wes Golladay", "Yes, we'll do that. Okay. And then looking at the Playa Vista market, it seems quite strong for you. Would you happen to have the loss-to-lease on that market and where renewals are going out right now?", "Jerry Davis", "The loss-to-lease on that right now is 5%. The year-over-year market rent growth in that LA portfolio and it includes one small asset in La Mirada, but this is predominantly the Marina Del Rey, but year-over-year revenue, rent growth is 9.2%. And the most current new and renewal growth in LA is news, we've achieved in October 8.8% and renewals are in October 7.2%.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Ryan Peterson with Sandler O'Neill.", "Ryan Peterson", "So we've seen recently some of your peers market New York high-rises as condo conversions because of the superior pricing there. Is that something you guys would consider with any of your New York assets?", "Harry Alcock", "This is Harry. Like all of us, we're constantly in the market having general conversations about market pricing. If an opportunity arose where we could predictably capture that spread between a condo user in changing the use at an extraordinary low cap rate and reinvest those proceeds in a core market on an accretive basis, we would certainly consider that. Right now, we haven't seen any of those opportunities materialize.", "Ryan Peterson", "Okay. So, really only if you had a reinvestment opportunity?", "Harry Alcock", "In all likelihood, yes.", "Ryan Peterson", "Okay and then only other question for me is do you see any more opportunities for deals similar to your Steele Creek deal?", "Harry Alcock", "This is Harry again. Steele Creek and Wolff are two relatively similar transactions that we've completed over the past 12 months. We're in the market looking at those types of opportunities. We don't have anything specific to talk about, but if those same types of opportunities materialized, we certainly would be interested in doing another one.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Aaron Hecht with JMP Securities.", "Aaron Hecht", "It looks like household formations were released this quarter and renter households declined for the first time sequentially in eight quarters. How are you guys thinking about that because it doesn't look like there's any lack of demand in your core markets?", "Tom Toomey", "This is Toomey. I take all of these government statistics that come out and wait and see if there's a trend line to develop, if there's not a one-month blip. So you just have to step back and wait and see how that trend and that number gets revised. We took note of it, that we're not feeling it in the marketplace by any measure, don't see it as a trend line, but we'll be cognizant of it and keep it in our view going forward.", "Aaron Hecht", "Okay and then on your 399 Fremont development, can you give any color on just the Rincon Hill area, because it looks like there's a lot of high-end product that may come online pretty soon there?", "Harry Alcock", "I'll start and Jerry may add if I miss something, but in Rincon Hill, there's over 4 million square feet of office that's either active or under construction. There are some multi-family projects high end that are coming online, some of which are in lease-up now and others that will be in line over the course of the next 12 months. It's our expectation that, that is an extremely strong submarket within San Francisco for rental product, given the enormous amount of job growth in high-paying jobs, so at this point, we're not concerned about that submarket.", "Jerry Davis", "I would agree with Harry. As we've looked at that market and the product we're going to deliver, we think we compete well. Probably the most encouraging thing, you talked about the supply, but the jobs that are coming, that are within a 5 to 10 minute walk over the next several years, are going to provide plenty of residents for all of us to do well.", "Aaron Hecht", "Okay. And then on the 717 Olympic property, was that water issue just a freak accident or was there some property management that should have occurred to avoid that issue?", "Jerry Davis", "It was a freak accident. There was an automobile accident, if you will, in the garage structure that set off the sprinkler system that affected the pressure on the sand pipe. It wasn't maintenance. It was created due to an accident.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.", "Rich Anderson", "Tom Toomey, if you had 20/20 foresight that San Francisco Bay area was about to really fall off the cliff and I know you don't have that, but let's just pretend you do because you have really super powers otherwise, what would you do? Would you sell immediately right now? Or would you muscle your way through it because you consider it a long-term hold regardless of what might happen over the course of a couple of years?", "Tom Toomey", "Rich, it's always a tough question when you look at falling off the cliff in San Francisco, is that the earthquake comes and gets it or just the marketplace.", "Rich Anderson", "The marketplace.", "Tom Toomey", "The marketplace, I believe it's a center for technology innovation. It's a gateway to Asia. It's a long-term dynamic city that has long-term growth prospects. And I'm prepared to weather the storm that inevitably will happen, that will cause it to take a turn-down and anticipate that through its innovation, its capital formation that it's a long-term vibrant mark and it's sure in heck hard to get real estate there, that's our overall portfolio strategy.", "We understand that markets will come and go, that situations like oil and gas that are going through right now are not long-term enduring situations. They are short-term blips. And we want to have a portfolio that's diversified to weather those storms and we've done it both in market diversification and product diversification and we'll continue that path and think it's the right one for long-term cash flow growth.", "Rich Anderson", "Maybe for someone else in the room, what happened leading up to the DC falling off? Did you sell at all? I don't remember. Or did you just defend?", "Tom Toomey", "The posture in DC was to defend. We did take some assets that we thought would have a harder time in recovery and pulled those up and moved on. And again, as you outlined earlier in the call, we think we're a little overweight, DC, but we think the inevitable recovery that arrives probably in 2017, 2018 window will represent a good time to pull some capital out of that marketplace and there will be other opportunities and other markets for us to redeploy those or we'll just pull them up and use them for our development pipeline.", "Operator", "It appears there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Tom Toomey, CEO, for any additional or closing remarks.", "Tom Toomey", "Well, thank you all for your interest in UDR and for your time on the call today. Just let me close by saying it was a fantastic quarter, that we're doing a very good job of executing on our strategic out plan. We've exceeded all of those metrics. We're certainly positioning ourselves for a strong 2016 and beyond. You'll see more of that plan come February and we'll be seeing most of you, I believe, at NAREIT in a couple of weeks and look forward to some more Q&A there. With that, take care.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Good day, and welcome to UDR's First Quarter 2016 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Shelby Noble. Please go ahead.", "Shelby Noble", "Welcome to UDR's first quarter 2016 financial results conference call. Our first quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed yesterday afternoon and posted to the Investor Relations section of our Web site, ir.udr.com. In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirement.", "I'd like to note that statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in yesterday's press release and included in our filings with the SEC.

Management will be available after the call for your questions that do not get answered.", "I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.", "Tom Toomey", "Thank you, Shelby, and good afternoon everyone, and welcome to UDR's first quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Tom Herzog, Chief Financial Officer; and Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our results; as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available for the Q&A portion of the call.", "The first quarter of 2016 was another great quarter for UDR, with strong same-store results and development lease-ups continuing to perform well. As you have come to expect from UDR, we remain focused on executing on our previously communicated two-year strategic plan, which is still the right plan, given the long-term strength of the apartment business.", "From a big picture point of view, we're now in our sixth year of achieving 5% plus NOI growth. Over the past two years, most of our markets have seen accelerating growth trends due to supply/demand imbalance, and while our overall 2016 same-store operating trends continue to improve year-over-year in a few markets as anticipated, we have started to feel the impact of concentrated new supply. We believe apartment growth is sustainable, and supply can be absorbed with steady job growth and household formations.", "Deliveries of new apartment homes are projected to peak in the cycle in 2016 at around 380,000 units, and will subsequently drop in 2017 to 300,000 units, while job growth is forecast to be in the 2 million to 2.5 million range in both years. In this environment, market mix and price points will be key, and this plays well to our overall strategy that centers around our diverse portfolio mix of 20 markets with A and B quality communities in urban and suburban locations, which over the long-term we expect to continue to perform well through the cycles and provide consistent cash flow growth.", "Our two-year strategic plan issued in February showed strong expected 2016 revenue and NOI growth of 5.75% and 6.75% at the midpoints. And we spoke to an anticipated solid, but slightly decelerating 2017 operating environment with revenue and NOI growth of 5% and 5.5% at the midpoints. Since then, there have been a number of publications speaking to flowing revenue trends in certain markets. And as such, I have asked Jerry to provide an update on our market expectations for the balance of 2016 and how we currently see 2017 stacking up. I hope you find this useful and that you reach the same conclusion that the UDR team. It's a great time to be in the apartment business, and therefore, we're reaffirming our full year guidance provided in the initial outlook, and we'll provide an update during the second quarter earnings call.", "Also let me take a moment to mention that we were pleased that in early March we were added to the S&P 500 index, which is granted to our investors and the entire UDR team who made this possible.", "With that, now I will turn the call over to Tom.", "Tom Herzog", "Thanks, Tom. The topics I will cover today include the first quarter results, our balance sheet and capital markets update, our casualty loss update, and development and transactions update, and our second quarter and full year guidance.", "Our first quarter earnings results were in line with our previously provided guidance. FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $0.43 and $0.41 respectively. First quarter same-store revenue, expense, and NOI growth remained strong at 6.4%, 2.7%, and 8.0% respectively.", "Next the balance sheet; at year end, our liquidity as measured by cash and credit facility capacity was 1.1 billion. Our financial leverage on an un-depreciated cost basis was 33.0%. Based on today's market cap, it was 23.8%, and inclusive of JVs it was 28.2%. Our net debt to EBITDA was 5.4 times, and inclusive of JVs was 6.5 times. All balance sheet metric improvements were ahead of plan.", "During the quarter we issued 174 million of common equity at a net price of $34.73 per share in conjunction with our inclusion in the S&P 500. In addition, in January we paid 83.3 million of 5.25% medium term notes.", "On to casualty losses; in conjunction with the previously announced damage to our 151 homes, 717 Olympic Community located in the Los Angeles, we recorded a casualty loss of 1.1 million during the quarter attributable to business interruption and temporary housing for our residents. This resulted in a charge of approximately $0.50 to FFO, what was added back to FFO was adjusted. We expect to recover a significant portion of this charge from the insurance providers. And any subsequent recoveries will be included in FFO, but deducted from FFO as adjusted. As a reminder, 717 Olympic is owned by the MetLife II JV. It has no impact on our same-store results. As of today, all damage has been fixed. The community if fully operational and we're over 88% leased.", "Turning to development, we commenced construction of our 585-home 367 million-345 Harrison Street development in Boston's South End, which we intend to fund with non-core asset sales. We have identified a number of assets that we'll be marketing to satisfy our funding needs for the year, with a significant portion of these sales coming from the mid-Atlantic markets. At the end of the first quarter, the company had an under-construction development pipeline for its pro-rata share totaled 1 billion. The development pipeline is currently expected to produce a weighted average spread between estimated stabilized yields and current market cap rates above the upper end of the company's 150 to 200 basis point targeted range.", "Next, transactions completed in the quarter. During the first quarter, we sold our 95% ownership interest in two land parcels located in Santa Monica, California for $24 million. This resulted in a gain to FFO of 1.7 million, which was backed out of FFO as adjusted.", "On to the second quarter and full year 2016 guidance, second quarter 2016 FFO, FFO as adjusted, and AFFO per share guidance is $0.43 to $0.45 and $0.39 to $0.41 respectively. At this time we are maintaining our full year guidance ranges for both earnings and same-store metrics. Full-year 2016 FFO, FFO as adjusted, and AFFO per share is forecasted at $1.75 to $1.81, a $1.75 to $1.81, and a $1.59 to $1.65, respectively. For same-store, our full year 2016 guidance remains unchanged, with revenue growth of 5.5% to 6%, expense 3.0% to 3.5%, and NOI 6.5% to 7.0%. Average 2016 occupancy remains forecasted at 96.6%.", "Due to the $174 million equity issuance in the quarter, we no longer anticipate a bond issuance later this year, and are updating our full-year interest expense guidance to 121 million to 125 million, from 128 million to 132 million. Other primary full-year guidance assumptions can be found on attachment 15 or page 26 of our supplement.", "Finally, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.295 in the first quarter or $1.18 per share when annualized, 6% above 2015's level, and representing a yield of approximately 3.3%. With that I'll turn the call over to Jerry.", "Jerry Davis", "Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon everyone. In my remarks I'll cover the following topics. First, our first quarter portfolio metrics, leasing trends and the rental rate growth we realized this quarter, and early results for the second quarter. Second, how our primary markets performed during the quarter with a high-level update for 2016, and 2017. And last, a brief update on our development lease-ups. We are pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. In the first quarter, same-store net operating income grew 8.0%, our highest growth rate since the first quarter of 2012.", "These results were driven by a very strong 6.4% year-over-year increase in revenue against a 2.7% increase in expenses. Our same-store revenue per occupied home increased by 6.7% year-over-year, to $1,897 per month, while same-store occupancy of 96.5% was down 20 basis points versus the prior year period. Total portfolio revenue per occupied home was $1,995 per month, including pro-rata JVs. Stable job growth, limited impact from new multi-family supply, rental preference from both new millennial households, empty-nesters, and everyone in-between all driving this continued growth.", "Turning to new and renewal lease rate growth, which is detailed on attachment 8E of our supplement, we grew new lease rates by 3.7% in the first quarter, 50 basis points below the first quarter of 2015. Renewal growth remained robust, at 6.9% in the first quarter, 120 basis points ahead of last year. On a blended rate basis, we averaged 5.3% during the first quarter, an improvement of 40 basis points versus the same period in 2015. In April, these trends continued with new lease and renewal rate growth of 4.2%, and 6.8% respectively. And our current physical occupancy is 96.5%. Our leasing success and stable occupancy gives us confidence that demand is more than sufficient to continue pushing rate higher throughout the upcoming prime leasing season in the majority of our markets.", "Next, move-outs to home purchase were flat year-over-year, at 13%, in line with our long-term average. Even with our strong renewal increases in the first quarter, less than 9% of our move-outs gave rent increases the reason for leaving.", "Before I move on to the quarterly performance in our primary markets, I'd like to give a general update on our general portfolio. First, third-party data indicates that in every one of our markets we expect supply to peak this year, with the exception being New York City. Second, job growth remains robust, and we continue to have strong pricing power in the majority of our markets. The overall economic environment we see today is very similar to what we provided in our two-year outlook.", "Now, moving on to the quarterly performance in our primary markets, which represent 70% of our same-store NOI, and 75% of our total NOI, Metro DC, which represents 18% of our total NOI posted year-over-year same-store revenue growth of 2.1%, compared to 1.9% in the first quarter of '15. We are forecasting the market to generate top line growth in 2016, between 2% and 3% as we will continue to benefit from our diverse 50-50 mix of A and B assets located both inside and outside the Beltway. In the first quarter, our A's and B's had very similar growth rates. Apartment supply in 2016 is expected to increase by 13,600 homes, and then fall to 9,000 homes in 2017. While job growth in 2017 is expect to increase by 1.9%, up from 1.6% in 2016.", "Our current forecast is that DC will have modestly-accelerating revenue growth in 2017, compared to 2016. Orange County in Los Angeles combined represent 16% of our total NOI. Orange County posted year-over-year revenue growth of 8.4%. We continue to remain very optimistic on Orange County as the market is only expected to see 5,000 units of new supply and nearly 35,000 jobs, implying a 7:1 ratio, which is roughly twice the long-term historical average. Revenue growth in L.A. was 8.8% during the quarter, continuation of very strong results in the back half of 2015 due to job growth and supply absorption in our Marina del Rey concentrated submarket.", "Lease-up pressure from almost 2,000 recently-delivered apartment homes in the neighboring Playa Vista market began negatively impacting our pricing power in the middle of the first quarter. And we think this competition will continue to affect us through the end of the third quarter. Fortunately, tech-related jobs continue to come to this part of Silicon Beach. Overall, L.A. will see over 12,000 apartment homes delivered in 2016, or about 1% of supply. And the market is projected to create 88,000 new jobs, again a 7:1 ratio. 2017 and 2018 are each projected currently to see deliveries flow to 7,000 to 8,000 homes per year, with job growth only slowing slightly.", "L.A. looks best to be a strong market over the next several years. And after we get past the short-term lease-up pressures in our Marina del Rey-Playa Vista submarket. We will get back on track to above average growth. We still anticipate full-year 2016 revenue growth in L.A. to be in the 6% range, and would expect 2017 to also be in that range.", "New York City represents 12% of our total NOI, and posted 5.8% revenue growth in the quarter. While our same-store properties are not directly affected by any new developments, we are beginning to feel the impact from the new supply in the Manhattan market. New Yorkers who typically have been loyal to their preferred neighborhoods are beginning to be enticed by pricing incentives in places like Midtown West. 2016 deliveries of 25,000 apartment homes are adding 1% to existing supply. 2017 is expected to have deliveries even higher, at 30,000 apartment homes. It's still right around 1% of existing supply. The higher deliveries in these years are directly related to the expiring 421 tax abatement program. Once we get through these multiyear elevated supply levels, new development should decrease significant. Job growth in 2016 and 2017 is expected to be right around 1.3% each year.", "For full year 2016, we have revised our revenue growth expectations down to about 5% in our New York portfolio, which is 50-60 basis points below our original business plan, because of the continuing pressures in new supply, we currently would project 2017 revenue growth in New York to be modestly lower than it will be in 2016. San Francisco, which represents 11% of our total NOI is feeling the effects of new supply in several sub markets, including software market. However, we still expect the bay area to be one of our best performing markets this year, with revenue growth of 7 to 8%.", "Same-store revenue growth in the first quarter was 9.6% due to the extremely strong blended rent growth we achieved in the second and third quarters of 2015. The good news is that 2016 will be the peak of deliveries this cycle at 12,600 apartments or roughly 3% of existing stock and the number gets cut roughly in half to 6800 homes in 2017 representing approximately 1.6% of existing stock. Annual job growth in 2016 and 2017 is expected to average about 2.5% each year. Although the Bay area is slowing, we still expect to be in above average market this year and next.", "Boston, which represents 7% of our total NOI produced a strong 6% revenue growth during the first quarter. One same-store property in the Back Bay neighborhood had revenue growth of 5% our suburban assets in the north shore were our strongest performers with growth of 7.5%. The Seaport district, home to our 2015 completion 100 Pier 4, continues to see more growth with additional office tenants in the submarket, including the first quarter that GE will be relocating to Seaport about one-half mile from our property.", "We started an additional this quarter in Boston South End, a 585 home $367 million project 345 Harrison Street. New supply in Boston is projected at 6100 homes in 2016 with slight deceleration in 2017 to 5500 homes. Both years represent less than 1.5% of existing stock.", "Job growth is currently forecasted to be about 1.5% both years. We expect revenue growth in 2017 to be comparable to this year. Seattle which represents 6% of our total NOI posted 8.4% revenue growth, continue to benefit from the strong growth inherent in our suburban B assets which are located in sub-markets that are less exposed to new supply. Long-term, we continue to like the downtown Seattle sub-market and believe that the ongoing creation of new jobs by companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Expedia will continue to drive demand in Seattle's urban core.", "The Bellevue submarket is in the midst of fairly heavy new multi family development that is not put up significant pressure on our portfolio as evidence by 7.7% revenue growth in Bellevue this quarter. Deliveries in metro Seattle are expected to peak in 2016 at 9800 apartment homes, before following the 6200 homes in 2017, while job growth continues at more than 2%. We expect revenue growth in 2017 to be comparable to this year.", "Last, Dallas, which represents just over 4.5% of our NOI, posted 5.8% year-over-year same-store revenue growth in the first quarter. Our B properties have revenue growth that was 400 basis points higher than A's as heavy new supply in uptown along with tollways and impacting rent growth in those submarkets. New supply in Dallas is projected to peak in 2016 at 18,000 new units and then drop to 12,700 in 2017. Job growth in the Dallas market should remain strong both years above 2.4%.", "Outside of our primary markets, such as Portland, Monterey Peninsula, the Sun Belt, Nashville in Austin, which comprised roughly 20% of our portfolio, we are above our initial expectations provided in our two year outlook. So we continue to have strong pricing power due to limited amount of new supply and robust job growth. Our expectation is that these markets have a long runway of growth due to favorable economics.", "April results came in inline with our plan, and as we look ahead in the new two months, we see improving pricing power, along with stable occupancy. Our 50-50 AB portfolio located throughout 20 markets has enabled our performance in our Sub Belt markets, Orange County, Portland, and Monterey Peninsula to offset markets that are being impacted by new supply in San Francisco, New York, and L.A. On a national basis, and within our core markets, apartment deliveries are expected to peak in 2016. Currently projections from Axiom Metrics have 2017 deliveries coming down over 25%. New York is the only market that we operate in that looks to experience a higher number of deliveries in 2017 than it had in 2016. Remember, that earlier this year, in our two-year outlook we indicated a 75 basis point deceleration in 2017 with a revenue growth guidance mid-point of 5%. Our overall view has not changed.", "I'll turn now to our four in lease-up developments, which you can find on attachment 9A and B or pages 19, and 20 of our supplement. Our share of these four properties represents $316 million or roughly 23% of our pipeline, inclusive of the West Coast development JV. In total, these properties are performing ahead of plan. 399 Fremont, our 447-home-$318 million lease-up in San Francisco, California took first move-ins in mid-March, and was 26% leased and 15% occupied at quarter end. Today, we are 29% leased and 24% occupied, with rents exceeding pro forma. We are currently offering a month concession, as planned, as this community, nothing that we will see increased competition for other lease-ups in the submarket in the near future.", "Katella Grand I, our 399-home, $138 million lease-up in Anaheim, California in the West Coast development JV was 37% leased and 29% occupied at quarter end. And as of today, is 47% leased and 37% occupied. We are currently offering less than one month of concessions with this community. And leasing has been very strong in April, with 41 applications.", "CityLine, our 244-home, $80 million lease-up in the Columbia City submarket of Seattle was 37% leased and 34% occupied at quarter end. Today, the property is 66% leased, and 52% physically occupied. 8th & Republican, our 211-home, $97 million lease-up in the South Lake Union submarket of Seattle was 8% leased and 0% occupied at quarter end. And today, it is 16% leased and 6% occupied. First units were available for move-in in mid-April.", "All in, we had a great first quarter, and we remain very positive on the outlook for multi-family fundamentals, and our ability to execute during the peak leasing season, and throughout the remainder of 2016.", "With that, I'll turn the call back to Tom.", "Tom Toomey", "Thank you, Jerry. And before opening up to Q&A, I want to take a moment to sum up our prepared remarks. We still feel very good about multifamily fundamental, and are at a phase in the cycle where market mix and price points of our portfolio are critical. As Jerry mentioned, due to changes in conditions some of our markets are underperforming, and some are outperforming our original expectations. However, on balance, our outlook for the portfolio is unchanged. This is a testament to our overall strategy and market mix, which is less volatile and more predictable, on average, throughout the cycles.", "We feel good about 2016 and '17, and remain on target. UDR has the right plan with right team in place to execute. And we feel confident about our future opportunities.", "With that, I will open it up to Q&A. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Austin Wurschmidt", "Hi, good morning. It's Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan. Just wanted to touch a little bit on the non-core asset sales, I was curious if you guys were looking to do a portfolio sale. What's the potential timing, and will you exit any additional markets? I know you mentioned a concentration in the Mid-Atlantic.", "Tom Toomey", "Jordan, this is Toomey. With regard to that, we're going to expose probably 300-plus million to the market on individual asset bases, and we'll see what the pricing comes in on those, and we feel like it's a good strong market to expose assets and we'll get good pricing on them.", "Austin Wurschmidt", "And how should we be thinking about pricing, what's sort of your cap rate expectations at this point?", "Tom Toomey", "Do you want to take it, Harry?", "Harry Alcock", "Sure. This is Harry. So it depends a little bit on the product mix. I can tell you, in general, the marketplace, Class As are trading at coastal Class As, and main to main locations are trading at four, sub-four. The Bs that would likely comprise most of what we sell, are going to trade between 5%-5.5% cap rates, and depending on location and specific asset type. There continues to be a strong bid for these assets, particularly in the B space, but A and C continues to be readily available. I can tell you Fannie and Freddie both expect to meet or actually exceed 2016 volume versus 2015. So it's a good time to sell assets right now.", "Austin Wurschmidt", "Thanks for the detail there. And then just touching a little bit on D.C., I mean, you continue to get a little bit of traction on new and renewal lease rates there, and I was just curious how that acceleration stacks up versus your expectation, and any detail you could provide on submarket trends and what you're seeing subsequent to quarter end?", "Jerry Davis", "Yes, sure, Austin. This is Jerry. D.C., again, we continue to think it bottomed about a year-and-a-half ago, late-2014, but we continue to see supply pressures and various submarkets throughout the Metro D.C. area, such as Arlington and Alexandria. What's interesting is we've seen the compression between what As and Bs are doing -- occur [ph]. Currently, it's probably less than 100 basis points. Our properties in that 14th and U Street neighborhood, including Capital View, View 14, Andover Place and Thomas Circle, those deals are all putting up probably about 3% revenue growth. And then a couple of the places over off Columbia Pike in Arlington are negative revenue growth right now.", "When you get outside the Beltway, even though outside tends to do a little bit better than inside the Beltway, we'll have a couple of properties out there in Woodbridge that are flat-to-slightly negative. So that the A-B mix has benefited us in the past, where these have significantly outperformed, but we are seeing neighborhoods in D.C. where supply has subsided, reacts very well and starting to see good rent growth. All in, D.C. is performing about where we expected. I'll touch on the home portfolio that we bought back in October, it's performing pretty much within plan -- in accordance with the plan that we had. We found a few opportunities to drive expenses down. We're in the process of spending coming close to $20 million on some initial capital expenditures, some on unit interiors, some on the exteriors of the properties, but as we chug through that we're seeing occupancy, which when we bought the portfolio, I think, was down around 92%. Today, occupancy in that portfolio has risen to between 95% and 96%.", "So D.C., I would tell you, is going according to plan. Our expectation this year, like I said in my prepared remarks, is that revenue will be between 2% and 3%, and then our expectation going further out is supply continues to be absorbed and '17 is better than '16.", "Austin Wurschmidt", "Great. Thanks for the color, and I'll yield [ph] the floor.", "Jerry Davis", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.", "John Kim", "Thank you. I just wanted to clarify your reduced outlook on New York. So it seems like you have 6% renewal growth this quarter and unusually low turnover of 20%, but you see revenue declining in 2017. So I just wanted to ask if that's purely due to increased vacancy, or do you see rates coming down as well?", "Jerry Davis", "No, I think it's going to be more rate. I think occupancy there will stay in the 97-98 range. Today it's in the high-96s. The recent turnover was down really in the first quarter as we moved more of our explorations into the more seasonally high demand second and third quarter. So it wasn't purely that we were retaining more people. It was more that we had fewer explorations in the first quarter. So we are definitely feeling the effect of the supply pressures, whether it's Midtown, West, Brooklyn, they're starting to have an effect on our Financial District properties. And if you really stratify what we did in the city in the first quarter, our two down in the Financial District popped revenue growth of about 4.5%, and our Chelsea and Murray Hill properties came in north of seven.", "So we're feeling it a little bit more in the Financial District. And then if you go up to our MetLife JV property in the Upper West Side, Columbus Square, that one is definitely feeling the effect of the supply in the Upper West Side, and have revenue growth of about 1%-1.5%. So I don't think you'll see us -- that the slowdown that I talked about in '17, I think is going to be more rate-driven than occupancy.", "John Kim", "And how comfortable do you feel in your 2016 outlook in New York given, as you mentioned, we're heading into the busy leasing season?", "Jerry Davis", "Yes, New York, actually, it's doing about as well in April as it did in the first quarter. I mean, I would've hoped it would've accelerated, but it hasn't yet, but new lease rate growth in April is about 2.5%-2.6%, but renewal rate growth has jumped up to 6.7%. So I think we did a good job pushing those into the stronger periods, but we feel good about where I expect now. I think I said on the prepared remarks that we've revised our expectations there from being high-fives to low-fives. I guess there is the possibility if we continue to encounter more significant supply pressures that could come a bit lower, but right now, pretty comfortable in that five range.", "John Kim", "Okay, thanks Jerry.", "Jerry Davis", "Sure.", "Operator", "I'll go next to Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI.", "Rich Hightower", "Hey, good afternoon guys.", "Jerry Davis", "Hey, Rich.", "So just a quick question on the schedule of new and renewal rates in the press release, really appreciate the detail there. As it relates to the different markets with different factors sort of offsetting one another, is there a way for you to peg the likes of hitting above the midpoint of the same-store range that didn't really change the several puts and takes during the quarter, in that sense?", "Jerry Davis", "I guess I would say this, overall, and maybe -- hopefully this will answer your question. Overall, first quarter came in where we thought it would. So far, in April we're right on track also. You're always going to have some markets that perform a little bit better than expectations. Some that are below, and obviously, the three that we spoke to in the prepared remarks that are currently under are San Francisco, New York, and Los Angeles. And the reason for this under performance really is the effects of new supply. We've talked for years that continuing to get 10% revenue growth in San Francisco wasn't long-term sustainable. And I guess the developers and city officials also took notice of this. And this previously undersupplied market is getting a slug of new supply right now.", "Fortunately for us, it's going to peak this year, then start to decelerate next year. But what we notice too, and I had this in our remarks, is success of new lease-up properties that are putting some of this pressure on us. That our 399 Fremont lease-up is well ahead of leasing velocity. We're getting rental rates that are above pro forma rents, which were $6 a foot. And we're giving away one month free. So what really shows up is there is demand, and there is traffic for apartments. But we have a lease-up property that's basically getting discounted down 8% because of one month free. You're going to find it harder to push rate on thanks to our properties. But yes, those -- we do have the three underperformers. We also, as I stated earlier, we've got about a third of the company that is exceeding expectations. And those are Orange County, which is I won't say significantly, but it's ahead of where we expected. Our two markets in Florida, Orlando and Tampa are significantly ahead of what we would've expected when we did our business plan. As is Nashville, Portland, and Monterey. And I think the big difference between the ones that are underperforming and those that are outperforming is which ones are being affected by new supply.", "Those that I just said that are outperforming tend to be B product, which doesn't compete as much against new supply, and they're in markets that really are not getting heavy doses of supply.", "Rich Hightower", "All right, that's very helpful. And then maybe as one quick follow-up there as it relates to the A/B strategy and Bs outperforming on account of new supply, is it entirely a function of less supply with the B assets versus A, or is there also an element of trading down or anything else on the demand side of the equation that might be leading to outperformance there in general?", "Jerry Davis", "I think it's predominantly lack of new supply. I mean, there could be some situation of trading down. We've seen the reasons for move-out being rent increase. We're to about 9%, that's stable with where it was about a year ago. We've got two markets that are above 20%, and those are San Francisco, and Los Angeles. And even though you could sit there and think maybe it's because they're getting priced out of the market. When we really see forwarding addresses on where these people move to, they're frequently moving to that brand new supply down that street that's offering the one-month free. Or in the case of Marina del Rey, a month-and-a-half to two months free. The price is then similar to what we were asking them to pay.", "So we're able to trade up, if you will, into a brand new community, but it's at the same rate. So I don't think it's price-fatigue. There's probably a little bit of that that's inching in there, but I think it's predominantly supply.", "Rich Hightower", "All right, great. Thanks, Jerry.", "Jerry Davis", "Sure.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Nick Joseph with Citi.", "Nick Joseph", "Thanks. Can you give us an update on the West Coast Development JV, and it looks like a few of the assets are now in lease-up, and what you're seeing in those markets?", "Harry Alcock", "Sure. I'll start, and then Jerry can jump in. Two of the assets are in lease-up, CityLine in Seattle, and Katella I in Anaheim. And as Jerry mentioned in his prepared remarks, they're both leasing up very well. We just started leasing 8th and Republican, and South Lake Union near Amazon. We've at least, I don't know, 10% or so of the units\u2026", "Jerry Davis", "16.", "Harry Alcock", "16% of the units at this point. The next ones are going to be Downtown L.A. asset that will be in leasing in the third quarter. And then the second phase of the Katella project, which would be in leasing early next year.", "Jerry Davis", "Yes, but Nick, I'll give you a little more color on how well those lease-ups are doing. As Harry said, they're all at or above what we expected. Katella Grand has probably been my biggest surprise. It's up in the Platinum Triangle. And we're getting rents that we anticipated, and call it the $2.25 to $2.30 a foot range. Then able to drive that thing up to 37% leased and 36% occupied using, typically, less than a month free. So that one's been a big surprise, to me, how strong it was. But I think it is a special project.", "CityLine up in the Columbia City location, that one got off the ground a little bit slow. And we cut rate a bit to get velocity going in the first quarter. But we caught back up to our budgeted occupancy level. And today, that property is 66% leased, 52% physical. And we've gotten rents back above market rate. And we brought concessions in at about a month free now. And the third one that is doing real well right now is 8th and Republican. And we opened the doors to that one about two weeks ago in a very, or as I've stated a minute ago, we're about 16% leased and 6% physical. One extra benefit that we found out a month or two ago, we thought we were getting dropped right in between Amazon land. Google announced recently that they're going to be putting a few offices up within several blocks of this property too and they will be out a couple of years.", "Tom Herzog", "This is Herzog, too, Nick. I'll add one other thing. Keep in mind, with the West Coast development JV that we do get a 6.5% pref [ph] until such time as the assets are stabilized as defined. And they absorb any operating losses during that time period. So, in the meantime, while these are stabilizing, we're earning a 6.5% on our investment.", "Nick Joseph", "Thanks, and then just on the new development in Boston, can you talk about the desirability of that project and expectations in terms of the spread over existing cap rates that you expect to achieve?", "Harry Alcock", "Sure, Nick. This is Harry. I'll talk about this for a couple of minutes. First, we're building a project in a location that will appeal to a broad range of renters. I'll talk about the neighborhood first, and then economics. This is a new location within the South End, which is one of Boston's most desirable neighborhoods. It's primarily a residential district with old 19th century brownstones. But this particular location is only a 10-minute walk to the Financial District, the Back Bay, and GE's new headquarters that'll bring 800 new employees to Boston. There's tons of restaurants, bars, galleries, and boutiques along Fremont Street. Our side is located directly across the street from a new Whole Foods Market that opened last year.", "There's been some recently built apartment projects, ink block in the Troy totaling more than 800 units that are nearly fully leased up. The first condo building across the street sold out. And prior to completion of more than a $1000 a foot, they have just started construction on a second condo building related companies purchased a site, kitty-corner from ours, and is into the city for approval of 175 apartments and 100 condos.", "In terms of economics, yield based on today's rents is about 5.5%. If we get 3% revenue and expense growth for the three plus years, the yield will grow to above six, and more than 200 basis points above today's cap rates. Rents today are more than $400 below our Pier 4 deal that we leased up in seven months last year. When you are comparing similar unit types and like similar assets in Boston, the cap rate for this asset would be very low like lease-up 4% cap rate.", "We believe in fact that this location could outperform Boston overall, which according to Axial averages nearly 4% per annum through 2019. In addition to Whole Foods and retail and residential construction, our units and our 40,000 square feet of retail will help complete the transition of this new location within a very established and desirable overall neighborhood. Downtown Boston expects to average less than 1500 unit deliveries per year through 2020, and we also believe supply is manageable.", "Nick Joseph", "Thanks.", "Tom Toomey", "Thanks, Nick.", "Operator", "We will go next to Richard Anderson with Mizuho Securities.", "Rich Anderson", "Thanks. Good morning out there. So if you are doing 8% same-store NOI growth this first quarter, and it sounds like you're going to have a good second quarter, and your guidance is 6.75% still, should we be assuming that you're expecting a supply-induced meaningful deceleration in the second half of the year? Is that how we should read this at this point?", "Jerry Davis", "Rich, I will start that. This is Jerry. I mean, really when you think about what makes up your revenue growth, it's really the -- it's any change in your occupancy year-over-year and then it's really the weighted blended average of increases for renewals and new leases over the preceding 12th period. So when you really look at how our revenue growth will decelerate over the years, you're really having to look for example in second quarter what did we do in second quarter last year on blended growth and what do we expect to do this year in second quarter on blended growth. And because last year the second and third quarters were extremely strong, and as we go into this year's second and third quarter, the rate growth is going to be less than it was last year. You have a natural deceleration.", "Now, I guess you could say accurately that it is primarily coming from new supply deceleration that is predominantly occurring in those three markets I talked about earlier, because they have the heavier weighting on our total revenue growth, but I guess long story short, I think you kind of hit it on the head, but I just wanted to make sure people really understand what the components are that really drive the rate growth. For example in first quarter of this quarter what we achieved in the third quarter of 2015 adding more of an impact on first quarter revenue growth than what we achieved as far as rate growth in the first quarter.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay.", "Tom Toomey", "Let me add to that. One of the things I'd have you keep in mind is we obviously had a good start to 2016 from a same-store perspective. And as we look at guidance for the balance of the year, it's still too early to make any modifications in our view. We want to get more into peak leasing season, but we do feel good about where we are at, and we will revisit again next quarter.", "Rich Anderson", "I appreciate that. Thanks, Tom. And then, one of the little tidbits I find interesting is that your development pipeline is at the top end of your kind of range of incremental yields, close to 200 basis points and yet you're worried about supply all around you. I mean, why do you suppose that those two opposite sort of things are happening right now? I would think maybe with elevated level of supply, your own development pipeline would be at least underperforming a little bit in that environment. Can you just kind of walk through that?", "Tom Toomey", "Rich, this is Toomey. I think it's a testament to Harry and his team. I mean, they have found very good site. They've done a good job of reading what the market opportunity is, and providing a hell of a good product. And I think you're seeing that both last year with Boston and this year with San Francisco. So I think it's a little bit of that aspect of it, if you will. I think it's a fair question. We're probably new to it, and we wanted it little bit more, and try to come up with reasons. We're really focusing on the forward aspect of the business. And we want to stay discipline about allocating our capital and sustaining that type of gap or accretion, if you will. And normally that's -- people wander into the subject of would you expand it? And I don't think we will. I think we're going to stay very disciplined about our development and keep going forward.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay, sounds good. Thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Nick Yulico with UBS.", "Nick Yulico", "Thanks. I was hoping you could shed a little bit more light on why the joint venture assets are underperforming so much on a same-store growth basis they did; 1% same-store NOI growth versus 8% for the rest of your portfolio, I guess you talked about in New York what else is going on there?", "Jerry Davis", "Yes, Nick, this is Jerry. When you really look at it, and I think we stated this earlier, A and especially A plus product competes more against new supply than B. We stated before that the spread between As and Bs in your same-store pool is probably about 100 basis points. But when you do look at the MetLife assets, and there is -- again, there is 24 assets I believe in the same-store pool in MetLife. There's five of them that are in urban course where heavy new supply is hitting -- that's definitely hitting A plus product. One of those is in downtown Seattle. One is in Washington D.C. One is Columbus Square, up in the upper West side. One is in uptown Dallas, and then the last one is in downtown Austin. Those five properties make up 41% of the total NOI for MetLife JV, and they have a revenue growth of 0.6%. So, you know, under 1% because they're going head-to-head against so much new supply.", "When you look at the expense side, you have situations where I believe last year in the first quarter we had pretty good real estate tax, the appraisals have benefited us, but it's predominantly because of those five properties that are in the urban core of heavy new supply urban locations.", "Nick Yulico", "Okay. Yes, that helpful. I guess my follow-up on that was, you know, if I go through your proxy and I look at some of the short-term compensation metrics for executives, one piece is that same-store revenue growth in market versus your peer group, and then I'm wondering why then it makes sense to be carving out, I think that calculation causes out the MetLife JV assets, which seems like it would actually be that beneficial if you're thinking about how your portfolio is being comp versus your peers which often have less JVs or don't have as much exposure with the JV in a market like New York or Boston?", "Tom Toomey", "Nick, this is Toomey. It's a good question. First, when we manage and set forth budgets with Met, we have them as a partner in the room, and they weigh in on how they want to be asset run, and we weigh in on it. And we usually somewhere in the middle of that arrive at how we're going to manage the assets. I think, second, we saw the pressure that Jerry alluded to, with ultra A assets, and we really have that conversation run those assets in that manner, and we have since day one disclosed it transparently.", "With respect to the comp point on the issue, we're very comfortable, we have deliberation with the Board internally that we've got the right comp plan and we launched the right action, which is to win our market. And I think we do that pretty darn consistently, and I think it's a testament to Jerry and his operating team and the innovation that they drive. So we're comfortable with our plan, and how we treated the Met JVs and disclosed them.", "Nick Yulico", "Okay. Thanks, Tom.", "Operator", "We will go next to Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird.", "Drew Babin", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. First question, just kind of going back to Nick's question on MetLife; the expense growth was relatively high in that JV, to your point about kind of working with MetLife you control the expenses, is there anything in that you might do differently if you're in 100% control of the property, or is there anything that can be done on the expense side, or is that kind of just an outsized impact from 421 in New York?", "Tom Herzog", "Some of it's outsized impact, some of it's also is real estate tax, timing of real estate tax refunds last year versus this year, and you really need to see a full year and not judge it purely on a quarter. But you will find also in some of these locations where there is heavy new supply, things like personnel growth, because in places where there is heavy new supply, you're constant competition to get the best employees to work for you. So that can drive that number up to. But I can tell you this, we typically attempt on any initiatives that we're rolling out for expense reductions, whatever we do for UDR, we typically do UDR wholly-owned we typically do with MetLife portfolio also.", "Drew Babin", "Makes sense, and then secondly just looking at private equity appetite for real estate assets, obviously there's been a very strong bid for theoretically more stable suburban properties with home properties and associated states being bought Starwood buying to our portfolio et cetera. What are you seeing in these eight markets in TBDs in terms of who is looking at assets, are you receiving any interests externally from any of the large private equity players, was their appetite kind of more geared towards stable, more stable assets with theoretically higher yields?", "Harry Alcock", "This is Harry. I think on the -- you have a sort of a by and large a bifurcated buyer class between the main and main class A assets, which are going to be pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and we're starting to see an influx of investment from Canada from the Middle East and Asia. And perhaps to a lesser degree the private equity funds typically have slightly higher IRR hurdles than these others. And therefore while they do they buckets of money that would lend itself to buying A properties, they tend to buy kind of buy A minus properties primarily. At least that's what you've seen historically. That's what we're seeing now that, that there is both asset classes we are seeing very deep buyer pools, which has obviously positively impacted asset pricing.", "In terms of others sort of reaching out to us, that's something that happens routinely, whether it's from private equity firms or sovereign wealth firms or other buyers, and that happens routinely at really at all points in the cycle.", "Tom Herzog", "Nick and Drew; if Nick you're still on the call, I want to loop back on the Met thing, a couple of points occurred to me and I was just looking at this notes. Just a reminder, that's 10% of our NOI, you know, we're consistently treated at, and sometimes it's better and sometimes it's worse than the wholly-owned portfolio. But what I look at and we go over every year with our Board, our IRR is going to returns on our investments from beginning to the end. And it's a good thorough review, and I'm just looking at the math coming up on its sixth year that we've been co-investing with them in this JV, and the IRRs are now at better than 15.5%. So I think it's been a very good investment, a very good relationship, and one that we look forward to continuing in the future.", "Drew Babin", "That's helpful, thank you.", "Operator", "And we will go next to John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.", "John Pawlowski", "Jerry, thanks for the operating update for April in New York; could you share a new lease and renewal growth trends for April in San Francisco, and what you're seeing heading into May?", "Jerry Davis", "Sure. I don't have May on me right now, but in April, San Francisco's new was 2.8%, and renewals were fairly stable with where they were in the first quarter at 7.5%.", "John Pawlowski", "Thanks. And lastly, what drove the decision to sell the two land partials in California?", "Harry Alcock", "This is Harry. Two projects are in Santa Monica, they both had sort of retail type operating assets on the partials, and as we pursue the re-entitlement of those sites over the past several years, it became obvious to us that the city was not going to sort of cooperate and allow a re-zoning of those assets, and so we sold them to retail units.", "John Pawlowski", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we will now next to Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jana Galan", "Thank you. Jerry, I really appreciate the market outlook for supply and job growth. Do you think that we also need to see wage growth accelerate to continue the success you had in your renewal increases?", "Jerry Davis", "I don't think it would hurt obviously. I still think even with the wage growth that we've been having over the last several years, we've seen, and with going on with the rent growth we've had. We still have rent to income level that's pretty consistent with where it has been at about 23%. And we haven't seen a huge spike in turnover. So we're not driving many more people out because of rent growth, but yes, I think anytime you can see some wage growth improvement, that's helpful. I'd say a couple of things that have helped somewhat is for our suburban, especially B renters, lower gas prices have kind of supplemented their wage growth.", "And I think when you look at the more urban dwellers, I don't think again it's so much wage growth that's affecting us there. It's their ability to jump to new lease-up, but I'm never going to argue against wage growth. When you see indications that whether it's California, or different cities in California, or Seattle has done rents in the minimum wages to $15, even though to put a little bit of expense pressure maybe on operators like us, because it will drive -- even though we don't have many people that makes below $15 an hour for an unskilled job. When you have skills that will spread that gap up, I think overall -- I think wage growth like that's going to be good for our sector, and would help us continue to drive rate.", "Jana Galan", "Thank you. That's it from me.", "Jerry Davis", "Thanks, Jana.", "Operator", "We will go next to Rob Stevenson with Janney.", "Rob Stevenson", "Thanks. Jerry, in Tampa and Orlando, at this rate, how long do you expect to be able to keep this up and is there is a situation where you worry about -- now, it's sort of $1200 a month rent for largely class B products that you're getting into the point where people can afford townhouses and condos in those markets and you could start seeing some move out and accelerate?", "Jerry Davis", "I mean, you always worry about that, and you have worried about that in the past. Today, about 15%, little over 15% of our move outs in Tampa are to purchase homes. So it's not huge. That people that qualify for the homes want to have to own a home, and I do think in that market you can see high single-digit new and renewal growth for a long period of time. I don't think it's going to last forever. I think it's been a very good multiyear run. I think it can use to run for another year or two, because we're not been affected by new supply.", "Job growth has been better than in the past. It's been higher quality biotech and medical jobs that have been coming to places like Orlando. But now, do I think it can continue at the levels that it's at today for multiple years? I don't think so, but I don't think it decelerates rapidly in 2017 either.", "Rob Stevenson", "Okay. And then Harry\u2026", "Tom Herzog", "On a lighter note, I think Jerry is going to give all our existing residents a Netflix account and send them the big short movie.", "Rob Stevenson", "Harry, in terms of land, I mean, how aggressive have you guys been these days, and is there anything reasonably priced in your core markets, or is it now sort of going to condo developers and other bidders at higher levels that you guys are comfortable buying land for future development?", "Harry Alcock", "Well, I guess there's a couple of things; one, we're continuing to look at land size in markets where we historically have built on the coast, and in addition we're continuing to work through the MetLife land bank and we've got projects in Seattle and in L.A. in the East Bay, and expect it will continue to grind through those and expect to start some of those over the next couple of years. Really you should think about it, the sites that we are looking at, these are going to be sort of late '17, and 2018 starts. And so, when we are looking at the fundamentals of these markets, where we have declining supply, really in '17 and '18, these are going to be '19 and '20 deliveries.", "But to answer your question specifically it is somewhat more challenging. Clearly, the number of percentage of projects that pencil today is much lower than it had been historically, but we expect to continue to find enough projects both externally and within our MetLife JV, using consistent underwriting standards without any type of aggressive rent growth assumptions. So we'll continue to maintain similar development pipeline as we have historically, and fit within our 900 million to a billion core type target.", "Rob Stevenson", "Does this force you to do more sort of Santa Monica type of things, where you have to buy stuff on the anticipation that you could try to get re-zone and take that sort of risk out there these days in order to find site?", "Harry Alcock", "Not necessarily. It doesn't mean that we won't a little bit of that. Again, we try to manage the amount of sort of preconstruction risk we take, but for example, if you look at a market like Boston, where we just started a project and therefore we would expect to start the next project sometime in two or three years, clearly, if we found that an adequate site, it's conceivable that we would take some entitlement risk. But we don't necessarily think that's something that we are going to have to do a lot of.", "Rob Stevenson", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "We will go next to Michael Lewis with SunTrust.", "Michael Lewis", "Hi. Thank you. You talked quite a bit about supply peaking everywhere, but New York in 2016, and I was just wondering how comfortable you are that 2016 will be the peak supply year, because as long as you have strong fundamentals, higher occupancy, positive rent growth, low cap rates, it may entice more people to build, it's working for you right, so it might work for others. So, just curious what your thoughts are on that?", "Tom Toomey", "Michael, this is Toomey. A very good question, and one thing that we alluded to a couple of years, when we saw the banking industry becoming further and further consolidated and regulated is we realized the impact would be -- as the Fed would have the ability to choke off construction loads. And what we are currently seeing in the marketplace and if you talk to private developers is securing a loan for new development in the multifamily space is getting very, very difficult. And you are going to see them less in deals, because it's going to require more equity, there is going to be less proceeds out of construction, and tougher underwriting.", "I think that combined with the transparency of operating environment and cities difficulties around zoning and entitlement processes is going to slow it down a great deal. And I didn't hear any development in the last three months, talking with a lot of private guys that said, \"Hey, we think we are going to do more business in '17 than we are doing right now.\" Everybody looks at it and says, \"We are pulling back. We will be enforced to pull back, and we will have to re-look at our numbers and come up with more equity.\" So I think that's going to be the biggest choke point about new supply and it's certainly not the demand side of the equation, it is certainly there, and we will persist for many more years. It's the supply is going to choke down.", "Michael Lewis", "Thanks. And that's actually a good -- your answer does lead into my second question, which is you have an outlook out there through 2017, do you think by the time we get to the end of that outlook, this dynamic between the suburbs outperforming the center city and B's doing better than A's, do you think that dynamic will start to shift by the end of 2017, or do you think will still be an environment like that?", "Tom Toomey", "Well, you are asking a very broad question, and it's hard to draw a blanket over the whole U.S. We can take individual markets and probably take it offline and go through those, but my view on long-term is that a lot of developers are moving out to the suburbs, where they are building kind of an A minus product to a price point sensitive customer, and they are going to be able to put up a lot more doors quicker in that type of environment. And the suburbs by the time '17 arrives will be probably turning over. I think they are going to be a good spot for '16 and '17, but after that I would suspect that they are going to start seeing the same supply pressures that we are seeing in some of the urban markets today. And so, they will probably start turning over then.", "Michael Lewis", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Hey. Thank you, and sorry, I hopped on late this busy earning day. So if you answered this, I apologize. But on the Santa Monica land, did you guys say how long you owned that land for?", "Tom Toomey", "Alex, we bought it in the second half of 2012; so, about three and half years.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay. And just given that you guys, you know the coastal markets well, was it just something, did -- was the pushback on the entitlement changed much -- was it much different than you originally thought, or you always thought it would be a difficult one to get done and you were just willing to buy it and see if you could get it done?", "Tom Toomey", "Well, Alex, at the time that we acquired it, that was a -- Santa Monica was granting these re-zoning types of projects that would allow for a certain density in a lot of these sites. Shortly after we acquired it, the city basically shutdown, and I remember in the year 2014, they issued something like 50 total building permits. And so, basically over the three years, it became obvious to us that we were not going to get these sites re-zoned anytime soon, given that they had existing retail uses, and we had retail buyers available, we decided to get rid of them.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay. And do you have any other in the rest of the portfolio, any land positions, anything that's sort of comparable?", "Tom Toomey", "No.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay, thank you.", "Tom Herzog", "Alex, I should add one thing.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Sure.", "Tom Herzog", "Just keep in mind on those two small land assets that had a little bit of retail on top of them. We did ultimately sell them both at gain. So, for what it's worth, there were some gains, but it was more gain.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Gains are good. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Austin Wurschmidt", "Hey, guys, it's Austin here again. Just one quick follow-up, Jerry, I was wondering if you could give a little color, your thoughts on some of the rental rate moratorium and other regulations that we have seen in Northern California, particularly with regard to the vintage of your Northern California portfolio.", "Jerry Davis", "Yes, you know there have been a few things that have come up, there were some meetings last week, or the week before in San Mateo that talked about properties built I think before 1980, or -- it's 20 to 30-year-old product, but it seemed like it got shot down pretty quickly, but I can tell you this, our two deals in San Mateo are older than that. So if it's passed, those potentially would be affected. The other ones that we've heard about, but we are not directly affected are -- I think it was a 90-day restriction on renewal growth in Oakland, and not positive effect, past just talked about, just directly affect us.", "And then the other one that was getting talked about I believe was in San Jose, you know, putting a -- moving the cap on renewals on rent control buildings, I think was going from 8% to 5%. Ours is not a rent control building. So I don't think it would have any effect on us in San Jose, and our asset there is a little bit newer. So at this point, I think the only one that potentially in the future could affect us if it did get passed, but again it seems like it shot down pretty quickly by City Council in San Mateo.", "Austin Wurschmidt", "Great. Thanks for the detail.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no other questions in the queue. I will turn it back to Tom Toomey for any closing remarks.", "Tom Toomey", "Well, thank you all of you for attempting, for being on this call today, I know it was a long call, but I thought it was very fruitful to have a good dialog and go through the markets in detail. A reminder to you as I listen to the questions and reading the call notes, a lot of you is right now on focus on the short-term, and really we are focused on the long-term aspects of the business, which do not remain anything, but positive. The demographics are on our side. The supply/demand curve is on our supply side to be able to execute our strategy, deliver solid growing cash flow and paying dividends.", "And so, I think the construct of the business is great, where we're from a strategic standpoint of being in the markets we're in, the mix of portfolios and the management team to execute on that. And so, we think the future is very bright. We think just as we've always tried to be very transparent about the operations of the business, when you back up and you look at the end results of the cash flow growth, the prospects for the balance of the year in '17 as well, we're very excited about those prospects and eager to just keep working on those.", "And so with that, I will close, and we thank you and look forward to seeing many of you in the next conferences over the next couple of months. Take care.", "Operator", "And that does conclude today's conference call. We appreciate your participation.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

On the call with me today are Shawn Johnston, Interim Principal Financial Officer; and Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our results; as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.", "The second quarter of 2016 was another great quarter for UDR, with 8% AFFO growth, driven by strong revenue growth of 5.7% and continued leasing strength in the 400 million development and lease up. This is a direct reflection of the continued execution of our strategic plan. At the core of our strategic plan are four elements.", "First, a focus on cash flow growth for our shareholders through operational excellence, which Jerry will touch on later. Second, an accretive development pipeline that can be fully self-funded. Third, a diverse portfolio mix of 20 markets with A&B communities in urban and suburban locations. And lastly, a safe low levered balance sheet. ", "Combined, these four elements are designed to provide the greatest predictability of cash flow growth through a variety of economic cycles. This is reflected in our updated guidance range for the full year with a mid-point resulting in 8% AFFO growth per share, which Shawn will touch on in his remarks.", "Before I turn the call over to Shawn, I wanted to add a couple of comments on the recent departure of Tom Herzog, our former CFO. While Tom was an exceptional CFO, he left UDR with an impressive bench, and I feel confident in the skills of those in the finance and accounting team to be more than adequate to handle his absence. At this time Shawn Johnston, our Chief Accounting Officer is serving as our Interim Principle Financial Officer, while we evaluate both internal and external candidates. Shawn is an exceptional candidate for the role and we are glad to have him serving in an interim capacity now. ", "With that, I will turn the call over to Shawn Johnston for additional comments on the quarter.", "Shawn Johnston ", "Thanks, Tom. The topics I will cover today include our second quarter results, our balance sheet update and our third quarter and full year guidance update. Our second quarter earnings results were at the top end of our previously provided guidance. FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $0.44, $0.45 and $0.41 respectively. Second quarter's same-store revenue, expense, and NOI growth were 5.7%, 5.5%, and 5.7% respectively.", "Second quarter expense growth was elevated due to a higher than expected property tax assessment on our 2014 development completion in San Francisco. Historically, San Francisco is value developments for tax purposes, by using a mix of cost to construct and income capitalization. While we budgeted for a mix that was weighted more towards the interim method than precedent would indicate, 100% of the valuation was eventually based on interim capitalization. This unexpected assessment resulted in a charge of $2.2 million during the quarter. $1.1 million of this was attributable to the period that the community was included in our same-store population, and was recognized as a digital same-store expense during the quarter.", "The remaining portion of the charge is for real estate taxes while the community was in lease up, which can be found in Attachment 5. Excluding this negative tax variance, quarterly same store expense growth for the portfolio and the San Francisco Bay area would have been 3.4% and 9.9% respectively versus the 5.5% and 33.1% realized.", "Next, the balance sheet. At quarter end, our liquidity as measured by cash and credit facility capacity was $876 million. Our financial leverage on an un-depreciated cost basis was 33.2%. Based on quarter and market gap, it was 23.6% and inclusive of JVs it was 28.1%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 5.3 times, and inclusive of JVs with 6.3 times. All balance sheet metric improvements were ahead of our strategic plan.", "I would like to point out a few changes to our supplemental package. First, you\u2019ll note that we have provided additional GAAP metrics in both our release and supplement in response to the recent SEC interpretation regarding GAAP and non-GAAP metrics. I\u2019d also like to direct you to Attachment 15 or Page 28 of our supplement, where we have updated our full year guidance. We are now providing both our previous and updated guidance for ease of comparison.", "With that, we have tightened our full year 2016 FFO per share guidance range to $1.76 to $1.80, and tightened and increased our FFO as adjusted an AFFO per share guidance ranges to $1.77 to $1.80 and $1.61 to $1.64 respectively. A few key items have impacted our original guidance. First, our same store portfolio is performing in line with original guidance, but our Metlife properties which are primarily urban A have underperformed our expectations. This underperformance has been offset by the outperformance of our development lease ups. Second, the S&P 500 inclusion trade resulted in some dilution. However, this issuance gave us the flexibility to change the timing of other planned 2016 capital events to offset the majority of the dilution and ultimately have resulted in an improved balance sheet.", "Lastly, we expect a reduction in our full year incentive compensation, which is partially offset by higher than expected healthcare cost, resulting in a net reduction to G&A expense of $2 million at the midpoint. A few other specifics from the page. We increased our sources guidance by $75 million at the midpoint to a range of $650 million to $750 million for the year. This is due to an increase in planned dispositions, which we now anticipate being approximately $400 million for the year. In addition to the $400 million of sales, we have issued a $174 million of common equity, with the remainder of the sources coming from secured debt refinancings. We do not anticipate any additional equity issuances through the remainder of the year.", "Our debt maturities increased by $60 million as we have accelerated the accretive prepayment on some existing secured debt to the earliest possible date without penalty. Additionally, we reduced our development, redevelopment and land acquisition guidance by $50 million at the midpoint due to timing of spend, and we increased our acquisition guidance by a $100 million in order to satisfy some Section 31 exchanges that we would like to complete this year.", "For same store, our full year 2016 guidance remains unchanged, with revenue growth of 5.5% to 6%; expense 3% to 3.5% and NOI growth of 6.5% to 7%. Average 2016 occupancy remains forecasted at 96.6%. Third quarter 2016 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance is $0.44 to $0.46, $0.44 to $0.46 and $0.39 to $0.41 respectively. Finally, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.295 in the second quarter or a $1.18 per share when annualized; 6% above 2015\u2019s level, which represents a yield of approximately 3.2%. ", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Jerry.", "Jerry Davis", "Thanks, Shawn, and good afternoon. In my remarks I will cover the following topics. First, our second quarter portfolio metrics, leasing trends and the rental rate growth we realized this quarter, and early results for the third quarter. Second, how our primary markets performed during the quarter, and last, a brief update on our development lease-ups.", "We are pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. In the second quarter, same-store net operating income grew 5.7%. These results were driven by a 5.7% year-over-year increase in revenue against a 5.5% increase in expenses. Year-to-date, through June 30th we've achieved NOI growth of 6.8% behind revenue growth of 6% and expense growth of 4.1%. ", "Our same-store revenue per occupied home increased 6% year-over-year to $1,921 per month, while same-store occupancy of 96.6% was down 30 basis points versus the prior year period. Total portfolio revenue per occupied home was $2,027 per month, including pro-rata JVs. Although we are feeling the impact of new supply in a few of our core markets, namely San Francisco and New York, the positives we see continue to outweigh the negatives. Stable job growth, new household formations, better delay in home purchase, choosing to rent, as well as empty nester baby boomers moving to an urban setting with a live, work, play atmosphere. Our portfolio mix benefits from each of these scenarios. ", "Turning to new and renewal lease rate growth, which is detailed on attachment 8G of our supplement, we grew our new lease rates by 4.4% in the second quarter, 330 basis points below the second quarter of 2015. Renewal growth remained robust at 6.3% in the second quarter or 70 basis points behind last year. On a blended rate basis, we averaged 5.3% during the second quarter, a reduction of 210 basis points versus the same period last year.", "If you look at the 76% of the same-store portfolio not located in New York and San Francisco, our decline in blended rate growth was only 100 basis points. I'd like to point out the exceptional growth we achieved in 2015 was an anomaly. We are now back to a normal operating environment. ", "Typically, renewal rate growth outpaces new lease rate growth by at least a 100 basis points. Because we were able to drive our occupancy in late 2014 to the 96.5% to 97% level, we were able to push new lease rate growth in the peak leasing season in 2015, higher than that of renewal leases. 2016 is proving to be a more normalized year with renewal growth outpacing new lease rate growth. While we wish every year could be as strong as 2015, we are very happy with the strength seen in 2016 thus far; specially given that we are currently dealing with peak deliveries in the majority of our markets. Next, move-outs to home purchase were up a 150 basis points year-over-year, at 14.1%, and even with our strong renewal increases in the second quarter, less than 9% of our move-outs gave rent increase as the reason for leaving.", "Now moving on to the quarterly performance in our primary markets which represent 70% of our same-store NOI and 75% of our total NOI. Metro DC, which represents 19% of our total NOI and 14% of our same-store NOI posted year-over-year same-store revenue growth of 1.8%, a slight deceleration from first quarter, due primarily to very strong bad debt collections in the second quarter of 2015. We are forecasting the market to generate top-line growth in 2016 of between 2% and 3% as we will continue to benefit from our diverse 50/50 mix of A and B assets located both inside and outside the beltway. Our B product outperformed our As during the quarter by 170 basis points as sporadic supply issues continue to make for choppy results in some infield locations. ", "Orange County in Los Angeles combined represent 16% of our total NOI and about 17% of our same-store NOI. Orange County posted year-over-year revenue growth of 8.9% with both our As and Bs performing well above 8% and all sub markets remaining very strong as we face very limited supply. Revenue growth in Los Angeles was 5.2% during the quarter. Our same-store portfolio is primarily concentrated within the Marina del Ray submarket and is currently facing over 2000 units of new supply, which we expect will be fully absorbed by year-end. We continue to see good job growth and the supply picture improving in 2017 for our same-store LA portfolio.", "New York City, which represents 12% of our total NOI and 13% of same-store NOI posted 4.65 revenue growth for the quarter. While our same-store properties are not directly affected by any new developments, we are feeling the impact from new supply in the Manhattan market as new lease growth during the quarter was 1.9%. New Yorkers who typically have been loyal to their preferred neighborhoods are being enticed and by pricing infinites in places like Midtown West. For full year 2016, we expect New York to have revenue growth in the low 4% range, below our original estimates of approximately 5.5%.", "San Francisco, which represents about 11% of both our total and same-store NOI is continuing to feel the effects of new supply in several submarkets, including South of market. However, we still expect the bay area to be one of our best performing markets this year with revenue growth between 6% and 7%. Same-store revenue growth in the second quarter was 6.3%, due to the extremely strong blended rent growth we achieved in the third quarter of 2015. We currently see our portfolio being affected by lease-up pressures through the middle of 2017.", "Boston, which represents 7% of our total NOI, about 5% of same-store NOI produced a strong 6.1% revenue growth during the second quarter. The suburban assets in the North shore were our strongest performers, with growth over 7.5%. Even with new supply downtown, our one same-store assets in the back day posted revenue growth of 4% for the quarter. The Seaport district, home to our 2015 completion on 100 Pier 4 in the South end district, home to our under construction community, 345 Harrison continued to see more growth with additional office and retail tenants in the submarket.", "Seattle, which represents 6% of our total and same-store NOI posted strong revenue growth of 8.5% for the quarter. 16% of our portfolio is B product, which posted revenue growth of 12.3% where our A quality communities produce 6.6% growth. We continue to benefit from the strong growth inherent in these suburban B assets which are located in submarkets that are less exposed to new supply. Even with new supply pressure, our Bellevue assets posted revenue growth of 6.8% for the quarter where revenue growth in downtown Seattle was essentially flat.", "Last, Dallas, which represents just over 4% of our total and same-store NOI posted 5% year-over-year same-store growth in the second quarter. Our B properties had revenue growth of 500 basis points higher than our A's, as having new supply in uptown and along the toll ways and packing rent growth in those submarkets. While new supply remains elevated, we expect deliveries to decline after this year and are confident they will be absorbed by the strength in the diversified job market in Dallas.", "Our secondary market, such as Portland, Monterey Peninsula, Florida, Nashville and Austin which comprised roughly 20% of our portfolio continue to have strong pricing power due to limited amounts of new supply and robust job growth. Our expectation is that these markets have a long runway of growth due to favorable economic. ", "July results came in, in line with our plan. As we look ahead to the next two months we see stable pricing power and occupancy. Our 50-50 AB portfolio located throughout 20 markets has enabled out performance in our Sun Belt market, Orange County, Seattle, Boston, Portland and Monterey to offset markets that are being impacted by new supply, namely San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles. ", "I'll turn now to our four end lease up developments, which you can find on attachments. 9A and 9B or pages 21 and 22 of our supplement. Our pro-rata share of these four properties represents over $400 million or roughly 30% of our pipeline, inclusive of the west coast development joint venture. In total, these properties are performing ahead of plan. First, 399 Freemont our 447 home, $318 million 50-50 met by JV leased up in San Francisco, with 50% leased and 43% occupied at quarter end. Today we are 57% leased and 48% occupied with rents exceeding pro forma. We are currently operating six weeks' concession as we\u2019ve begun to see increased competition from other lease ups in the submarket. Over the last month, we have taken over 30 leases. ", "The following three communities are all part of the west coast development joint venture. Katella brand I, our 399 home, $138 million lease up in Anaheim, California was 65% leased and 58% occupied at quarter end, and as of today it's 72% leased and 64% occupied. We are currently offering less than one month of concession at this community and leasing remains very strong with about 30 applications per month. ", "8th & Republican, our 211-home, $97 million lease-up in the South Lake Union submarket of Seattle was 47% leased and 37% occupied at quarter end and is currently 60% leased and 46% occupied, and we are averaging over one application per day. CityLine, our 244-home, $80 million lease-up in the Columbia City submarket of Seattle was 87% leased and 84% occupied at quarter end. Today, the property is 89% leased, and 86% physically occupied. All in, we had a very strong second quarter, and we remain very positive on the outlook for multi-family fundamentals, and our ability to execute throughout the remainder of 2016.", "With that, we will open the call to Q&A. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Nick Joseph ", "Thanks. Just sticking with operations, you outlined A versus B performance cost in many markets and the 50/50 diversified portfolio, I think you have a unique perspective on this. So when you expect that spread between As and Bs to contract and when could As actually outperform Bs, just given the current supply picture?", "Tom Toomey", "Good question and, I\u2019d tell you it varies market by market, but I think overall, and we stated this probably for the last two to three quarters, we would see As getting closer to Bs probably mid-year, next year, maybe a little bit after that. And then as you get deeper into \u201918 I think As probably start competing more head-to-head with Bs. But it\u2019s definitely market dependent. For example, I would think in Washington DC, we\u2019ve seen that spread contract and expand multiple times. Last quarter it was about 50 basis points where Bs were outperforming. This quarter we expanded to 1.7, but we do see a slowdown of new supply effecting our product and DC over the next year and half. So I do think As, because there are typically better locations by the second half of next year should start doing much better there.", "When you look at a place like New York, it\u2019s probably a little more prolonged, call it maybe even 2019 or further where we see Bs continuing to outperform. And in San Francisco I think its similar. You\u2019re going to see supply continue to offset the market in so many places like that at least through the middle of next year. And I think that will cause As to continue to have to go head-to-head against new supply well into \u201918. So I think San Francisco, New York, Dallas, Austin is probably pushed out a bit, but several of the other markets that saw new supply come a little bit earlier, it\u2019s shorter but, on average I'm guessing, it gets closer in late \u201917 and probably pulls even in \u201918.", "Nick Joseph ", "Thanks. And then as per the two-year outlook, you put out 2017 operating assumptions. You\u2019ve maintained 2016 same-store revenue growth. I was wondering if there is any update to the 2017 estimate of 4.75 or 5.25?", "Tom Toomey", "Yes, I can tell you we -- clearly we saw a deceleration coming in 2017. And as you said, we\u2019ve put that in our 2-year outlook. And the range was the 4.75 to 5.25, which implied about a 75 basis points decline from 2016. And we\u2019re continuing to project a slowdown in \u201917 based on a lower blended rate growth in \u201916 compared to \u201915. But at this point it\u2019s probably a little early to give guidance on where we think \u201917 is going to come in. We still don\u2019t have great visibility on pricing for September and the fourth quarter of this year, and we really haven\u2019t fine-tuned our expectations yet for 2017. So a little bit early, but it's probably leaning towards the lower end of that range.", "Nick Joseph ", "Thanks. And just quickly, on that range, does that contemplate the assets that are not in the same-store pool that you laid out on attachment 7B, that will roll into the same-store pool in 2017.", "Tom Toomey", "Yes.", "Operator", "Next we\u2019ll hear from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Austin Wurschmidt", "Hi it\u2019s Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan. Just revisiting Nick\u2019s earlier question on Bs outperforming As in most of your markets. I was just curious what the price differential is between your As and Bs in some of the similar submarkets?", "Tom Toomey", "It depends A and B. The difference between A and a B in Dallas is probably $250 to $300. When you get to the New York, it's probably north of $1000 differential. San Francisco, it's going to be $800 to $1,000. So it can vary, but you are typically looking at it getting close to a $1,000 in some of the high rise and urban markets on the coast. And when you get into the Sun Belt it can be tracked down to just a $200.", "Austin Wurschmidt", "So it's fair to say around 20% to 25% in some of your larger markets?", "Tom Toomey", "Yes, that sounds right.", "Austin Wurschmidt", "Okay, and then just thinking about guidance, what are you assuming in terms of blended lease rate growth in the second half of the year?", "Tom Toomey", "Second half of the year, the blend, we're looking at it being low for us. Probably you are going to see in the second half -- I can you this. Renewals for July are coming in on effective basis at about 5.9%. And as you look out to next month or two, it's probably going to stay in that 5.7% to 5.8% range but then in the fourth quarter it will come down probably mid-5%. And then we're seeing new lease rate growth in July is currently at about 3.2% and our expectation would be it will just come down a hair over the last three months. We really -- we saw pricing last year in the fourth quarter come down a bit. So we're not anniversaring off such high prices. But yes second half is probably going to be low for us compared to the 5.3% that we have in the first half. ", "Operator", "And next we have Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Just a few quick questions. Jerry, on the operations, on the first quarter call you guys were -- earlier here, you guys were asking about the high guidance and actually Herzog explained how the high same-store NOI guidance, what the leakage was, that it wasn\u2019t necessarily translating to FFO growth, but now this quarter where we see some of your peers dialing back their expectations for the year, what are some of the things that because you guys to be able to maintain such a high guidance range? Is it that the amount of Bs that you have or is just a fact that in your portfolio mix you said markets like Dallas and Norfolk, southern markets that aren\u2019t represented in some of the other in some of your other bi-coastal peers.", "Tom Toomey", "Yes. I\u2019ll start. First I\u2019d remind you, we got out of Norfolk in the fourth quarter of the last year. So it's gone. Yes, I think a big part of it that you have to consider is we really drove weight very strongly in the second half as paid benefits this year. And when you look at the -- we anticipated there would be a deceleration in rate growth with this year and that has happened. And while I'll say directionally and in total, that reduction was pretty close, we missed on a market-by-market basis. For example, 29% of our portfolio, which is made up of New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, we\u2019re missing our numbers. We came into the year thinking San Francisco would be an 8. Now we think it's probably going to end up at 6.5. We thought New York was going to high 5s. Now we think it's going to be low 4s. And Los Angeles, we came in think it was going to be call it a 7, and now we think it's going to be mid 5s.", "What we have that a lot of people don't is the diversified portfolio. 20 markets, we got the 50/50 split between A, Bs and Urbans. And what's really helping us is that 42% of our portfolio is performing better than we had expected coming into the year. So it's offsetting those three markets that are doing worse. And those are markets like Seattle which I think all of us are doing well in right now. Our Orange County portfolio with 8.9% revenue growth in the second quarter is doing exceptionally well. We're doing very well in Boston, where we have predominantly a suburban portfolio in our same-store pool. We held up at about a 6 -- a little north of the 6 revenue there. Two markets in Florida, both Orlando and Tampa are doing better than we expected. Nashville is on fire right now, and again we're very suburban B there. So we're not being impacted at all by the new supply. And then we have our Monterey and Portland portfolios that are doing well.", "So the beauty of our portfolio with that diversification is we're not dependent on a couple of the markets doing well or not doing well. We realize this diversified approach that's going to continue to help us in the future, because all markets are going to go through the natural cycle. So we\u2019ll always have some that are doing better, some that are doing worse. So, I think it's really more of a portfolio diversification that's really helping us.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "And historically, like Toomey is talking about, hardest market, the market that you had used to source capital to help fund the development, based on what you're seeing in this cycle, does the weakness in some of the coastal markets pressure at the high end change your view and maybe some of the coastal markets are going to be seen for harvesting rather than some of the markets like Richmond, some of those others?", "Tom Toomey", "I think there's still a couple of markets that we probably are ready to exit a little more quickly than others, and I think Harry will talk maybe as soon as I get off this on which ones we\u2019re looking at in our disposition program this year. But markets that we've historically talked about that were in our warehouse and we kind of stopped talking about that, because we -- we've really come to realize, there're good strong markets, and they're going to perform well over the long term, places like Florida, again Orlando, Nashville, Tampa, places like that, I think we're satisfied to stay there over the midterm and probably long term. There's no rush to exit. But we'll selectively sell assets, and at times get out of markets to fund the development pipeline. But maybe Harry can give you a little more input on what we're looking to sell this year.", "Harry Alcock", "Yes, Alex. In the short term -- we're always looking at which assets to sell to fund our development pipeline in particular. This year we've looked at -- we intend to sell Baltimore -- at least sell down portfolio to some extent. We have a group of assets in the market today. We're also going to sell a couple properties in Dallas for the balance of the year.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay. And then Harry, while you\u2019re on, could you just walk us through the ground lease deal that you did in LA and the economics then how this fits in within UDR's investment game plan?", "Harry Alcock", "Sure. Well Alex, as you know, we look at all these trades in the context of best invested return to the shareholders. La Jolla, the effective land sizes of $400,000 per unit, which is the price that's unheard of the Los Angeles, we were able to monetize most or all of our future development gain today, and then convert this one-time gain into another structured deal where we received nearly 7% return on our capital. And so while its different than Steel Creek, it\u2019s another example of how we deploy capital and then create transactions.", "Operator", "And next in queue we have Nick Yulico with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Nick Yulico ", "Well thanks. So I guess just turning back to the guidance, specifically on same-store revenue growth, where you\u2019ve gone 6% year-to-date and for the year saying and 5.5% to 6% is the range, how should we think about what level of conservatism is built into the guidance? Because it doesn\u2019t seem to imply much of a deceleration in the back half of the year?", "Jerry Davis", "Yes, Nick, it\u2019s Jerry. I\u2019d tell you right now, we look at our model, we\u2019re coming in right in the midpoint of guidance. There\u2019s a couple of things that could push us, there\u2019s really one thing that push us to the top-end, and that would be if we get a significant occupancy pick-up. And we have been pushing to drive occupancy a little bit higher over the last month or two. The thing that could drive us to the bottom is if we see a further deterioration in operating fundamentals. And typically those would probably have to come with more downside than we\u2019ve projected in New York and San Francisco since the other ones have been reacting kind of stable.", "There is a couple of things though -- because I know what you\u2019re talking about. We\u2019ve got a 6 or so in the first half of the year, which would imply second half would be a 5.5. But there\u2019s a few things to keep in mind. If here so far we had 6.3% rent per occupied home growth, that\u2019s been offset by about a 30 basis points decline in occupancy; we had very difficult occupancy comps at the first half of last year. Our occupancy in the second half of last year decelerated about 20 or 30 bps. Now we\u2019re still very high at 96.6, but it wasn\u2019t at 96.8 or 96.9. Our expectation and what we\u2019re shooting for this year is to have a positive spread over last year\u2019s occupancy. So we\u2019re not going to be losing revenue growth even if occupancy declined. We\u2019re hoping we get a little bit of pickup in that.", "Then the second thing just that\u2019s interesting is our fee income is up almost 10% year-over-year, and we would expect that to continue through the second half of the year. And that\u2019s really coming partially from lease break fees; people electing to move and relocate for jobs or buy houses or things like that. And but the second part is we started working on an initiative in the second half of last year to drive higher revenues from our parking rent, which was an initiative we began working on like I said, late last year but we\u2019ve got the fruits of it this year, to find a way to increase this under optimized real estate.", "So you got 6% of your revenue stack coming from fee income, that\u2019s growing at a much higher rate than my rents. And you know, how optimistic or pessimistic or conservative is that midpoint? Right now we\u2019ve factored in like I said earlier that we think blended rate growth for the second half of the year is going to be low 4s. So again, you\u2019re looking at renewal growth in the low 5s and new lease rate growth, maybe right around 3, and that seems to us to be pretty sustainable right now.", "Nick Yulico ", "Okay, sounds fine. I guess just one other follow-up on that. You did talk about the second half blended lease growth of low 4%. It sounds like there is other items in your sort of revenue that are helping as you mentioned fee income et cetera. So I guess point is we shouldn\u2019t be using that low 4% lease rate growth as sort of a directionally where your same-store revenue growth is heading is, how should we think about?", "Jerry Davis", "Well, I'll say this. You're lease rate growth or what we get from new rental renewals benefits you over the next 12 months. So a portion of what we\u2019re realizing in the third quarter of this year is based on the very strong lease rate growth and renewal growth that we got at the end of the last year. So it continues to pay benefits for the next 12 months. So what I'm telling you that I'm going to do over the next six months has some benefit over the next six months, but it also has a benefit over the following six months. So you can't just look at my current -- what am I signing leases for, because that's only for the percentage of residents or expirations that are happening at that time. ", "Nick Yulico ", "Yes, so I meant that the second half blend of lease growth of low 4%, whether that sort of indicator about where 2017 same-store sales revenue growth would be, not this year?", "Jerry Davis", "It does build. You are right. It does build into 2017. The others saying is though, what are rents going to do next year, and we\u2019re going to have some markets where you\u2019re probably going to see rate growth continue to go down, but we have other markets for example Los Angeles where we\u2019re fighting heavy new supply right now, but I expect that one to pick up quite a bit next year. So some of is dependent on how we do next year but we are building up part of our rent role right now for 2017.", "Nick Yulico ", "Okay, that's helpful. And just to clarify, when you talk about the fee income being strong, is any of that from actual leased termination, lease break fees of residents, or is that helping you at all?", "Jerry Davis", "Yes, that is -- that's about half of it. We're hitting a portion -- we'll probably pick up a little over a $1 million, $1.2 million this year of additional revenue from parking, and that's just basically -- and it\u2019s predominantly in garden communities, charging people for parking and determining which spaces are the most preferable and trying to monetize that. But the other big mover is lease break fees, where somebody wants to cancel their lease ahead of the natural expiration date. They are contractually obligated to pay us to get out of the lease. So a portion of it is that.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Rob Stevenson with Janney.", "Rob Stevenson ", "Jerry, when you look at 2017 deliveries in the New York area, is that -- how much of that is concentrated in Manhattan, and would be sort of direct competition for you guys versus how much of that stuff is in Queens and Brooklyn where you don\u2019t have any assets?", "Jerry Davis", "Most of it is not directly impacting us. When you look at approximate to our neighborhoods, we\u2019re not going to head to head with much, but we have been feeling the impact coming from whether it's mid-town in west Brooklyn, you have people in New Jersey, as well as Queens, they are all kind of a stealing some people away, if you can get nice new product for a lower effective rate. I don\u2019t have the numbers off the top of my head about how much is in Manhattan versus Queens though.", "Rob Stevenson ", "When does the that property that's just north of View 34, that we followed the property tour is scheduled to start leasing?", "Jerry Davis", "I think it's late fourth quarter or first quarter. We think we\u2019ll probably feel some effect from that, but their rents are quite a bit higher than ours.", "Rob Stevenson", "Okay, and then Harry the guidance on the acquisition went from $0 million to $100 million to a $100 million to $200 million. Is that third party acquisitions or is that you guys buying in some of the Wolf stuff?", "Harry Alcock", "It's not the Wolf stuff. So it generally is going to be third party acquisitions and there are couple 10/31 trades that we're looking to execute in the fourth quarter.", "Rob Stevenson", "You don't want the contract currently?", "Harry Alcock", "No.", "Operator", "Next we'll hear from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.", "Rich Hill", "A quick question. I think I remember you asking about of this call that you were seeing a little bit more supply pressures in the LA market. That\u2019s maybe a little bit different then some of the commentary if you referred from last years. So I'm curious, how much of that is driven versus by Class A versus Class B? And are you actually starting to see supply pick up in maybe the Class B space versus the Class A?", "Tom Toomey", "It\u2019s a good question. Here's what the deal is. 90% of our same-store portfolio is located in Marina del Rey. So it's three properties over in Marina. Marina is about a two-mile drive to Playa Vista where all of the tech firms are relocating to the area called Silicon Beach. We've got two lease ups occurring in Playa Vista right now. One is a 1,500-unit deal, the other one I think is 400 units. But they are coming in offering concessions of one to two months free. And what\u2019s it's really done, it's directly impacting my three [ph] properties in Los Angeles that make up 90% of my portfolio. So, yes, I don't think any of my peers would be feeling the same thing, because they don't have as much concentration in one sub market in Los Angeles as I have.", "Operator", "Next we've Richard Anderson with Mizuho Securities.", "Richard Anderson", "So, Harry, you said something interesting earlier about how you were kind of abandoning -- maybe it\u2019s Jerry -- abandoning this warehousing concept, and thinking about keeping some assets in some markets in the portfolio. And so I was wondering if you could talk about any other adjustments you're making to the strategy like that. Because one of them, I recall when you spent some together last year, the 50/50 Class A, Class B could actually morph into more like 60 or 70 Class A over time. Do you feel like maybe there's an adjustment there that you'll make in the current environment kind of like how you're adjusting your warehousing kind of concept?", "Tom Toomey", "Rich, this is Toomey. I think abandoning or changing is probably a little bit of an over statement. I think what we're doing is constantly weighing our market mix and the price point in what we think cash flow is going to grow at. And so when we think we have a market for example where Baltimore has performed in last five years, averaging 3% growth, we kind of look out the next five years and say, we don't think it's really going to change a whole lot. Where else do we think we can redeploy that capital in the enterprise, most immediately in the development pipeline. So we're always revisiting our markets. On the balance of 50/50, the As that we're putting in today, 10 years from now will be Bs. And so I think we'll probably hover around the 50/50, it might go 60/40 but I don\u2019t see a long-term directional change in that allocation.", "I think what ultimately we\u2019re trying to build, and have done so far and will continue to refine is building cash flow, and where we see it can grow the best. And concentrated positions could create concentrated risk. And so we\u2019re always going to have this diversification. We think over time it works. Some markets having Bs work better than As. Other cases where we look at jobs and where we think they're coming up in the price point, As are going to be better. So I think that\u2019s the overriding doctrine that we\u2019re overall thinking about our capital allocation and decisions, and markets from time-to-time. Florida is an example right now, talking off the cost, is going to enjoy a another couple year run, but supply will start coming at Florida in the near-future, and then we\u2019ll look at how we feel about our assets positioned in that market and rather we should move more capital out of that, and into other places where opportunities will become available.", "Richard Anderson", "Okay. And then as a follow-up, was there anything about the QR print that kind of caused you to at least take another look at your numbers and make sure you weren\u2019t missing anything. The is one kind of cynical view is that the rest of the group is going to have to revisit guidance, not this quarter maybe, but next quarter. I\u2019m just curious if there was any level of reaction on your part from seeing that profit take effect?", "Tom Toomey", "Rich, I'm not going to comment on EQR or their results and their outlook. What I am going to say is, is that Jerry and his team run a culture from the bottom-up focusing greatly on what\u2019s going on in the ground, reforecasting the business constantly, monitoring our traffic or pricing power, and that feeds right up to us on a weekly basis, and we discuss how does that fit in our outlook for the future, and we\u2019re very comfortable with the guidance we\u2019ve just given. We feel like a lot of the year is pretty much behind us. There's not a lot of leases to price in that fourth quarter window, and we\u2019re trying to really focus on our '17. And I think that\u2019s a credit to his team, to Shaun and his efforts in forecasting FP&L, that we have a pretty darn good handle on exactly where we\u2019re at, what are the levers that we can move, and what\u2019s our range of outcomes. And that\u2019s why we tightened guidance the way we did, but we feel very good about the guidance we\u2019ve given, and it's a credit to Jerry and his operating team, but also in way it's positioned", "Operator", "And moving on we\u2019ll next hear from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.", "John Pawlowski", "Jerry, rent growth across a number of Sun Belt markets, namely Dallas, Tampa and Orlando for example, seem to have decelerated throughout the quarter. Do you expect that reacceleration in the back half of the year across some of these Sun Belt markets?", "Jerry Davis", "You know Dallas I think is going to continue to be difficult. Its having new supply there. Our B product is continuing to do well, but we\u2019ve got properties in uptown as well as Plana [ph] that are going up against new supply. So I think you\u2019re going to continue to see a struggle in Dallas, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to get any worse. I think when you look at the other Sun Belts, Orlando and Tampa, I think you're going to see Orlando turn back around. What happened in the quarter -- second quarter is we probably got a bit aggressive on renewal growth, where we were popping out 7.9%, and opened back door a little, put a little pressure on occupancy levels, and we had to cut new lease rate growth to get occupancy back up. Our occupancy in Orlando today is 97.1%. That compares to an average of 96.5% during the second quarter and we've seen a lease rate growth in the month of July jump back up to 6.6% compared to the 4.9% that we reported in Q2. So I think Orlando feels good and then Tampa just feels stable. We've had a few lease ups in a sub market of Tampa that's affected us, and I think they're starting to stabilize now and I think our numbers will too.", "John Pawlowski", "And then Harry what timing can we expect on the roughly $400 million of dispositions, how is pricing shaping up versus expectation?", "Harry Alcock", "Pricing is coming in sort of at or slightly above expectations. We expect these things to close mostly early in the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Next we'll hear from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird Company.", "Drew Babin", "One follow-up question on the 10/31 opportunity. Would you say that the opportunity on the disposition side, is kind of a more compelling reason for the increase in your overall transaction activity for this year, or would you say that the opportunistic use of the capital on the acquisition side is the more exciting opportunity?", "Harry Alcock", "This is Harry. So I think there's a couple of questions there. One, we sell a number of properties every year to fund -- there's a bucket of capital to fund various uses, including specifically development. We do have 10/31 opportunities that we're going to look at. The pricing on the acquisition we think is likely to be generally market. We'll look at markets such as DC, Boston, Southern California, Northern California, Seattle to redeploy the capital. We think that will be largely market. The cap rates on these sales, typically our Baltimore assets are going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 6%. The cap rate on one of our Dallas acquisitions that's in the market today called Cert, which is a Metlife JV asset, which should be somewhere in the neighborhood of 5.25. We've got one additional Dallas asset that will definitely be a component of the 10/31 and we think that's probably a mid 5s type trade.", "Drew Babin", "And secondly I was hoping to dig in on Manhattan a little bit. With View 34 being same-store pool this year, and obviously that's been a strong asset so far. Can you talk at all about how the Manhattan portfolio is performing ex-View 34? Or conversely just provide how View 34 has done year-to-date?", "Harry Alcock", "Yes. View 34 actually added about 70 basis points to our numbers. And I -- hold up one second, let me get the details. I think -- look at the Manhattan portfolio, View 34's revenue growth during the quarter was about 6.1% year-over-year.", "Tom Toomey", "It's Toomey. I'd add. That's what's reflective when you do a good job on a rehab of a B, and you keep it in that B price point and boy, I wish I could find more View 34s is the answer?", "Drew Babin", "So can you talk at all specifically about how Downtown's performing?", "Tom Toomey", "Sure. Yes, Downtown is definitely our hardest hit submarket in Manhattan for same-stores. But our two Downtown properties had revenue growth during the quarter of just under 3%. Now when you get up to a one Met JV, which is in the upper west side, Columbus Square, that property had revenue growth of just under 1%. So that's the one that is combating most head to head new supply. And then just to do a full lap through, Manhattan we only have one other deal and it's in Chelsea. And that property has continued to do extremely well and it had revenue growth in the mid sixes.", "Operator", "Next we have Juan Sanabria with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Juan Sanabria", "Just wondering if you could briefly run through what your exceptions are across let's say your top five markets for new supply 2016 and then going into full year 2017?", "Jerry Davis", "Sure. When we look at D.C. in 2016 our expectations for news -- I'll tell you, we get this data from Axiometrics. So if you get Axio data, it's going to be roughly the same, but D.C. 2016 is about 13,500 units and 2017 is projected to be about 9,000. New York is going to go from 25,000 this year to 30,000 next year, and that is the one market we see where supply in our major markets is going to be higher next year than this year. San Francisco goes from about 13,000 to about 7,000. Seattle goes from about 10,000 to 6,000 and I guess the last market I would highlight is we showed Dallas going from about 18,000 units this year to about 13,000 next year.", "Juan Sanabria", "A couple of your peers have commented that they may be few numbers higher than what Axio actual uses. Is there any concern on your part that those numbers may be understated and your 2017 figures could be under more pressure than where the numbers may currently spin out too?", "Tom Toomey", "Juan this is Tom. This is an interesting topic, and I'm glad you kind of got us there, is what is the supply picture look like in the future, because I think everybody is kind of throwing around different numbers. I would tell you some anecdotal information that's critical to this conversation would be is what are banks' lending on, and what is the bank lending environment. And if you start digging into that with the bankers, you're realizing very rapidly that the terms on construction loans, the pricing on them, and the availability is contracting at a rapid pace. And we've seen several large banks just red line and say we're not doing multifamily loans any longer, period. Or probably now price terms that are prohibitive to make the deals work.", "So, I think you are going to start to see some of those construction numbers start really coming down rapidly, as people start to get into their construction loan draws, and trying to get their terms and their penciling work. I think it also creates an opportunity for UDR to look at wharf and steel type creek opportunities, that might start becoming and available in 2017, should this come to fruition. So I would stay very focused on what the supply of money looks like, the terms of that, and watch how that ultimately unfolds. I know everybody's numbers are all over the map right now, but what I look at is one of the drivers and it's not the opportunities, not the fundamentals. Those are there. It's the question of capital and the price of that capital and will deals work. And we'll stay focused on that, which is my recommendation for 2017.", "Juan Sanabria", "And then in Europe any remarks? Tom, you talked about being focused on operational excellence. I think you've hit a little bit on the parking upside. Any other things you could point to that you're working on that maybe we'd say some margin upside and any sort of target numbers you could talk to?", "Tom Toomey", "I'll let Jerry clean it up, but I'll start with it. One we're a very operationally focused company, and it comes a lot through innovation. So, there's always as you can see from prior road shows, we've always listed out initiatives that we're focused on. We have basically a biweekly meeting on innovation here, and we're talking about the product, the initiatives that we have underway, what's working, what's not and we're always constantly pressing the next envelope for our customer. And we do a great job of listening to what they want, and what they are willing to pay for. And its Jerry and his team to filter through that innovation list and put it in the practical terms.", "This parking conversation that he alluded to earlier is really a conversation started two years ago, and ultimately we've built systems out, convinced the field about the pricing scheme and they've done a great job of executing it. And I can tell you that at the last count there were 57 initiatives on that schedule. Some will not work, many of them will. So we're going to continue to be innovative operationally, and that's how it makes the difference at the enterprise.", "Jerry Davis", "I'll give you a few examples. Tom spoke and you mentioned the parking, another one, and they're not all revenue enhancing. Some are expense reducing. So we -- and some are capital expenditures that give us that return. But one is converting common area space lighting to LED lighting, which dramatically drops down, both your electrical cost as well as the maintenance time people have to spend replacing those light bulbs. And we've seen a reduction in our electric costs this year from doing that.", "Secondly package lockers. Some people believe in them, some people don\u2019t. I will tell you we do. We've installed well over 40 lockers; we've got another 35 that are being installed right now. We're doing it for two reasons. Dealing with package management is a huge time suck on our onsite teams. So it opens them up to do more work makes money for us. And secondly it's a benefit that residents enjoy to have 24/7 access to pick up their own packages. So we get a little bit of a rent from that doing that too. And the packaged lockers have an IRR, that we look at it, well over 25% to 30%.", "So, financially it makes a lot of sense, but we always do things that the residents want, and that typically is good for us. And what both of those things do? You heard me mention on the LED lights because it takes -- gives back some time to our maintenance teams. And you heard me on the package lockers, say that we've been able to give some time back to our leasing maintenance. This year, and if you look at our personnel numbers, personnel expense number, you'll see that it's roughly flat for the quarter. We've been able to reduce about 1.5% to 2% of our site headcount this year because of some of these efficiencies that we've been able to do. So those are just a couple of examples, but like Toomey said we're always looking. There are some that we'll spend a great little time on, and they don't work, but we're always trying to search for the next thing to expand our margins.", "Operator", "And moving on we'll hear from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.", "Wes Golladay", "You mentioned that the supply in Marina del Rey would abate to the second half. Are you seeing any of your major markets where the supply could be back half loaded this year?", "Tom Toomey", "Back half loaded, let' me think. I think Bellevue -- probably Bellevue, Washington. So, one, and I'll get Harry in on this on a minute. Bellevue is one where there's lot of cranes and there's a lot of supply coming. We're currently doing exceptionally well there with 6.5%, 7% revenue growth this quarter on our same-store pool, but our expectation was that we would be more affected by new supply there and that's one of the reasons that our Seattle portfolio is outperforming. But Bellevue is probably one that I could say picking up later this year and maybe spreading into the first half of next year. Can you think of anything else, Harry?", "Harry Alcock", "Well, New York obviously continues to second half of this year and into next year, you're going to see that heavier supply in New York.", "Tom Toomey", "And I will tell you another one, that this will continue to get hit, and we don't have any same-store properties there, but Downtown LA has quite -- I mean probably got 3,000 to 4,000 new supply that's in some stage of lease up or pre-lease up right now. So Downtown LA is going to -- it's going to be interesting to operate there over the next year.", "Wes Golladay", "And real quick, you had mentioned the lenders who were looking to cut back on multifamily lending. Was this more emphasis on the coastal markets or is it broad based including the Sunbelt as well?", "Tom Toomey", "This is Toomey. We're seeing it across the template. And so when we talk to people about how they're sourcing their capital, where half of them go to other pools of money, foreign banks, local, regional banks, all of which do not have the capacity of our big national banks. And so by virtue of just pricing and the size, we expect that will drive some of the geography of where supply is going to come. So it's going to start moving to the Sun Belt and it's start going to moving suburban, and then also I think it's going to decrease that urban pressure. So we're going to see the market shifting.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll hear from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.", "Dennis McGill", "A couple of quick ones. On the 4.4% new lease growth rate for the quarter, what would that look it if you split it by urban and suburban assets?", "Tom Toomey", "Urban and suburban. I don't have that number on me.", "Dennis McGill", "Okay. We can follow up. And then just a more bigger picture, it sounds like right now it's widely accepted that San Fran and New York are going through an adjustment phase. But these are markets that I think most have said have come in below expectations and weaker than even maybe six months ago, but it doesn't sound like there's any assumption that other markets could follow that path. Is that right and then I guess what gives you confidence that there is not another one sort of uncertainty around the corner, especially with the urban portfolio. I understand the suburban protection, but any urban environment where supply is pretty pronounced virtually across the country?", "Jerry Davis", "Here is how I would think about it. First, New York and San Francisco are not really surprises to us. They are urban settings, when you see supply coming, you see it coming years in advance. Second, we've had great job growth in both of those markets, and both have tapered off to more of the norm. And so that combination kind of gives you what those markets are. As we look towards the future, we don\u2019t see as a big supply pressures coming at the urban portfolios, but we do have a concern about job growth sustaining itself, and I think everybody should. And were waiting to see how the election turns out and how the economy turns out, but in both of those camps that's -- the future will be what it's going to be.", "So I'm not at all surprised about those two markets. We are not surprised about our outlay exposure. We saw it coming. What we see was this. These are supply driven numbers that are changing our pricing power. It is not the underlying fundamentals of demographics and or job markets that are driving our business right now. Those are still in very good shape. And so we we're very focused on the supply pressure, and think we have a very good handle on it, feel good about the way we're running the business to deal with that supply. When it abates, we think we're back to guns on pricing, and we'll do very well in that environment. ", "Tom Toomey", "And I would just add, even though we don\u2019t see any markets right now, if one pop-up for let's say there is job loss in a particular market or something like that, that goes back to the benefit of being in 20 markets and having that A and B portfolio. We've got other markets that can counterbalance something like that.", "Operator", "And at this time, it appears we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the conference back over to President and CEO, Tom Toomey for any additional or closing remarks.", "Tom Toomey", "Great, thank you again for all of your time. Again, I think we had a very solid quarter on all fronts. Certainly we remain focused on the strategic plan and the execution of it. A big part of that is just execution and we're doing it right now. What is the strategic plan focused on? Growing cash workflow through all points in the cycle. We're going through one of those right now. You can see from our results we're still able to sustain and guide to on a strong cash flow number, and I think that's attributed to the team in the room, in particular Jerry and his operating team, and their focus on adjusting their strategies by individual assets, by unit types to meet the market and get ahead of it if you will. And also we're enjoying a very good strong development pipeline that's leasing up very well and gives us confidence for the future.", "So with that, we thank you again for your time and look forward to talking to you next quarter.", "Operator", "And that does conclude today's conference call.

First, the strength of our best-in-class operating platform and portfolio diversification was again evident, allowing us to maintain same-store guidance throughout the year, while effectively combating the marketplace that was choppier than expected. Second, our external growth remained highly accretive. Third, our balance sheet metrics continue to improve enhancing both liquidity for the Company and safety for our investors. Fourth, we join the S&P 500 and accomplishment that places us in a select group of only 27 other property REITs.", "In short, these accomplishments showcase another year of successfully executing our long-term strategies, as set forth in our Strategic Outlook. All of the credit for these successes goes to our associates in the field and in the corporate office as they face daily market challenges and a CFO change. I would like to sincerely thank everyone in the organization for their dedication and hard work throughout 2016.", "Next, as we move into 2017, we are confident that the outlook for the long-term apartment fundamentals remains strong despite short-term challenges in the form of new supply coupled with elevated concession levels, which are forecast to abate as we move into the second half of 2017. In total, we expect this year will again produce topline and bottom line growth in excess of long-term averages.", "Lastly, we remain confident that UDR is doing the right things, and has the right team in place to create long-term value for our shareholders. Adhering to our Strategic Outlook\u2019s core principles will continue to help us generate high-quality cash flow, dividend, and NAV growth for many years to come.", "I will provide further commentary regarding our 2017/2018 Strategic Outlook later in the call, but will turn it over to Jerry for additional comments on the quarter.", "Jerry Davis", "Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to announce another quarter of strong operating results. During the fourth quarter, year-over-year same-store revenue and NOI growth were 5.0% and 5.3% respectively. For full-year 2016, same-store revenue and NOI growth totaled 5.7% and 6.5% respectively.", "During the fourth quarter, we saw a continuation of the topline operating trends evident throughout 2016. That is overall fundamentals continue to normalize with localized demand/supply dynamics in markets determining our ability to generate revenue growth. Making up 45% of our same-store NOI, strength was evident in Orange County, Seattle, The Monterey Peninsula, Boston and our Sunbelt markets. While San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York, which comprised 30% of our same-store NOI, remained challenged primarily due to concentrated new supply and elevated concession levels.", "For the year, the strength of our operating platform, combined with our diversified portfolio allowed us to effectively combat these supply driven headwinds, generate portfolio growth that compared favorably versus the apartment group average. I would like to thank all of the operating associates for making this happen.", "Similar to what you heard on our last call, we focused on driving occupancy during the fourth quarter to remain full during the seasonally slower periods. While each market and community is different with regard to the trade-off between rate growth and occupancy, I envision us maintaining this strategy at the portfolio level through at least the first half of 2017.", "During the fourth quarter, our occupancy averaged 96.8%, that's 20 basis points higher than in the first half of 2016 and 30 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2015. Next portfolio-wide new lease and renewal rate growth were flat and positive 5.1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We continue to see minimal pressure from single family competition with move-outs to home purchases staying flat at 14% during the fourth quarter.", "Portfolio-wide affordability remains a non-issue with move-outs due to rent increase at 5%. Net bad debt remains low and at levels consistent with previous quarters. Year-over-year same-store expense growth of 4.2% was elevated during the quarter. Real Estate taxes were the primary culprit growing 9.5% year-over-year. We continue to see pressure in New York from 421 burn-offs and across many of our markets due to still rising incremental valuations. I'll provide market level expectations later in the call when we address our 2017/2018 Strategic Outlook.", "Last, our development lease ups continue to perform well, achieving rates in aggregate above original expectations and with leasing velocity is generally ahead of original forecast. The average value creation spread built into our pipeline is in excess of the top end of our 150 basis point to 200 basis point range. Community specific quarter end at lease-up statistics are available on Attachment 9 or Page 21 of our supplement.", "Summing that up, the fourth quarter was another good quarter and 2016 was a solid year given the challenges we faced. We remain laser focused on maximizing revenue growth and constraining expense growth when possible and are confident in our ability to execute in 2017.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe.", "Joseph Fisher", "Thanks, Jerry. The topics I will cover today include our fourth quarter results, a transactions updated, a balance sheet update and capital markets update and our first quarter and full-year guidance. Our fourth quarter earnings results were the mid to above the high end of our previously provided guidance.", "FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $0.47, $0.46 and $0.40 respectively and were driven by solid same-store growth. Full-year 2016 earnings results came into the mid to high-end of our previously provided guidance with FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share at $1.80, $1.79 and $1.63 respectively.", "Next transactions, subsequent to quarter end, we exercised our fixed price purchase option to acquire CityLine, a 244-home West Coast Development Joint Venture community located in suburban Seattle. The Company's total investment in CityLine was $86.5 million, roughly a 15% discount to the communities\u2019 estimated fair market value. This equates to a 5.3% cash flow cap rate.", "As it relates to future options on the West Coast Development Joint Venture communities or Steele Creek, we will evaluate those options as they become available based on our funding capacity and potential value creation for our shareholders. For an overview of other transactions consummated during the quarter and year, please see the transaction section of our 4Q earnings press release or Attachment 13 of our 4Q supplemental.", "Next to the balance sheet. At quarter end, our liquidity as measured by cash and credit facility capacity was $1.2 billion. Our financial leverage on undepreciated book value is 32.1%, on quarter end enterprise value, it was 23.9% and inclusive of joint ventures it was 28.8%. Our net debt to EBITDA was 5.1 times and inclusive of joint ventures was 6.2 times. All credit metrics continue to track well versus our strategic outlook.", "Lastly, on the balance sheet. As it relates to our new $500 million commercial paper program announced last week, the program offers us an incremental source of low cost floating rate capital and is fully backed by our line of credit. Looking ahead, we do not intend to increase our floating rate debt exposure as a result of putting this facility in place.", "I would like to make it clear that this facility will be utilized in place of, and not in addition to our existing line of credit. We extend our thanks to the rating agencies and our lending partners for making UDR, kind of only a limited number of REITs with access to this form of capital.", "I would now like to direct you to Attachment 15 or Page 28 of our supplement, where we have provided full-year and first quarter 2017 guidance. Our full-year 2017 guidance ranges are $1.83 to $1.87 per FFO and FFO as adjusted and $1.68 to $1.72 per AFFO. Our full-year 2017, same-store guidance cost for revenue growth of 3.0% to 4.0%, expense growth of 2.5% to 3.5%, and NOI growth of 3.25% to 4.25% with average 2017 forecasted occupancy at 96.7%. Other primary full-year guidance assumptions can be found on Attachment 15.", "For first quarter 2017, our guidance ranges are $0.44 to $0.46 per FFO and FFO as adjusted and $0.42 to $0.44 for AFFO. Finally, we declared a common dividend of 29.5% in the fourth quarter or $1.18 per share when annualized, this equates to a yield of approximately3.2% as of quarter end.", "With that, I will remind those listening that there is a link to our 2017/2018 Strategic Outlook document on the Investor Relations page of our website. We will pause for a moment, so that everyone can gather the outlook materials.", "Thomas Toomey", "Thanks Joe, and while you are pulling that up I just want to welcome Joe to his first of many earnings calls and it's been a joy working with him and we're looking forward to many more years of this. But now turning to our 2017/2018 Strategic Outlook, which was published in conjunction with our earnings release yesterday afternoon. I'd like to start with some big picture thoughts.", "First, as you page to the document, you will note continuity with previous strategic outlooks. Our focus on optimizing operations for preserving a diversified portfolio, investing in accretive external growth, maintaining a safe and flexible balance sheet, enhancing transparency has worked well for us and driven strong cash flow dividend and NAV growth for our shareholders.", "We believe adherence to these strategies position UDR well to capitalize on opportunities in a variety of economic backdrops and parts of the real estate cycle. Specifically, our diversified portfolio accomplishes several goals, including lowering our relative exposure to any one market supply and demand trends giving our transaction team more avenues to accretively deploy capitals and provide our shareholders with a predictable growing cash flow stream. When combined with our excellent operating platform, this is what ultimately differentiates UDR and makes us a full cycle investment.", "Moving to Page 3 of the outlook, we lay out our core principles. These are comprised of long-term consistent strategies that govern the path and direction of our enterprise takes. These are, one, maximize revenue and NOI growth in our markets through innovative and margin enhancing efficiency initiatives. Two, invest when appropriate in accretive internal and external opportunities that optimize returns for our investors refresh our portfolio, maintained diversification and better position us for future growth. And three, maintain a safe liquid balance sheet capable fully funding our enterprise throughout the cycle.", "These strategies represent our core tenants and we believe when executed upon well, drive predictable cash flow, dividend, and NAV growth over time, while also contributing to an equitable environment for robust TSR.", "Moving to Page 4. Our tactical execution of our long-term strategies can take different forms, depending on a variety of factors, including shifting market fundamentals, available growth opportunities and access to accretive capital. On this page, you can see a number of different topics that impact our daily businesses. Being flexible and proactive in all aspects of our business is crucial to our success and a differentiating factor.", "Next Page 5. Consistently executing our long-term strategies has led to strong AFFO dividend and NAV growth since our initial Strategic Outlook was published in early 2013. During that time, our shareholders have been rewarded with compound annual total shareholder return of 14.9% versus the NAREIT apartment index of 12.3% and NAREIT equity index of 9.2%.", "Moving on the next 9 Pages of the document outlined how we have performed versus our previous four published outlooks, in key aspects of our business and where we are going in these areas in the future. We are not going to turn each page today, but I encourage you to read through these pages in detail. You will see that our operating capital allocation, balance sheet, cash flow growth and NAV growth results since our initial outlook was published in February 2013, compare well versus previous plans.", "Now, a couple highlights from that section. First, we do believe that we have the best-in-class operating platform. Whether we measure this by our ability to forecast results and trends or how we perform at the market level versus peers, we compare favorably. Second, our diversified portfolio makes UDR a full cycle investment. We value this attribute, and intend to maintain diversification by MSA price point and submarket in the years ahead. Third, our developments continue to be highly accretive. We are looking to maintain our pipeline in the range of 5% to 9% of enterprise value, but will not stretch if a deal doesn't pencil. Last, we have made significant progress on derisking our balance sheet over the years. We are comfortable where our metrics are, but we'll continue to make progress from organic growth moving forward.", "Prior to closing out my comments, I'll provide a brief overview of our macro view, and how it impacts our outlook. While our budgeting and outlook process is granular and built from the bottom up, we also employ a macro overlay as a check. Today, we face the uncertainty of government deregulation, tax reform, volatile interest rates and fluctuating supply demand fundamentals at the market level. While we do not know where these factors will ultimately settle, we lean towards an optimistic longer-term outlook on apartment fundamentals balanced against the pragmatic patient view of our business.", "Consensus expectations for continued job growth of 150,000 to 200,000 per month in 2017 feels appropriate and results in a relatively balanced supply demand environment through the first half of the year before supply begins to subside in the second half of 2017. From an incremental capital deployment perspective, we are in an excellent position to remain patient, but will still look to capitalize on growth opportunities, should they meet our hurdle rates using conservative underwriting. Ultimately, we are willing to say no to deals if they do not pencil and simply focus on operating our real estate.", "To close out my comments, the runway for solid growth in the apartment industry remains long in our view. While it is true that new supply has presented short-term challenges, we see this choppiness in the market as an opportunity for UDR to outperform versus peers. We look forward to another strong year in 2017 and successfully executing our latest Strategic Outlook.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Joe to speak about 2017/2018 expectations.", "Joseph Fisher", "Thanks, Tom. Please turn to Page 15 of the document. On this page, we lay out our 2017 guidance, much of which I covered in my prepared remarks and our initial outlook for 2018. We expect that both years will produce same-store growth in excess of historical averages, I would like to stress that our initial 2018 expectations reflect how we currently view next year's fundamentals point out. Of course expectations for 2018 will change as 2017 progresses, but as in years past, we will not be updating our out year expectations until we provide 2018 guidance a year from now.", "Moving down the sources and uses, as you can see we have minimal debt coming due in 2017 with more debt coming due in 2018. As we move through 2017, you can expect that we will be continuously evaluating our options with regard to the 2018 maturities. Lastly, development spend will remain at primary use of capital during both 2017 and 2018 largely funded with free cash flow and dispositions. Regarding the balance sheet, we expect our credit metrics to continue to organically improve at a measured pace and both years.", "Now I will turn it over to Jerry to comment on the market level expectations.", "Jerry Davis", "Thanks, Joe. Please turn to Page 16 of the document for our market level 2017 same-store revenue growth expectations. See from the map, we expect that the Pacific Northwest, the Monterey Peninsula, Southern California, Boston and many of our Sunbelt markets will continue to generate same-store revenue growth in excess of our portfolio average. This includes Los Angeles where we were negatively impacted by new supply in 2016.", "Washington D.C. is expected to incrementally accelerate versus 2016 and is now forecast to be a portfolio average growth market in 2017. Please note that this forecast incorporate same-store additions and D.C. in 2017, including five of the six home properties, which will increase D.C.\u2019s share of our same-store NOI to approximately 19%.", "New York, San Francisco and some smaller markets will continue to struggle in 2017. New York and San Francisco especially will continue to be impacted by still elevated supply coming online in 2017, although San Francisco additions are expected to peak in the first half of the year, potentially setting us up for a better 2018.", "Last, as we consider new supply in 2017, our data providers are forecasting national deliveries of approximately 370,000 new apartment homes. Of this 175,000 homes or 47% of national deliveries are expected to impact the markets where we operate. Of the supply coming into our markets around 28% or 48,400 homes are expected to be added in our submarkets in 2017.", "Regarding how supply will be delivered as 2017 unfolds, our submarkets are expected to see average quarterly deliveries of approximately 13,000 homes in the first half of the year as compared to11,000 quarterly deliveries in the back half of 2016. In the second half of 2017, deliveries should fall back to approximately 11,000 per quarter on average.", "With that, I'll open the call up for questions. Operator.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.", "Nick Joseph", "Thanks. For 2017 same-store revenue guidance, what are the assumptions embedded in achieving either the high end, or the low end of that range?", "Jerry Davis", "Yes. Nick, this is Jerry. Basically the key differentiating factor on that is going to be, what kind of pricing to the lease-ups put out there. And are there going to offer two months free or one-month free. And the second one is job growth, but I can tell you the assumptions that we put into really get to that midpoint is job growth between 150,000 and 200,000 jobs. Our expectation is delivery should peak in the first half of 2017 that shows that our data providers are expecting roughly $370,000 home for the year, possible if it repeats what happened this past year that some of those could Slide in 2018.", "Now when you look \u2013 take that $370,000 national deliveries, the 70,000 are going to be in our markets and 48,000 of those are going to be in our submarkets. That's 13% of the total 2017 national deliveries are going to be in our submarket. We dial it down a little bit closer, when you take our top seven markets which make up about two-thirds or NOI, only about 20% of the 2017 deliveries in those seven markets will be within one mile of the UDR property.", "So you really go from 370,000 deliveries and when you get down to our top seven markets, a UDR property is having to deal with probably15,000 or so of those deliveries on a more specific basis. That being said, that's talking about 2017 deliveries. We are in some markets still facing lease up pressures from 2016 deliveries.", "Nick Joseph", "Thanks. What markets of the widest range of potential outcomes in 2017?", "Thomas Toomey", "I would say, Seattle. It's one that we're optimistic about job growth in some of our submarkets, for example in Bellevue, it was recently announced Amazon is going to come over to the East side, sales force is going to hire about 500 people about a block away from the two properties that we bought MetLife out of this past year, but you do have potential versus some supply pressures Bellevue got about 800 more units delivering there.", "We don't have much product in Downtown Seattle. So the glut of 50% of the supply that's coming into metro Seattle was Downtown, so that shouldn't overly affect us. But I would say, Seattle is one that probably has a fairly broad range. The other one, just because of what happened last year would be San Francisco.", "Our expectation is the bulk of the new supply, especially in SoMa gets absorbed, first \u2013 a lot of gets delivered and then absorbed throughout this year, depending on what kind of pricing that people impose, it could move a bit, but I would say those are probably the two markets that I think could swing the most, when we look at it.", "Nick Joseph", "Thanks.", "Thomas Toomey", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.", "Juan Sanabria", "Hi. Thanks for the time. I was just hoping you could speak a little it too the expectation is on new and renewal growth embedded in your same-store NOI across the larger markets New York, San Fran, LA in particular for 2017?", "Thomas Toomey", "I don't have that exact data with me. I can probably give it to you later. I can tell you on a more macro basis, when we look at 2017 with the midpoint guidance of 3.5%, we would see blended rate growth between new and renewal somewhere in that 3% to 4% range.", "Juan Sanabria", "Okay. Any sense on the blended for those top markets, if you don't have the newer renewals just to see kind of where New York, San Fran and LA shake out amongst the many different markets you're in?", "Thomas Toomey", "Yes, I don't have that on the \u2013 I mean I can't tell you, I can give you a bit of an update to what's in the supplement on Page 20 of the sub. We give the effective new and renewal growth for the fourth quarter. I can't tell you for example, in San Francisco where we had negative 5.8% new lease rate growth in the fourth quarter. In the month of January, that number came down to negative 3.2%, so while negative. At this time appears to be stabilizing somewhat, I don\u2019t if we'll be able to maintain that, but it has got a bit better.", "And then when you look at New York. New York in the fourth quarter, we had a new lease rate growth of negative 2.7%, so far this month we are at positive 0.9% in New York City. So that has improved and at the same time, what's really encouraging to us is our occupancy today in New York City is 98.2%.", "So we are able to really build up a high occupancy in the fourth quarter, which was part of our strategy have been able to maintain it and not have to give away rent in the first quarter. And then our occupancy today in San Francisco is 97.5% which is 90 basis points higher than it was in the fourth quarter.", "Juan Sanabria", "Great. On the expense side, I was just hoping you could talk to the assumptions around expense growth kind of picking back up into 2018, but maybe a little lower than at least we expected in 2017 and kind of what's driving that movement in 2017 and 2018 and any color would be appreciated.", "Thomas Toomey", "I'd say, really what you see is in the fourth quarter for example of this year, our expenses came in a bit higher than we expected at 4.2%. It was really due to real estate taxes, which were up 9.5%, a big part of that was the phase-in of the 421gs in New York and we also got hit with real state taxes year-over-year in San Francisco and Seattle.", "Last year, we also had quite a bit in the fourth quarter of some real estate tax refunds. So we came in a little heavier on expenses in 2016 than we'd anticipated which basically brought down some of the growth rate in 2017. So it was a comp year, but our current expectation is still that when you look at the components of expense growth next year, it's still going to be heavily weighted towards real estate taxes, which will probably be high single-digits. You've got utilities call it in the 3% to 4% range. We expect repairs and maintenance to be flat to slightly negative. We think our marketing will be negative growth in 2017, and our personnel we expect to be about 2%.", "As you jump over to 2018, where we have a range of 3% to 5%. There's a lot of unknowns at this point. Part of it \u2013 the biggest component is real estate taxes. We can see what's going to happen with 421s, but over the last couple of years that valuations of our real estate, and sales comps have gone up, which has driven real estate taxes. We are not sure at this point, how much will get into real estate tax refunds from prior years.", "Then the other component on the expense stack that we are looking at pretty intently, especially as you get into later this year, but especially in 2018 is personnel cost. We're just not sure if they're going to spike, we've been able to maintain those it basically sub-inflationary levels, as we've been able to realize some efficiencies and even though we've been giving people raises of 3% or so, we've been able to reduce some headcount. Not sure how much more that we have, but really the things that will swing it from the three to the five are probably mostly related to the real estate taxes and personnel lines.", "Juan Sanabria", "Thank you.", "Thomas Toomey", "Sure.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.", "Austin Wurschmidt", "Hi, guys. It's Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan. Just wanted to touch on the same-store revenue guidance again. It seems like through the second half of 2016, you guys are north of 5%, so you've got a pretty healthy rate, earning into the first half of the year. And Tom, you mentioned in the concessions should abate in a lot of your markets in the second half of 2017. So I guess really what are you assuming for the second half of the year for same-store revenue growth, to get you down to that 3% to 4% range? ", "Jerry Davis", "Well really the assumption is obviously that you may or may not, if you get down to the 3%, have the pricing power that we're expecting, which is the blended new and renewal lease rate growth between 3% and 4%. One thing that benefited us quite a bit in the second half of 2016, was we had a positive variance on different line items. One was occupancy, in the fourth quarter, we were 30 BPs higher than the fourth quarter of prior year.", "The second one is, late 2015, we started pushing up new initiatives that bore fruit last year. One was charging for parking spaces throughout the portfolio even on at some suburban garden communities. Actually, the pick up and parking revenue attributed about 15 basis points to our revenue growth for the full-year and most of that was occurring in the second half.", "So some of that will not be repeatable, but yes, really when you look at the second half of the year, what could drive us down, and what's really hitting us right now is some of this irrational pricing, that you\u2019ll see in our high supply markets where people are given away two months free. Obviously, when you look at what our blended growth was in the fourth quarter at 2.4% and 0% on new and 5.1% on renewals, some of that was seasonal, some of that was weakness in the markets.", "We're anticipating easier comps in the second half of the year, but I think the biggest factor that you really need to realize is the impact in the second half of 2016 from the improvement in occupancy and the improvement in some other fee income that may or may not repeat.", "Austin Wurschmidt", "Thanks for the color, Jerry and then just sticking maybe with Northern California, one of the higher supply markets. What are you seeing across the different submarkets between San Jose, downtown San Fran, and the East Bay just on the ground?", "Jerry Davis", "They\u2019re all tough, I guess to start with. There is none that are doing great that some are much more challenged with new supply. I can tell you, SoMa is probably the most difficult where you've got a new lease rate growth that\u2019s at least negative 5% and we had our revenue growth revenue growth there in the quarter, I think was something like some SoMa was I think negative 0.8% for the fourth quarter. So it was weak.", "Santa Clara was probably our next weakest we've got two or three properties down there and it was 2.1%, but we had a couple of strong producers to our San Mateo were at 4.5% our best market in the fourth quarter was Mountain View we've got one asset their net revenue growth 6%.", "I guess the commonality we\u2019ve done really well is they were not combating new supply at all. They are - maybe B minus properties. But you're getting new supply down and Mission Bay and SoMa it's very difficult and you're repricing units negative mid single-digits, which is creating revenue growth that's slightly negative.", "Austin Wurschmidt", "Great, Thanks for taking the question.", "Thomas Toomey", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.", "John Kim", "Thank you. I guess without delving too far into politics, how concerned are you about headwinds to demand under the new administration? And in particular, we're already seeing major changes to immigration policy, and I'm wondering how much you think that may impact some of your coastal markets?", "Joseph Fisher", "Yes. Thanks, John. This is Joe. So we been a lot of time going to take and through the variance the scenarios here and kind of decision free analysis of tax for deregulation border Texas immigration et cetera . But to be honest, a lot of it is really just big picture going to theoretical at this point. So trying to actually come up with decisions based of it's a little bit difficult.", "I think we\u2019re going to the optimistic side, of course on deregulation and tax reform in terms of what it means for the company longer-term, but in terms of what it means for our forecasting and near-term business, how we're thinking about it. We're going to remain patient prudent about it and not making a big picture decisions based off the theoretical at this point. Harry are going to take through a little bit more detail offline on GSE or tax reform, et cetera, but at this point, nothing major impact in the business.", "John Kim", "How about in particular like H-1b visas? Is that something you track within your portfolio as far as number of residents that are under this visa plan?", "Jerry Davis", "Yes, this is Jerry. I don't have that information.", "John Kim", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Michael Lewis with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.", "Michael Lewis", "Thank you. I actually wasn't going to mention Trump, but John got me in the mood. One of the things we were thinking of is, we came across this list of the 50 Trump infrastructure projects most likely to get done. I was wondering if you've looked at your portfolio, and where maybe you have exposure, where there's apartments close to these projects, where maybe you could see some demand increases. I don't know if you've looked at that yet?", "Thomas Toomey", "This is Toomey. We haven\u2019t seen the list, but I'll be interested in send in our production and if you look forward to Chuck Schumer and the Dems would help as well.", "Michael Lewis", "Okay, well I can forward it to you, at least. I don't know if I could \u2013 Schumer hopefully has already seen it. My second question is an open-ended one for Joe. To jump on your first call by the way. I was just curious if you haven't been at UDR very long but you have a history of following the Company, and I'm wondering if there's anything you've seen so far maybe that has surprised you or things you think you could do differently. I don't know if the commercial paper program has your fingerprints on it, but just if you have initial thoughts or things you and Tom have talked about?", "Joseph Fisher", "No, I guess as you said I\u2019ve been around the industry in the Company for quite a while at this point. So knowing the team here, 10 plus or minus years, so got another more over time, their strategies, how they operate and as part of the process, I think both sides did a lot of due diligence in terms of understanding each other and where the organization is going with the resources are available, et cetera. So no surprises at this point. Really just trying to get up to speed and kind of learn the side of business a little bit more and add value where I can.", "In terms of the CP program, that was really the work of Warren and Abe Claude from the Treasury team really taking that forward and they getting that in place. So excited about that they work pretty hard with the rating agencies to get the A2 and P2 ratings from S&P and Moody's and then all of our lenders to get that put in place. So pretty excited about that is just another alternate form of capital that we have available.", "Again as said in the opening remarks, so keep in mind that an alternative to our line. That is not in addition to our line of credits or intent is not to take on additional floating rate debt exposure. It's not additional capacity as we see it. It's just access to potentially a lower price cost of capital for us, but the line which today indications are kind of inside of L plus 50 on CP possibly even tighter than that. So we feel pretty good about that.", "Michael Lewis", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question.", "Rich Anderson", "Hey, thanks and good morning. So I'm looking at the tone of the call here, and the development spending number in particular of $400 million at the mid point. Tom, you alluded to keeping development in the range of 5% to 9% of enterprise value. Is $400 million of the development spending a low number, like maybe the floor that we could expect from UDR, or could it even be lower than that?", "Thomas Toomey", "Okay. Rich, good morning or good afternoon, either way, it's about the midpoint of it. We think that range of 5% to 9% gives us flexibility to continue to find opportunities. But we will weigh them one deal at a time and let the market dictate where the best cost capital is against the return and risk.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay, so $400 million if second half doesn't go the way you think, could go to $300 million or something lower?", "Thomas Toomey", "Yes, maybe deal is not a clear that hurdle and if it doesn't, I\u2019m not married to that number, a married to proper capital allocation decisions.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay, and then a question for Jerry. What's the situation with Los Angeles? I remember a year and a half ago, everyone was getting all warm and fuzzy about the market, and then it disappointed in 2016 because of supply, and now it's back up in one of your favorite markets. It's really kind of come full circle in a really short period of time that's not really typical of a market. Can you describe what's going on there and why it\u2019s to hedge such a kind of a wipes \u2013 all kind of event over the past year and a half?", "Jerry Davis", "I\u2019d love to it, Rich. Yes, I mean we discussed this in prior calls, but our LA portfolio is really predominantly concentrated over Marina del Rey, got three of our four properties there. And that city is about two miles from Playa Vista, which is where the bulk of Silicon Beach and you\u2019ve got significant tech jobs going here. But last year, we also had a couple thousand units, really two operators that came in and had to lease up their properties last year and they came in with some of this what we've been calling irrational pricing.", "We are going away two months free on 12 and even though their base rents were probably 15%, 20% higher than ours, when you come in with two months free you basically kill any pricing power we had in our assets. So it took us from a, call it, the fourth quarter of 2015 in Los Angeles, we have revenue growth of about 10% I believe. And when you look at the fourth quarter of this year, it was down to 2.8%. It was really because we have no pricing power throughout the year.", "Sometime in the fourth quarter both of those deals stabilized get up to 90% occupancy, and all of the sudden, we\u2019ll start pushing rate again. So again, if you were to look at the new and renewal growth page in our supplement, in the fourth quarter, we had new lease rate growth in LA of 1.4%, which was above average for the Company and it's 2.1% so far in January. So our expectation is LA \u2013 our submarket of LA had the biggest wave of supply in it, once it went away. We are able to get back on track and start pushing rate again and we currently think Los Angeles is going to performing above average for UDR.", "Now if you go to Downtown LA, it's a different story. There's probably 3,000 to 4,000 units coming online in 2017. There is a couple thousand units in lease-up there right now. I think most of them are given away about a month free, so it's not irrational, but it's just heavy doses of new supply downtown.", "So one of those deals depending on where your properties are located, you could have different results and because we have so much concentration at Marina del Rey. You can see us swing I think from having a great 2015 to underperforming if you will, by peer comparisons 2016 and I think in 2017, we'll probably do about as well as everybody else, maybe a little better.", "Harry Alcock", "Hey, Rich. This is Harry. I just wanted to add one point, if you look longer term in Los Angeles there's been a couple ballot initiatives, one that\u2019s on the March ballot that is actually proposing to impose a moratorium on all new development in Los Angeles. It's a little unclear how those are going to play out, but clearly with the heavy doses of new recent supply, you have some local pushback, which from a fundamental standpoint could bode well for that market long-term.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay. And then, if I guess to have a yes, no where I'm not going to tell you response Metro D.C. is that a green market so to speak on your Page 16 and 18 or too early to say? ", "Thomas Toomey", "It\u2019s too early to say, I would say it\u2019s either average or it would be a green. We do see D.C. as being one of the markets that we see continued improvement as you get out to 2018. As we stated this year, we're going to be in the 3\u2019s that's up from mid 2\u2019s in 2016, but yes, we're really not in \u2013 our portfolio, I think that\u2019s the answer just that our portfolio is not going to head-to-head with much new supply in D.C.", "We have one asset that's really going against fairly sizable way down by the ballpark or Southwest waterfront, but that one deal happens to be our rent control deal, which is pricing significantly lower, but yes, I think, D.C. if I'd guess today it\u2019s going to be average to above average. The other market we think very likely will show some improvement in 2018 over 2017 just because how bad it's getting beat up this year would be San Francisco.", "We think San Francisco is going to definitely be a below average market this year as we go through absorbing supply, especially in the downtown area in the first half of 2017. But what we're hopeful for and I can't say that Los Angeles story repeats itself, but what we're hopeful for is that once you get through that supply pricing comes back, and you get to get back at it.", "Rich Anderson", "Great. Thanks.", "Thomas Toomey", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore. Please go ahead with your question.", "Rich Hightower", "Hi. Good afternoon, guys. And welcome, Joe. So first question is related to sort of this comment about irrational pricing and some of the new lease-up competition within your submarkets. So how much of your view on the composition of the builder base, meaning merchant builders, or people with expensive mezz financing going to catch that, or people like that, how much of that colors your view on how long this irrational pricing dynamic will continue, and would you say any of that is reflected in guidance for the year?", "Harry Alcock", "This is Harry, and then turn it over to Jerry. I think you hit sort of an important element of our business as we look into 2017 that for the merchant builders in particular who rely on construction financing, that financing is clearly much more difficult to obtain lower loan to values, higher spreads, sort of redlining certain developers in certain markets. So that financing is not merely as readily available as it has been a year-ago, which inherently I mean that combined with continued rising costs and deceleration in fundamentals should result in fewer starts in 2017 that we've seen in the past two or three years.", "Jerry Davis", "Yes, I would add Rich, when you say how much is built into our guidance. I would say if there is significant irrational pricing, yes, we think that's what probably would push us down to the low end of our revenue guidance and if a lot of those get leased up or if there's a lack of that irrational pricing in 2017, I think that's what gets us up to the top end, but we think that is one of the biggest variables that we face on the revenue side.", "I think we can maintain the occupancy. I think we see the supply, the other wild card obviously is the job picture, but that pricing as what we feel really did the most damage to us and the sector this past year whether was in San Francisco, Los Angeles, even in New York City. I think there's a bit of a slowdown in job creation in San Francisco last year, but we do think what got us most was two months free on a 12.", "Thomas Toomey", "Rich, this is Toomey. Just some additional color. The GSEs have a program and I\u2019ve use this is kind of an escape valve. Whereby they will go to permanent financing as well as a drawdown schedule if you will, on properties that are in lease-up. So you can go from \u2013 you don't have to be at 85%, 90% occupancy, you can start financing on a permanent basis as low as 60%.", "Now it cuts proceeds, but clearly the GSEs have programs should some of these developers as their lease-ups look for an avenue to go to perm in a quicker pace, they just have to look at the pricing grid and determine if that's the better option forms. So I think is that program starts getting more traction in the space, it maybe a little bit of a relief valve on that urgency to get to 90% so you can get to permanent financing.", "Rich Hightower", "Okay. That's actually very helpful color. Second quick question, you guys mentioned five of the home properties in DC are entering the same-store pool in I think the first quarter of 2017. Can you guys give us a sense of sort of the basis points of contribution to same-store revenue growth that are held within those assets?", "Jerry Davis", "Sure. Honestly, we have 3,400 total units coming into the same-store pool in the first quarter. We got the five home properties, you've got one property that was a development deal we did in Del Ray area of DC You've got one renovation deal that's in the Pacific Heights area of San Francisco and then eighth property is our Pier 4 deal up in the Seaport area of Boston, and you combine all of those in contribution to total same-stores is basically zero. They kind of net out, a lot of it is because of the locations they\u2019re at.", "San Francisco was sub performing market, DC is kind of right in the middle. Boston is probably at the high end the blended altogether. They probably don't make significant they don't make any impact really on the total same-stores and even within DC, the contribution of those five home assets, the contribution is deminimize.", "Rich Hightower", "Okay. That\u2019s great. Thanks Jerry.", "Jerry Davis", "Sure.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.", "Nick Yulico", "Hi, everyone. Going back to your 2017 market revenue growth expectation page here, and New York, Francisco or solicited below 3% revenue growth, something to get a little bit more precise of a range of outcomes for those two markets?", "Thomas Toomey", "Yes, we typically don't give anymore precise. I will tell you this, at this point, they're not negative.", "Nick Yulico", "Okay, so not negative. All right, and then for those two markets, where are your in-place rents versus where you're trying to get new leases signed today? Are you still below market?", "Thomas Toomey", "I do not have that on May, I'm fairly certain I would have a gain to lease, which is what you're saying on both of those right now.", "Nick Yulico", "Okay.", "Thomas Toomey", "And yes that\u2019s basically when you do look at new lease rate growth that we show on the page of the supplement, typically if you see the numbers in negative remains what your in-place rents are greater than what current market rents are. So you're going to reprice negatively when you have a turn. So yes, I don't have the numbers on me, but I'm fairly certain those are going to lease.", "Nick Yulico", "Okay and just last question, Tom I think you talked about concessions abating second half of 2017, I think some of that was related to San Francisco, but if we think about Francisco, New York. I mean maybe there is a little bit different of a supply delivery completion picture in 2017, but there is still 2018 to come more supply. I\u2019m wondering is this \u2013 when we talking about concessions abating, I mean do they go away on 2017/2018 or they just kind of bounce around and make both markets still challenging markets to be trying to compete versus new supply.", "Jerry Davis", "Yes, it\u2019s Jerry. I\u2019ll let Tom clean this up if you wants to, but I\u2019d say this in San Francisco, our expectation is I don\u2019t know if we would say concessions go away. We think they come down significantly. Yes, I can tell you and for example in the fourth quarter, this year our concessions in San Francisco were 300,000 plus higher than they were in the fourth quarter of last year that was about 40% of our total concessions.", "So I think as the supply goes through and you don't have as many lease up offering one to two months, and I think that takes all the pressure off to stabilize deals. So it should come down, will go to zero. Now, I can't tell you exactly where it will go, but I think the concession pressure there is shorter lived than it is a New York and we've stated previously, we think New York is going to be a challenging market for us and the other peers probably well into 2018 as supply continues [Technical Difficulties].", "Thomas Toomey", "Hey, Nick, this is Toomey. Just to give you a little bit more longer-term trend view from my point and I\u2019m closing on 25 plus years of doing this, 60% of the time in the market, you can get your deal leased up with one-month concession. 20% of the time, you don't need to offer that. That was 2015.", "We did not have to offer any concessionary in almost any of our lease ups to gain the traction in lease up velocity, we are striving for in the pricing power. So 2016 fit a lot into that 60% bucket and we saw a handful of markets that went over the line past one-month free and then that's just a function of either job loss or excessive supply and you identified in both cases San Francisco and New York and 20% of the time you're in a recession, you're delivering a deal and you are going two to three months free.", "We don't see that horizon out there in our marketplace. We think the market's moving back to its normal pattern, which it operates 60% of the time. One-month free, as soon as that is leased up, people pull off the concessions, go back to full pricing and that's when we're seeing that exhibited for example in a market like LA.", "And our theory for 2017 is a handful of markets operate in that 60%, some of them are going to be on the lower side and still offer that concessionary, but Jerry and his team are pretty sensitive to it and you can see the responses been driving occupancy, and being very successful at it.", "So I think the key is, is being very nimble about your pricing schemes and sensitive to the concessionary markets. And I've always cautioned people on your side of the fence, you would learn a lot more by looking at the confectionery market, then you will the same-store market. It is a leading indicator towards our pricing power, strengthening or weakening.", "Nick Yulico", "That\u2019s good perspective. Thanks, Tom.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please proceed with your questions.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Hey, good morning out there. And welcome, Joe to the other side of the conference call dial-in. Just a question, Tom, and maybe you are answering it when the phone cut out, but as far as concessions go, do you think that they have reached sort of a stable level and therefore as far as somewhere mid 2017 for the back half, then they\u2019ll go down or do you guys anticipate in some of the markets that confessions pressure could continue to increase in the first part of 2017?", "Thomas Toomey", "Well, I think it\u2019s a market-by-market specific question, and if Jerry wants to speak to or you want to address this particular market and its concession pattern, it's probably best directed at him. Mine is just an overall trending of how I see the market reacts and it's pretty darn predictable in my view.", "Jerry Davis", "Yes. I would say this Alex. This is Jerry. I think for now, they appear to be stable. I don't think they're increasing few markets that are actually coming down and we've had some success on lease-ups in a few markets where you're at that normalized level that Toomey was talking about. For example, we've got a deal in Irvine called, The Residences on Jamboree this past month, we signed 40 leases, we open this place about I guess two to three months ago, but we had 40 leases this past month add one-month free and today we're 40% leased and almost 20% physically occupied.", "So it is market by market, I think when you get up to San Francisco, we're finishing up to lease-up it 399 Fremont, and we're down to the last couple of probably least desirable units. And yes, we are now going to offer closer to two months free to finish this thing out. So it\u2019s dependent on the submarket, but I do think is significant supply gets absorbed in places like San Francisco, you're going to see it go back down, but it's stable today.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay. So the bottom line is Jerry that whereas last year, there is a bit of how much it surprise, but surprise sort of mid-year with the amount of concessions and supply. Right now, you don't see that happening in the first part of 2017 and sort of a stable situation and then should abate towards the year-end it sounds like what you're saying.", "Jerry Davis", "Yes. I think San Francisco is similar to what it was last year. We're not going to get surprised, because we're in it, but I do think it's going improve about in the second half.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay. And then there is a question for Joe or Warren, whoever wants to take it. On the CP program, you are clear that you would either do CP or line of credit, but from a funding source and overall cost of your debt, does it matter which one you use, does it matter if you think about your long-term bonds, does one react better if you use line of credit versus CP, what's the differences you interplay?", "Joseph Fisher", "The main difference is just in terms of where we're going to price relative to LIBOR. So if you look at where LOC prices today, we\u2019re at L plus 90, plus 15 basis point facility fee. So you\u2019re at 1.05% all-in on that. Indications are that we're going to be probably in that 40 basis point to 50 basis point range over LIBOR for the CP program. So it's really just taking any balance that we had in the forecast over the next year or two and evaluating at that point in time whether not we want to move that over the CP and pick up 50 plus or minus basis points of spread relative to line.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay, and historically, the CP has been inside a line of credit, or has there been times where it's outside?", "Joseph Fisher", "Yes. If you go back to the crisis, clearly CP dried up and liquidity went away. That's why it's a backstopped by the line and that's an alternative to the line, so it\u2019s not an addition to it\u2019s, that\u2019s why we have the line of credit to back it. So CP can dry up from time-to-time, but historically it has been inside.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Drew Babin", "Hi, guys. When you first gave guidance for 2016 in Q4 2015, blended spreads renewals and new leases were up 5.3%. Ended up being a pretty good indicator for revenue growth for 2016 being 5.6%. Given the blended spreads are 2.4% right now, lower than the low end of your guidance, what can we expect in terms of turnover ratios, particularly in Q2 and Q3 during the peak leasing season? Would you expect turnover to be much lower than it was last year? ", "Thomas Toomey", "I would forecast this year it's going to be slightly lower, in the fourth quarter we were down a little over 100 BPs. I can tell you in January so far it's looking like we're going to have slightly lower turnover. It's hard to tell. We could get to a point honestly; Drew, if we got pricing power back significantly as we go into leasing season, we're going to put our foot on the gas again and it could push some people out.", "So I really operate to a turnover level, I try to maximize the revenue this past three or four months our intent, because the spread between renewals and new where so wide was there is value in retaining as many people as we could. So we didn't push quite as hard and drove that down and to drove our occupancy up to 96.8% for the quarter. I can tell you today, my same-store occupancy is 96.8% still, but we're just going to have to see where we're at in the middle of the year.", "Drew Babin", "Okay, thank you. And one more, just on New York City, if you could break it down kind of by neighborhood, where do you expect things to be a little bit stronger in 2017? And I know you mentioned before the financial district assets are maybe a little weaker at some spots during 2016. What does that look like going forward?", "Thomas Toomey", "Yes. I think Chelsea, our one deal there will be our best performer. I can tell you right now, it's new lease rate growth is I think 4%, you get down to the financial district where we have two, they probably \u2013 one of them is positive one today, one of them was negative one. Now we have few exploration so the sample size is very small and all of these for the month of January. But I think financial district is going to be difficult. There is still some of these older converted buildings that are in lease-up today offering pretty sizable concessions.", "The financial district probably goes head-to-head more directly with Brooklyn where there is a fairly significant glut of supply that\u2019s being absorbed. Our property over at Murray Hill, View 34, formally known as Rivergate, it\u2019s doing okay. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s doing great. There's a new lease up that should start welcoming its first residents in the next month or two, it's priced significantly higher than us, but that's one of those situation. If they come in and they want to lease up fast and start giving away two months free, it could have an impact on us, so we're watching that.", "And then our Columbus Square deal that's in the MetLife joint venture actually stabilized. It\u2019s doing okay, which means positive, it completes a little bit with Midtown West, but it's probably doing about average with the rest of the City. So Chelsea is the best and I would guess depending on what happens in Murray Hill, that one could get a little messy, but I would think the financial district would maybe be the weakest because of Brooklyn supply.", "Drew Babin", "Great, thank you.", "Thomas Toomey", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your questions.", "John Pawlowski", "Thanks. Jerry, with regards to 2018 revenue growth guidance, can you share the blended rent rate growth assumption that underpins the midpoint?", "Jerry Davis", "We really aren't going to share that right now. We haven't gotten that specific. I can tell you the basics that come to that. It's really about four points that we thought about. One, we think job growth in 2018, at this point is probably comparable to 2017. We don't have anything to tell us. It won\u2019t be.", "Second, we think several of our markets are going to see stabilization in 2017 as far as where supply is coming in, deliveries are expected to peak in the first half as I said earlier today in 2017. And you've got two markets that probably see acceleration from 2017 to 2018. One of those is Washington DC and the second one as I stated earlier in San Francisco.", "John Pawlowski", "Okay. And can you share January trends? I know you mentioned occupancy but new lease growth, renewal growth, and what you're sending renewals out at today?", "Thomas Toomey", "Yes, I can give you that. New so far in January is actually down 0.7% that compares to flat for fourth quarter. I can tell you a fourth quarter was kind of propped up a bit by October numbers. So it is down, but as I stated earlier, couple of the markets are doing better than they were in the fourth quarter, San Francisco is that a negative three for January for new lease rate growth.", "And New York is that positive slightly under one. The rest on it\u2019s a mix of things. I can tell you again, we have continued to be pushing occupancy. Again our rate is 96.8%, I read an Axiometrics report and came out a day or two ago that was talking about December national occupancy was 30 basis points lower than it was December of last year were 30 basis points to 40 basis points higher than we were at the same time last year.", "So we've continued to do a little bit of the occupancy versus rate trade and then your question about renewal growth, January's renewal growth right now is coming in at 5.2%.", "That compares to 5.1% in the fourth quarter and what we're sending now for the next couple of months is right around 5%.", "John Pawlowski", "Okay, thank you.", "Thomas Toomey", "Sure.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead with your question.", "Dennis McGill", "Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just digging in on the supply a little bit, there seems to be too many moving pieces when we look forward. One is how much supply is actually coming and when is it going to come, and then the other piece is how is the market reacting to that supply. So if you look in hindsight, look at 2016, was supply more or less than what these data providers thought it would be at this time last year, or did the market react differently, or some combination?", "Jerry Davis", "I'll start and somebody can finish. It\u2019s Jerry. I would say \u2013 I don\u2019t think supply was more it actually may have been a bit less because some of the supply of those expected to come in the end of 2016 slid into 2017. I think it was more the pricing of that new supply and again we've been talked about, so I don\u2019t want to continuously repeat. But it was people offering excessive concessions that kind of put a damper on the ability of stabilized properties to push rate.", "Dennis McGill", "So if we look forward, then I guess the impact would be the opposite? You'd expect more supply, but you expect people to behave more rationally?", "Jerry Davis", "I don't know. I expect right now that people will behave the way they have been. And again, when we look at the range of guidance we gave 3% to 4%, if more markets prices rationally. I think it takes us to the bottom end of our range and if people price more rationally than I think it takes us to the top end of our range.", "Dennis McGill", "Got it, okay. I appreciate guys.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Rob Stevenson with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go head with your questions.", "Robert Stevenson", "Thanks guys. On the development pipeline, at this point, do you expect to start 7 Harcourt or the Dublin project in 2017?", "Harry Alcock", "Rob, this is Harry. 7 Harcourt is going to be a small redevelopment. I expect that we probably will start that in 2017, Dublin. So land parcel that we acquired out of the bed like joint venture, but in the third and fourth quarter of last year, I think we probably have another 12 months or more of design work, I think that probably has not started 2017. I would look at that more for 2018.", "Robert Stevenson", "Okay, and then since you started a JV project at Addison, is there any reason why you would start another project until that comes closer to delivery date in 2018?", "Thomas Toomey", "Yes, you're talking about the Vitruvian West parcel, where we have multiple parcels that we own with MetLife. Our expectation is that we'll complete construction sometime in late 2018 on that and probably won't start the next phase clearly until that one is completed. So late 2018 sometime into 2019.", "Robert Stevenson", "Okay. And then one quick one for Joe. The $600 million or so of debt was coming due in 2018 has just under 4% cost on it. Where are you from talking to bankers these days, where you guys think that you could place $500 million, $600 million of unsecured debt costs wise today given the 10-year at $250 million?", "Joseph Fisher", "Correct, yes we got that $300 million coming due in June next year 4.25% and then you have Fannie facility that's about $140 million floating and then $70 million fixed in there that\u2019s high 3\u2019s. So you'll probably see us not come out with a $600 million issuance so I would assume. You may see a $300 million to $400 million within that to refi part of it. We have the ability to prepay some of it, so it could get pulled forward. But when you look at rates today, 10-year for us on unsecured, we are certainly about 135 over.", "If you go into kind of insurance in GSE market, you guys have 10 depths wider than that for insurance another 10 depths wider than that or GSEs. So you\u2019re going to have 3.8, 3.9, 4.0 for those three respective options there. If we went down to 7-year, which we have a whole in our 2023 maturity schedule, we could look to do something there as well.", "Then you are going more to a spread of 120 basis points on the unsecured side and then again, moving up from there for insurance and GSEs. So it's something we're cognizant of. We're going to continue to evaluate it. We will look at prepays, see if they makes sense at some point, but we'll keep an eye on it and may address some this year may wait till next year.", "Robert Stevenson", "Okay, thanks guys.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.", "Michael Bilerman", "Hey, it\u2019s Michael Bilerman. Joe, congrats on the move again, and I'm just curious, now that you're C-Suite Joe. What's your pitch to the old buy side, Joe that at least, at the end of November didn't own any shares of UDR? What would you say to him, now that you're in the seat and why you should have owned UDR rather than NAV peers?", "Joseph Fisher", "Thanks, Michael. I appreciate the warm welcome.", "Michael Bilerman", "Would you expect anything less?", "Joseph Fisher", "I think it\u2019s got the same thing, further reason that attracted to come over here was one, you look at management side in terms of the depth of the platform on the management side. Clearly operations, I think we're pretty excellent on that front and pretty good reputation there, continue to outperform our peers in most markets and then the diversification fees, I\u2019ll call it a NAV trade.", "When you think about diversification, it's more or less stability of cash flow trade that plays into kind of the involving shareholder base that exists out there. So the stability of casualties diversification by market, price points of market is pretty compelling. So while it doesn't sound like my old shop owned as November. We've been holders over time in UDR, so hopefully they'll come back in at some point and hopefully some others will as well.", "Michael Bilerman", "Is there anything that you are advocating when you are starting other side of the table for value creation that you'd want to implement now that you're on that side of the table?", "Joseph Fisher", "Yes. I think there was always things not just with the UDR, but with all companies that I always advocating for dependent on my near-term and longer-term view. So at this point, it's really taken those views that I have and skill sets that I have kind of learn the business from the other side with the full information as opposed to looking at from the other side and maybe a shorter-term approach that I had in the past.", "So there's going be things that I\u2019m going to look at, but at the end of the day part of the appeal that\u2019s coming here was the decision making process. Yes. Five guys in a room, all have equal vote and all put their thoughts into it and then we make the decision as a collective group. So my thoughts, I'm sure will be heard, but we\u2019ll debate them as a group.", "Thomas Toomey", "Mike, this is Toomey. Yes, I just add to that. And I think it\u2019s critical to point to. What\u2019s critical for our long-term success is to continue to evolve in a smart way and one way to do so is adding really smart people to the room, who have a different perspective on the world and have been on the other side of the table.", "And I think Joe brings an enormous amount of that and it\u2019s great to having a dialogue with them about why we\u2019ve done things or what we are thinking about for the future and to have a good lens from the Streets perspective, as well as an investment community perspective added to that. So he is very extremely additive to the conversations, we make a decision on things here as a group and anytime that group is stronger, we make better decisions.", "Michael Bilerman", "Agreed. I guess one last one Joe is, we spend a lot of time on investments and operations. I guess as a previous investor, how do you evaluate corporate governance for the apartment REITs, and how do you think UDR ranks? And is there things that coming from that buy-side mentality that you would want to implement at UDR in the corporate governance side?", "Joseph Fisher", "Yes. Anything on the corporate governance side in terms of implementation, we're going to always be open to feedback from investors on the Street, but it's really going to come from discussions with the Board and management team, top down. So not going to speak to any views that I may or may not have on corporate governance at this point.", "Michael Bilerman", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.", "Richard Hill", "Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Quick question, maybe just taking a step back, and we may be unique to this, and we may not be. But in a lot of our discussions with both investors that are investing in apartments and maybe more generalist investors that are looking at rentership overall, there seems to be at least more questions we're getting as to whether or not some of the apartment REITs would at some point be looking to invest in the single family rental market.", "I guess our response is there's not enough apartments in the United States as is over a longer term, so maybe it's not needed. But I'm curious if that's something you've thought about, if you're getting questions about that, as well and if you just think that's a completely crazy question?", "Thomas Toomey", "Rich, this is Toomey. I'll give you my point of view on it. First, from lens of, I think home ownership is going to wane. If you look at it, people that are over 60% is 80%, the national numbers are 63% as they age out, so to speak, that number probably comes down. And so I think you're seeing in general acceptance that renting is a very viable option and the sigma that existed under my generation has waned.", "When I think about the single-family rental business, I've been amazed and very applauding the fact it went from a transaction to actually an operating model. And then when I look at the operating model they've moved their cash flow margin from about 30% up to 40% in a pretty damn rapid window of time. And I think that's a testament to those management teams and to their efforts and wish them the best of luck on continuing to grow that.", "From our cash flow margin standpoint, we're operating at about 63%, 65%, so if I were going to invest a dollar, do I want to invested in a business at 40% margin or one that 60 plus margin and how does that valuation adjust accordingly to that. And we've built a Company as Joe highlighted earlier driven towards cash flow margin expansion et cetera, et cetera.", "And so I think apartments would be taking a step back by adding that margin and to look at the operating detail and ask could it ever achieve going from 40 to 60 plus. It might, but times going to \u2013 it's going to take a long time to get there in my view. So that's my lens on the single-family versus multifamily perspective and I would pretty much say at this time, I would have no interest in joining the ranks of the single-family rental pool.", "Richard Hill", "Got it, that's very helpful. Just wanted to get your strategic thoughts on it. That's all for me.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.", "Wes Golladay", "Hi, guys. Looking at the construction lending environment, it continues to get tougher and tougher. Do you think this will lead to more of a supply and demand imbalance late 2018 and 2019, where you get back to that above trend, maybe 4% or 5% national growth for same-store revenue? ", "Harry Alcock", "This is Harry. I think, I mean just to focus on the first part of your question where you think about construction lending environment is difficult. The fundamentals are increasingly difficult with respect to these individual development assets. So I think it's likely that we will see somewhat of a slowdown in terms of new development starts in 2017, which, to your point could translate to lower deliveries in 2018 and 2019.", "I think you are seeing some of the merchant builders however focus on projects that they can't start, which means they are rotating out of the urban infill areas that drove much of that sort of this current wave of new supply into the suburbs, so that the absolute numbers of units may stay relatively similar. Although, I think there's also a decent possibility that delivers late 2019 slowed somewhat. Jerry, do you want to think about what that could mean from a supply demand standpoint?", "Jerry Davis", "I think as long as job growth continues and you think about what Toomey said a minute ago about homeownership rates. Yes, I think you see a pullback in on supply in our markets. Yes, I could see, getting up to that level, you see the top end of the range we've given for 2018, peers into that range you are talking about, so I can see that potentially happening, but it's really most dependent on jobs.", "Wes Golladay", "Okay and then, are you seeing more alternative transactions like the Wolfe transaction you did a few years ago to help these developers out?", "Harry Alcock", "This is Harry again. There clearly is a market for that type of financing structure given that sort of with the reduced loan to cost available through the third-party construction lenders you have a natural gas in the capital stacks. So those types of investments are clearly available and clearly is a market for them and we're continuing to look at them as they materialize.", "Wes Golladay", "Okay, thanks a lot.", "End of Q&A", "Operator", "It appears we have no further questions. I\u2019ll turn the program to President and CEO, Tom Toomey. Please go ahead.", "Thomas Toomey", "Thank you, all of you and for the extended session, I thought it was very helpful and I hope you found the same. In summary, we feel great about the business, the plan and the right team and now it's just a matter of continuing to execute on a day-to-day basis and build on the success that we have. With that, I'll close and say, we look forward to seeing many of you on the road as we get out there and continue to communicate what the attributes of UDR and our success around execution.", "Operator", "This will conclude today's program.

[Operator Instructions]. ", "I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.", "Thomas Toomey", "Thank you, Chris and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to UDR's Second Quarter 2017 Conference Call. On the call with me today are Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Fisher, Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our results; as well as senior officers Warren Troupe, Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. ", "My comments today will be brief, highlighted by an update on apartment fundamentals and a broader overview of our business performance. First, macro apartment fundamentals. At the outset of the year, we anticipated relatively stable apartment demand in 2017. That is the continuation of 150,000 to 200,000 national job additions each month and wage growth in the 2.5% to 3% range. Year-to-date, both metrics are in line of these initial forecasts, with monthly job creation averaging 180,000 and wage growth of 2.6%. Additional key drivers such as household formation, propensity to rent and demographics also remain supportive of our businesses. In short, apartment demand drivers are performing as expected. ", "Moving on to supply. We began 2017 expecting apartment deliveries to peak around the middle of the year and then steadily decline through the end of 2018. While the aggregate 2017-'18 new apartment supply picture remains intact, our latest third-party data in conversations with large merchant builders indicate that 2017 deliveries continue to slip into 2018 due to tight construction labor market which is contributing to an average delay of 3 to 6 months. This trend will likely continue, resulting in 2018 deliveries more on par with those of 2017. While these are national numbers, we operate in individual markets which Jerry will address further in his prepared remarks. ", "Moving forward, we still expect that apartment starts will begin to decline given ongoing cost increases, labor shortages and construction financing limitations. The latter of which continues to create opportunities to accretively invest through our Developer Capital Program.", "Next, with this positive backdrop in mind, our team, again, produced solid results in the second quarter. Driven by our diversified portfolio and long-lived, high-margin operating initiatives that continue to boost revenues and constrain expense growth. Importantly, these initiatives are sustainable and will contribute significantly to our NOI growth for years to come. ", "In total, 2017 feels decidedly better than 2016 did at this point in the year. Putting this altogether, we raised our full year of 2017 same-store and earnings guidance. The drivers of which were strong operations, accretive financing activities and continued investment in our Developer Capital Program. Longer term, we remain confident that we have the right portfolio, platform and team in place to continue to effectively execute our strategic outlook and generate strong earnings, NAV and dividend per share growth over the full cycle. ", "With that, I will turn it over to Jerry to address operations.", "Jerry Davis", "Thanks, Tom and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to announce another quarter of strong operating results. Year-over-year, second quarter same-store revenue and NOI growth were 3.9% and 4.2%, respectively. After including pro rata same-store JV communities which are heavily weighted towards urban A+ product, revenue and NOI growth was 3.6% and 4.2%, respectively. In total, 2017 is progressing a little better than expected. ", "During the quarter, our operating strategy focused on, one, pivoting to capture an increased number of higher rate growth renewals; two, maintain portfolio occupancy in the high 96% range; and three, continuing to capitalize on our long-lived broad-based operating initiatives. We were successful in these endeavors as demonstrated by the following. Quarterly renewal growth remained strong at 5% and our corporate level renewals team, coupled with improved reputation management, helped to drive quarterly and year-to-date annualized turnover, down by 180 and 130 basis points, respectively. Second quarter same-store occupancy of 96.8% increased by 10 basis points on a sequential basis and by 40 basis points year-over-year and our operating initiatives contributed significantly to our year-over-year quarterly same-store NOI growth. ", "Other income which makes up almost 10% of our total revenue, grew by 9% in the quarter, fueled primarily by our parking and shorter term furnished rental initiatives. These two multiyear initiatives contributed over half of our other income growth and should continue to grow at rates in excess of our unexpected rent growth for the next couple of years. ", "These continued successes allowed us to modestly increase full year 2017 same-store revenue and NOI growth guidance despite recent market rent growth flattening out a bit earlier than initially forecast. Importantly, overall leasing trends in 2017 have stabilized versus 2016, as evidenced by a 25% year-over-year decline in our concession and gift cards spend during the quarter. Moving forward, we expect that our results will continue to compare favorably versus the market and peers. ", "Next, similar to years passed, we see minimal pressure from move-outs to home purchase or affordability which totaled 13% and 6%, respectively, during second quarter. Likewise, net bad debt remains low and at levels consistent with previous quarters. ", "On to expenses. We continue to feel pressure from real estate tax increases and personnel costs. You may remember that we were impacted by a large upward adjustment in taxes paid at our channel at Mission Bay property in San Francisco during the second quarter of 2016, a portion of which reversed in the third quarter of 2016. This drove the relatively low 4% year-over-year growth in real estate tax as we realized during the second quarter of this year. We continue to expect that full year real estate taxes will grow by high single digits.", "On the personnel front, wage pressures continue to intensify, as does demand for our people. We're actively combating the impact of these forces by additional technological and corporate level solutions that yield greater productivity at our communities.", "On to a brief market update. First, Seattle, San Francisco and the Monterey Peninsula continue to outperform versus initial 2017 expectations. Most of these markets will feel the impact of new supply throughout 2017 and potentially into 2018, but demand remains resilient. ", "Next, Washington, D.C. and Orange County are generating results marginally below initial expectations, although still within original ranges. Weaker job growth and concentrated apartment deliveries are restraining new lease rates to a degree. Our 2017 revenue growth in these markets is still forecast to be good, but not quite as strong as what we had forecast coming into the year. Our remaining markets are generally in line with expectations. ", "Next, our development lease-ups continue to perform well as the concessionary environment has rationalized somewhat in 2017. In aggregate, our pipeline is generating lease rates and leasing velocities above original expectations. Community-specific quarter end lease-up statistics are available on Attachment 9 of our supplement. ", "Last, summing it up, second quarter was a good quarter as our operating platform and diversified portfolio continued to drive strong results in our modest increase in same-store guidance. We remain highly confident in our ability to execute through the remainder of 2017.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Jim.", "Joseph Fisher", "Thanks, Jerry. The [indiscernible] that I will cover today include our second quarter results and forward guidance, a transactions update and a balance sheet and capital markets update. Our second quarter earnings results came in at the mid- to high end of our previously provided guidance ranges. ", "FFO per share was $0.45, FFO as adjusted per share was $0.47 and AFFO per share was $0.43. On a year-over-year basis, AFFO was up $0.02 or 5%, driven by $0.02 from same-store performance, $0.02 from developments and acquisitions and offset by $0.02 of disposition-related dilution and corporate activities. I would now like to direct you to Attachment 15 of our supplement which details our latest guidance expectations. ", "Full year 2017 FFO per share guidance was reaffirmed at $1.83 to $1.87. FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were increased to $1.84 to $1.88 and $1.69 to $1.73, respectively. Primary drivers of the increases include better-than-expected operational growth, increased investment in our Developer Capital Program and accretive capital markets transactions.", "Our full year same store revenue growth guidance was raised to 3.25% to 4%, expense growth was reaffirmed at 2.5% to 3.5% and NOI growth was increased to 3.5% to 4.25%. Average 2017 forecasted occupancy was reaffirmed at 96.7%. ", "For the third quarter, our guidance ranges are $0.46 to $0.47 for FFO and FFO as adjusted and $0.42 to $0.43 for AFFO. ", "Next, transactions. As a reminder, the overall goal of our Developer Capital Program is to take advantage of the opportunity provided us by the ongoing disruption in the construction lending market. We do this by investing in third-party development project that give us direct or indirect access to the real estate through a buy, hold or sell, while also generating risk-adjusted returns that slide in between a stabilized acquisition and an on-balance sheet development. ", "During the quarter, we added 3 investments to our Developer Capital Program with an initial capital outlay of $33 million and a total funding commitment of $79 million. This increased the size of the program to $261 million at quarter end which is at the upper end of our targeted range. As we have previously communicated, we exposed 3 DCP assets to the market during the second quarter and expected a variety of outcomes depending on where market pricing came in. For the 2 West Coast JV communities, it is likely that we'd sell one and hold the other with our partner. Steele Creek is still in the market and its future will be decided once we see final pricing in the third quarter.", "As it relates to future options on West Coast development joint venture communities, we will evaluate the economics of each of the investments during their relevant option windows. Holistically, you can expect it as we harvest accretive capital from DCP sales, a portion of the proceeds will be reinvested into similar types of value-accretive structures as you saw this quarter. Please see attachments 12B and 13 of our supplement for further details.", "Next, balance sheet and capital markets. As we entered 2017, we identified several improvements to our balance sheet that we could execute on. These included further on encumbering our asset pool, decreasing our outstanding floating rate debt and reducing 2018 maturity risk. The combination of our $300 million, 3.5% 10-year unsecured debt issuance during the second quarter and our proactive debt prepayments throughout the first half of 2017 achieve these goals. And importantly, we're MPV and cash flow positive.", "Prepayment cost on the $177 million of debt we retired during 2Q totaled $4.3 million. On the JV front, we refinanced 399 Fremont's construction loan into a $197 million, 3.5% secured fixed-rate loan with a 10-year term and we refinanced $135 million of 4.6% pooled debt, securing 2 UDR/MetLife communities and a 2 separate 7-year secured loans with 3.25% rates. ", "With regard to our $500 million commercial paper facility, $240 million was outstanding as of the end of the second quarter at a weighted average rate of 1.49% or LIBOR plus 27 basis points. We remain pleased with the pricing and liquidity of this facility.", "At quarter end, our liquidity, as measured by cash and credit facility capacity net of the commercial paper balance, was $896 million. Our financial leverage was 33.3% on an undepreciated book value, 23.9% on enterprise value and 28.5% inclusive of joint ventures. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 5.3x and inclusive of joint ventures, was 6.4x. Timing will drive some variability in our quarterly credit metrics, but in total, they are tracking in line with our strategic outlook.", "Finally, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.31 in the second quarter or $1.24 per share when annualized, representing a yield of approximately 3.2% as of quarter end.", "With that, I will open it up for Q&A. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Nick Joseph of Citigroup.", "Nicholas Joseph", "I appreciate the color on the supply commentary for 2017 and 2018. Just wondering if you think that part of the outperformance year-to-date in terms of same-store revenue in the guidance raise maybe comes at the expense of 2018 same-store revenue, at least relative to what you put into the 2-year plan.", "Jerry Davis", "Nick, this is Jerry. I'll take that up. When you look at the 2-year plan, none of the drivers in our assumptions for the cumulative 2-year period have really changed. And I would say just right now, it's probably too early to talk about 2018.", "Nicholas Joseph", "And then just -- sorry, go ahead.", "Jerry Davis", "I was going to say the slippage, we definitely need to see a little bit of slippage from first half into second half. As we entered the year, we saw about 55% of deliveries were going to be first half and today, it looks like it was about 44%. Now take into account there's typical slippage at all times, so you could see a little bit of that slippage slide a little bit, as you stated, from the back half of '17 and to early '18.", "Nicholas Joseph", "And then just for New York specifically, it looks like same-store revenue decreased from the first quarter which is one of just 2 markets along with Austin. So just wondering if you could provide some color on what you're seeing in New York and then how much of an impact are you feeling from the lease-up with the Copper building next to View 34.", "Jerry Davis", "Sure. A big part of that was, when you look at it, rents, obviously, each of the successive quarters that build up your revenue growth has been going down in New York. So it's a drop-off that we expected to see, somewhat was on the fee side. We continue to have good occupancy in New York, as you can see in the supplement. But it is down a bit from first quarter. We were running very hot in the first quarter of '17 at 98% and the second quarter's 97.3%, so we lost about 70 basis points there. The rest of it was pretty much on, again, the buildup of the rents. Our expectation, we've said this in the first quarter, that we didn't expect to see New York continue to put up 4% revenue growth as it did in the first quarter. That's an easier comp. Our expectation was it would be somewhere in the 2% to 3% range.", "We're still comfortable with that as the -- for the full year. And as talking about the Copper building which is right next to View 34, it is in lease-up. They've begun leasing some of the higher floored units which are more expensive. And when I talk to my team in the field, they continue to say they're not feeling much of an impact from the Copper building right now just because the average price per unit for the rents is quite a bit higher. I'm sorry, the floor plan, Nick, is very different. Copper building has quite a few smaller units. Our building has predominantly larger units that are more conducive to multiple roommates.", "Nicholas Joseph", "And when you think about competition with it, from a net effective rate perspective, are they offering concessions? And how does that compare to where View 34 is?", "Jerry Davis", "Yes. View 34 is offering modest concessions right now. And when I look at the Copper building, I think right now, they're just offering about a month free. So it's not too excessive right now.", "Operator", "The next question is from Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Austin Wurschmidt", "Just curious, with kind of the first half of the year baked and you're tracking above the high end of the range on same-store revenue guidance and probably some visibility into July and August, what would it really take for you to hit that low end of the revenue guidance range at this point?", "Jerry Davis", "The low end, I guess, is the potential scenario, but we think it's very unlikely. Right now, when you think about how do you get to the midpoint just to start with. Midpoint would assume the second half would come in at about a 3. We don't expect to have an occupancy pickup in the second half of the year. During the first half of the year, we had occupancy contribution of about 40 to 50 basis points. With some of that shift of supply that we were just talking about going from the first half to the second half, if you start to see some of the irrational pricing, similar to what we saw last year in places like San Francisco, New York and L.A, it could put significant pricing pressure potentially on us. We don't see that happening right now, but if it did, we think that, that could push us down pretty close to that midpoint.", "As I look at concession levels today, though, in most of my major markets, whether it's New York, D.C., Seattle, San Francisco or Southern California, there's very few markets today that we're seeing concessions levels up around 2 months. The only ones we see today, a little bit in Brooklyn where we're not directly competing, but we get a little ancillary competition, the ballpark area of D.C. has seen anywhere from 1 to 2 months free. Then really the only other 2 places we're seeing get up to 2 months in some locations is Santa Clara. There's a couple lease-ups there providing that large of a concession as well as that platinum triangle area of Anaheim.", "Austin Wurschmidt", "And then just -- you touched on the ballpark in some of the concessions you're seeing there and DC has been a market you flagged as modestly underperforming your initial expectations. As you look out with job growth kind of slowing a bit here recently, are you concerned that, that market could backtrack as some of the additional supply within the ballpark and the Wharf area start to come online?", "Jerry Davis", "I have to go backtrack, we're still comfortable at the beginning of the year, we thought it was going to be high 3s. Today, we'd see it down closer to 3-ish, may be a plus or minus. So it's sliding a bit. Some of that is because of the heavy supply that's hit in 2Q and 3Q. There's a couple of submarkets that are getting hit. Predominantly the ballpark, we're feeling a little bit not much out in Tyson's Corner. But yes, when we look at which markets have probably come in a little worse than we anticipated this year, you have DC as well as Orange County. We have discussed that back in NAREIT. But I would tell you, overall, this year's coming in right about where we expected, maybe a little bit better because you get those offset by Northern California and Seattle and then the remainder of the markets are pretty much coming in as expected. So yes, D.C. is one that we're feeling a little bit of pressure in right now predominantly because of the supply, a little bit because of the jobs, but we think it's more supply. And we're hopeful it's a little concentrated right now. But we're still not seeing really crazy levels of concessions like we saw in some places last year.", "Operator", "The next question is from Rich Hightower of Evercore.", "Richard Hightower", "So I was looking through the new and renewal page in the supplemental, you can't help but notice renewals were pretty strong, at least in the aggregate and turnover went down pretty significantly year-over-year. Just curious what you guys think the lower limit on that turnover metric is. And can you tell us if it sort of ebbs and flows with the volume of supply deliveries in any given quarter, just how we should think about it?", "Jerry Davis", "I can tell you there's -- you have external factors that affect supply which you described. When you have heavy new development in your submarkets and they're offering 2 months free, that's enough to entice those people to move. And when you look at the comparison to last year, the 3 or 4 markets that we see the most marked decline, if you will and turnover are San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York City which were the ones where we saw the most irrational pricing last year. So yes, if you do see heavy new supply come at you and you have heavy concessions, that's typically enough to make people jump. That shift heavy supply with 1 month free which is what typically people are offering.", "The burden of moving typically doesn't get you there. But I would tell you, there's two other things that I think we focused on to help drive down that turnover. One, we're paying a lot of attention to call it reputation management and resident polling of any issues they're having and then we're taking action to remedy the solution. So I think we're doing a good job there. Secondly, we implemented an inside renewal team here in our office about eight months ago and to date this year, we feel like we've saved an incremental 200 move-outs that would have occurred if we didn't have this team and that's helped buoy up our occupancy and helped drive down some of this turnover.", "Richard Hightower", "All right, that's helpful, Jerry. And maybe one follow-up to some of the comments on the concession environment this year versus last year. What do you think is driving that if it's anything beyond just the volume of supply deliveries? Is there something else that's causing the market to be a little more rational this time around? Is it just the experience of last year sort of chastening behavior, in that sense or something else?", "Jerry Davis", "I think part of it last year, I think people were very concerned with significant interest rate increases and they're trying to lock in their financing. I think that you've seen a little bit more of an elongation of the delivery period so much at one time. So while it's putting some pricing pressure on most of the stabilized new leases, it's not extensive to the degree it was last year. So I think it's a little bit less of both of those things.", "Operator", "The next question is from John Pawlowski of Green Street Advisors.", "John Pawlowski", "Jerry, thanks for your comments on the other income growth. Could you just quantify the basis points lift to full year '17 revenue growth that ancillary income's thrown off?", "Jerry Davis", "I don't have that number on me. It's -- I think when I looked at it a while back, it was in probably the 60 to 90 basis points. And I'll tell you this too, it's not a onetime thing. We're a company of innovation. We're consistently coming off of that next new thing that will continue to drive outsized other income growth. So I don't want anyone to think that it -- this year and then it drops off. I think we've got things in the works today, whether it's increasing the penetration on a lot of these things we rolled out this year or it's on new things we'll roll out next year that make this a sustainable driver of our income.", "John Pawlowski", "Okay. Is it a sense that '18 is in line with that 60, 90 bps lift or less or more?", "Jerry Davis", "It's probably early to give a number on that. I think it's still going to be a significant portion that's going to grow that line item, if you will. Other income which grew at about 9% this quarter, I think it was up about 12% in the first quarter. Compare that to where rents are growing and call it within somewhere in the 3% to 4% range on a blended basis. Now I'm comfortable to say that other income is going to continue to grow at a much higher rate than rents.", "John Pawlowski", "Okay, great. And one last one for me, on the capital allocation front, on the margin, are there any changes to your view on the attractiveness of the risk-adjusted returns for on balance sheet development versus other uses given what's happening with construction cost, land costs, supply not seeming to abate?", "Joseph Fisher", "John, this is Joe. No, there really hasn't been -- I think commensurate with commentary last quarter and what you've heard from peers, the development front, the fact that construction costs have continued to increase, labor has been difficult, construction financing market's difficult and land hasn't certainly reprised at this point. So that our underwriting has adjusted to that reality. I think it's still a little bit difficult to make things penciled. We still have a desire to maintain the development pipeline and to go out there and find land parcels, but it's not as easy as it sounds perhaps. So there's still a desire in the capital allocation front to find parcels, keep the development pipeline where it is, although it's naturally going to drift down, if you look at our completion schedule.", "And similarly, on the DCP, you can see we had some good success there in the quarter of deploying additional capital into that program, both with Wolff on the West Coast development JV as well as a couple of new structures with other partners. So we still have interest there, still taking a look at additional investments on that front. So there really hasn't been much of a shift at this point in time on capital allocation.", "Operator", "The next question is from Rob Stevenson of Janney.", "Robert Stevenson", "Jerry, when you think about the submarkets around D.C., the RBC, Alexandria, Tyson's, suburban Maryland, the district proper, I mean, any material differentiation operating performance lies between that? Or is it just basically whack-a-mole with wherever the new supply is coming?", "Jerry Davis", "It's fairly consistent, Rob. You got some markets are doing a little bit better. I will tell you, our -- two of our larger concentrated markets, one is that Logan Circle, U Street area, we had revenue growth there of 2.6%. It was a little below average but when you go over to Columbia Pike out in Arlington, you've got revenue growth that was 6.5%. So that was by far our strongest. I think that was predominantly, it was going off an easy comp last year when it was hit with new supply. You got a couple of submarkets for us of that are suffering. It's Silver Spring is being affected by new supply right now. When you get out further into areas like Dallas. There's some new supply. But I guess, we had to say where's the area that's the most impacted right now, whether it's because it's in the same exact submarket or not, Washington, D.C. is doing worse than Virginia. And then I would say our Maryland properties which are either up in College Park or mostly in Silver Spring are doing worse than D.C. right now.", "Robert Stevenson", "Okay. And then within the portfolio today, what are you guys seeing as the opportunity for redevelopment, both on a widespread basis as well as the more or less simple sort of kitchen and bath with a limited scope? What's those 2 subset of opportunity within the portfolio today, you think?", "Jerry Davis", "Yes. I'll tell you, Rob, for the last couple of years and we've stated this. We've been spending about $40 million a year consistently on those smaller scope items. Those are either kitchen and baths, smaller amenity upgrades, things like that. And that $40 million this year, we're actually realizing a cash-on-cash return of about 21% and the IRRs are coming in at about 12%, so well above our whack. About 40% of those are kitchen and bath and the rest of them are either inside the units, things like flooring or just appliance replacements or it's things like converting old theater rooms into conference rooms, making rooftops more inviting, creating dog parks or throwing amenities into courtyards.", "So there's stuff like that, but we think for the next several years, there's the opportunity to continue to spend about $40 million. We don't want to ever get to the point where we make it too big of a program. We like the consistency. When you get to the larger renovations, the larger renovations, just to let you know, we typically underwrite those that are cash on cash, something a little between 8% and 9% return. You're looking for under, I guess, assets that you are -- B assets, things like that in A locations that you can do some improvement to. And we've got a few. We do not have an extensive inventory of properties to go these -- do these renovations on, but we probably got a couple in D.C. that when the time is right, we can take a look at. ", "We may have one up in Boston. We have a couple out in California. Maybe 1 or 2 in Seattle. But it's a handful. It's not a super extensive list and I'll tell you, we're not going to go spend the money unless we can get the return and we're not going to go do it unless it's a location that we think there's at least a potential for some cap rate movement.", "Robert Stevenson", "Do those become more attractive in the aggregate if, as Joe said, you guys can't find over the next year enough land to replace the ground-up development pipeline? Do those get elevated on the priority scale? Or is that regardless you've got enough capital to do both if you really wanted to?", "Jerry Davis", "I think if you had good investment opportunities, you would find a way to, I guess, allocate the capital appropriately. And I will tell you this, we're not -- just like we were not going to aggressively underwrite development, we're not going to aggressively underwrite for a redevelopment just to find a place to go spend some capital. If we don't believe in the project, I don't see us spending the money on it.", "Robert Stevenson", "And then just lastly on that same thing. If it's not -- if it's a B -- if the B asset and A location and it doesn't deserve CapEx dollars to do a renovation, does that immediately put it on the candidates for sale at the right price?", "Jerry Davis", "No, I think you're right. We look at assets like that if we can't pencil a renovation. And it's a B asset in an A location or especially more frequently the B in the B that you can underwrite and if it's not just viable to spend the CapEx, then yes, I think it can work its way onto our disposition list.", "Operator", "The next question is from Jeffrey Pehl of Goldman Sachs.", "Jeffrey Pehl", "Just wanted to go back to the same-store revenue growth guidance. Looks like year-to-date, it's about 4.2% and you were 3.9% in 2Q. Just want to see what your expectations are for third quarter, if it be similar to 3Q or 2Q or if you have a deceleration from there.", "Jerry Davis", "I think we really don't give quarterly same-store guidance, but I think, again, if you were going to just do the basic math of how do you get to the midpoint, it would probably infer that it's going to come down from the 3.9%.", "Operator", "The next question is from Rich Anderson of Mizuho Securities.", "Richard Anderson", "So are you guys seeing -- despite the specifics of supply slippage that you're seeing, is there a movement away from the urban core into the suburbs? And do you expect maybe some of your more outlying assets outside of the downtown to do worse in the coming years?", "Jerry Davis", "I think we've had the assumption for a while that, that's going to happen. We're seeing a little bit of it, but still today, Rich, when you look at where we're feeling the biggest impact of new supply, it's typically in those reports, whether it's a place. But sometimes, you'll have the outskirt locations, I'll give you an example, Dallas. Uptown is still extremely being hit by new supply, but so is that Frisco Legacy Village. We're feeling it up there, too. So it can move a bit. But today, it still feels like it's more urban. So I don't think it's fully gotten in and hitting the suburban product. But yes, I think our expectation, I'll throw it over to Harry to see if he's looking at land and talking to guys if he think it's moving out, but our expectation would be that probably will be the next step.", "Harry Alcock", "Rich, it's Harry. On the investments side, I wouldn't be surprised. I mean, we're actively looking at -- in a number of our traditional sort of large East Coast and West Coast markets. But in addition, we've expanded sort of our investment reach to include other markets that we currently operate in, including Portland, Austin, Nashville and Denver. Some of those will be suburban-type assets as we look to deploy capital, either in the Developer Capital Program. And in fact, a couple of the deals that we closed this quarter were in more suburban locations, if you look at Portland in particular. But also as we look for land sites to back fill our development pipeline, we're looking in sort of those first-ring suburbs outside of the urban core just simply because with relative -- with continued rising construction costs and relatively flat revenue growth for the next year in the urban core given the amount of new supply, the suburban-ish type markets may pencil better for us.", "Richard Anderson", "It may pencil better now, but if it takes 2 or 3 years to bring product to market, are you kind of putting yourself in danger zone in the sense that if Jerry's right in terms of the decision about the future of urban versus suburban, maybe you shouldn't be doing that?", "Harry Alcock", "We look at -- just like anyone else underwriting deals, we look at in-place plus an expectation as to how revenue growth is going to trend. So we take all that into account as we look at these investment activities.", "Richard Anderson", "I'd ask a little bigger picture question. I imagine from a stock market perspective, this sort of concept of supply slipping forward is probably less good than bad in a sense that you don't take your medicine now, but you've kind of just hangs with you for the next several quarters. But then I'm thinking about it, I wonder if the slippage and tell me if I'm right or wrong. If the slippage almost like in sync with the slippage of demand. By that, I mean, the Trump administration hasn't really produced the type of economic activity in the time period that they suggested. And so maybe as the supply slips and we get more sort of tax reform and whatnot from this administration, yet economy starts to heat up a little bit more, do you think this is actually sort of an in-sync type of scenario supply slipping and maybe demand picking up about at the same sort of pace? Is that a fair way of looking at it?", "Joseph Fisher", "Rich, it's Joe. Maybe a couple of things on that. If you go back to when we first put out the outlook and talked about our job expectations, while we were positively biased on what Trump may or may not accomplish, we did not actually factor that in. So when we're talking about demand slippage, I think it's demand slippage versus perhaps lofty expectations but not expectations that we had worked into our forecast. In fact, if we look at what we're seeing in terms of demand today, job growth and wage growth for us and UDR markets across the board are coming in well above national averages. The quality of jobs continues to improve. When you look at kind of changes overall. It's a mixed bag, but generally, we've had a few markets coming better, a few coming worst. But overall, a little bit better than our initial expectations. ", "So I wouldn't say that we've seen job slippage versus our original expectations. To your point though, I can see where you're going with that. But yes, if, in fact, we do eventually get some type of tax reform or deregulation, it is probably only incremental to the demand picture. But at this point, we're not underwriting it. We didn't factor that into our initial 1 or 2-year forecast. So it's kind of gravy on top of that if, in fact, it comes to fruition.", "Operator", "The next questions is from Drew Babin of Robert W. Baird.", "Andrew Babin", "Quick question on Seattle. It looks like sequentially on a year-over-year basis, Seattle decelerate a little bit from 1Q to 2Q. I'm just wondering if there's anything behind that or is it just kind of a blip? Is there jumpy supply deliveries? Is demand slowing a little bit? Is there anything kind of unique going on there?", "Jerry Davis", "I don't think so. I think Seattle has the ability to have starts and stops. When you looked at the first quarter, I know our blended rate growth was a bit on the low side then it accelerated. Today, when you look at what we put out in the second quarter, we have blended rate growth of 6.3%. So sometimes it's just the comp versus the prior year, but we did start the year very good. But I don't think it's anything to be overly concerned about. A lot of our product is in the Bellevue area and Bellevue is getting a little bit of supply coming out today but nothing extraordinary that's being absorbed well. Our Bellevue properties had revenue growth of 6%, 6.5% I believe during the quarter and you got a lot of job growth that continues to either come into Bellevue, come into downtown, job growth kind of happening now in Redmond. So I'm still not overly concerned, but you do have to keep an eye on the levels of supply that continue to come at Seattle. And for the last 3 years or so, it's been heavy, but it's been absorbed well. Today, I'm not concerned. But as you know, we keep our eyes on anything that's showing that much supply coming.", "Andrew Babin", "That's helpful. And one last question on the JV guidance increase for the JV FFO, was that something that just occurred during the second quarter and was passed on for the year? Or I guess, I'm just questioning the Verve, Mountain View asset, is that stabilizing maybe quicker than you'd expected? Was it JV or refinancing? What's kind of driving that upside there?", "Joseph Fisher", "Drew, so the increase that we saw in JV really have a couple of things taking place there. One has to do with the assets that we've talked about that were in the market and the timing of those potential dispositions or acquisitions as they remain in equity and earnings. So 8th & R, Katella, Steele Creek and the timing of those, maybe a little bit later this quarter than originally expected. The other piece of it, if you look in our guidance page, you can see that our Developer Capital Program in terms of the deployment of capital there, that range of $50 million to $100 million now factors in the 3 additional deals that we saw in the second quarter, so a little bit more capital deployment on that front which is going to flow through the JV side. And then I'll kick it to Harry, who can just comment quickly on kind of where Verve yield is.", "Harry Alcock", "Yes. Verve is -- we're 80-plus percent leased at this point. We expect the yield deal to come in at about 6.1% return on cost. Properties right on the El Camino, it suits up very well and that's in the JV with MetLife.", "Operator", "The next question is from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley.", "Richard Hill", "I want to follow up just a little bit on the supply picture in your commentary about supply being pushed out a little bit. I apologize if this has been asked, but are there any specific markets you can point to where supply is being pushed out? And maybe, I think you discussed some of the markets where you're seeing higher but maybe where you're seeing it specifically pushed out.", "Joseph Fisher", "Rich, this is Joe. So [indiscernible] is coming earlier just in terms of seeing the slippage, both within first half to second half and then probably second half into 2018 as well. So when we look at the slippage overall, more weighted towards the second half today, but that could change if we do see more slippage in the 2018. But I think when you kind of look at the themes, all markets by and large are seeing some slippage due to contract labor. But the ones where we're seeing it most pronounced got to go through the West Coast primarily. It's Orange County, it's L.A., San Francisco, Seattle and probably the only other market that received a meaningful slippage is going to come in Nashville. So it is more of a West Coast theme overall in terms of that slippage that's taking place.", "Richard Hill", "Got it. And maybe the same question on the job growth side. Are there any markets where you're seeing better or worse job growth? I know in your prepared remarks, you talked about Orange County. Any other markets where you would point to as outliers, either on the upside or downside?", "Joseph Fisher", "Yes. You mentioned one of them already. So Orange County in L.A. probably a little bit weaker than our original forecast on the demand front. I would want Austin in San Jose in there as well. To the positive, so a number of positives. Austin doing better. Nashville orlando, Seattle, even New York City is doing a little bit better than our original forecast. So we've got some ticks and ties in there. But overall, as I mentioned earlier, job growth doing a little bit better than expected and continue to see job growth and wage growth in our markets doing much better than the national average.", "Richard Hill", "Got it. And then one final question, I promise. Same-store revenue, how did that sort of trend throughout 2Q, if you could? And how does that look going into July? Any sort of guidance or insights there would be helpful.", "Jerry Davis", "I'm assuming instead of same-store revenue, you're talking more about new lease rates?", "Richard Hill", "Well, yes. Either or, but yes.", "Jerry Davis", "All right. I'll give you the rent trends on the new site because renewals has stayed fairly static, call it in that 4.9% to 5% range for the last several months and we expect that to continue, at least into the near term. You look at 2Q, new lease rates on an effective basis were up 2.2%. That's what's in the supplement and it progressed up from 2% in April and it was 2.3% in both May and June. At this time and July is not fully done, we would expect to July to come in the mid- to high 1s. I would tell you, when we look back 4 of the past 5 years, new lease rate growth has experienced a similar seasonal decline from 2Q to 3Q. In fact, when you look back 6 of the last 7 years, we've actually seen July come in a bit lower than June. So what we're seeing today is fairly typical. This year, the slowdown appears to be coming a little bit earlier, but that's kind of where they stand right now.", "Operator", "The next question is from Jeff Spector of Bank of America.", "Jeffrey Spector", "Not sure if this was asked already, but I heard comments about New York City stronger than expected. Can you talk a little bit more about the New York City market and maybe some of the submarkets where you have exposure?", "Jerry Davis", "I don't know if I said New York was necessarily stronger than expected. New York is one of the markets that's coming in about as expected. In our first quarter, we had very strong growth at 4% that decelerated to a more normalized growth rate for right now. It was 2.2%. Our expectation is it's going to continue to be in the -- somewhere in the 2s. But when you look at the submarkets we're in, we're really in about 3 or 4 submarkets. The Financial District during the quarter have revenue growth of about 2.4%, Chelsea came in at about 2.7%. Murray Hill property came in just below 2% and then the one property that's not in our same store is our Met JV property. It's on the Upper West Side and that one came in at slightly negative because it's competing most directly against the new supply of Midtown West.", "Jeffrey Spector", "Okay, great. And then I'm not sure if you had mentioned this already, but did you say occupancy today, we were curious on that verse. Let's think about a comparison to the second half of '16 same-store results? We're just trying to get a feel for that.", "Jerry Davis", "Yes. Occupancy, today, is 96.7% or so in our expectation. Last year, we ran the second half high 96s, call it, 96.7% to 96.8%, but it's going to be -- right now, what we're looking at is probably no uptick in occupancy compared to last year. Whereas in the first half of the year because of -- we ran the first half of 2016 in the mid-96s, we ran the first half of this year high 96s, we had an uplift this year on the occupancy side in the first half. And just one thing I was going to add. Even though occupancy's going be there, the one thing we do see happening as the year progresses is that blended lease rate growth will compress to a comparable level to what it was at the same time last year. So it has continued to get closer each of the subsequent 3 quarters or so. We continue to see that happening throughout the year.", "Jeffrey Spector", "Okay. That's helpful. And then just last question, just -- I know that you hear this throughout all the tours we take about cosigners and parents guaranteeing young renters today. I mean, is this higher than what you've seen in the past? You guys even track this? Is this something that we should even be paying attention to?", "Jerry Davis", "I'd say I don't specifically track it. It's not one of the main metrics I'm looking at. I can tell you I would look at cosigners more intently if I was looking at bad debt, but bad debt is stable over the last couple of years at roughly 0.1% of potential rents. But I couldn't tell you right now it's increased or decreased.", "Operator", "The next question is from Dennis McGill of Zelman & Associates.", "Panagiotis Peikidis", "This is Pete Peikidis here with Dennis. First question we had is if we look at the second half revenue growth guidance, if we look at the third quarter versus the fourth quarter, how do you see that trending?", "Jerry Davis", "Yes. We're not really giving that kind of guidance right now. I would say [indiscernible] going.", "Panagiotis Peikidis", "Great. And the next question, I just want to clarify your earlier comment that was made. So it would take -- where it would take pressure from irrational activity on lease-ups to raise the midpoint of the full year revenue growth guidance. And is that safe to assume then, without that, you could reach the high end?", "Jerry Davis", "I think the high end is definitely reachable. I think if you see the lack of pressure on new lease rates which right now, we would say is most likely to come from that types of irrational pricing, there's the potential definitely that you could get there. But things have to break right in a multitude of ways. But right now, we're comfortable with the midpoint maybe for the...", "Operator", "The next question is from Daniel Santos of Sandler O'Neill.", "Daniel Santos", "Just one quick question going back to the Developer Capital Program. What's your comfort level with any expansion of the program moving forward? And as you think of new projects, are you looking to have exclusive relationships with developers in certain markets? Or does every deal stand alone?", "Harry Alcock", "This is Harry. I'll answer that. So just to sort of recap it, we recently did 6 deals, 5 in the West Coast JV plus Steele Creek out of the total investment of $233 million. This year so far, we've added 4 deals with a total capital commitment of $94 million. We bought CityLine which is one of the West Coast JV deals, so that went out of the program, $20 million and then we had 3 projects that are stabilized today that are all or one of which is 8th & Republican in Seattle. That's in the market and tied up for sale. So that'll come out of the program. Katella, in all likelihood, given that there's a Phase 2, that it comes online next year and in all likelihood, we're just going hold that for the time being and nonetheless, that just becomes a JV. So in effect, that comes out of the program and then Steele Creek, as we talked about earlier, is in the market for sale and that we'll see where pricing comes in. But either way, in all likelihood, that comes out of the program.", "So in effect, we've gone from $233 million to roughly $150 million today. That whole first group of assets has done very well in line with our expectations, sort of low double-digit type unlevered IRRs and we're actively looking to backfill that program with additional opportunities to get it back to prior levels in that $200 million to $300 million range. In terms of the second part of the program, we do not have exclusive deals with developers. However, you've seen us do 7 deals with Wolff in the West Coast JV. So it's not exclusive. It clearly is a program that's working out well for both parties. From our perspective, we get a 6.5% coupon on the invested capital, plus in effect, we get a 50% upside in value creation of the assets relative to our buy-in price. ", "And importantly, we have a fixed-price option on those assets that we believe could be valuable in certain cases, as you saw with CityLine 1, where we had an option price of roughly $100 million -- or $90 million and we had the value of the asset when we declared it was something over $100 million. Did I answer all of your questions?", "Operator", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Toomey, for closing remarks.", "Thomas Toomey", "Well, thank you, all of you, for your time today. We do appreciate it and certainly, your interest in UDR. We started out the call by saying it was a very good quarter. You can see that things are going very well for us, leading to an increase in guidance across the board in earnings and same-store results. And we're very focused on the third quarter and the balance of the year and think things are going to work out for us on both of those. So we're enjoying a very good swing in it, guys and we look forward to seeing you soon. Take care.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's teleconference.

Our third quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed yesterday afternoon and posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, ir.udr.com. In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements.", "I'd like to note that statements made during this call which are not historical may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in our press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements [Operator Instructions].", "I will now turn the call over to UDR's President and CEO, Tom Toomey.", "Tom Toomey", "Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to UDR's Third Quarter 2017 Conference Call. On the call with me today are Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Fisher, Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our results; as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.", "First, macroeconomic drivers and overall apartment fundamentals remain conducive for the continuation of strong growth for UDR in our industry. Stable job growth, combined with improving wage growth and consumer sentiment, bode well for future demand. While it is true that some new apartment supplies scheduled for delivery in 2017 have slipped into next year, current demand remains resilient and we have seen no recent signs of widespread irrational concessionary activity. Like everyone, we continue to monitor the developments in Washington, D.C. and at the Federal Reserve while being mindful that we will provide a basic necessity and demographics tailwinds are at our back.", "Next, our team again produced solid results in the third quarter, driven by 4 areas of strategic focus: one, the dedicated work of our site level and corporate teams; two, our diversified portfolio along market mix and price points; three, the continued success of our long-lived, high-margin operating initiatives; and four, incremental investments in our high risk-adjusted-return Developer Capital Program.", "In summary, 2017 has gone well, leading us to raise full year 2017 same-store and earning guidance ranges. Jerry and Joe will provide additional commentary on these topics in their prepared remarks. ", "Next, I'd like to thank all of my UDR associates for their contribution to another great quarter and especially to those associated in our Texas and Florida markets for their dedication and commitment to helping our residents get back on track after the recent hurricanes and the focus they have shown to finish out a strong 2017.", "Last, looking into 2018 and beyond, our strategic focus continues to revolve around how to best drive our business forward, getting better at what we do and continuing to grow long-term shareholder value. We look forward to sharing our 2018 and '19 expectations with you on our fourth quarter conference call with a release as well as the two year outlook.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Jerry to address his operations.", "Jerry Davis", "Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to announce another quarter of strong operating results. Year-over-year, third quarter same-store revenue and NOI growth were 3.3% and 3% respectively. After including pro rata same-store JV communities, which are heavily weighted towards urban, A+ product, revenue and NOI growth were 3% and 2.8% respectively. Year-to-date, 2017 same-store revenue and NOI growth results of 3.9% and 4% remain slightly ahead of original expectations due to our proactive operating strategy and more rational pricing on lease-ups and assorted markets.", "Strategically, we remain focused on: first, retaining a larger percentage of our residents by higher growth rate renewals; second, maintaining portfolio occupancy in the high-96% range; and third, continuing to drive our long-lived, broad-based operating initiatives. Our quarterly results speak to our successful execution of these strategies.", "First, third quarter renewal rate growth remained strong at near 5%, with new rate growth just above 1%, while annualized turnover declined by 140 basis points year-over-year. Our teams in the field as well as our corporate level renewal and reputation management teams deserve all the credit for generating these high-level results.", "Second, same-store occupancy of 96.7% in the quarter was flat year-over-year. I'll remind everybody, the easier occupancy comps we saw in the first half of 2017 remain more difficult in the second half of the year.", "And third, our revenue-generating and cost-constraining operating initiatives continue to produce fantastic results.", "Other income, which makes up nearly 10% of our total revenue, grew by 12.5% in the quarter, fueled by a variety of long-lived, sustainable initiatives such as parking, short-term furnished rentals and package lockers. We anticipate a continuation of outsized future growth in our other income basket for the foreseeable future.", "On the flip side, expense growth has not been as kind of late. Similar to past quarters, real estate tax and personnel costs remain our two primary pressure points. For full year 2017, we still expect real estate taxes will grow by high single digits versus 2016. On the personnel front, wage pressures continue to intensify as does demand for our people. Similar to past quarters, we are actively combating these forces through additional technological and corporate level solutions that yield greater productivity at our sites. Wage pressures do have a silver lining though, which is better potential for future rate growth.", "Moving on. We see minimal pressure for move-outs to home purchase or rent increase, which totaled 12% and 5% of responses during the third quarter. Likewise, net bad debt remains low, all our levels consistent with previous quarters.", "Onto a brief market update. First, Seattle, San Francisco and the Monterey Peninsula continue to outperform versus initial 2017 expectations. Demand remains resilient as wage growth has ramped up over the past year and lease-up concessions have rationalized somewhat versus 2016. Second, Washington, D.C. continues to slightly underperform but is a market that should continue to produce solid results in the years ahead. Third, after a lackluster start to 2017, Orange County is feeling slightly better. We continue to feel good about the long-term prospects of our portfolio, which is primarily located west of the 405 freeway.", "Our remaining markets are generally in line with expectations. Next, our development pipeline, in aggregate, are generating lease rates and leasing velocities at or above original expectations.", "With regard to Pacific City, our 516-home development in Huntington Beach, we are experiencing construction delays averaging 3 months, which have increased construction cost by 2%. These delays have also negatively impacted our ability to lease as effectively as we would like given uncertainties around firm delivery timing of amenities and apartment homes as well as the high-end nature of the targeted Pacific City resident. Positively, our achieved rental rates remain on plan.", "At 345 Harrison as well as our JV developments, we remain largely on budget and on schedule. Community-specific quarter-end lease-up statistics are available on Attachment 9 of our supplement.", "Moving on. We incurred minimal damage from the third quarter hurricanes that impacted Texas and Florida. A special thanks goes out to our teams in Austin, Tampa, Orlando and West Palm Beach. You all went above and beyond to get our properties back in working order and ensure that our residents were taken care of. We appreciate your hard work and sacrifice leading up to, during and following those storms.", "Last, summing it up. The third quarter was another solid quarter as our operating platform and diversified portfolio continued to drive good results. We remain highly confident in our ability to execute through the remainder of 2017.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Joe.", "Joseph Fisher", "Thanks, Jerry. The topics I will cover today include our third quarter results and forward guidance, a transactions update, a balance sheet and capital markets update. Our third quarter results came in at the mid- to high end of our previously provided guidance ranges. FFO per share was $0.46, FFO as adjusted was $0.47 and AFFO was $0.43. On a year-over-year basis, AFFO was up $0.02 or 5%, driven by solid NOI growth and capital deployment opportunities.", "I would now like to direct you to Attachment 15 of our supplement, which details our latest guidance expectations. Full year 2017 FFO per share guidance was reduced to $1.83 to $1.85 as a result of hurricane damages incurred during the third quarter, while FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were increased by $0.02 at the low end to $1.86 to $1.88 and $1.71 to $1.73 respectively. The primary drivers of the raises were increased investment in our Developer Capital Program, fewer planned asset dispositions and stable consistent operating results.", "Our full year same-store revenue growth guidance was raised to 3.5% to 3.9%, expense growth was increased to 3.1% to 3.6%, and NOI growth was increased to 3.6% to 4.2%. Average 2017 forecasted occupancy was reaffirmed at 96.7%. For the fourth quarter, our guidance ranges are $0.46 to $0.48 for FFO per share, $0.47 to $0.49 for FFO as adjusted per share and $0.42 to $0.44 for AFFO per share.", "Next, transactions. Regarding our Developer Capital Program, the third quarter was a busy one with numerous transactions completed or going under contract during the quarter and subsequent to quarter-end. After accounting for subsequent acquisition activity and disposition activity, our invested balance in the DCP program is approximately $140 million at a yield of approximately 7.5%, with $79 million remaining to be funded. This program has continued to create value for shareholders as we harvest capital and stabilized investments and look for new deployment opportunities.", "During the quarter, the West Coast development joint venture sold 8th & Republican, a 211-home community located in Seattle for approximately $101 million. While we liked the product and the location, the property made more economic sense as a well-priced source of capital to fund other recent DCP investments.", "Second, we added 1200 Broadway in Nashville, a large mixed-use asset that will have 313 apartment homes, 65,000 square feet of office space and be anchored by a Whole Foods when complete. Our initial capital outlay was approximately $13 million, with a total funding commitment of approximately $56 million. We will earn 8% on our outstanding investment, with a share of upside upon sale of the community.", "Third, subsequent to quarter-end, we purchased Steele Creek, a 218-home community located in the highly desirable Cherry Creek submarket of Denver for $141.5 million at a 4.5% nominal cap rate. We originally provided $93.5 million of financing to the developer and were entitled to 50% of the upside versus all-in construction cost upon sale of the community. Our upside participation totaled $14.9 million, resulting in an effective basis and yield of $126.5 million and 5%. Steele Creek is an A+ asset with high walkability, expansive high-end amenity areas, including a rooftop pool and 17,000 square feet of extremely well-located ground floor retail.", "And last, the West Coast development joint venture placed Katella Grand, a 399-home community located in the Platinum Triangle submarket of Orange County, under contract for sale subsequent to quarter-end. The sales price is approximately $148 million and is expected to close later in the fourth quarter, subject to customary closing conditions.", "Moving forward, you can expect that our capital deployment focus will remain on high risk-adjusted-return DCP investments and sourcing new land parcels to support our development pipeline. Please see attachments 12B and 13 of our supplement for further details on this quarter's transaction activity. Next, balance sheet and capital markets activity. At quarter-end, our liquidity as measured by cash and credit facility capacity net of the commercial paper balance was $851 million. Our financial leverage was 33.5% on an un-depreciated book value, 24.6% on an enterprise value and 29.2%, inclusive of joint ventures.", "Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 5.4x and inclusive of joint ventures, was 6.4x. Timing will drive some variability in our quarterly credit metrics and commercial paper balance, but in total, they are tracking in line with our strategic plan. Finally, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.31 in the third quarter or $1.24 when annualized, representing a yield of approximately 3.3% as of quarter-end.", "With that, I will open it up for Q&A. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi.", "Nick Joseph", "Maybe just starting with supply, if you can talk about your expectations for '18 versus '17. And any markets that you expect to see a meaningful increase or decrease relative to this year?", "Jerry Davis", "Hey, Nick, this is Jerry. I'll take that one. I just want to mention a couple of things. First, as we look at supply, we rely on outside sources, predominantly Axiometrics, and then we run permit regressions for a forward supply forecast. Axio's current forecast for our submarkets in '17 is about 42,000 units. And when you look out to 2018, it goes down about 12% to 37,000 units, so a decline. That being said, as we've seen throughout '17, there have been -- there has been some slippage that could still happen in the fourth quarter of this year as well as at points next year.", "When you look at specific markets where we see increases in deliveries in 2018, really, 3 stand out, the first one's New York City, the second is Los Angeles, and third is Seattle. And then we've got about 5 markets where we see declines of more than a couple of thousand homes, and that would be Nashville as the largest decline, the San Francisco-San Jose area, Dallas is also going to decline modestly, Austin is looking to decline, and then lastly, Orlando. All of the rest of them are pretty much flat.", "Nick Joseph", "I appreciate that. And then just in terms of turnover, you've seen it continue to trend down, but is there an opportunity to push that further down? Are we close to kind of the -- a frictional level where essentially people are going to move out because they're going to move out?", "Jerry Davis", "We continue to work on that. As I had in my prepared remarks, we've got an inside renewals team that has worked hard this year to really try to save as many notices to vacate or slow responders to our renewal request. We've had good traction with that. I think that team can continue to drive results. It's something that as we listen to Yelp reviews and respond to what our residents are telling us they're not happy about at our properties, we think we can continue to drive that.", "What you're seeing is fewer and fewer people, at least now, moving out the home purchase. That's at about 12%, so it's still at historically fairly low levels, so you don't have that competing against you. But I'm hopeful that we can continue to drive it down even further in the next couple of years if there's some of these initiatives we've turned on.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Juan Sanabria", "I was just hoping you guys could give an update on how you see the urban, suburban coast over Sun Belt markets playing out into '18. Does that gap shrink, and if you could just give us a sense of how those are performing today?", "Jerry Davis", "Yes, I'll take that initially, Juan. This is Jerry. Right now, when we look at the past quarter on at least an A versus B ratio -- comparison, A is underperforming B at probably 50 to 100 basis points on revenue. When I look at new lease rate growth and renewals, more recently, on an urban and suburban, I think it would track fairly similarly. Right now, most of our A product is urban and the B is suburban, so I don't think there's a significant differentiation. But the suburban is continuing to outperform. I think when you look at where supply is going in the future, it is going to be a little bit less in some of our urban markets in the future, so I think it's going to tighten up a bit. I don't know, Harry, would you add anything?", "Harry Alcock", "No.", "Juan Sanabria", "And then just a question on seasonality, you guys noted maybe it came a little bit earlier this year than typical. What do you think drove that? And does that change kind of how you're trying to target lease expiration timings at all? Or how are you guys thinking about that?", "Jerry Davis", "No. It was just a month. I think we stated last quarter that -- and we saw the deceleration in new lease rate growth that usually starts, I think, in August, and it started in July. So it was only 1 month, but it's not going to really make us rethink lease expirations. We think we've got our LEM schedule pretty set years ago. Today, we have about 20% for leases expiring in the first and fourth quarter, and then you're right around 30 give or take, in the second, third. That feels right to us. And it can defer market-by-market, but on a national basis, I think that's the right spread to optimize revenue growth.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Austin Wurschmidt", "Just curious, you've talked in the past about casting a wider net in terms of development opportunities across your markets, and most of the investment we've seen, I guess, in more of the Sun Belt markets has been through the Developer Capital Program. Is that just a function of the investment opportunity set that's available today? Or would you consider ground-up development in those more Sun Belt markets?", "Harry Alcock", "Austin, this is Harry. We consider investing, whether it's in DCP through acquisitions or through development in any of the markets in which you've just seen us investing recently, that includes the large coastal markets, then also Denver, Portland and Nashville, where, as you mentioned, we've invested in DCP recently.", "Austin Wurschmidt", "And then what are you seeing, I guess, across -- and maybe this is for Jerry. In D.C., blended lease rates moderated a bit there. Could you just give us a little bit of an overview of the submarket performance this quarter and what you're seeing into the fourth quarter?", "Jerry Davis", "Yes. When you really look at the submarkets, the B product did better, sometimes Bs and As will flip flop in D.C. A couple of quarters ago, I think we saw As which were inside the Beltway, get as strong as Bs this quarter. Our Bs were about 160 basis points higher as far as revenue growth in D.C. We're seeing quite a bit of new supply coming in the Southwest Waterfront ballpark area, where it's driving concession levels anywhere from 4 to 8 weeks. We're feeling the effects of that. And a lot of the submarkets within the district, even over at our U Street area on 14th, we had revenue growth there. It was really our worst submarket in D.C. It was at negative [2%]. And then over in the Columbia Pike area is our strongest submarket at 5.4%. So both were inside the Beltway, but that higher-end A product on 14th definitely has felt more of the effect of that new supply over by the ballpark.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS.", "Nick Yulico", "A couple of questions on development. First, as you think about new supply, competitive supply, perhaps easing in some markets next year, are you looking to increase the amount of development that you would be doing? And then how should we think about how you would get -- your dollars get weighted towards development opportunities on balance sheet versus JVs versus the Developer Capital Program?", "Harry Alcock", "Nick, this is Harry. I'll start then hand it over to Joe. So our goal strategically, as we've mentioned, over the past several years is to maintain the development pipeline between $900 million and $1.4 billion. However, we'll do so while maintaining a disciplined underwriting approach. It's likely that by year-end, our pipeline will be down to $800 million to $850 million. And while we're looking to backfill, we would not be surprised if our pipeline stays below the bottom end of that $900 million to $1.4 billion target through 2018, and it's really just a function of the opportunity set that we see while maintaining that disciplined underwriting.", "Again, strategically, we intend to continue to backfill, but tactically, that's going to be driven by the opportunity set. Again, we're looking to invest or develop in the same markets where we've been investing recently. We look at urban, we look at suburban, and again, it's driven by the opportunity set.", "Joseph Fisher", "Hey, Nick, it's Joe. The only thing I'd add there, just as it relates to your DCP and joint venture question, within DCP, as mentioned, we're down to right around $140 million of exposure after the suburban activity. It's going to ramp back up to about $80 million for the additional funding for commitments we have. So we're really sitting around $120 million, which gives us a decent amount of capacity, still up to with our self-imposed limit of $300 million. So still, that's why we're looking for activity there and expecting to really do what we've been doing in terms of evaluating each deal in a disciplined manner as it comes up and consider recycling or buying that asset.", "And then on the MetLife side, the most recent wave of development that's come through there has really cleaned out a lot of that land pipeline. You're really down to just the Vitruvian land in Dallas. So any future development is really probably going to be on balance sheet and not necessarily from MetLife outside of that Vitruvian deal.", "Nick Yulico", "And then you talked about San Francisco, San Jose, seeing supply come down next year. Is that for the entire market there? Or is it only specific submarkets that you think -- I'm trying to get a feel for where the supply is -- you think is coming down. The impact is coming down across all of San Francisco and San Jose, or if it's only specific pockets that would be, I guess, less impacted by supply.", "Joseph Fisher", "Thanks, Nick. Hey, it's Joe just following up again on -- on San Francisco, overall, Jerry's comments related to San Francisco and San Jose combined. When we break that down into that same level, that's [going to break down] pretty similar, about 1,000 units, at least in San Francisco and San Jose. And then when we look at it within our submarket exposures, the submarket exposure for us in San Fran is down a little bit. It was down quite a bit more in San Jose. And we really don't have much exposure over in [indiscernible] just so through submarket [indiscernible]", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird.", "Drew Babin", "I wanted to ask about the competitive asset swaps. I would assume, with B cap rates having trended down and submarkets probably still trending down and maybe some pickup in kind of the urban CBD A product, are there any markets where you might see some types of asset swap opportunities to maybe trade into more urban locations to take advantage of supply maybe waning a bit in those locations into position for the next cycle?", "Harry Alcock", "Drew, it's Harry. I mean, I think you'll see that we did sort of a little bit of that through DCP this year, where we bought really an irreplaceable asset in Denver, in perhaps the top location in the state, sold assets at this Platinum Triangle in Anaheim. I think we continue to look at those types of opportunities. You are right that the spreads between, call it, the B assets in suburban locations have compressed relative to the A assets in the urban locations, and we'll continue to look at those opportunities as they arise.", "Drew Babin", "That's helpful. And then looking at the expense outlook that was in the strategic outlook, calling for the 3% to 3% -- or 3% to 5% expense growth next year, and obviously, you're not providing an update to that right now, it would sound like real estate taxes are maybe something that's putting negative pressure on that or negative in the sense that there's going to be continued pressure. Are there any expense line items that you can talk about that have maybe improved in the asset management programs or things that we can expect expense growth to be much more benign next year?", "Jerry Davis", "Drew, this is Jerry. I guess I would start with when you look at controllable expenses in total this year, and I'll get to '18 in a second, for the quarter, they're only up 0.5%. So you had real estate taxes up 10% and everything else in, probably 0.5%. On a year-to-date basis, most of the other categories are up 1.2% of the total real estate taxes. So we continue to work on, I think whether it's in repairs and maintenance as well as in personnel cost to drive down growth rates there. The other thing we're consistently looking at is ways to invest ROI dollars in expense-reducing utility initiatives, such as LED lights as well as xeriscaping properties, things like that. I mean, I think, on the marketing side, we've done a good job this year of driving down marketing cost. It doesn't always look like it because there are some offsets to our short-term furnished rental program, predominantly renting the furnishings, that's driven up that after-marketing capital freeze. But I can say we're consistently working to keep non-controllable or controllable rental expenses in check because we are very aware that the real estate tax will provide the mixture that you've talked about.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.", "John Kim", "Just a follow-up on the short-term furnished rental program, I think, Jerry, you mentioned other income is 10% of revenue in the fast-growing segment, but can you break out the different buckets between the rental program versus parking and package lockers?", "Jerry Davis", "Yes. I can probably do it offline a little bit better on components, but you're right, it is a total NAV percent. I will tell you, of the parking for the quarter, it was up $700,000 year-over-year, so that was a significant increase. I think it was about 20 -- over 20% up. Short-term rentals, which we didn't even have in place last year, for the quarter, revenue -- the revenue component was up $1 million year-over-year, and the NOI was up about $700,000. As I stated earlier, there are some expenses that are related to this, predominantly furniture rental. So on a combined basis on the revenue side for the quarter, those 2 were making about $1.7 million of the increase.", "John Kim", "And how big do you want that to be -- or how big can it be? Is it an Airbnb-driven business, and is it sprinkled throughout your portfolio or just certain assets?", "Jerry Davis", "First, it's not Airbnb. It's over 31-day rentals, so it's not short-term. The average term actually is 79 days. It's not even just 31 days. It is spread throughout the portfolio, although I'll tell you that the major concentrations are in some of our urban markets. About 35% of the programs in San Francisco, 24% is in Boston, and then 11% is in Orange County. So those 3 markets make up almost 2/3 of the program. I won't say we'll hold strong for this, but we do try to keep the exposure in any individual property to no more than about 1% or 2% of the product there. If it was a property that was in lease-up, where we have plenty of availability we'll go ahead, knowing that when those units do turn, we can put them back into 12-month rentals.", "John Kim", "Okay. And then on the sale of 8th & Republican, it seems like a great location. It sounds like the union -- the joint venture didn't really sell it for much of a profit. So why not exercise the purchase option rather than sell the asset?", "Joseph Fisher", "Yes, hey, John, it's Joe. I guess I'd go back to what we're trying to imply in my opening remarks, which is it's just a well-priced source of capital. So as you know, as we look at the overall first wave of these investments, stepping back, we've had 4 come up this year, it means CityLine, Steele Creek, 8R and Katella, of those 4, we're going to end up selling 2 and buying 2. So the program's doing about what we expected from that respect. Overall, you end up with a couple of home runs in Steele Creek and CityLine and a couple of singles in the other 2. But blending that, you're going to get into the right IRR of plus or minus 10%. So when you look at why sell 8R, you're correct, we like the submarket, like the asset, but we happen to like Steele Creek better.", "So when we look at the ability to source capital in the mid-4s coming out of Katella and 8R and going into a blended 5% on Steele Creek and a 4.5% on the $141.5 million price, you end up with a better IRR over time. And if we had a better cost of capital or more opportunities to sell assets, 8R could have been a purchase. But that's the way it played out when we played the capital against each other and the IRRs against each other.", "John Kim", "And can you just remind us of the mechanics of the preferred return on that? So you get the 6.5% during the construction phase, and then you share 49% of the profits on sale?", "Joseph Fisher", "Correct. So you have a 6.5% press up until we reach 80% stabilized for 3 consecutive months. At that point in time, you're going to go to a cash flow split based off the ownership interest. And then upon sale, you're correct, we're going to receive our ownership percentage if we sell it. And if we exercise our option price, we'll be pricing it at that option price.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.", "Rich Hill", "Continuing on the, just the line of questioning on the Developer Capital Program, we obviously heard about some banks pulling back on construction lending, which provides a pretty meaningful opportunity for you, guys, which I think is resonating in your results. But I'm curious, how do you think about underwriting these construction loans? Is it really all about the property and location of the property? Or are you thinking about the -- effectively your borrower as well? I'd love to just get a little bit more detail on how you're thinking about underwriting them.", "Joseph Fisher", "Look, as we said all along, the asset ultimately has to be an asset that we want to own in a submarket and a market that we want to own. So it comes down to a real estate underwriting position because we do have backside participation in a number of these deals. We have an option price on the West Coast development joint venture deal, so you have to underwrite it from a real estate equity perspective, not necessarily a lender's perspective. At the same time, you do want to think about it from a lender's eye in terms of what your rights are if the deal goes south. So you're kind of looking at it from that perspective as well. So you're kind of looking at it from both ways, but ultimately, you got to think about it as a deal that we want to own and therefore, a real estate underwriting.", "Harry Alcock", "And I think I just -- I'd just add that if you think about the investment the REIT holds between an acquisition and a development on risk-return continuum, where you have some development exposure in terms of the lease results, but we get paid the 6.5% through the development lease-up periods, with no schedule or cost risk. And in the case of Wolff, we have a fixed-price option in the future. So it really is kind of a hybrid.", "Rich Hill", "And at the risk of asking a 2018 guidance question, is sort of your activity in 2017 reflective of how we should be thinking about it going forward? Or do you think that's -- this is a program that you'll see more opportunity in, in the future as other lenders start to pull back a little bit more?", "Joseph Fisher", "Yes, Rich, I think the activity you saw this year is what we would like to do and accomplish with the program. But at the end of the day, it's going to be very opportunity-specific. As long as we keep constraints on ourselves in terms of making sure it's an asset that we want to own, that's going to limit the pool of investors to some degree. In addition, as you've seen, new starts and new supply are expected to start coming off in '18 and '19, so that's going to limit the pool of opportunities as well. So we're going to remain active in trying to find deals and source deals that meet the underwriting standards, but not a guarantee that we're going to develop through this volume of activity.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel.", "John Guinee", "I was looking at your development summary and I noticed, with the exception of Dallas, you really turned off the development spigot pretty aggressively a couple of years ago. So my first question is why. And then when I look at your land position, it looks like, excluding Dallas, you really only have 200 or 300 units, Boston and Dublin, California, of entitled land ready to go. And so I'm sort of wondering, I understand the land focus, but I also know that hard costs are going up greater than rental rates, yield on development is coming down, land prices haven't yet adjusted down. Are you optimistic that you can refill the land bucket and start up your development anytime soon?", "Harry Alcock", "John, this is Harry. I think as I mentioned earlier, our goal strategically is maintaining our development pipeline between $900 million and $1.4 billion. However, we'll do so while maintaining a disciplined underwriting approach. We're going to maintain our target 150 to 200 basis points spread to market cap rates. And so what you see is that our development pipeline has come down a bit. I think we'll end the year a little over $800 million. We're actively looking to backfill for 2018 and 2019 starts, but my expectation is that given the opportunities, that our pipeline will fall below the low end of that $900 million to $1.4 billion for at least the next several quarters.", "John Guinee", "Do you think maybe 150 to 200 basis points spread is too aggressive?", "Joseph Fisher", "You mean, in terms of you think we're being too conservative, which I don't think we'd agree necessarily that we need to adjust our underwriting standards just to maintain a strategic view of development pipeline. The pipeline is going to be an output of wanting to accept our cost of capital. So if returns impress we can always walk away and it's only what we have to do, and development is not something that we absolutely have to do. We can pull back on dispositions and not move forward at the bottom line. So I think maintaining on this on underwriting is probably the appropriate path forward, not necessarily driving the main development pipeline.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Pete Peikidis with Zelman & Associates.", "Pete Peikidis", "Jerry, I appreciate the market-level detail on leasing trends in the supplement. Could you just share or speak to new lease and renewal growth trends for October in New York and what you're seeing heading into November?", "Jerry Davis", "Yes. In New York, new lease rates currently are, for October, are right around negative 2%. So it's dropped off from the quarter, just following typical seasonal trending that we've seen over the past couple of years where you see a downward threat from third quarter into fourth quarter, so it's not overly surprising.", "Pete Peikidis", "And just given the relative strength in Orlando and Tampa? And understanding that you expect supply to moderate in Orlando next year, are you expecting the pricing to keep pace through the end of the year? And are there any risks that rising rents to your assets start becoming more competitive with the overall market in newer product? Or is there still a sufficient buffer there?", "Joseph Fisher", "Hey, Pete, could you just step back a second? You kind of broke up there at the beginning of your question and we missed that. Could you just repeat the first half?", "Pete Peikidis", "Just given the relative strength in Orlando and Tampa, I guess I was just looking for some further color on pricing expectations here through the end of the year and sort of if there's a risk that pricing of your asset start become more competitive with the overall market. Or is there still sufficient buffer there in Tampa and Orlando?", "Jerry Davis", "I would say this, as you look at where October is in Orlando, we've actually seen new lease rates go north of 6%. So Orlando has improved. I think some of that is potentially due to the influx of people affected by the hurricanes. Tampa, however, it's seen more normal seasonal trends. New lease rate growth in Tampa, so far this quarter, is a little bit under 2%. So as far as rates, if your question is are they competing with new supply, I think they're still an adequate spread between our B assets, which is what we typical, for the most part, have in our Florida properties, to the A assets there. Job growth has slowed a bit or wage growth has in Orlando, job growth is still strong. But I think those properties will continue to do well, especially when you factor in what I said earlier about some of those Florida markets are showing less deliveries next year than we have this year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "First question is on the Developer Capital Program, how do you guys incorporate or mitigate the growing delays in construction so as to not impact the returns that you guys hope to achieve?", "Harry Alcock", "Alex, its Harry. We have no schedule or cost for it still. Any overruns are borne solely by developer. That includes schedule or a cost. And to the extent there are delays, the net impact really is that that we continue to collect our coupon, our 6.5% for longer.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay. Okay. Then that's helpful. And then the second question is, Denver, I don't think I heard you guys talk about it before, but clearly, it's a new favorite market for the apartment REITs. You guys obviously took down Steele Creek. Can you just talk a little bit about your home market and your expectation for investment? Do you see the same opportunity there or across others of your market? Do you see better opportunity elsewhere?", "Harry Alcock", "Alex, it's Harry. I'll start to talk about investment. Maybe Jerry can talk about the sort of operating environment. As I mentioned before, with -- our goal is to continue to focus our investment activity, whether its development, DCP or acquisitions in the markets where we've been investing in the recent past, the large coastal markets, but also Denver, Portland, Nashville and then Dallas with Vitruvian Park. So we view Denver as an attractive investment market. Again, we invested in Steele Creek back in late 2013 and now in 2017, have completed the acquisition. So it continues to be a market that we like, along with the other markets that I mentioned.", "Jerry Davis", "Yes, I would just add, Alex, now Steele Creek, for the people who are not familiar, is in the Cherry Creek neighborhood of Denver, which is probably the top neighborhood in the whole city, really irreplaceable location directly across right the Cherry Creek Mall. As Joe stated in his prepared remarks, exceptional first floor retail there. I'd point out it's got a walk score of 95, so it is definitely the place to live. You're looking at rents that are pretty high for the Denver market, at about $330 a foot. They're large floor plans.", "Average square foot is about 955 to 960 square feet, so average rents are north of $3,000. But right now, whether it's downtown Denver or over in Cherry Creek, you're going against a pretty significant new supply. I think that's because they're building in areas where most of the people in Denver would prefer long-term to live. And I think when we get through this supply. This deal is going to be even better than it is today. But again, exceptional location, quality product and it's a product that we've been running for the last 2 years, so there's probably little surprises that we're going to find out about.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "So Jerry, does that mean once the supply comes down in Denver, you guys may ramp up? Or are you looking to increase investment even while there is the new supply wave going on?", "Harry Alcock", "Again, the -- our investment activity within our target markets is heavily influenced by the opportunity set. So we clearly would invest in Denver, either in development DCP or acquisitions, to the extent the opportunities presented themselves. As we mentioned, Steele Creek, in an irreplaceable location, Jerry just went through some detail. And again, I think from a pricing standpoint, Steele Creek compares favorably to sort of the cap rates that you're seeing on the suburban product that's trading in Denver, just as we talked about earlier, partially a function of these high-end core products being relatively out-of-favor with the capital that's chasing the assets compared to the flat fee product.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, our question-and-answer session will resume momentarily. Please stand by. [Technical Difficulty]", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.", "John Pawlowski", "Jerry, the pace of deceleration in renewal growth in the past few years has been quite modest, so the gap between renewals and new leases has widened. Do you expect the pace of deceleration to pick up in '18 for renewals specifically?", "Jerry Davis", "At this point, I don't see any evidence that would happen. Like you said, a year ago, when I look at what renewal rate growth was in October, it was 5.1%. So right now, we're high 4s. So it really hasn't dropped dramatically. And again, at this point, I think rent growth has continued to go up modestly for the REITs. If you look at Axiometrics' studies, it shows that we're going up about 1% compared to about 2% on a national basis probably because of the quality and locations of our assets. But you're seeing rent to income levels stay steady. For us, it's about 24%. So I don't see it compressing at this point, but we're going to have to see what happens as the year progresses. But it really has remained stable, as we mentioned, over the last couple of years.", "John Pawlowski", "Okay. What specific markets are you seeing the most strain on pricing power due to affordability reasons, either move out to rent increase or move out to buy homes?", "Jerry Davis", "Really, on the rent increase, it's typically been places like San Francisco where you'll feel some of that pressure. It's not as acute as it was a year or 2 ago as rents haven't gone up at that level. But really, mostly there, there's not a lot on move-outs to rent increase that jump off of the page at the outside of those locations. The move-outs to home purchase, really, there's only 3 markets that we have right now over that we're about to give that as the reason for leaving: Boston, Richmond and Portland. When you get over 15%, you're moving into the Sun Belt markets. But when you get into the rest of the coastal markets, move out to home purchase is under 10%.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI.", "Rich Hightower", "So I don't know if I missed this earlier, but can you, guys, give a really quick rundown of October to-date data? I know you've talked about it with a couple of markets, but just maybe a little bit deeper in that sense.", "Jerry Davis", "I think instead of giving a detailed rundown of October by market, we can give you that after the call individually. But when you -- overall though, I will tell you that we went from the 1.1% for the third quarter, that's on new lease rate growth, and it's slightly positive so far in October. We haven't fully closed out our books yet. And then when you look at the renewals in total, they went from 4.8% in the third quarter. And right now, they're just a hair below that.", "Rich Hightower", "And then just on New York, looking at the last couple of quarters with your portfolio, I mean, it's still weak relatively speaking, but there's a little bit of stability maybe versus what we might have expected 6 to 9 months ago. I mean, is that -- and I know you've talked about a better concessionary environment versus a year ago. I mean, is there anything to that that's specifically driving that? Or we're still all sort of expecting New York to be a weak market through 2018? I mean, just what are some of the high-level thoughts there?", "Jerry Davis", "Yes. I don't think New York is going to, we would still say, New York is going to continue to struggle next year. When you look at the employment information right now, it looks like it's, this year, producing about 100,000 jobs. Next year, it's going to go down to about 87,000 jobs, so down a bit. Wage growth is 2%, 2.5%, which is not too far off from national average. When you look at the supply that's coming into New York, it's most prevalent in Long Island City as well as Brooklyn and Midtown West. When we look at how we're doing in the city, we've got 5 assets borne in our same-store pool. We're definitely feeling the most effects, a bit our Upper West Side MetLife JV property, where revenue growth during the quarter was a negative 2%. As you go through either our Chelsea property, our downtown properties or our Murray Hill property, they're all plus or minus between 0.4% positive and 1.6%. So fairly tight range for that B asset that we have in New York City other than the, again, A+ deal we have up in Columbus Square.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.", "Rich Anderson", "Joe, you mentioned $140 million of current investment that's going to go up in the DCP program and then a $300 million self-imposed limit. I'm curious if that's a temporary self-imposed limit in such that you see others kind of play itself out and kind of learn from it a little bit and then maybe becomes a greater percentage of your overall development program at some point in the future if it continues to be successful? Is that a fair way to think about it?", "Joseph Fisher", "Yes, Rich, I think that's fair to keep it a little bit open-ended depending on the opportunity set that's out there, so not to say we wouldn't go above $300 million. If risk-adjusted returns kept coming our way and it became more disconnected from acquisition and development returns, perhaps we'd look at increasing that limit. But we also got to be cognizant of where we source that capital fund and how much of that is available. And then earnings-wise, this is accretive to earnings, so we have to be cognizant of the fact that at some point, if the opportunity set dissipates over the next 4 to 5 years as these kind of long-duration investments burn off, you want to make sure that you don't have a cliff in any one given year. And so we do try to keep it under 1% or 2% of net earnings so that doesn't become a negative thesis to the street, but we'll continue to evaluate. So as opportunities keep coming our way, then not to say we won't go above that limit for a period of time.", "Rich Anderson", "Sure. Perfect. And then second question, this whole supply slippage phenomenon that's happening to you and everyone as well as maybe the elevated difficulty finding financing for development in general, do you feel as though that, that is kind of resonating with the broader developer community and will maybe contribute to a protracted decline in supply growth in '19 and beyond? Or is it just too soon to make that call at this point?", "Tom Toomey", "I think you've got the right pieces. Rising interest rate, rising cost, NOI trends, where they're pointing, banks still remaining disciplined, all shape up to a potential to expand the program in the years ahead. And so in hence, we don't want to burn all our fuel right now on this piece of it. But we'll play it out, and I think the discipline that the team has is critical at this juncture and we're going to take '18 one opportunity at a time and make sure that we're cognizant of the overall risk profile of the company and the economy overlaid on that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Neil Malkin with RBC Capital Markets.", "Neil Malkin", "I mean, your stock price is at pretty good levels, and we've heard commentary from your peers that maybe '18 in particular is going to be a good time to actually acquire, go on the offensive. You have a lot of merchant builders who are bringing their product to market and need to recycle in order to keep going and maybe you have the opportunity to buy below market or get in at a good time, especially given your operational savvy and particularly because you have among the highest leverages -- leverage levels among the multifamily peers. Have you thought about raising equity and in tandem with maybe a big purchase in some markets you're focused in?", "Harry Alcock", "I'll start. And I know Joe is going to want to step in as well. This is Harry. I think like any other investment, we'll consider sort of buying, as you say, merchant-build deals that are in lease-up. And we'll consider that in the context of other uses of capital, specifically DCP and the amount and cost of capital sources, which Joe will talk about in a second. In terms of the opportunity set, we think it's possible there's going to be some opportunity here as construction loans approach maturity for developers who want to monetize their position.", "However, I will tell you that there's very little distress in this market, which I believe will limit the opportunities. Many of these deals are funded with institutional equity. So while the developer may be motivated to sell as the value of their position declines over time, the institutional equity can be much more patient, and we're seeing quite a few deals where the equity is actually buying out the developer so the deal never hits the market.", "Joseph Fisher", "Just your comments regarding share price, cost of capital and leverage. I guess starting with cost of capital. From an equity standpoint, the share price has been acting okay, but I would say that we've had multiple times this year that we've traded at a decent premium to consensus NAV and you haven't seen any activity out of us. So when we built the plan around sources and uses, we made sure that it was built around not needing to access the equity market. And if we do, it's going to be for a use that's going to be accretive in nature and adds to NAV overall. So while we've been at premiums, we've chosen not to act thus far this year.", "In terms of the deleveraging, I guess I would look at solid BBB+ investment grade credit rating and the fact that earlier this year, we were issuing 135 over, in line with our other BBB+ peers. So I think our debt investors are pretty happy with the leverage level and kind of where we're at. We've stuck to the plan overall that we laid out in the 2-year in terms of trying to keep relatively static metrics on debt-to-EBITDA, debt-to-enterprise, fixed charge, et cetera, and really focusing more on the composition of our leverage, meaning focusing on increasing the unencumbered pool, increasing duration, reducing floating rate and some of the items around that as opposed to absolute leverage.", "So at this point as has been contemplated the idea of a deleveraging or equity to fund external investment, given the needs that we have.", "Neil Malkin", "I appreciate the color. And then last one for me is in San Francisco last year, you saw a lot of irrational concessions. I'm wondering if you started to see that kind of knee-jerk reaction back up to market levels as those burn-off. I'm wondering if that's actually making renewals or new leases stronger than you expected and if you think that will continue into next year.", "Jerry Davis", "Yes, Neil, this is Jerry. You're right, we did see that irrational pricing in, specifically, San Francisco last year. We're seeing this year, as you really look at turnover, it's down quite a bit, both year-to-date. And then when you look at it for the most recent quarter, it's also down about 300 basis points.", "So I'm really not seeing any more difficulty getting people to stay when you look at the renewal rate that we had in the month or in the third quarter. It was just a little under 4%. So I'm not having any more difficulty than I would say normal to do that even though we are giving away some of those higher concessions last year. So not seeing it and I don't think the irrational pricing has come back to San Francisco. You'll still have some properties into some area that are offering 6-plus-weeks concessions, but it's nothing like it was a year ago.", "Operator", "There are no further questions. I'd like to hand the call back over to President and CEO, Mr. Toomey, for any closing remarks.", "Tom Toomey", "Well, again, thank you for your time today. And in closing, I'd just say this. This quarter checked all the boxes. I thought it was a strong quarter for operations, capital allocations, the discipline remains very solid, and we increased guidance. And with that, we look forward to seeing you at NAREIT in a couple of weeks", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Vice President, Chris Van Ens. Thank you, Mr. Van Ens, you may begin.", "Chris Van Ens", "Welcome to UDR\u2019s Fourth Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. Our fourth quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed yesterday afternoon and posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, ir.udr.com. In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements.", "Statements made during this call which are not historical may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in our press release and included in our filings with the SEC.

On the call with me today are Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Fisher, Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our results; as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.", "I will address three topics today, first a macro outlook for 2018 and beyond, how do UDR strategies differentiating characteristics fits into this outlook and finally a quick review of 2017. ", "First, our high-level demand assumptions for 2018 include a general economic outlook as measured by consensus GDP growth of 2.6% the second highest level over the past decade and creating a growing tailwind. The continuation of solid job growth and accelerating wage growth as full employment is upon us. ", "Regarding tax reform, the general view is it create a bias towards vendor ship as well as a positive impact on corporate earnings and our residence take home pay will increase. We\u2019re taking a wait and see approach, therefore is not explicitly factored into our guidance. And slowly improving single family housing market but with minimal changes to the overall home ownership. ", "Potential headwinds include elevated new supply and higher interest rates both into the curve. Taking together these macro drivers should results in a relatively stable 2018 apartment environment with our pricing power and occupancy expected to be similar to that up 2017. ", "Beyond 2018 we\u2019re more optimistic on a macro outlook for our business as global and U.S. economies are enjoying board base growth after years of monitory and now tax. As multifamily demand typically eco\u2019s for broader economy we should continue to see healthy demand coupled with 2019 apartment deliveries that are expected to decline. All in a positive set of facts but too early to call 2019, although UDR will benefit from an improving NOI contribution from our recent development completions which totaled approximately 500 million in capital invested. ", "Moving on, we just continued publishing our two-year outlook, given our stable outlook. A consistent strategic direction that we\u2019ve executed well upon over the last five years, our ongoing best in class disclosure and both solicited and unsolicited feedback from our shareholder base. Moving forward we will continue to openly discuss our strategic direction with market participants. ", "Next the strategies we intent to employee throughout UDR primary business areas in the year ahead, look fairly similar to those employed since 2013, because they work and include first our best in class operations will continue to be driven by strong blocking and tackling and our innovative technology driven initiatives that are consistently boost our run rate results. We were at the top same store growth performer in 2017 and expect to again be bad in 2018. ", "Second, we prudently allocated capital throughout 2017 and will continue to do so in 2018. Our developer capital program is accretive to our bottom line and will continue to look for opportunities, while remaining disciplined in our underwriting. ", "Our development pipeline will likely shrink in 2018 due to the difficulty of hitting return requirements on new projects. But we will continue to look for accretive opportunities to back fill our pipeline. ", "While our third-party forecast called for interest rates to increase in 2018, we had minimal refinancing exposure due to the significant balance sheet activities we completed throughout 2017. ", "And last our diversified portfolio, by both geography and price point, should continue to serve us well in 2018 and beyond. Let me close by saying that as we look back on 2017, we executed our growth plan well, which resulted in two same-store and FFO guidance raises and ha farm TFR for our shareholders. A special thanks to all our UDR associates for your strong blocking and tackling in operations, disciplined capital allocation and continued willingness to actively innovate across all aspects of our business. ", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jerry to address operations.", "Jerry Davis", "Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to announce another quarter of strong operating results. Year-over-year, fourth quarter same-store revenue and NOI growth were 3.1%. After including pro rata same-store JV communities, which they were urban, A+ product, revenue and NOI growth were 2.8%. ", "Accordingly, results were driven by solid blended lease rate growth of 1.9%, a robust top line contribution from our long life to operating their initiatives, stable occupancy of 96.8%, annualized turn over that was 40 basis points lower year-over-year and a continued objective to drive down expense growth where impossible. ", "Full-year 2017 same-store revenue and NOI growth were 3.7% and 3.8% respectively and driven by factors similar to those that contributed to our strong quarterly results. A special thank you to all of our associates in the field and the corporate office for continuing to maximize our top line growth while also limiting controllable expense growth under 2% in 2017. ", "Moving on. We saw a minimal pressure for move-outs to home purchase or rent increase, at 14% and 5% of reasons for move-out during the fourth quarter. Likewise, net bad debt remains low, all our at levels consistent with previous quarters.", "Next, the primary 2018 macroeconomic assumption that underpin our same-store guidance. First, national job growth of approximately 150,000 per month with wage growth averaging 3% to 3.5%. These are set against elevated to multifamily completion in many of our markets due to supply slipping from 2017 and to 2018. I would note further deliveries slippage throughout 2018 due to construction labor shortages remains a wild card. ", "2018 UDR specific assumptions are as follows. Overall, pricing power in the form of blended, lease rate growth is expected to be relatively comparable to what we saw in 2017. Occupancy is forecast to remain in the high 96% range. Other income should continue to grow at an outsized rate versus rental rate growth or perhaps not as strongly as we saw in 2017. ", "Controllable expense growth will remain in check due to efficiency initiatives but real-estate taxes will continue to provide pressure given our 421 burn-offs in New York and higher valuations across assorted markets. B quality and sub urban properties should generally continue to outperform A quality and urban assets, and same-store community addition for the full-year positively impact our revenue growth by 10 basis points to 15 basis points, expenses by 15 basis points to 20 basis points and NOI by 20 basis points to 25 basis points. Taken together we are expecting same-store revenue expense and NOI growth to each be 2.5% to 3.5% in 2018. Holistically we anticipate that our 2018 operating strategy will continue to favor occupancy over rate growth as apartment fundamentals are expected to bump along the trough. These are improving, nor meaningfully worsening throughout the year. Importantly we anticipate blended year-over-year lease rate growth to crossover versus last year sometime in the first quarter.", "Regarding our markets, those expected to grow same-store revenue and rate above the high end of the of our 2.5% to 3.5% portfolio growth include Seattle Los Angeles, the Florida markets and Monterey. These markets represent 26% of forecast 2018 NOI. Washington DC Orange County San Francisco Boston Nashville Dallas and other small markets that represent approximately 63% of forecast NIO are expected to be in line with the range. And New York and Austin which represents approximately 11% of forecast NOI are expected to generate growth below the low end of the range.", "Moving on our development pipeline in aggregate continues to generate lease rates and leasing velocities in line with original expectations. In our $350 million Pacific City development in Huntington Beach, what we have delivered and leased is achieving strong rental rates, but past construction delays continue to negatively impact our velocity given the projects high-end clientele. Pac City will be a game changing asset in Orange County once complete but will be a drag on our 2018 results versus previous expectations. ", "The 345 Harrison our $367 million project in Boston, we recently opened our leasing office and are around 6% preleased. 345 and our JV developments remain largely on budget and on schedule with a notable positive exception of [indiscernible] west. This community is leased up at a much quicker pace and underwritten and has raised rents three times to date. Community specific quarter end lease up statistics are available on attachment 9 on our supplement.", "Last, I would like to again thank all of our associates in the field and at corporate for making 2017 another successful year for the company, onto a successful 2018.", "With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Joe.", "Joseph Fisher", "Thanks, Jerry. The topics I will cover today include our fourth quarter results and forward guidance, a transactions update, and a balance sheet and capital markets update. Our fourth quarter and full year earnings results came in at the mid points of our previously provided guidance ranges. FFOs adjusted and AFFO per share were $0.48 and $0.42 for the quarter, and a $1.87 and $1.72 for the full year. 2017 AFFO was up $0.09 or 5.5% versus 2016, driven by our strong operating platform which produced robust NOI growth as well as our disciplined capital deployment decisions.", "Next, I\u2019ll provide several high-level comments related to our 2018 guidance, the details of which can be found on attachment 15 of our supplement. ", "Full-year 2018 FFO as adjusted per share guidance is $1.91to a $1.95 and AFFO is a $1.76 to a $1.80 respectively. Primary drivers of the $0.06 of growth between our 2017 FFO as adjusted of $1.87 and our 2018 $1.93 midpoint include a positive impact of approximately $0.07 from same-store, JV, and commercial operations, flat G&A year-over-year, a neutral impact from development and developer capital program investments after accounting for funding costs and the negative impact of approximately $0.01 from higher LIBOR and other non-core items. ", "Additionally, the difference between our 2018 FFO as adjusted midpoint of $1.93 and a $1.95 we provided in last year\u2019s three-year strategic outlook is driven by the following. A positive impact of approximately $0.02 from developer capital program investments, high prepayment activity and lower G&A, offset by negative impact of approximately $0.02 from lower forecasted 2018 same-store and JV growth and a negative impact of approximately $0.02 from developmental delays.", "Moving on as Jerry indicated in his prepared remarks, our full year 2018 same-store revenue, expense and NOI growth guidance ranges are each 2.5% to 3.5% with forecasted occupancy of 96.7 to 96.9. Regarding sources and uses, we have a de minimis amounts of pre-financing that needs to be completed in 2018 and continue to focus on dispositions to fund our development and developer capital program. For the first quarter our guidance ranges are $0.46 to $0.48 for FFO as adjusted and $0.44 to $0.46 for AFFO.", "Next transactions, during the quarter we sold two fully owned communities Vista Del Ray and Villas at Carlsbad located in Orange County in Suburban San Diego for 69 million at a weighted average nominal cap rate of 5.4%. The communities were 50 years old on average. Subsequent to quarter end we entered into a contract to sell Pacific Shores, a 264-home community in Orange County for 90.5 million subject to customary closing conditions. ", "As we look into 2018 and beyond we continue to favor investment in our fully owned development pipeline and developer capital program which had a quarter end investment balance of 159 million and an effective yield in the mid 7% range. However, given the difficulty of finding economical land in many of our markets it is likely the size of our development pipeline will continue to shrink for the foreseeable future. While it is our desire to add more land to the balance sheet, to restock our pipeline over time, we will remain disciplined as we underwrite prospective deals.", "Next, moving onto balance sheet and capital markets, during the quarter we issued $300 million of 10-year unsecured debt at a coupon of 3.5%. In conjunction with the issuance we redeemed 300 million or 4.25% debt originally due June 1, 2018. At quarter end our liquidity as measured by cash and credit facility capital, net off the commercial paper balance was $855 million, our financial leverage was 33.2% on un-depreciated book value, 24.3% on enterprise value and 28.9% inclusive of joint ventures. Our net debt to EBITDA was 5.3 times and inclusive of joint ventures was 6.4 times. ", "Looking ahead we remain comfortable to our credit metrics and don\u2019t plan to actively lever up or down although you will likely see our revolver balance drift lower throughout the year. ", "With regard to the profile of our balance sheet, similar to our 2017 activity we will continue to look for MPV positive opportunities to improve our duration and increase the size of our unencumbered NOI pool. ", "Finally, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.31 in the fourth quarter or a $1.24 per share when annualized and in conjunction with our release we raised our 2018 annualized dividend to a $1.29 per share representing a 4% year over year increase and a yield of approximately 3.7%. ", "With that I will open it up for Q&A, operator.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.", "Austin Wurschmidt", "Hi, good morning Jerry you mentioned that you expect blended lease rates to turn a little bit positive early in the year, just curious what markets are predominantly driving that re-acceleration.", "Jerry Davis", "You know when you really look at January of this year compared to January of last year it did cross over, we were at a negative 0.3% in January of \u201818 that compares to a negative 0.7% when you look at January of \u201817 and roughly half of the markets are doing a little bit better on this blended -- on this new lease rate than it did last year including Boston, DC, Seattle, San Francisco, the two Florida markets as well as Salinas. ", "And then you know there\u2019s several markets that are fairly close and there\u2019re some like New York that are down year over year. ", "And then think when you look at renewal growth, renewal growth in the month of January was up on an effective basis 4.9% and that\u2019s down just 20 basis points from January of last year when it was 5.1.", "So, on a blended basis we\u2019re probably right up that cross over in January and February, we do think that it kind of bottomed. And we\u2019re not forecasting at this point a hockey stick where you start seeing current year blended rate growth significantly higher than it was last year but as you looked at last year it was consistently less than it was the prior year so we really look at 2018, we think blended rate growth is probably going to be comparable to what it was in 2017 and that was in the mid twos. You know when you look at the earning of embedded rents coming into this year it was about 1.1% that\u2019s about 30 to 40 bps lower than what it was coming into 2017.", "Austin Wurschmidt", "That\u2019s helpful and then you mentioned turnover was done, I think you said 40 basis points in 2017, I\u2019m just curious how that stacks up historically with turnover and what are you assuming going forward from a turnover perspective?", "Jerry Davis", "We thought last year we had a lot of success in turnover again it was down 40 bp in the fourth quarter at 41% full year was just under 50%, was 110 basis points, where in the last year I would remind you that we started this short-term furnished rental last year, which had a negative effect on turnover, so the numbers would have been even better if we had had those 200 or so move outs related to those short-term rentals but as we look into 2018, we continue to listen to our customers, we continue to not be excessively aggressive on renewal rate increases and today we would be forecasting turnover to be roughly flat with what it was in 2017.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.", "Juan Sanabria ", "Just thinking about supply, what\u2019s the level of conviction in any sense of what the decline may be from \u201818 into \u201819 that you guys are expecting at this point. ", "Joseph Fisher", "Juan, as we forecast out to \u201819, we had a couple of different data points to help triangulate as we think about it, but, when we look at start some permit activity that took place in 2017, obviously those were down around 10%. So, I think that gives you a good lead time when you think about typical construction timelines that we would expect 2019, to come about that launch. ", "Also, obviously talked our groups on the ground, try to get a sense for what they see taking place and what they see as competitive supply going forward. And its covers, such as [match] and other and other conversations with the brighter market participants and the merchant builders and they continue to have difficulty given the construction financing environment out there to really get new starts going in and get their capital lined up. So, I think we have a decent amount of conviction that it is going to trend down from \u201818 level, what will remain to the question is, how much of \u201818 into \u201819, but we feel pretty good they will be coming down. ", "Juan Sanabria ", "Great and then just on the same store revenues, what\u2019s the main driver between the variance from bottom end to high end and what do you guys factoring with regards to concessions and if you could just give us an update on what you seen on a concessionary front. ", "Jerry Davis", "Sure, Juan this is Jerry, I guess to start with concessions on more of a historical basis. Our fourth quarter concessions were down 35% year-over-year and if you factoring gift card, which show up [ph] down our marketing cost those were down 71%. So, we\u2019ve been utilizing concessions as well gift cards less than we did a year prior. We see concessions levels continuing to come down a bit in 2018 as we modeled out the year. ", "You asked how do you get to the high end and low end of our guidance and our guidance runs from 2.5% to 3.5% when a mid-point of 3%. I guess first I\u2019m going to walk you from our 3.7 reported in 2017 and we get down to 3. ", "First, we don\u2019t expect any addition to revenue growth from occupancy, we forecasted occupancy we stabled at high 96 range. So, you don\u2019t have 20 bps of growth like we did in 2017.", "Second as I stated earlier those embedded risk that we entered the year with were about 40 bps lower and what they were last year, so you don\u2019t have that, that takes you down another 40 bps and then other income which was a major contributing factor to our outperformance of 2017 only I think it will continue and contribute significantly, we\u2019re not counting on it being quite as much of a benefit in 2018 as it was in 2017 so that\u2019s probably 10 basis points less. ", "So again, you go from the 37 you don\u2019t get the 20 bps of occupancy, you don\u2019t have the 40 bps of embedded rents and you lose 10 basis points compared to the prior year of other income growth, and it gets you to the three. ", "Another way of looking at it to get to that midpoint is our blended rate growth both last year and this year we expect to be in that mid two range and then when you look at the contribution that we expect outsized from other income we think it\u2019s going to be somewhere in that 40 basis points to 70 basis points and that gets you to the 3%. ", "So depending on how you like to come from it that\u2019s why this is a midpoint what gets us to the top end would really be outsized job growth that helps us push rents but outsized wage growth which right now look like it\u2019s going to be about 3% for this year and if we have more success on other income items such as the short-term furnish rentals as well as parking above what we have in our plan not it get us to the high-end will get us to the low-end 2.5 would be lower job growth in the expect your rational pricing from some of this new supply that we are going to be competing with and if we are less successful on our other income initiatives. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird.", "Drew Babin ", "Question on community larger markets D.C and Orange County, obviously last year I think demand growth may be disappointed in Southern California overall coupled with some new supplies. It just seems like the new supplies maybe kind of burning off to some degree at least in Orange County by the end of \u201818. Something you talk about demand growth in Orange County what you are seeing there and then I guess while you are on it, let\u2019s talk about D.C. and what you are seeing in terms of private sector employment.", "Jerry Davis", "Orange County last year we felt some effects from supplies specially in locations like Huntington Beach and job growth that was probably the biggest culprit to our disappointment. We only have 13,000 jobs in 2017 down in OC compared to about 25,000 in 2016. Current projections that were getting from Moody\u2019s as job growth in \u201818 should be back up to about 28,000. You are seeing a reduction in manufacturing jobs but an increase in white collared jobs in Orange County, so again we\u2019re expecting job growth to be about double what it was last year in Orange County. ", "Supply is currently expected to be a hair higher than it was last year, this year or in 2017 it was about 5,000 to 6,000 units and \u201818 is projected to be closer to 7,000. So, Orange County if the jobs comp should do comparable to what it did this year we are currently forecasting revenue as you look at Orange County to be in the below 3s. ", "When you get over to D.C. the year started out with a sluggish job growth and it picked-up measurably as the year progressed. What we feel like hurt us more in D.C. this past year was due supply down in the ballpark areas as well as on the southwest waterfront, little bit of supply also in Noma and even though we don\u2019t have properties directly in those submarkets we felt that most acutely in our Logan circle U Street area where during the fourth quarter we actually had revenue growth, it was negative 1.5%. So, within a district when you have a different neighborhood it is drawing down some of our resident base.", "Drew Babin ", "And then just quickly on the dispositions you made in the fourth quarter and under contract in 1Q \u201818 in Southern California can you talk about the sale cap rates on those? I suppose like some of these weren\u2019t ROI CapEx opportunities management [ph] 50 years old kind of limit to what you can do that, would you shed some color there?", "Harry Alcock", "Drew this is Harry. The sale cap rates were around the 5, there is a top 13 effects for the buyers who have much lower cap rates, you are right these are 50 year old assets in sort of our analysis included the theory that capital flows into value added product or extraordinary which from our perspective resulted in very good pricing more in the fact we thought we were being paid for any potential value add that we could have put into the property. ", "I mean if you just look at price per unit which I think are sort of a more enduring and consistent metric that cap rates of these assets all traded for well over 300,000 per unit. I mean just by way of comparison we just built a brand-new property in urban at 335 a unit which is very comparable to the price per unit that we received on these old 50-year-old assets.", "Drew Babin ", "I guess one follow up on that. Looking for private equity and other investors are obviously very interested in suburban value add play are there any kind of just warning shots or transaction that you are seeing that are evidence of maybe more interesting CBD core type product or is supply kind of needed there, need to work its way through before you think that. ", "Jerry Davis", "We are starting to hear and see some evidence that capital is flowing back to core CBD as you mentioned. Again, there is just an abundance of capital that\u2019s chasing multifamily today. And at some point, that capital needs to find a home. So, where value add continues to be oversubscribed from the capital demand standpoint you are going to see capital reallocate in trying to find that home and in core we are starting see that a little bit.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.", "Rich Hightower", "Jerry going back to your prepared comments on the different markets and where they stack up relative to the same store range can you give us a sense of which market might potentially diverge most widely from your current forecast and what the drivers might in those specific markets?", "Jerry Davis", "Sure, I have been gone this and everybody always seems concerned about Seattle. Right now, we have Seattle just one of our top four five markets with our revenue growth north of four. Currently Seattle has come out of the gates a bit sluggish similar to what it did last year and then it turned over. ", "I will tell you this even though it feels a little bit sluggish versus our original plan when I look at new lease rate growth in the month of January in Seattle it was positive 0.5%, last January it was negative 1.5%. So, while it doesn\u2019t feel great versus our original plan, it feels stronger than it did last year and accelerated. We are cognizant in Seattle that you have got new supply that\u2019s going to hit predominantly in the CBD as well as up in the EU district. ", "We only have two same-store properties in those markets its two small deals up in the EU. A lot of the new supply that hit Bellevue last year has been absorbed and job growth is occurring out there whether it\u2019s from Salesforce or Amazon or REI consolidating their campus. ", "So, Bellevue where we have a large concentration, we still are doing well, fourth quarter we have revenue growth north of 6%, we also have some B assets which are down in the southern suburbs of [indiscernible] as well as the Northern of [indiscernible] that continued to perform well above our average though. ", "While we recognize that Amazon has come out since they are going to take their future hiring level from the 70,000 that they talked about 50,000, there\u2019re other tech companies that are starting up facilities whether it\u2019s a Southlake Union or Bellevue or whether it\u2019s Facebook, Google, Salesforce that are operating in more of a diversified workforce beyond Amazon. ", "So, Seattle is one that I think can go either way, it can surprisingly upside the last two years, as everybody had concern or supply really couldn\u2019t hit it so that\u2019s one that we are watching quite a bit right now. And then the [indiscernible] starting out the year a bit better than original expectations in San Francisco, you\u2019ve had good job growth especially down in that [indiscernible] Hill area, the financial district where Salesforce has just started occupying their building as well as the new offices that are opening up down in Mission Bank, but right now San Francisco is continuing to do pretty well.", "And then the last one it\u2019s really taken off it\u2019s been Orlando, very strong early results there, it\u2019s not a major market for us but I think the influx of people from Puerto Rico has driven the population up and they are getting jobs and they are renting apartments, so those would be more of the positives.", "Rich Hightower", "And then anything on the negative side?", "Jerry Davis", "Right now, I think Boston has started out a bit sluggish, again that can happen, in the winter months there, we obviously had a disappointing fourth quarter in Boston where revenue growth was under 2% after being north of 5% and that was really related predominantly to pricing pressure within the CBD, mainly in our back-bay property, as well as there\u2019s a lease up, that\u2019s competing against us in our seaport area property.", "But Boston is one that I think most people feel even the supply is there, the job growth is going to be very strong but it\u2019s one that starting off on our stabilized deals, it\u2019s been a bit weak, but when we look at the success we\u2019ve had at our 345 Harrison deal, we\u2019ve leased over 40 units there in the last month, and we don\u2019t even open for occupancy for a couple more months. So, kind of we\u2019re watching down but historically seeing in Boston that once March comes around you tend to see a significant acceleration in traffic patterns.", "Rich Hightower", "Secondly, it\u2019s more of a I guess a housekeeping question, as you mentioned the contribution to the same-store revenue and NOI from properties being newly included in same-store [indiscernible] could you give us a sense of which properties are being included in that number, at least among the major ones just to know the changes that are proposed up?", "Jerry Davis", "Actually, if you guys out there want to look at on page 11 of our supplement we do detail out in the middle of that page what corner properties come into same store [indiscernible] so you\u2019ll see the additions to the first quarter of \u201818 and [indiscernible] the full year same stores. And it\u2019s predominantly I think it\u2019s four props, three properties, four properties excuse me in the Seattle market, 880 Newport Beach which is the [indiscernible] down in Newport Beach and then Edgewater which is in the Mission Bay area of San Francisco, and it\u2019s about 2200 doors.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley, please proceed with your question.", "Rich Hill", "Hey good morning guys, thanks for taking the phone call. We spent a little bit of time on some of your bigger markets but also want to spend maybe a little bit of time, start talking about some of your smaller markets and how much that diversity is helping your revenue growth in the year ahead and maybe as you answer that question I\u2019d love to maybe get a little bit more color on what you\u2019re seeing in job growth outside of some of the major markets and how that relates to supply. It\u2019s a big question but I\u2019ll leave it up to you. ", "Joseph Fisher", "I guess I would start with you know probably three of the strongest markets we\u2019ve had over the last two years have been our two Florida prop markets, Orlando and Tampa where not only have those markets done well but we\u2019ve done exceptionally well within those markets versus our peers. When you look at Orlando and Tampa our expectation in 2018 will be a slight deceleration from this year but still revenue growth in the 4 to 5%, Harry spoke to the influx from Puerto Rico that\u2019s affecting Orlando but even prior to that Orlando was enjoying very strong job growth and in 2018 job growth in Orlando is expected to be about 2.8% compared to about 1.3 nationally. ", "Tampa is coming in at about 2.7% so it\u2019s also coming in very strong, and other than certain submarkets there\u2019s not a ton of new supply. Our properties in those two markets also tend to be in the B, maybe in B- range, but we don\u2019t compete nearly as much against the new supply. ", "Another market that has probably been our leader the last couple of years, it\u2019s not really significant but it\u2019s our Monterey portfolio which has had double digit growth and then high single digit last year in revenue growth. This next year it should once again be our top market at right around 6% revenue growth. ", "Employment growth is going to be stagnant at about 1.1% so slightly below national average, it\u2019s predominantly an agricultural community. What really benefits that market is there\u2019s been no new supply probably in the last four to five years as job growth has continued to do well. ", "And then the two markets that have been a little sluggish for us and we think will be in that middling range for us this year would be Baltimore and Richmond. Baltimore is this next year\u2019s going to have job growth fairly close to national average at 1.3% Richmond\u2019s going to be at about 1.5%. So, they\u2019ll kind of be in the middle not big contributors or detractors.", "Rich Hill", "Got it, and just one follow up question. Are you seeing any sort of population migration trends away from San Francisco, Seattle, D.C., Boston to some of these, I don\u2019t know, secondary markets that you can identify at this point or is it maybe too early to put a finger on that?", "Jerry Davis", "It\u2019s probably a bit too early, if you\u2019re talking about -- are you talking about related to tax reform or\u2026?", "Rich Hill", "No, just generally speaking. We\u2019re hearing that population migration is down over the past 5, 10, 20 years but starting to see some population migration trends to cities that are may be a little bit more affordable and still dynamic as well. So, you obviously have a diversified portfolio, and I was wondering if you\u2019re seeing any evidence of that.", "Jerry Davis", "Yes. You\u2019re seeing a bit. I mean, we\u2019re seeing population growth come to places like Denver, Portland. I think Seattle has got some influx that of Northern California, within the state of California you\u2019re seeing people move, especially protect jobs from the Bay Area down into Playa Vista down in Southern California. But, I wouldn\u2019t say anything of significance other than those.", "Joseph Fisher", "Just maybe one follow-up on that. We do pay attention to migration trends, the population growth. And given the diversified portfolio, clearly, while we have some markets that will experience outmigration at times, we\u2019re most likely to benefit in other places. But traditionally, the Sunbelt is going to be where we see greater population employment growth but probably a little bit less on income growth. And if you go over to bicoastals, it\u2019s typically where we see greater changes in income growth and wage growth. And that\u2019s been pretty similar over the last year, if you look at our biggest wage growth, growers are -- it\u2019s Northern California, it\u2019s Seattle, it\u2019s some of those -- we focus on the composition of both, not just immigration population but income growth and the ability to drive rental income ratios over time. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. ", "John Kim", "I just wanted to follow up on Richard\u2019s question on your Sunbelt exposure. It\u2019s been going down steadily over last few years, it\u2019s down 17% of your NOI and four years ago it was 27%. Will you potentially be allocating to the Sunbelt based on your findings of tax reform?", "Joseph Fisher", "Hey, John. It\u2019s Joe. So, first, a comment, before tax reform took place, if you look at what we\u2019ve done over the last 12 months, I think you\u2019ve seen us consistently say kind of the markets we want to increase exposure to which was number of those kind of Sunbelt type of markets such as Austin, Nashville, Denver and Portland. What you\u2019ve seen is through DCP and other investments we\u2019ve been able to increase exposure to I think all but Austin within those four that we have targeted at this point. So, you do see us trying to target those markets relative to our bicoastal. In addition, you\u2019ve seen disposition activity in 4Q as well as our 1Q subsequent activity. As Harry talked about, the Orange County and Southern California dispositions, really more of a byproduct of our overweight to Orange County and the fact that we have Pac City coming on here this year which will increase NOI exposure.", "As it relates to tax reform and impact of that, I\u2019d say, it\u2019s still early days. And I don\u2019t expect to see a necessarily year one or year two impact from it but it is a good longer term question. When we ran through the numbers related to it, what we found by going down the IRS database and like many by income by zip code and by market, was that overall -- our consumer base has after tax increase of $1,700 or 3%. When you go to the bicoastals, you are really more like a call it 1% increase in New York, 2% in California, 2.5% in Boston and then all our other markets are kind of 3% to 3.5% increases. So, I would say not nearly as draconian as perhaps the headlines would have implied in terms of potential migration trends. But it\u2019s something that we are evaluating and we will continue to think about.", "John Kim", "And do you think the peak leasing season will give you an indication of this or will it take a couple of years potentially to realize the full impact?", "Joseph Fisher", "In terms of migration trends within MSAs, it\u2019s going to take longer than a couple of months of bottom line impact on the consumer pockets before we see an impact. The hope is of course that as everyone has more dollars in their pockets that as you go through leasing season, maybe you see some additional strength.", "John Kim", "And then, my second question is on the MetLife and KFH JVs. I know you don\u2019t really provide same store guidance for this portfolio. But, in the fourth quarter and that\u2019s minus 1% same store NOI. And I\u2019m wondering if you project that organic growth turns positive in 2018?", "Jerry Davis", "Yes, we do. When we look at our MetLife portfolio and it\u2019s about 9% to 10% of the total Company on a pro rata basis, we see revenues next year coming in probably in the mid ones; that compares to again same stores coming in at around 3. Expenses probably be in the mid to high 3s because tax issues in 2018. And that would bring you at NOI in the low ones. I want to remind you, there is a heavy percentage of that MetLife portfolio, it\u2019s really comprised of three or four assets that are in a very high supply markets. And these are not just A properties, these are A, plus, pluses, one would be in Columbus Square up in New York, one would be Ashton Austin, In Austin, one is in downtown Denver, which is with heavy new supply, and then you\u2019ve got another one in right downtown [Indiscernible]. So, it\u2019s understandable in our opinion to see how revenues are going to be a 150 bps below what our same store pool is.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.", "Dennis McGill", "First question just on expense side. The guidance the last couple of years I think coming out pretty close to the high end, maybe slightly above the high end. As you set the outlook this year, how much should that factor into it and how much variability you think -- what would drive the variability and I guess to the high end versus the mid or low end?", "Jerry Davis", "Yes. Again, our guidance this year\u2019s 2.5% to 3.5%, pressure point is going to be on real estate taxes which once again are going to come in high single digits. We have some impact from 421s which will drive total expenses up, almost 40 basis points to 50 basis points. The other pressure points we\u2019re feeling are personnel. And while we see wage pressures probably pushing us up about 2.5% to 3%, we\u2019ve come up over the last year with some efficiencies within our workforce whether it\u2019s on the sales side, the administrative side or maintenance side that I think will be able to compress the impact of that down.", "Probably, we want to push us to the high end of guidance, if we get some unforeseen tax bad guys or don\u2019t have as many appeal wins as we\u2019ve typically had, we really don\u2019t budget for those significantly but that could affect us on the tax side. On the personnel side, it really just depends on labor markets. Last year, we were surprised up in San Francisco as well as Seattle when wage pressures took our personal cost up between 5% and 7%. We feel like, in certain markets, we\u2019ve addressed wage scale issues. But that\u2019s something that could kick in this year. Joe was talking about both the benefit from tax reform but also we are seeing wage increases on national basis go up 3%. Now, if we see wage pressures, we would hope with some outsized rent growth that would accompany that. So if it pushes us to the high end there, we would think there will be a corresponding push to the high end ideally on the revenue side. But, our other expense categories, primarily it\u2019s repairs and maintenance or marketing costs, we have continued to work to create a more efficient way for our residents to deal with this. And we think we can get both of those categories very close to flat to negative. In fact, currently, we\u2019ve got about 33% of our onsite tours are booked through appointments online. So, we\u2019ve been able to cut out some of the personnel burden there as well as over the last year, year and half, we\u2019ve installed package lockers into over 100 of our properties, which has made our people much more efficient.", "Dennis McGill", "And then, if you look at last year, the upside or to the midpoint or higher -- coming at the higher end, was that more driven by property taxes or personnel relative to your initial midpoint guideline?", "Jerry Davis", "It was more personnel.", "Dennis McGill", "And then, separate question just entirely, on the land side, I think you made the comment earlier, you just -- the land market just seems to stubborn as far as adjusting and make it difficult on underwriting new development deals. What do you think breaks out? What has broken out in the past?", "Joseph Fisher", "We have been talking about that for the last six or 12 months, which is why I think you\u2019ve seen our pipeline obviously continue to dwindle down with new net additions to the land pipeline being effectively zero at this point. What we have continued to say is that while rents have kind of plateaued at long term levels and cost inflations continue to creep up above that level, the release [ph] continue to be land pricing. So, I don\u2019t think -- what we have to see change is really anything other than that and that either rents actually accelerate and outpace inflation or land pricing has to reprice which while we\u2019ve seen at least one example of that on a deal we are focused on, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s widespread yet at this point.", "Dennis McGill", "Are there any markets where you feel like one of those two things has happened to be the catalyst, which you think is going to be a more likely catalyst for rents or repricing?", "Harry Alcock", "This is Harry. I think land prices tend to be fairly sticky because you are dealing with individuals with their own sort of emotional analysis in some cases that\u2019s not always entirely rational. And so, land sellers tend to be slow to adjust their expectations unless there is some particular event that could be negative, if they don\u2019t respond. Rents are purely cyclical. So, I think that rents -- and development cost, so the other variable that Joe didn\u2019t mention, and again, as construction activity declines, typically, one would expect construction cost to decline. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily a market basis that we can speak to but it\u2019s -- each market is going to have its own set of facts.", "Tom Toomey", "Dennis, not to wear the subject out too much, this is Toomey. What I think is land reprices when merchant builders are heavy on inventory of it and the financing market dries up. And will we see that anytime soon? I am not certain. But, that\u2019s usually the characteristics that starts to push more dirt into the hands of other people.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS. Please proceed with your question.", "Nick Yulico", "A couple of questions. First on the multifamily transaction market. With debt costs having gone up over the last six months, are you seeing signs of cap rates going higher? And even if not yet, do you think it\u2019s reasonable to assume cap rates go up by a certain level, given the rise in interest rates?", "Harry Alcock", "I think, there\u2019s sort of three factors that go into cap rates, one is interest rates, one is NOI growth and the other and perhaps most important is capital flows. Today, at least in the near term, capital flows are extraordinarily high. And therefore, there\u2019s no reason to expect that the cap rates are going to move. And we have not seen any evidence that cap rates are going to move. If in the future, depending on what happens with the interest rates, clearly, if interest rates continue to climb, over time, there tends to be some loose correlation between cap rates and interest rates. But again, it depends on how those other two factors move. So, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see cap rates move a little bit over the next year or so, but we have not seen any evidence of that today.", "Nick Yulico", "So, I guess, if pricing is still strong in the transaction market, Tom, I am wondering how you and the Board are thinking about share buybacks or special dividends, your stock, like most of the multifamily REITs, showing a meaningful discount to NAV. So, at what point do you stop investing in the developer capital program, stop doing acquisitions and instead focus on buying back your stock and selling more assets, if the transaction market pricing is still so strong and there\u2019s risk of maybe cap rates going higher?", "Joseph Fisher", "Hey, Nick. It\u2019s Joe. Maybe I\u2019ll set it up and just give you a couple of parameters around how we\u2019re thinking about it, and then if anyone wants to come over the top. It\u2019s a relatively new phenomenon, obviously with the selloff that\u2019s taken place in the last 30 to 45 days. But the way we kind of think about it is where do you trade versus NAV, what\u2019s the leverage profile, what are your committed uses, what are the alternative uses they compete for and then call it corporate factors? So, as you kind of take through those you have clearly a discount to NAV in place today. So, we\u2019d agree on that front. From a leverage profile standpoint, we like where we are at from a maturity profile, a line utilization standpoint, and solid BBB plus credit. But, we\u2019ve not intent to lever up, especially for share buybacks. So, you can kind of take that source off the table, which reduces your sources back to just dispositions, cash flow. And so, then, you come over to kind of committed uses. And when you look to our sub between development in DCP, we still have 200 plus million dollars of committed uses at this point in time. In addition, we continue to take a look at DCP and development, and loans, not necessarily on balance sheet yet. We do have potential land parcels that we\u2019ve been working on for a quite long period of time that could hit. So, when we\u2019re thinking about shadow uses, that\u2019s going to factor in the math. But ultimately, you get to a point where you do have available capital and similar to how our DCP and development program compete against each other for that amount of capital, you are going to have one more competitor in the ring which is share buybacks. So, compete those three against each other when we have the capacity. The other piece of it be in corporate factors which I think everyone is aware of is a REIT from a tax gain capacity standpoint, we can only sell a certain amount of assets each and every year. And right now, our dispositions are really allocated towards those preexisting uses at this point and time. But I think as the year moves on, we will take a look at where the discount is and what the alternative uses are and make the best decision at that point.", "Nick Yulico", "I guess, just following up and I appreciate lot of detail there. But, at what point do you -- I understand you have existing uses but how do you -- as a company -- I think, look, a lot of REITs are facing this issue right now. How do you think about continuing to invest in development at this point in the cycle based on how the stock price is doing, based on the fact that your FFO growth this year is 3%, which is matching your same store growth? I mean, what point do you start rethinking the value of investing and doing development versus again just maybe buying back your stock?", "Joseph Fisher", "It\u2019s a fair question. I think, we are going to continue to look at those IRRs on development, which are in that low to mid teens range. And whereas DCP is call it [ph] acquisition and development, you end up with a stock buyback on a unlevered basis, if your unlevered assets are seven, you have call it 10% unlevered asset value buyback, you are getting 7.5% to 8% type of IRR. So, IRRs are still arguably more compelling. Now, clearly, there is more risk associated with it. But that\u2019s going to be the discussion as when we get there and as we look at each development, if we can get compensated and get the 150 to 200 basis points over range that we target; can we get to the upper end of that and account for the increased risk, over compensate or buyback. At the end of the day, we are never dependent on equity issuance. And we are looking at basically cash flow and dispositions to fund that development. So, the value creation margin still exist, the IRRs still exist. But we are obviously cognizant of the fact that we have another use of capital that we could potentially look at.", "As it relates to your second point that you made a comment on same store growth and FFO growth being one and the same this year which we provided a little bit of lock in the earnings release as well as in my commentary. But, I think it\u2019s probably important to expand on that a little bit because it does relate to the development pipeline. We mentioned that developments in DCP overall are net neutral contributor this year to earnings, which we got a couple of follow-up question overnight on that. What\u2019s really going on is that you do have a net positive contribution from developer capital program. And then, you have a net negative contribution coming from development. And I\u2019ll hit you with the punch line first which is basically you have a timing issue related to Pac City, 345 Harrison. What we have is, call it, 700 and plus million dollars of development in those two assets, which this year, we are going to end up with a FFO yield of about 2.5% coming off of that 700 million. As you guys know, that\u2019s really just 4% cap interest disappearing on those developments, taking on expense structure which results negative cash flow initially and then ramping up as lease up comes on. Eventually, you go from a 2.5% FFO yield to stabilizing those assets out over a couple of year period into the high 5s. so, you have basically $600 million that\u2019s already been paid for on that $700 million that has all NOI come into a sort of next couple of years with little bit of funding left in the form of disposition. So you\u2019re correct that this year a zero contribution, but we would expect that to ramp up as we hit 2019.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question.", "Rich Anderson", "One of the reasons your stock is in a --stock performance misery, [ph] I guess, is the issue of supply. And Joe, you mentioned land being difficult to make sense. Is that -- I look at that as a good thing. I mean, okay, maybe won\u2019t be able to do as much development, but the reason why multifamily stock has had a tough time this year in part, there is a lot of things, but partly because of supply. So, do you look at that as a good read through generally? And I guess that question goes to everybody or anybody.", "Joseph Fisher", "Clearly it goes to a positive on the ground fundamentals if supply comes down. For 90 plus percent of our business, that\u2019s a positive if development is more difficult to pencil. For the other side of the business, on the transaction side, you may see the pipeline ramp down a little bit, which results in less earnings contribution near-term but in theory you make it up on the same store NOI side over time.", "Rich Anderson", "Yes. It sounds like a good ratio, I will give up 10% from my 90% any day. So, in terms of how you\u2019re looking at land, just the market in general away from you, do you still see -- it sounds like you\u2019re still seeing deals happen. So, is it kind of stupid land trades are still going on, if not from UDR but from other players that could potentially lead to stupid new development projects also or do you feel like it\u2019s starting to slow down even outside of you guys?", "Tom Toomey", "Well, I would hope that most deals are done -- are rational as opposed to stupid, particularly the ones we do. But I -- Rich, I think, it clearly -- and we\u2019ve seen it, we\u2019ve all talked about it for the last couple of quarters or more, it\u2019s getting harder for these deals to get financed and fewer of these deals will pencil. But that doesn\u2019t mean that none of the deals will pencil and that capital isn\u2019t going to be a available to continue see new development deals and that UDR, even while maintaining sort of our consistent disciplined underwriting approach, won\u2019t be able to backfill our pipeline. We all expect that to happen over time. But, it does mean that you have to look at a lot more deals before you find one that -- the pencils in it means that it\u2019s likely the construction starts will continue below the levels of the last three or four years.", "Rich Anderson", "Right. So, hopefully, you guys -- you and the REITs are kind of leaders by example and we will see how it plays out. The last question I have is, Joe, you mentioned the development pipeline kind of staying at a lower end because of all of these factors. Do you see that -- what\u2019s at least within the DCP effort, do you see that as the same six projects will be around for a little while or do you think there will some trades but you\u2019ll kind of net out to the same number over the course of the year?", "Joseph Fisher", "I think, there is potential to net out to the same number over time. We\u2019re sitting at, call it, 160 million or so today of exposure there. Over the first quarter, you\u2019ll see DTLA which is coming up through its option period, so we will work through the kind of buy, hold, sell analysis on that one. But we do have another 60 million of funding left on some of the other deals. So, will be at a 180 million or so of exposure. And we\u2019ve talked in the past about kind of our earnings and cap on the program that we impose on ourselves. But, we think we still have another 100 million of capacity. The difficulty is going to be if we see development overall coming down, you can expect that there is fewer developers therefore looking for that type of capital. So, there may be fewer opportunities. But, we think we\u2019ve probably got a shot at maybe a couple of them throughout the year that could continue to backfill the pipeline.", "Tom Toomey", "I\u2019d add to that a little bit. I think you\u2019ve been around long enough, and look towards the future, and you\u2019ve got to realize if we\u2019re in a rising interest rate environment, absent the NOI impact, the question is going to be loan proceeds and availability of lending in that environment and will that bring more assets to the market as construction loans start maturing. And we\u2019re down two to three years down the road. But past experience always points to people wanting to get out ahead of that and start selling assets. And so, I think you are going to see a lot more transactional volume over the next couple of years. And inside of that\u2019s always the opportunity to recap deals, buy deals. So, I think we\u2019re just entering what I would call the natural progression of this cycle. And it will start with decreasing supply aspect, improving NOI trend, but at a higher interest rate environment creates a more transaction-driven market. And I think we are ready for that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup.", "Nick Joseph", "I appreciate the detailed market commentary. But from a regional perspective, I guess, just thinking about your largest three regions. How would you rank the West, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast in terms of 2018 same store revenue growth?", "Jerry Davis", "You said the West, Mid Atlantic and Northeast?", "Nick Joseph", "Exactly.", "Jerry Davis", "I would definitely say the West will be the top, followed probably by the Mid-Atlantic and then the Northeast. You got the Northeast being heavily weighted by New York. New York, our expectation right now would be revenue growth in that 1% range. So, it\u2019s going to [technical difficulty] Probably, if you went to the other regions, that southeastern region I think is going to compete with the western region to be the top.", "Nick Joseph", "And then, just your commentary on 2019 deliveries, and obviously there could be some slippage. But, are there any markets that you are either expecting meaningful decreases or meaningful increases kind of just versus the average?", "Joseph Fisher", "And I think it\u2019s a little bit too early to tell at this point. The markets that we\u2019ve seen supply come down and permit -- sorry, permit comes down a little bit [technical difficulty] more Sunbelt biased. So, if we run through the regressions there, they imply maybe a little bit more come down to Sunbelt; overall, it\u2019s fairly similar. [Ph]", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Just two quick ones for you. The first, you guys have about 20% exposure to D.C. [ph] your biggest market. Just given that market\u2019s propensity to produce a tremendous amount of supply in contrast to the job growth, do you guys foresee that market just pairing that back in the next year or two to maybe right size it relative to some of the other markets?", "Joseph Fisher", "I think you can probably expect similar to what we are doing in Orange County, which is another market that we view as overweight versus our long-term average. We have kind of gotten to the point now that we can start to source capital from some of the more bicoastal and overweight markets, given that we are comfortable with the 20 markets we are in and diversified platform. So, I think you probably see us wind up a little bit over the next two or three years whether through right dispositions or just lack of new investment while we invest elsewhere. So, I think your thesis is correct.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay. And then, the second question is, you guys -- and this has been a sort of a recurring theme. Do you guys produce better than average same store NOI? And yet we look at where companies are expecting guidance for 2018 versus 2017, ex items, your FFO growth is basically in line with peers. So, one, what are some of the offsets that\u2019s causing -- the offset to the same store NOI especially because you said the MetLife JV should actually improve? And then, two, when do you think on a more consistent basis we will see the outperformance on the same store lead to outperformance on the FFO?", "Joseph Fisher", "Probably a couple of factors here. One, you mentioned MetLife and while it doesn\u2019t prove, it is still at a run rate lower than our same store. So, when you blend the two, you do have a pro forma combined same store that\u2019s below our 3% guide. So, when you lever that that obviously impacts the earnings growth.", "When you go to the development pipeline, there is really two pieces to speak to. One, if you look at the development pipeline that\u2019s winding down from say 1 billion to 0.5 billion, if you look at our interest expense guidance, we are up about $15 million year-over-year. About half of that\u2019s really due to cap interest coming off. So, it\u2019s really a development pipeline issue related to cap interest coming off and causing interest expense to go up a little bit more than perhaps what I think a couple of models factored in when we look at them.", "The other piece goes over to Nick Yulico\u2019s question and kind of my response there, as to 700 million related to Pac City and 345 Harrison. When you are earning 2.5% on $700 million of deployed capital but you funded that capital with call it 5, 5.5 dispositions as well as some debt, you end up with a fairly dilutive impact in the year that you go through lease-up. As we fast forward, call it a year or two and you go from 2.5% up to let\u2019s say 5.75 to 6 over time, you basically have 3% on that $700 million that is effectively pure accretion outside of that 100 million that we still have left to fund. So, while 2018 is a negative impact from those two assets, we think we more than make up for it when we get into 2019 and 2020. So, I think you will see development start to be much more additive as we fast forward.", "Operator", "There are no further questions in queue. I would like to hand the call back to Tom Toomey for closing comments.", "Tom Toomey", "Let me have a brief closing, given the time element. First, I thank you for your time and interest in UDR. And second, if doesn\u2019t come across, I want to make sure we state it. We feel very good about our strategies, about our continued execution and how this year is already starting out very strong for us. So, with that, we look forward to talking to you more in the future.", "Operator", "This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation.
