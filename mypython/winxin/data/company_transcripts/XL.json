My name is Shirley, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the XL Group Plc Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "David Radulski", "Thank you, Shirley. And welcome to XL Group's fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings conference call. This call is being simultaneously webcast on XL's website at www.xlgroup.com. We posted to our website several documents, including our press release and quarterly financial supplement.", "Please note that we have now new information to provide you regarding our proposed acquisition of Catlin Group. Public information regarding that transaction, including the offer announcement, press release and investor presentation, is posted on our corporate website and to our transaction specific website, xl.transactionannouncement.com.", "As noted in the offer announcement, U.K. Takeover Code does not apply to Catlin as it is a premium domicile company. However, due to provisions with respect to the U.K. Takeover Code and Catlin\u2019s bylaws, the parties have agreed to certain matters regarding an application of the U.K. Takeover Code to the potential transaction. As you may have encountered with other M&A transaction, this put significant constraints on the party\u2019s statements which we hope you can understand.", "On our call this evening, Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, who\u2019ll offer opening remarks; Pete Porrino, XL's Chief Financial Officer, who'll review our financial results; followed by Greg Hendrick, our Chief Executive of Insurance Operations; and John Welch, our Acting Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations, who will review their segment results and market conditions. Then we'll open it up for questions.", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain of the matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements, including those with respect to XL and a proposed transaction of Catlin.", "These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations, all of which involve risks and uncertainties, and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, and therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them.", "Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 8-K, the factors identified in the investor presentation, as well as other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.", "Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they're made, and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Mike McGavick.", "Mike McGavick", "Good evening and thank you for joining our call. As you are all well aware, it\u2019s been a noteworthy few weeks for us and with more news just last week regarding further consolidation, a really interesting time for the market as well.", "I'm sure you will have some further questions regarding the Catlin acquisition during Q&A. And I will just say here at the top of the call that, well, our planning for the integration with Catlin continues and is on track. We have no further information on this subject to provide at the time. As David has noted, the focus of this call is XL's fourth quarter and full year 2014 results.", "2014 was a strong year for the company, continued the harder and progress we have been delivering and positioning us incredibly well for our exciting next chapter. Starting with our P&C results, our combined ratio of 88.2% was our strongest performance in more than 15 years and a significant improvement from the 92.5% achieved in 2013.", "Our P&C loss ratio improved 5 points from 2013 to 57%. It is a particular note that even in this difficult market our gross premiums written grew 5% year-over-year to $7.8 billion.", "We achieved the total underwriting profit of $676 million, a 50% increase over the prior year and for the second year in a row we achieved a double-digit ROE, 11.2% for the full year, excluding unrealized gains and losses on investments.", "Results in the quarter itself were equally as positive. Our ROE in the quarter was 13.7% on the same basis, the quarter combined ratio of 84.5% and loss ratio of 52.3% were also among the best quarterly results in the last 15 years. Underwriting profit in the quarter was $219 million, which was a 116% increase over Q4 2013.", "Now, of course, like most of the industry, we were helped by an extremely low catastrophe year. But that does not diminish our -- at all, our overall sense of the enormous progress achieved since we put this current strategy in place.", "For example, we all know that in the last few years this end of the year call has been filled not only with our share of cat losses, but other large loss activity that has brought down our full year results.", "Now we know that both positive and negative for duty will have its -- also always have its place in this business, but we believe are better balanced, better underwritten and better position book, as you will hear from Pete and Greg is shining through.", "From a segment perspective, we are proud of what our underwriters achieved in the year, while a tough Reinsurance market conditions persist, our Reinsurance segment contributed an underwriting profit of $451 million for the year and a 73.3% combined ratio.", "Year-over-year, gross written premium did decreased, but we continue to be disciplined and feel that the results speak for themselves in terms of our willingness to chase -- to not chase terms that fall outside of our approach. John Welch, our acting Head of Reinsurance will have more to say on the segments results in a moment.", "Turning to Insurance, Greg has at least one more call with us as Head of the Insurance segment and so we won\u2019t overly seeing his presence just yet. But looking at the full year, one maybe does get a sense of the great progress he and his Insurance colleagues have made.", "The Insurance segments combined ratio of 94.4%, loss ratio of 63.2% and underwriting profit of $225 million are all the best results in these metrics since 2007. We have more work to do, but we like the progress, particular the continued improvement of the ex-cat accident year combined ratio, which was 95.2% in the year or a 0.5% better than the same result in 2013.", "Lastly, and especially for our XL colleagues listening to the call, I want to make particular note of our innovation drive and we have -- how we have grown our impact on the market through this focus.", "According to at least one public tally we issued 31 new product announcements in 2014. That's a 35% year-over-year increase in new product announcements compared to 2013. And one of them, our North America Construction team's Public/Private Partnership Coverage recently received an innovation award for business insurance. We have great momentum in creatively addressing risks. This vital work must continue to accelerate.", "In sum, we are very pleased with these results and with the progress we have made during these past few years. The continuing strength of Reinsurance, the tangible improvement in Insurance, the second year of achieving a double-digit ROE and some of the best financial results we have achieved in 15 years. We\u2019ve worked hard to get to this point. We expect this progress to continue and couldn\u2019t be more excited about what is on the horizon.", "With that, I will turn it to Pete.", "Pete Porrino", "Thanks, Mike and good evening. Operating net income for the fourth quarter was $294 million, or a $1.12 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to $287 million or $1 per share in 2013.", "Operating net income for the full year was approximately a $1 billion or $3.68 per share. Our net income attributable to ordinary shareholders for the quarter was $140 million or $0.53 per share on a fully diluted basis and $188 million, or $0.69 per share for the full year.", "As we\u2019ve previously discussed, our net income is impacted by the mark-to-market movement of the derivative that transfers the economics of the assets, backing our life Reinsurance transaction. But that derivative movement is completely offset by investment income, realized gains and losses and the change in the unrealized position of our portfolio and does not impact our net book value, operating income or comprehensive income.", "We continue to show that relationship in the summary consolidated financial data included with the press release. As European interest rates have continued to fall, we have recorded a derivative loss, offset by a book value gain associated with an increase in the market value of the underlying assets.", "Our property and casualty combined ratio for the quarter of 84.5%, was 8.8 points lower than the same quarter last year and the full year\u2019s 88.2% was 4.3 points lower than the prior year. Our accident year combined ratio for the quarter of 91.4% was lower by 5.9 points, while the full year\u2019s 92.6% was lower by 4.7 points.", "This improvement was largely driven by lower levels of catastrophe losses and the impacts from our underwriting actions that Greg and John will discuss further. For the quarter, our natural catastrophe losses totaled $32 million, which was split $18 million and $14 million between our Insurance and Reinsurance segment.", "By comparison, net losses from natural catastrophes in the same quarter of 2013 totaled $94 million. For the full year 2014, natural catastrophe losses were $113 million compared to $317 million in 2013.", "Prior year reserve development in the quarter was a net favorable $97 million, compared to $61 million for the same quarter in 2013. This reflects favorable development of $35 million and $62 million in the Insurance and Reinsurance segments, resulting from our fourth quarter detailed ground-up reserve review.", "For all of 2014, development was a net favorable $255 million or 4.5 loss ratio points, a slight decrease compared to $290 million or 4.9 loss ratio points for 2013. Consistent with previous indications, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and performance-based compensation, operating expenses for the year were 4.5% higher than in 2013.", "During the quarter, operating expenses were up 13.3%, compared to the same quarter last year. However, this was almost entirely due to the impact of our favorable results on our various compensation plans. We continue to focus on balancing cost efficiency with continued investments in our infrastructure, underwriting teams and strategic opportunities.", "As is been the case throughout the year, our increased use of Reinsurance will continue to impact the reported operating expense ratio as ceding commissions, which cover all expenses are generally reported on the acquisition expense line. For 2015, excluding the impact of the Catlin transaction, we estimate that our operating expenses will grow by a percentage in the low single digits.", "Turning to investment performance, at a $172 million net investment income on the portfolio was $68 million below the same quarter last year primarily due to the Life transaction. The gross book yield in the portfolio at the end of December was 2.7%. When compared with the average Q4 new money rate of 1.7%, we expect that net investment income will continue to remain under pressure, as we've approximately $3 billion of assets with book yields of 3% rolling off over the next 12 months.", "Net income from investment fund and investment manager affiliates was $21 million for the quarter, down $56 million from an exceptional prior year quarter. The XL property and casualty investment portfolio returned 1% for the quarter and 4.8% for the year. The mark-to-market for the quarter was $94 million, including net realized gains of $13 million, driven primarily by sales of equities. This compares to net realized gains of $12 million in Q4 2013.", "Unrealized net gains in the portfolio were $1.1 billion of the end of the fourth quarter. The duration of our fixed income portfolio remained at 3.8 years. Effective tax rate on net income available to ordinary shareholders for the full year was 34% and for the fourth quarter was 21.5%. These rates are higher than prior year due to the impact of the loss recognized on the life reinsurance transaction and subsequent net loss on the related derivative, both of which have little or no tax benefit.", "On an operating basis, our effective tax rate for the full year was 12% and for the fourth quarter was 10%. With respect to capital management during the fourth quarter, we purchased 5.2 million shares for $175 million at an average price of $33.82 per share. For the year, we purchased and consolidated total of 24.7 million shares for $800 million at an average price of $32.40 per share, leaving $267.6 million available for purchase under our previously announced share buyback program.", "While we continue to see share buyback as a valuable capital management tool, we pulled our purchases at the end of November and in the completion of our proposed acquisition of Catlin Group.", "I will now turn it over to Greg to discuss our Insurance segment results.", "Greg Hendrick", "Thanks, Pete and good evening. Today, I will cover results for the segment, provide some color on our progress during the year and finish with remarks on current market conditions.", "Starting with the results, 2014 was Insurance\u2019s segment most profitable years since 2007, generating nearly $100 million more underwriting profit than last year. The accident year combined ratio was 96.9%, compared to 99.4% in 2013. And this year-over-year improvement was driven primarily by the accident ex-CAT cat loss ratio of 63.9%, which was 2 full points better than prior year.", "The fourth quarter marked our eighth consecutive quarter of profitability, with the segment producing a calendar quarter combined ratio of 93.8%, compared to 96.7% in the same quarter last year and an accident quarter ex-cat loss ratio of 63.5%, which is 2 points better than prior year.", "The results also benefited from another quarter of favorable CAT activity, which contributed 0.5 point to the improvement. This is mostly offset by slightly lower prior year development, even though we recognized $35 million of prior year releases.", "The underwriting expense ratio was 31.9% in the fourth quarter, reflecting a deterioration of 0.4 points from prior year, mainly due to an increase in variable compensation. Excluding variable pay, the underwriting expense ratio actually improved by more than 2 points in the quarter versus prior year and by 0.4 points on a full year basis.", "As mentioned previously, the actions we've taken to shift towards quarter should increase the number of our businesses and to store the comparisons of our acquisition and operating expense ratio to prior year. This quarter shares have increased ceding commission income, reducing our acquisition ratio by 2.6 points in the quarter but net earned premiums probably contributing to a 3 point higher operating expense ratio.", "Insurance gross premiums written grew by $432 million or 8% for the full year and $195 million or 15% in the quarter, when adjusted for foreign exchange movement. While approximate one third of the growth in the quarter was driven by a few large transactions and timing, the general trajectory reflects the continued build-out in many of our businesses. Roughly, half of our growth was led by our North American Construction, Global Risk Management, Marine, International, Financial Lines businesses.", "In addition to these lines, we also have material growth in our E&S, Cyber, Political Risk and Crisis Management teams. With the exception of our international Onshore Energy and Lloyd\u2019s middle market books, which we shrank as a result of underwriting changes due to underperformance. Only the Surety business was down materially relative to prior year quarter and this book was up nearly 50% for the full year. While markets are increasingly competitive for many of our businesses, we continue to see increased submission flow and a higher growth ratio reflecting our positive momentum in a large commercial marketplace.", "Shifting to ongoing progress, as mentioned earlier, we experienced a two-point improvement in our accident year ex-CAT loss ratio relative to 2013 despite experiencing a 25% increase in large short-tail losses in 2014. Our ability to improve our overall accident year ex-CAT loss ratio while absorbing increased large losses is evidence of the improving profitability of our underlying book.", "This improvement is a result of our ongoing focus on an improved mix of business and continued execution of underwriting actions. For the full year, nearly 60% of our gross premium is better than or within five points of our target combined ratio. Of the remaining 40%, roughly half is in line that we continue to build out such as Crisis Management, Political Risk, International Financial Lines. As these businesses are still in growth mode, there is an expense drag which impacts the return while the businesses get to scale.", "With regards to remaining 20% or so, it\u2019s no longer that entire business is below target. Rather, it\u2019s certain portfolios within these businesses that we continue to focus our re-underwriting efforts. In addition, our rigorous process of identifying, implementing and measuring our underwriting action again yielded a one-point improvement in our segment loss ratio during 2014.", "Regarding talent, this quarter we appointed Greg Bangs to lead our Global Crime business. Donna Nadeau was promoted Chief Underwriting Officer in North America. And we added June Dwyer to our distribution network team. In addition to these deployments, we continued the expansion of our underwriting talent.", "We strengthened our Cyber business. International Financial lines expanded its merger and acquisition business. Aerospace expanded its capability in China. And we continue to make investments in Brazil with the addition of several new team members across multiple businesses. For the year, we increased our underwriting workforce by nearly 10% as we continue to build our businesses around the world.", "Turning to market conditions, we saw a continued slowing in rate across more lines of business as the overall rate change to the segment was down only 1% in the fourth quarter and up 0.5% on a year-to-date basis. That said, two-thirds of our businesses ended the year with positive rate.", "In the fourth quarter, our international P&C business achieved rate in excess of 1% with only our Lloyd's middle-market businesses in red figures. Our North American and Professional businesses were both down just under 1%, driven by 5% reduction in North American property and continued softening in U.S. excess D&O. ", "Our specialty business continue to be more severely impacted with an overall rate decrease of two points, largely reflecting continued competitive conditions for Marine and Offshore Energy, as well as disappointing Aviation market, which was broadly flat. Finally, while we once again benefited from a relatively quiet catastrophe quarter and year, 2014 was a solid year.", "We continue to remix our businesses, growing higher margin businesses capitalized on reinsurance efficiency and as Mike noted, boosted our innovation efforts, paying in 2015 despite pricing headwinds, we're as well positioned as we've ever been for continued success.", "And now to John to discuss reinsurance results.", "John Welch", "Thanks Greg and good evening. I\u2019d like to cover two principal issues tonight, review of our Q4 and full-year results and also some comments on recent renewal season and market conditions. With respect to the fourth quarter, we had a combined ratio of 61.2% producing and an underwriting profit of $156 million. This compares favorably to the combined ratio of 85.1% and an underwriting profit of $66 million in the fourth quarter of 2013.", "During the quarter, we had the benefit of prior year releases of $62 million and catastrophe losses of $14 million, net of reinstatement premiums. The major contributors to the CAT activity in the quarter were development on September floods in India and Hurricane Odile. Q4 2013 included a prior year release of $21 million and catastrophe losses of $71 million net of reinstatement premiums.", "With respect to the year-over-year movement in favorable PYD, it is worth noting that Q4 reflects the semiannual reserve review for XL Re America and that Q4 2013 reflected an unusual strengthening of $31 million for Spanish surety losses. Excluding the impact of prior year releases and CAT losses, the segment produced a combined ratio of 73% which compares to the 73.6% in Q4 of 2013.", "Turning to topline in the quarter, gross written premiums were $158 million or 3.9% decrease over Q4 2013. The decrease was primarily driven by non-renewal activity in our U.S. casualty treaty book and FX impacts partially offset by growth in international casualty treaty, property facultative, U.S. property treaty and crop. For 2014, the segment produced an outstanding combined ratio of 73.3% and an underwriting profit of $451 million which compares the 81.4% combined ratio and underwriting profit of $325 million in 2013.", "This result was impacted by catastrophe losses of $45 million in prior year reserve releases of $155 million compared to 2013 where we had CAT losses of $198 million and reserve releases of $188 million. Excluding the impact of both CAT losses and prior year releases, we had a combined ratio of 79.8% compared to 80.6% in 2013. Our year-to-date gross written premium was down 5.7% to $1.8 billion as we continue to manage our way through very competitive trading conditions.", "Turning to market conditions, given another light year for cap loss activity and continued growth in reinsurance capacity for these risks, we experienced another competitive January 1 renewal season. Rates adjusted down 7.5% to 15% on the U.S. CAT book and we\u2019re down 6% to 15% for the international CAT book.", "In addition to price, we saw terms and conditions loosen to some degree. Specifically, there was pressure on hourly clauses and reinstatement provisions. Within the U.S. CAT book, this pressure resulted in some incremental increases in coverage and the amount was minor across the book and is captured in the risk-adjusted rate decreases.", "Outside the U.S., the vast majority of renewals saw no loosening with respect to these terms. From a structural perspective, there was increased interest in multiyear contracts, expanded geographic scope and placements with aggregate features. With respect to long tail and specialty markets, the environment is extremely competitive and pressure remains on both reinsurance pricing and terms and conditions.", "This continues to be true commission structures on proportional placements. In addition, we saw slight deterioration loss ratios for long tail lines as rate increases fell short of loss trend. We continue to navigate our way cautiously through this phase of the market and our trading with long-standing clients with proven track records.", "Despite the difficult market conditions, our underwriting teams maintain their discipline and did an excellent job retaining profitable business and finding new opportunities. Our long-standing trading relationships allowed us to write a January 1 portfolio that was largely in line with our expectations from both the mix and profitability perspective.", "With that, I will turn it back to David for Q&A.", "David Radulski", "And Shirley, you can open the line for questions please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. You may ask your question.", "Brian Meredith", "Yeah, evening. A couple of questions here for you. The first one, you talked about continuing to make infrastructure investments in the organization. Wonder if you could elaborate what are those investments right now? And does the proposed acquisition cost you took kind of slow down on any of those at this point?", "Mike McGavick", "This is Mike, Brian. First of all, we still do have some technology platform stuff that we\u2019re building out. We have one underlying platform around our financial close systems that we call enterprise enablement, EE, and that is well underway. And I think that most of the functionality wraps up in the next year. And that one will be useful whether there is an integration or not.", "The second with respect to underwriters, we have been building out a global underwriting platform for certain of our businesses that have common processes. That's one where there could -- the integration could have an impact on how we choose to proceed on those, and those issues are not yet resolved. So there could be changes in some of what's forecasted depending on choices that are made by the integration teams in the next weeks and months.", "Brian Meredith", "Great. Thanks. And then the second question, Mike I am just curious, how are you right now mitigating any kind of distraction with the new organization is with respect to this pending acquisition?", "Mike McGavick", "Well, we've all bought really huge whips. I mean, look, the reality is, this is a very difficult time for our colleagues at XL and for our hope to be colleagues at Catlin. It\u2019s distracting, it\u2019s confusing, this is people's livelihoods, and we take that very, very seriously. At the same time, we know very well that our colleagues know that we made a commitment to our Board about the plan for 2015 and we continue to work to deliver it.", "And if there is one thing that I've never had any doubt about it, it\u2019s about the work I think and the intelligence of our colleagues. They both see the importance of the commitments they make and they carry those into the marketplace. And I think when going to their intelligence a little bit, it's hard not to observe that. If you have a two companies coming together, you\u2019re probably going to want to make sure you put your best foot forward. And that includes staying focused and delivering.", "So people are in the sense really showing us that they have the ability to perform under difficult circumstances, that's an important credential that they are advertising to us into their future colleagues. So as I travel around and meet with our colleagues, you have that underlying sensibilities, but you also have the real sense of commitment and the devotion to going forward with the firm, and that works together I think to keep everybody focused.", "I would add one more thing too, having these other transactions recently announced kind of both affirms our strategy very clearly that was a nice thing. But I think it also causes all of our colleagues to say, ghee, you know there's something really exciting going on right where I work right now and rest of the market seems to be in some turmoil too. So all of a sudden, I think you're more focused on what you can do to help your existing employer and the future employer that\u2019s been created. So I think that all works together to create a group of very focused and dedicated people.", "Brian Meredith", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead with your question.", "Josh Shanker", "Thank you. Good evening, everyone. I was hoping there might be a possibility of getting a little more granular on the operating expenses, which are obviously elevated compared to a year ago, but not so much compared to last quarter. What's comp related, what\u2019s infrastructure related, and what would we think would probably go away in the future?", "Mike McGavick", "I am going to start and then pass it over to Pete. And I promise Pete I won\u2019t give the whole answer. The most important thing I'd say is as the year ended, we want to kind of spot on to what we said we would do for the year. And we said that ex-FX and comp related movements that we would be right around mid-single digits, I think we came out almost spot on 5.", "So I feel very good that as we try very hard to do that we did what we said we would do. But I think that -- and that of course always did include these other strategic investments. As I said earlier, it's too early to tell exactly how those wall shake out. But when I step back, you heard Greg referenced the fact that there continues to be an expense drag on building out those newer lines of business that we think are embodied the important remixing of lowering our overall combined and loss ratios.", "And that's one of the expense tracks that we think we can cheer right away through our combination with Catlin. Just as I've talked before about the fact that similarly when it comes to the expense of their, this is Catlin\u2019s building out of a global platform that we can rationalize a lot of expense there. So it's not just in the sort of what you're spending on tech categories that we can get synergies, those are meaningful. It is also more about the fundamental nature of the strategies of the two companies and how they fit together.", "Pete Porrino", "Sure. So Josh just -- and yes, Mike, you did leave me a piece, so thank you for that. Of the expenses in the quarter, so I would think about call it ballpark $40 million compared to last year would have been the variable compensation increase, okay, so just to give you a magnitude there.", "And then on your question about the strategic expenses, I think the best way I could take you through the numbers a little bit. And we said this before, if you look at our corporate expense line and again this is not how we manage the expenses a couple, we manage them in total. But if you look at the corporate expense line, we said in the past that approximately a third to 40% of that number is what we call the strategic initiatives and the rest would be an allocation of corporate that we don't allocate to the businesses.", "As you look at that 33% to 40% number, Mike talked about a couple of those initiatives that in place -- that are in place and the one that he mentioned on EE, as he said that one we are hoping to start to -- we are delivering, we\u2019ve already started delivering the benefits of that. We will continue that through 2015. And at that point in time, we would expect that the spending on that would go down pretty significantly.", "Josh Shanker", "Okay. That\u2019s a great answer. And one question for Mike. If you look out, you said on the call and you said in the press release, these are some of the best results we\u2019ve seen excel in 15 years and that\u2019s true. Interest rates are low here. One argument would be that because interests are low everyone is buttoned up and is playing bowl, and that\u2019s created a very healthy environment for PMC. The other argument would be that these are trough results and when interest rates go up, you will see ROEs rise for XL and the industry. Where do these results fit in the view of where you think results will be for X on the industry two, three years from now in a mortgage rate normal environment?", "Mike McGavick", "That\u2019s a really interesting question. And I am sure as heck I knew the answer. But I will give you a couple of perspectives. Number one, several years ago when Greg and others and we're all working on the strategy, we could see that this interest rate environment was going to be persistent. We have in-house committee of various disciplines that does interest rate forecasting and they have been consistently along with the rest of world saying this is not some temporary phenomenon, this is going to take a long time to resolve.", "And so we made a very aggressive decision back then that we were going to focus on that in essence the action in your loss ratio and everything else too, but really, really focus on delivering a great underwriting results as the driver of results. And our progress has of course had to come from that because we\u2019ve been mixing toward a lower investment return for a long time and it continues. So I think much of the market has adopted that same discipline to various degrees.", "At the same time, especially with what's going on in the reinsurance sector, we see a tremendous amount of capital being brought to bear. So that has a countervailing effect on discipline out there, because especially just imagine you talk some group and they are giving you a billion of capital put to work. You want to put it to work somehow. And so they're trying to outwit the market, outwitting a market we would submit is always a very, very difficult thing, especially if you don\u2019t have the kinds of long-term relationships and capabilities that a firm like XL and others bring to bear.", "So as I look at it, I do think obviously, when we get to the inflection point and assuming we do start to see some rise in interest rates and the contribution thereby to the earnings, I think you\u2019re coming off of such a disciplined period. I do not expect that all of the sudden everyone will go crazy. If fact, far from it, I think, discipline and underwriting is going to run on, because that\u2019s how people are used to working now and they're getting a lot of reward for working that way.", "And I don't expect it will suddenly change on a dime because somehow there's some interest-rate based cash flow coming on. So I'm hopeful that this discipline will be retained and there will be something we can build on. As proud as we are of these results, we\u2019re completely mindful that only in these last couple of years that we\u2019re beating our cost of capital.", "This is a solid return and in the spectrum of things going on a really positive development, but by no means is where we think ourselves or the industry should be performing, especially as interest rates normalize. So I would hope that discipline will last beyond what required in the first place.", "Josh Shanker", "Thank you for the extended answer. And good luck on the integration or hopefully the closing of the deal with Catlin.", "Mike McGavick", "Thank you very much, Josh.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Cliff Gallant with Nomura. You may ask your question.", "Cliff Gallant", "Great. Thank you. And Mike, condolences to Seahawks, I assume you would run the bowl.", "Mike McGavick", "This would have been a great question. I was so happy that they decided not to hold the Super Bowl this year.", "Cliff Gallant", "Two questions. One, you mentioned some pretty good growth in your cyber markets and you are adding to the team there. Just wondering, when you go into a new market like how is it that you can -- seems like it will be easy to grow, but there is a lot of risk you\u2019re taking on and how do you limit the risk, how do you know what you're getting into?", "Mike McGavick", "I\u2019m going to ask Greg to expand, but the simple answer is low limits and a broad dispersion of clients.", "Greg Hendrick", "That would be the whole answer. No, we\u2019ve been added for -- this will be the fourth year in existence and the third, second -- two and a half years are really going in a much bigger way at it. Mike is absolutely right, we keep our limits very low both on a gross basis, normal maximum there is $10 million and we buy quota share protection take that down to $5 million, so very small limits.", "As you probably know, it\u2019s also -- I\u2019m proud of the work the team does. I'm proud of the both the underwriting they do and the services they provide their clients, but it is a fairly scaled down product. There isn\u2019t broad disruption there. There isn\u2019t broad physical damage. It\u2019s effectively a breach and how they get our clients, customers back up on their credit agreement and back restored to health.", "So from that perspective, we also stay away from in general kind of the big-box retailers and some of the other larger exposures in that space. So it\u2019s a combination of low limits, good spread, good expertise to help clients and a big good broad industry distribution.", "Cliff Gallant", "Okay. Thank you. One other question I had is, we -- and thank you for the discussion over January 1 renewals, but notably, the talk with Catlin was happening over the renewal period. To what degree do you think that affected? How your renewals without much of an impact on what your volumes will look like this year?", "Mike McGavick", "My view is no, but I ask John to elaborate.", "John Welch", "That is the correct answer. We saw no impact of the leak with the announcement.", "Cliff Gallant", "Okay. Listening to your overview of where pricing was it, although it sounded it would be reasonable of us to expect that your Reinsurance volumes this year will be down. It sounded something like 5% to 10% or so?", "Mike McGavick", "We don't actually and never have gotten into specifics of the renewal season in terms of the size of portfolio or how we allocated our capital. But I can say that the pricing environment was difficult. But we've always got a couple of things going on as well. So how exactly that will shakeout by the time all the renewals finish out. But too early to tell, but I'm feeling that the group did a very nice job of handling some really difficult conditions.", "Cliff Gallant", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Josh Stirling with Bernstein. You may ask your question.", "Josh Stirling", "Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking the call. So, Mike, you made difficult for us as we all want to ask some forward-looking questions, but you don\u2019t want to talk about the deal? So I\u2019m going to try to stay big picture. I\u2019m thinking about your future capital leverage, your capital levers and operating leverage and reinsurance strategies, and I\u2019m trying to build my model for the next few years and I\u2019m wondering if you give us some bit more conceptual sense that how you think is likely to change? Even if only directionally we really love to get a better handle of what kind of strategy you think you are going to pursue on out of reinsurance spend? And then big picture, if there are actually meaningful opportunities for basically capital leverage from either diversification or sort of the capital benefit from using Lloyd's unique platform?", "Mike McGavick", "Yeah. You\u2019ve really excited the number of the things we're looking at very hard. I can\u2019t help you too much with the models at this stage, because we\u2019re still building ours, but I would give you a few thoughts in terms of detail now as opposed to headlines.", "I give you a few thoughts, one, you observe correctly that Lloyd is a very efficient platform. I think there are -- it sufficient in terms of capital, it\u2019s difficult in terms of expense, so it's a double-edged sword. And you can find that amongst the mix of businesses we have that there are things that would be better or worse in that environment and our view of the way they have been -- I'd say it simply, Catlin has always needed to and been more efficient that its capital use and we\u2019ve admired that in them.", "And when we see how Lloyd's used and think about our products, we're looking for the right mix to take advantage of that capital framework and the right mix to move away from that expense very much. So there is all kinds of really interesting optimization exercises going on.", "You can say the same thing from a diversification point of view. Sometimes its product specification but sometimes its geographic diversification and we\u2019re going to have a much bigger spread of geographic dispersion through which to work with and a whole set of different legal entity structures, which also have efficiency that can be gained as those are optimized.", "So I think what you're hearing is, we have a whole bunch of new tools available, the way the whole thing comes together. And I think I know that both teams are entering their work very mindful of what they can do to make sure that the very most efficient platform comes out the backend.", "And I can only tell you that from a personal point of view as I\u2019ve -- as we get deeper into the detail, I get more excited about the possibilities. There are many of these things that had no bearing on how we price the deal or the kinds of returns that we have promised the marketplace.", "Josh Stirling", "Okay. Great. Thank you. And just, I think, it\u2019s a question for Pete, its very numbers question and I apologies if you have addressed this earlier and I somehow missed it. But I wondered if you could walk us through some of the math behind this quarter's paid to incurred ratio and you guys disclose this to your credit, but it\u2019s an awfully higher number and you\u2019re growing in the numbers way above one.", "I\u2019m wondering if there is something unique going on with your seeding strategy or remixing or something that\u2019s leading it not have to fund the same level of reserves as you have in the past or whether maybe this is just like some one-time, this is due to some one-time factors that benefited the quarter?", "Pete Porrino", "So Josh, this is Pete. Let me address that. So there were two drivers for the high paid to incurred in the current quarter. So you're exactly right, your analysis is spot on. One was an exceptionally low level of incurred losses in the Reinsurance segment, as John talked about. And the second was a higher level of paid losses in the Insurance segment.", "And so what we give you in the financial supplement is the total, but if you broke them out you would see those individual segments and we\u2019re happy to provide that if you like it.", "The low-level of incurred losses in Reinsurance reflects a lack of both the attritional and lodge natural peril catastrophe losses in 2014, as well as the favorable PYD that we booked in the quarter.", "And on the Insurance side, the high level of paid losses, they reflects really more than a one quarter's worth of paid losses that we use. We process more of our cash receipts near the month end and we talked about the finance infrastructure projects, Mike mentioned it.", "As this comes online, right, as we\u2019ve been taking about this, this is now coming online and it\u2019s improved our ability to process elements of our close, closer to the period end. So in realty there is more than three months in that -- in this quarter paid losses and those two comprise the entire difference taking those two out, its right about 100%.", "Josh Stirling", "Got it. Thank you, thanks for the clarification.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. You may ask your question.", "Paul Newsome", "Good evening and congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to ask about currency and we\u2019ve seen a lot of companies with some pretty big currency impacts on their book value. Did I miss it or didn\u2019t look like there was much of an impact for you folks?", "Pete Porrino", "No, there wasn\u2019t that much. I mean if you look at what our exposed currency, we manage our currencies conservatively. We have a natural hedge on our legal -- this is Pete. We have a natural hedge on our legal entities that would be denominated in other currencies. We\u2019ve got a very strict rule on how much risk we will take on those balance sheets, right. And so at the end, the only currencies that we expect to flow through would be the retained earnings at the legal entities that would be in currencies denominated in other than U.S. dollars. And for us, it just was not that big of a transaction. So we do have an active hedge program, where we have a mandatory amount of VaR that we\u2019ll allow.", "Paul Newsome", "Interesting. I have a certainly different question. In some of the European countries, the interest rates have gotten extremely low, and in some cases the government rates are actually negative. I think most companies I would imagine you are the same since we tried to back liabilities in those current -- those currencies in those areas in assets that are in the same country. What do you do now that in some areas there is essentially no return on the available assets?", "Pete Porrino", "All right. So Paul, this is Pete. I\u2019ll take it again because it\u2019s a continuation of the comment about natural hedge that we have. And so yes indeed, when we are in locations where the reserves are in a currency, we are likely to have the assets in those same currencies. And clearly investing in euro and Swiss franc asset today is challenging given that there are negative yields going out, six years on the bonds and 12 years on the Swiss francs. Given our ALM matching approach, we invest in those portfolios quite a while ago and we expected reinvestment amounts over the next 12 months is only about $380 million.", "So we don't see this as a huge headwind in the near-term. So far we've mostly avoided buying bonds of negative yields. We've been able to invest incorporates, covered bonds and other high-quality ABS as well as European government agency paper, all of which pay a credit spread. So it generates some positive yield. But it will be an increasing -- increasingly different difficult challenge if this negative yield environment is sustained. Right, so at 12/31, the average book yield of our yield portfolio was 1.7% and the average market yield of our benchmark in euros is probably 0.4%.", "And so over time, you would expect those two numbers to converge. But as I talked about we will maintain our current matching philosophy. We are not in the business of taking unhedged FX Risk. We\u2019ll maintain our overall investment strategy discipline, not stretch the yield. The last thing I\u2019d say is as a result of the life transaction, we are in a different place where we are a lot less sensitive than we used to be, right, given the sale of our European block of business there.", "Mike McGavick", "Yeah, Paul, I would just add a couple of thought. First I\u2019d underscore the last point Pete made that transaction continues to really look like one of the really good achievements of the year, and this is another case of why. The second thing I would observe is in a variety of the international forums that I've been in particularly with my banking friends lately, the impact of interest rates on insurance business models is getting more and more attention than the central banking system. And I'm hopeful that they will start to take into account that impact as well as the other stimulative impact that they see, and come to more balanced solutions over time.", "Paul Newsome", "Great. Thanks and condolences on the Super Bowl.", "Mike McGavick", "Thanks.", "Pete Porrino", "That\u2019s too.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Randy Binner with FBR. You may ask your question.", "Randy Binner", "Hey good evening. Thank you I have a couple this is -- just first one is just following up on what Brian Meredith was asking on and as far as the workforce is concerned, I think Mike touched on it. But I think I am going to ask it more exclusively and that is with your transaction and the other large merger out there. It seems to me that there might be excess supply of labor in a lot of your key markets. And so, is that something that when you are doing your ongoing talent searches that you are feeling now already in the market?", "Mike McGavick", "Well. I think right now, it wouldn\u2019t be fair to judge the marketplace right now on some snapshot basis because with our two workforces working toward coming together, I don't think this is going to be a -- we are not going to have a unaffected view of how the labor markets working. We will not have as many people. I think that reaching out to us as we\u2019ve had recently until the dust settles somewhat because they know that there is uncertainty.", "I think the larger point to me is that there, I think that while there is always going to be a really meaningful competition for talent in our sector because great underwriters and underwriting leadership, great actuarial talent, these folks are hard to find. And when you find them, you try to get them in your organization and keep them as long as you can. And so, I don't think that piece of it will change even if there was dramatically more integration across the sector because the really great talent really isn\u2019t in oversupply.", "The second thing, I would say though is it does I think change the mentality of the workforce going through integration. If you thought your situation was the only difficult situation around. And therefore, it became tempting to go to some other organization and feel safer, I don't think that mentality is going to be very much in play right now. It\u2019s going to be difficult to go somewhere, where you're safe from all of this because I think it's going to take a while to play out.", "And again, I don't want to overstate it, but I think it makes our people very mindful of the great opportunity we are creating at XL and [Cal] [ph]. And I think when those two firm -- when these two firms come together, it's just going to be a real powerhouse in the large complex risk space. And in a world where risk solutions are becoming more and more complex, where risk mutates more rapidly, being a part of the firm that is doing the really creative hard work of making sure our clients are well protected, I can\u2019t imagine a place I'd rather be as an underwriter and that's exactly what we are trying to create.", "And so, I just think I can only comment kind of the -- on the impact of our own colleagues. But I think they are going to really want to be a part of it and I\u2019m going to be excited. I know Steven is to create as many opportunities for that kind of wonderful opportunity as we can.", "Randy Binner", "All right. Great. Thanks. And just one other follow-up and this is from what I think, Paul Newsome was just talking about. We ended up getting the book yield and the new money yield on your European or foreign book. But can you just provide the similar percentages for the overall book, or I guess the domestic book, however, you would communicate it?", "Mike McGavick", "We\u2019ve done well. You\u2019ve got Pete reaching for a file. So he is looking for a number.", "Pete Porrino", "No. I think it\u2019s in the -- yeah, it was -- I covered in the script. Let me just go back and cover it again. So, we had 3% -- and so we had that new money rate of 1.7% and our average book yield was 2.7%.", "Randy Binner", "2.7%. Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. You may ask your question.", "Meyer Shields", "Thanks. Good evening. One basic question. Just wanted to make sure I understand it. When you\u2019ve got dramatic foreign exchange changes, does that itself produce some of the reserve development that you reported in the quarter, or are those two categories completely distinct?", "Sarah Street", "No.", "Pete Porrino", "Meyer, could you repeat the question? I couldn\u2019t hear it.", "Meyer Shields", "Yeah. Let me try again, I am sorry, I am having phone call for awhile. When -- I don\u2019t know, the euro weakens dramatically against the dollar? Does that translate -- does that produce reserve development, when your euro liabilities now require few dollars to fund them?", "Sarah Street", "No. It would not. So the FX movements will go to the currency translation line and that would not be reported as part of the prior year development.", "Meyer Shields", "Okay.", "Pete Porrino", "So, Meyer, so if you look at our income statement and you saw the FX in the income statement, that would be large portion of it, would be the re-denomination of those liabilities.", "Meyer Shields", "Okay. No. That\u2019s perfect. I just want to make sure that I understood that. We haven\u2019t talked about Berkshire Hathaway in awhile? But now that\u2019s company, Berkshire Hathaway specialty has gotten sort of settled? Are they are more relevant competitive for us than they were a year ago than anything to concern you?", "Mike McGavick", "No. I\u2019ve -- we have expected anything that that crowd puts its line to, we expect them to do well. We certainly notice them a bit more. But I can\u2019t say that that they have a history of being really disciplined underwriters. So I don\u2019t think there is anything other than another competitor, on one hand that\u2019s going to grow and influence overtime, but at the same time, what I expect will be a continuing consolidation of other players. So it\u2019s kind of one hand on the other hand, but in the end I don\u2019t -- I haven\u2019t seen any real distortion in the marketplace because of their presence.", "Meyer Shields", "Okay. Fantastic. Thanks very much guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question comes from Ryan Byrnes with Janney Capital. You may ask your question.", "Ryan Byrnes", "Great. Yeah. Thanks. Good evening, everybody. Just wanted to touch, I think, Greg\u2019s comment earlier on the Insurance segment. I think you guys stated that there were -- large losses were 25% higher than last year and obviously, last year there was a lot of volatility in the underlying loss ratio, but we didn\u2019t see it this year? So I was just wondering, if you could help us, give us a little bit more color on what kind of impact it did had this year on a percentage basis and see what the -- why those losses persisted and can you get Reinsurance coverage more favorably heading into next year?", "Greg Hendrick", "Sure, Ryan. It\u2019s Greg Hendrick. So from a dollar perspective, when we look at large losses, we are looking at over $10 million for property and energy. Last year we had, at the end of the accident year, so the end of the 12 months as reported, we had $110 million or about 2.6 plus ratio points. So \u201914 we had $132 million or 3.3 points. So 0.7 higher loss ratio impact from large losses, but we still improved our accident year cat by 2 points.", "That\u2019s quite simple. All that hard work I have been talking about of re-mixing, re-underwriting and really gaining a much more profit underlying portfolio, there isn\u2019t any one, two or three things I\u2019ve point you on the one that I\u2019ve reiterated in the past.", "So for us when I look at the losses, I don\u2019t see anything that could give me trouble about, what we underwrote, how we underwrote it, the line size and so I feel like, we are -- there is great amount of volatility. If I gave you the last five years in terms of count, we have had 27,267 at the end of the 12-month accident year period. So quite a bumpy up and down that is part of the volatility we might turn -- talked about earlier.", "On reinsurance, we did put in place an arrogant risk protection at May 1. That has -- we have contributed number of these losses against there got deductible, so from here for the remainder of that treaty period we will have a lot less volatility, where we had experienced more loss in the first part of next year.", "As far as May 1 goes, we will see when we get there about the Reinsurance purchasing. As things are at the moment, we don\u2019t expect any problems with our reinsurance treaty renewals.", "Ryan Byrnes", "Great. That\u2019s great color. Thank you. And then my last question is, were there any one-time Catlin expenses in the fourth quarter and I guess, should we anticipate any go-forward?", "Pete Porrino", "Hey, Ryan. It\u2019s Pete. There was diminish amount is approximately $2 million of Catlin expenses in the quarter and really, I think, we are unable to give you much guidance for what we are going to see in the future, I apologies.", "Ryan Byrnes", "Okay. Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Gutterman from Balyasny. You may ask your question.", "Ian Gutterman", "Hi. Thank you. Pete, I have -- I notice something about your Reinsurance segment in Q4 last year, as I didn\u2019t notice this until today? But sequentially the accident year was about 10 points better than the first three quarters and the same thing happened last year and the same thing in 2012, before that that never happened. Is there some seasonality in Q4 in your Reinsurance accident year, or are you doing true-ups on your pick and that\u2019s been to your benefits in the past two years or is there some reason in Q4s a lot better than the rest of the year?", "Mike McGavick", "So, yes, I will let John talk about that. There was some seasonality there.", "Ian Gutterman", "Sure. Okay.", "John Welch", "But essentially, the process is to take a look at the accident year in the fourth quarter and revert to actual reported activity. And so what you're seeing in the last few years is the actual CAT activity running much better than expected. I\u2019d called attritional CAT activity running much better than expected and then that's brought into the actuarial methods and essentially there's a release across the year for that activity.", "Ian Gutterman", "Got it. Okay. So for that -- so I shouldn\u2019t necessarily build that it for next year unless a sense of being like a CAT year again?", "John Welch", "Right. And just to give you a sense, for the fourth quarter, the impact of that activity was about 8.2 points.", "Ian Gutterman", "Got it. Thank you. And then on the incentive comp, was there a bigger impact on Reinsurance proportionally than insurance? It looked like there was a bigger increase in the Reinsurance expense ratio year-over-year than the Insurance increase?", "Mike McGavick", "Yeah. Proportionally, there would be. I mean, the way we work our incentive comp is highly aligned to localized results and clearly the Reinsurance results were genuinely outstanding.", "Ian Gutterman", "Got it. Okay. And then my last one on the Insurance segment on pricing. As you've grown, I assume to some extent, the new business carries, a new business country with it, a, are you able to -- on renewal, essentially get it back to sort of a necessary long-term price or you still in the process of that and how much is that impacted by the overall pressure on rates? I guess, I wonder, is there sort of another mix benefits to rates beyond just sort of the headline number as you renew new business?", "Mike McGavick", "Let me start then I\u2019m going to pass it to Greg. This is Mike. The one thing I observed is when you set up a new team you often get what I would call honeymoon pricing at the start. The market is excited to have that team with your firm and they have a lot of relationships that they are leveraging and you can get some surprising, good pricing at the outset of the new team being stood up. So the penalty, as it were is less than you might think.", "Ian Gutterman", "Okay.", "Mike McGavick", "Ordinary new business activity. But, Greg, you want to comment on the rest of it.", "Greg Hendrick", "Sure. Yeah. I\u2019d say a couple of things. One is I think I have touched upon in the past. Quite often, it\u2019s the case that this is not new business to the underwriters at XL. Either we\u2019ve seen it in prior durations at XL, or the underwriters have seen it in their prior lines and other operations. So these aren\u2019t particularly in their large commercial space. These aren\u2019t brand new unknown risk to us that we are trying to price for you, as opposed to what you are trying to underwrite new home or new car on your small business.", "The second one is the interesting piece of data. I have heard others comment on this on their call. We\u2019ve made a great effort over the last three years to build up our ability to capture rate adequacy in the Insurance segment. And without fail, as we\u2019ve build this process and strengthen it, new business prices are better than renewal business. I\u2019ve heard others comment on that conundrum because in your question, I get the same inference which is, it must be worse and it just -- the data doesn\u2019t seem do it. Now that maybe that you don\u2019t know as much about the new business as you do the renewal, but I just want to give that point of data to you that there is a stronger price adequacy based on our pricing tools for new versus renewal.", "The last thing is I don\u2019t think you should be modeling any kind of return on renewals going forward. There is so many moving parts in an insurance book. You are constantly in a good year. We\u2019re at 85% to 87% retention ratio. So we\u2019re refilling 13%, 15%, 20% of the book anyway. So you\u2019re constantly having new and there\u2019s just too many moving parts to tell you that you are going to get an improvement for that one when the current new business renews.", "Ian Gutterman", "Got it. Makes sense. Thank you for that helpful answer.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question comes from Dan Farrell with Sterne, Agee. You may ask you question.", "Dan Farrell", "Hi and good evening. Just a question on growth and insurance, I know you said that there were some large accounts added to the growth. But I was hoping you could give us little more detail within the segments. What types of lines are driving casualty growth? What types of lines are driving other insurance growth?", "Greg Hendrick", "Sure, Dan. So let me break it down into three parts. Your first one is the large or timing that I referred to in my comments. Couple of those are in the Global Risk Management business or U.S. Risk Management business where we have big gross written premiums where we\u2019re writing a policy over insurance captive and they\u2019re retaining a large part of the risk. So we\u2019re proud to be successful there in a couple of instances in the quarter.", "Our North American Construction team has had some strong growth as well. There was some premium associated with the retrospective Worker's Comp. which is not a big part of our insurance book but we do have some of it. There\u2019s a little bit there. And the rest of it was a companion that I won\u2019t bore you with a miscellaneous kind of timings and accruals and true-ups that goes on in the normal course of business with insurance.", "In terms of the second piece, which is we\u2019re growing in businesses, I touched on Construction. Crisis Management had a great quarter as well. International Financial Lines is another area where we grew strongly. And if I turn over to geography, Brazil, we had a really strong quarter in Brazil across a number of different lines of business that is really paying off in our investments down there. So those are the pieces of the growth year-over-year.", "Dan Farrell", "Okay, great. And then just another sort of numbers question on reinsurance purchase in that gross, I realize it\u2019s hard for you to comment on what\u2019s going to happen forward with your purchase. But if we look at the quarterly seasonality, you obviously did a lot of purchase in 2Q and then the retention jumps back up in 3Q and 4Q. Is that the right seasonality on a quarterly basis to think about as it just happened to be? What products are you reinsuring in that particular given quarter?", "Greg Hendrick", "We should have a less seasonality on a normal -- as we reach normal run rate. This is standalone XL commentary now. Standalone run rate for reinsurance suited those jumps up and down or when we had certain quota shares renewing in the professional and we\u2019ve talked a bit about this one in July to join for our casualty. And so what you see there is the effect of the changes that hit the books then and changes that suited -- I\u2019m sorry, net to gross retention ratio.", "Dan Farrell", "Okay. All right. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And at this time, I will turn the call back over to the speakers for closing remarks.", "Mike McGavick", "This is Mike. I guess, three quick things, number one, our colleagues who often check in on these calls. I just want to say that we in the leadership group and certainly the board as well are deeply appreciative of the hard work that produces extraordinary results. And it\u2019s really an exciting time for the firm and exciting time going forward. We know very well that's an anxious time as well. And I promise you we are working very, very hard to get answers to people as quickly as we can and we will keep at it.", "Second, to the analyst community, I just want to observe that this transaction clearly was surprising to some people and some side as a whole new strategy and other things. And I just want to thank the community for the open-mindedness you\u2019ve shown to this transaction. I think it has a lot to say for it and there is a lot we can\u2019t yet say about it. That\u2019s been frustrating for everyone but I\u2019ve appreciated the open-minded approach that\u2019s been taken. And third, addressed to my beloved Seahawks, I love them even more. They handled the loss with class was pretty cool. Anyway thank you very much for your time.", "Operator", "Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

My name is Shirley, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the XL Group plc Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please  be advised this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "David R. Radulski", "Thank you, Shirley, and welcome to XL Group's Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being simultaneously webcast on XL's webcast at www.xlgroup.com. We posted to our website several documents including our quarterly financial supplement. On our call today, Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, will offer opening remarks. Peter Porrino, XL's Chief Financial Officer, will review our financial results; followed by Dave Duclos, our Chief Executive of Insurance Operations; and Jamie Veghte, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations, who'll review their segment results and market conditions, then we'll open it up for questions. Also in attendance and available for questions are Susan Cross, our Global Chief Actuary; Sarah Street, our Chief Investment Officer; and Stephen Robb, our Controller. ", "Before they begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that certain of the matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations.  Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements and, therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them. Forward looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other documents and file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of which they are made, and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise. ", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike McGavick.", "Michael S. McGavick", "So the interesting quarters that have characterized the year 2011 continue. It has been an extraordinary quarter at XL. It is a mix of good and a few not-so-good items, as it always is. On the not-so-good side, we saw heavy catastrophe activity, as did the industry. But on the good side, once again, we saw the progress that we have made in ERM at XL shine through as our performance in catastrophe terms, we think, was very much in line with our peers and in some cases, even a little better. And happily, prior quarter Cat events continued to perform as predicted at the time.", "Now also on the not so good side, we saw a difficulty in our large property line, which produced one very large loss. And that large loss has been the continuation of a pattern of larger losses that we have seen out of that operation. On the good side, you can be assured that the new leadership we installed over that book in 2011 gets it, as do all of us. Make no mistake. As underwriters, we do not find an x Cat, x PYD combined ratio of 101.7% acceptable at any point in the cycle. But back on the good news side, our challenges are on a short-tail line of business. And we believe the underwriting actions, many of which are already underway, will take hold relatively quickly", "But bringing all of that up relates to the quarter just passed. And that belies the fact that generally here at XL, we are extremely excited about the market that is increasingly near at hand. Broadly  speaking, nearly every line of business with a notable exception of U.S. D&O is showing -- is now showing either flat or positive rate change for the second straight quarter. In fact, overall in this third quarter, we saw 2 points of rate when you take away the negative pricing in professional lines, and this is the continuation of a trend for the second straight quarter with positive rate. And we believe this understates our progress as it has been accelerating each month throughout the quarter. Now I'm not here to call it a hard market yet. But clearly, managements in our industry are becoming frustrated by reality. The reality that we are in a prolonged low interest rate environment, the reality that for some companies, I think, reserves are running dry, and the reality that the sector has been underpricing most of these products for an extended period of time.", "Now while I'm on the topic of reserves running dry, you will notice that there was relatively minimal prior year development at XL in the third quarter. But you will recall from prior calls that we do not do a deep examination of our reserves during the first and third quarters, so it is not unusual for us to have a third quarter likeness. And some will note that this third quarter PYD is less than the same quarter a year ago. But that quarter was driven by specific case anomalies as we described at the time. My point is that this quarter does not mean anything with respect to the overall level of redundancy at XL, which has been favorably reviewed by industry analysts including many on this call. ", "Now getting back to the larger story, why do I say we're so excited? Most of our businesses are performing very well. The businesses where we've had some noise have our arms around it, and we think quick actions will have great effect. And the reality is if a market starts to turn, you want to be the company who has momentum, the company who has been adding to the talent on the ground working with clients. And we have been adding to our underwriting talent, both in terms of the underwriting in the existing businesses, and we've been adding new lines of businesses where we think we had access to superior talent to drive into these markets. Again, we are very excited about our strategy and its particular timing as we see the markets right now.  ", "Taken together, this is one of the really extraordinary times for XL. We believe we are positioned correctly, and we're ready to get to work. And we are hoping what we are seeing early signs of generally holds true to the end of the year. Now let me be a more specific.", " ", "As you've seen from our release in the quarter that had significant Cat losses, we generated operating earnings of $0.28 per share and an annualized operating ROE of 3.6% in the quarter. As I've done on recent calls, I'll  briefly describe it in the context of the 5 drivers that build value for XL shareholders: Underwriting excellence, strategic growth, strong enterprise risk management, optimized investing and operating and capital efficiency. First, with respect to our underwriting, our reinsurance operations, again, produced outstanding results with the combined ratio of 78.8%. Our insurance segment's combined ratio of 112.2%, as was described, was impacted by Cat losses and one large non-Cat property loss. ", "Looking at strategic growth. By far, the most important trend in the quarter was the excelling rate -- accelerating rate achievement we've seen across both Insurance and Reinsurance, as I earlier discussed. New business and improved rate drove most of the quarter's top line P&C growth of 16.4% following last quarter's gain of 16.9%. But that's not the only way we are going to grow in a changing market. A couple of examples: First, we obtained prior approval to establish a Brazilian insurance operation. As XL participates in 1,700 global programs and as nearly 1/3 of them have at least one policy in Latin America, this is an important step in building out our presence in that critical region. ", "Second, we announced the addition of a globally recognized Political Risk & Trade Credit team led by Richard Maxwell. This is in keeping with the expansion into additional lines of business that you've seen over the course of the year. ", "Our next value driver, strong enterprise risk management, was again demonstrated by our natural catastrophe loss performance as I mentioned earlier. With our net cat losses of approximately 1% of shareholders' equity and 5.3% for the year-to-date, both comparing very favorably to our industry peers. We've already addressed the importance we have in the confidence in our conservative reserving. ", "To our fourth driver, optimized investing. As we all know, turmoil ripped the markets with significant spread widening in response to events in Europe and uncertainty about U.S. growth. Despite this volatility, our investment portfolio actually had a small positive mark-to-market. In this low interest rate environment, net investment income remains under pressure. But we are sticking with the strategic asset allocation approach we described at our Investor Day and are not choosing to stretch for yield. We like our relatively conservative positioning in these uncertain times. ", "Our fifth driver is operating and capital efficiency, and we believe we have the operating leverage we need to take advantage of the improving market conditions. We believe the strategic investments we've made to our underwriting platform will serve us very well. Regarding capital management, we bought back 15.1 million shares of XL in the third quarter. Since August 2010, we have bought back a total of 52 million shares or $1.1 billion.", "Now before we turn to the presentations of others, I want to briefly discuss 4 subjects as respect to the future. We do not give guidance, and we know that's frustrating for those of you who rely on building models. And I think there are 4 things I should comment on to be helpful, and the first is with respect to share repurchases as I just mentioned. I would not want you to take the amount of share repurchases that went on in the third quarter as a signal to the level for the future. ", "The fact is, in the third quarter, we had 2 anomalies: Number one, we had taken a pause and had the opportunity to catch up, and we found the value we can create during this quarter given what was going on in the markets very opportunistically attractive. Given the opportunities I'm describing, from improved pricing and lines of business, I just wouldn't want you to think that we wouldn't keep some of our powder dry. Look forward for future announcements as we go along.", "Second, with respect to affiliate income. As you know, our investment affiliate income is reported on a 1- to 3-month lag. As a result, the turbulence that we saw in the markets over the third quarter, which of course, you are all very familiar, would not show up in our earnings until next -- at the end of the fourth quarter. ", "Third, with respect to expenses. In this quarter, you will notice our expenses were a bit lower, especially as it relates to lower compensation costs. But the fact is, I would still take the first and second quarter as more likely the level of expenses in the fourth quarter and going forward, And finally, I don't think you need to be reminded but we certainly know it ourselves, our hearts and minds were certainly with the people who are currently affected in Thailand. We have this call in the midst of yet another industry catastrophe that is unfolding. And it is still far too early to say anything specific, but we certainly know it will have some impact across the industry, and we would expect some at XL.", "So that's a brief summary both of how we feel about this quarter in specific, how we feel broadly about the markets and the way XL is posed to compete in them and a little bit about some future events that we would encourage you to keep in mined. ", "Now Pete Porrino will share more detail in a moment on other actions we've taken to streamline our capital structure, lower our pro forma leverage and increase our book value per share. This is Pete's first earnings call, but he is certainly no stranger to many of you, given his industry experience as the Head of Insurance Practice at Ernst & Young. Pete knows finance. He knows insurance, and he knows XL. In fact, you should know that Peter has been integrally involved at XL since my arrival as he and I have worked together closely for many, many years. We are simply delighted the he has joined our leadership team. ", "Before turning it over to Pete, you may have noticed that XL has a new global brand and logo. We have felt for sometime that we needed to bring XL's public face up-to-date with our strategies and ambitions. And this has been a great opportunity to communicate with our investors, our clients and our colleagues about how XL has changed and is changing. This new brand gets to the heart of everything we do at XL, our opportunities to provide solutions for the world's most complex risks and as our new brand states, to make the world go. Now to Peter.", "Peter R. Porrino", "Thanks, Mike. I'm delighted to be on this call and to be part of the XL team. I can tell you that after 2 months here, this place has the excitement and energy of a start-up, only with the infrastructure, a deep talent pool already in place and over $10 billion of tangible shareholders' equity. Now as you can see from our release, operating net income for the third quarter was $89 million or $0.28 per share compared to operating income of $175 million or $0.52 a share in the third quarter of 2010. This decrease was largely driven by the impact of Cat losses in the quarter of $111 million compared to $66 million in the prior year and lower levels of positive reserve development.", "Now turning to our summary of financial results on Slide 3. You'll see that Property & Casualty gross premiums written were up 16.4% versus the third quarter of last year, with a 16.6% and 16.0% increase in the Reinsurance -- I'm sorry, in the Insurance and Reinsurance segments, respectively. Dave and Jamie will highlight the sources of growth in their segments. Net premiums written grew more slowly than gross premiums due to the growth in our crop business which, as you know, is heavily reinsured. ", "Our P&C combined ratio for the quarter was 101.6%. It was 6.7 points higher than the same quarter last year. Our accident year combined ratio was 103.0% or 1.6 points higher than Q3 2010. And as Mike mentioned and as detailed on Slide 4, Cat losses in the quarter accounted for 8 loss ratio points, 2.9 points higher than the same quarter last year. x PYD and Cat, our combined ratio improved by 1.3 points, driven by results in the Reinsurance segment. Prior development in the quarter was a favorable $18.4 million or 1.4 loss ratio points. This reflects favorable development in the Reinsurance segment of $39.8 million, offset by strengthening in the Insurance segment of $21.4 million.", "Now it's important to keep in mind how our reserving process works. As we've outlined on previous earnings calls and as Mike mentioned, Q3 is what we refer to as an actual versus expected, or A versus E quarter for both our global Insurance segment and our U.S. Reinsurance business. Since we perform our detailed ground-up reserve reviews in the second and fourth quarters with the interim quarters based on actual versus expected, you would generally not expect to see a significant movement in the third quarter. One cannot simply straight-line PYD on a quarterly basis. For those portions of our business covered by A versus E reviews, which account for approximately 80% of our reserves in Q1 and Q3, we respond to movements in the shorter-tail lines or the specific claim movements in all the mature years. ", "We experienced some strengthening in Insurance this quarter relating primarily to specific non-Cat property claims activity. The remaining 20% of our reserves are predominantly Reinsurance, non-U.S. Casualty and shorter-tail Reinsurance business, for which reserves are reviewed quarterly with more comprehensive assumption updates performed annually. This is a primary driver for the favorable development this quarter. And as Mike said, the release of this quarter were lower than the prior year quarter due to a couple of specific situations that we discussed last year. ", "Looking forward to fourth quarter, it's too early to forecast the outcome of our detailed reserve reviews, although we can say that actual experience on our long-tail lines continues to develop in line with, and in many cases, better than expectations.", "At $210 million, net investment income on the P&C portfolio in the third quarter was 4% below the prior year, due primarily to lower yield as a result of lower interest rates and cash outflows from the investment portfolio. The average new money rate on our P&C portfolio in the quarter was 2.2% with a net yield of 3.2% achieved during the quarter. The P&C book yield at the end of the quarter was 3.1% net of expenses. Our P&C duration remains unchanged at 2.8 years. Net income from investment affiliates was $23 million, up $20 million from the prior year. We sold an investment manager affiliate in this quarter that resulted in a $25 million gain. This helped to offset losses in the alternative portfolio due to difficult Q3 market conditions.", "Realized losses were $62 million compared to $69 million in the prior quarter. A significant portion of this was FX-related where they were offsetting FX gains in the income statement and cumulative translation adjustments. The remaining OTTI charges were primarily on non-agency RMBS assets. The total mark-to-market was $84 million positive with the impact of widening credit spreads being offset by lower rates during this risk loss quarter in the capital markets.  ", "As we've talked about in the past and as you can see from our expanded FIN swap disclosure, we have been actively managing our holdings and European assets over the past 2 years in anticipation of the developments we are seeing in the market now. Our direct exposure to peripheral sovereigns is less than $30 million, and our holdings and financial institutions in those countries is only $56 million. Since the onset of the financial crisis a couple of years ago, we've reduced our hybrid exposures by over $1 billion, and our current holdings are now in strong institutions in Germany, Switzerland, Northern Europe, the U.K. and Asia. Since the end of Q3, we've taken advantage of recent market strength to sell an additional $51 million of hybrid securities. ", "Now to our capital management, where there's been a fair amount of activity since our last earnings call. One of our Investor Day goals was to simplify our capital structure and reduce capital leverage to a level more in line with our peers. And with the actions we've taken, we're reducing our pro forma leverage by over 300 basis points. Specifically, we purchased and canceled 15.1 million ordinary shares at an average cost of $20.33 for a total of $307.7 million in the quarter and $566 million for the first 9 months of 2011. Approximately $166 million of this was authorized in 2010 but not completed until the first quarter of 2011. This brings our total buybacks under the current authorization to 33.6 million shares and leaves $290 million remaining available. ", "In August, we completed the remarketing of the $575 million, 8.25% senior notes that comprise part of the 10.75% equity security units issued and settled the related forward purchase contract. We also completed the tender we offer for all of our remaining outstanding Series C preference ordinary shares. In September, we issued $400 million of 5.75% senior notes due 2021. The net proceeds of this will be used as partial funding for repayment of our outstanding $600 million, 6.5% guaranteed senior notes due in January 2012. And finally, in October, we announced the termination of the Stoneheath Re facility and the resulting issuance of $350 million of Series D preference ordinary shares, at 322 basis points over LIBOR, a very advantageous rate in today's market. ", "I'll now turn it over to Dave to discuss our Insurance segment results.", "David B. Duclos", "Thanks, Pete. While insurance results in the third quarter for the industry and XL were adversely impacted by significant catastrophic losses, including Hurricane Irene, the good news is we are seeing what we believe are sustainable rate improvements across almost all of our lines of business. ", "Some detail on Q3 first. The Insurance segment's combined ratio for the quarter of 112.2% was 8.2 points higher versus the same quarter last year. Clearly, a disappointing result and one which masks continued good progress in many areas as we bring our strategy to life. Prior year reserve strengthening of $21.4 million accounted for 1.8 points of the variance, mostly driven by strengthening in our property and onshore energy line. ", "Current year net Cat losses of $76 million, including reinstatement premium, accounted for 5.1 points of the increase. An increase in the current accident year loss ratio accounted for another 2.1 points, largely due to a significant non-Cat property loss, partially offset by improvements in our international primary Casualty book. A decrease in net expenses accounted for 0.8 points of improvement mostly due to recalibrations in annual bonus and long-term incentive plan. ", "Insurance gross premiums written in Q3 rose $165 million year-over-year or nearly 17% from prior year quarter. While this growth benefited from some favorable foreign exchange adjustments and other one-off gains, over half of the increase or 9% was driven largely by new business and improved rate. New business included premium from targeted initiatives such as North America and international construction, North America property and surety and international upper middle markets. ", "Net premiums earned were up $58 million or 6.6%,  reflecting the earn-through of higher gross premiums written. Our Q3 loss ratio of 82.5% was 9 points higher than last year, and 72.2% or 2.1 points higher than last year when adjusted for prior development in Cats. Again, this variance was driven by the large non-Cat property loss and previous price reductions, which have eroded our loss ratio in this line. In recent quarters, we've seen improvement in rate with this business and will continue to push rate hard, given current results are not at targeted level. ", "Regarding people, Q3 was another active quarter for attracting top industry talent. In addition to Mike's examples, Richard De Simone joined XL to lead our expanding U.S. Ocean and Inland Marine business. In total, we added over 30 new underwriters in the quarter while retaining existing talent as we continue to build out both new and existing businesses. This speaks to the building momentum Mike alluded to earlier and the fact that underwriters value our structure, strategy and culture. ", "On to market conditions. We achieved the second consecutive quarter of positive pricing in Q3. Both our international and North American P&C businesses achieved rate increases in the 2% to 3% range. U.S. D&O pricing is still being pressured due to the line's excellent profitability. But across all lines of Insurance, x U.S D&O, average rate improvement was roughly 2% and early signs for an even stronger fourth quarter. We believe that the conditions driving the pricing momentum we saw in the last 2 quarters should continue in Q4 and well into 2012. We remain steadfast in underwriting discipline, and we look forward to the opportunities presented to us both by our current clients and our new business.", "And now to Jamie to discuss Reinsurance results.", "James Veghte", "Thanks, Dave, and good evening. XL re-enjoyed excellent underwriting results in the quarter with a combined ratio of 78.8%, producing an underwriting profit of $91.5 million. This compares to a combined ratio of 75% in the third quarter of 2010. Result included positive prior year reserve development of $39.8 million, which compares to releases of $86.8 million in 2010. Adjusting for both Cat losses and prior year releases, the segment had a combined ratio of 80%, which compares favorably to the 86.5% achieved in Q3 of last year. This improvement is generated from the segment's expense ratios with both the operating and an acquisition expenses showing improvement of 2.0 and 2.2 points, respectively. The loss ratio also showed an improvement of 2.4 points, driven by a mix of business change, including the larger portion of property Cat business in the portfolio. ", "Turning to top line. Gross and net written premiums were $619 million and $420 million, an increase of 16% on the gross and 7.9% of the net. The increases in the gross book came principally from the U.S. crop book due to rising commodity prices. In addition, both the Bermuda and European business units showed increases due to selected new business opportunities.", "Turning to the market. We commented on the July 1 renewals on our last earnings calls, we had an excellent renewal with both the U.S. and international Cat portfolios showing nice risk-adjusted gains. We fully expect trading conditions to remain robust in the Cat market going into the January 1 renewals, given the level of global Cat losses this year. Perhaps, more -- most encouraging is the clear expectation of on improved pricing environment on the primary side, particularly on long-tail lines. With the exception of public D&O, there's a positive price momentum across the domestic market. ", "We've spent a significant amount of time with customers and brokers at various conferences, such as Monte Carlo, PCI and CIAB. And the unanimous feedback were not only a reiteration of the need for rate, but a commitment to achieve it. This is a major benefit to the sectors of our portfolio that are most sensitive to primary trading conditions, particularly our U.S. and international Casualty portfolios where we write a significant amount of proportional reinsurance. Broadly, we are very encouraged by the trading environment that's developing across the market. Given our global footprint, lead capabilities and capacity, we will be in an ideal position going into the renewal season. ", "With that, I'll turn it back to David for Q&A.", "David R. Radulski", "Shirley, can you open the lines for questions please?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Keith Walsh from Citi.", "Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "First question for Mike. A lot of talk around rate, not just on this call but all the calls. What do you view -- when you look at written rate, is that currently trending in excess of your loss cost? And do you view the rate increases you're currently getting and expect to get as enough to really offset the loss in yield that we're seeing?", "Michael S. McGavick", "That's a great question. At this stage, my answer to that would be no. We are seeing positive movement in rate without question, Keith. But we are not yet seeing it to the level that will be necessary, both to offset the losses that are seen across the investment yield in our place or even loss trend. Now I should be specific, I don't mean that with respect to the current loss trend we're experiencing. As you know, it's been a very low period. But we don't look at it that way. We reserve to a normalized loss trend, and that's the number we focus on in terms of where we think rate needs to go. So no, we aren't where -- we -- neither we nor the market are where we think it needs to be. But it is, of course, very positive to finally be working away at it as opposed to continuing to see it get worse.", "Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then for Peter, just looking at the next -- thinking about capital structure and the next maturity, I guess, $600 million in 2014, is there a preference to pay that down or refi? And how do you think about excess capital in the context of buybacks, debt pay down and growth in the business? Can you do all 3 at once?", "Peter R. Porrino", "Sure. So on the first one, we don't have any comment yet on the 2014s, we will deal with that at the appropriate time. And then on your second one, I think it would be yes on all 3. I mean it is, clearly a balancing act that we deal with pretty much every quarter that we think about this.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just one question I had was other casualty, can you remind us what's in that line and what drove the increase year-over-year?", "David B. Duclos", "Michael, this is Dave Duclos. Are you relating to the premium?", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes, that's right.", "David B. Duclos", "We had growth in our North America casualty operation specifically, a result of the couple of programs that we wrote earlier in the year. That would drive the majority of the casualty increase.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And those are platforms that are continuing to grow, or are those kind of reaching a sort of run rate?", "David B. Duclos", "Those are books of business that we're in the process of rolling in, and they're probably pretty much completed. Books that we are very familiar with, staff and the organization that we brought on are very familiar with.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then just one on the Reinsurance side. It looks like the expense ratio was low, I think you made a comment in your opening remarks. Was that lower in the third quarter because of seeding commissions because you seeded more business there? Or how should we think about that number?", "David B. Duclos", "There's 2 parts to the expense ratio. The operating expense ratio is lower due to accruals for year-end compensation. The acquisition expense ratio was lower principally due to the increase in the crop portfolio in the quarter, which after our significant sessions for the government and the open market has very, very low net acquisition expense ratios.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. Okay. And so that's going to be more seasonal for third and maybe a little bit in the second quarter then?", "David B. Duclos", "Correct.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Michael Paisan with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Michael G. Paisan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "A couple of questions. Number one, Mike, you talked about the progress that you've made kind of across the board. Obviously, it's very good. But I guess the question is, number one, when does that progress become -- okay, we've made the progress and now we're kind of heading in the right direction, that's number one. And number two, it gets back to the capital issue in terms of your stock now is trading at pretty low valuations. So how do you guys kind of balance the whole -- just buy back a whole bunch of stock versus deploying into the marketplace?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Yes, let me talk about that. So you've got a 2-part question. One, how do we feel about the progress. And the way I would have interpreted your first part of your question, \"When can we as shareholders expect that to show up?\" And then second, given where we're trading on a valuation basis, \"Why haven't we just kind of thrown it all in on share repurchases.\"", "Michael G. Paisan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "That's correct.", "Michael S. McGavick", "Let me talk about both in the same kinds of blunt terms that you've asked. With respect to progress, some of the progress is there. When you see the kinds of additions of quality, market respected and leader talent coming to the firm, that is an important harbinger of what comes next. So I would argue that kind of momentum is rare. We're something of a hot chop right now, and that is a very important precursor to what comes next. We're starting to see that already in the top line. This is the second quarter we're at significant double-digit plus top line improvement. In fact, when you boil through all those numbers and you get to what's about rate and real growth, you'll see kind of 9% FX -- x of FX and whatnot. That is very meaningful growth. And that's just starting to see the rate kick in. So I think that part is very real, and it leads to improved, although not at the same rate, of net earned income. And of course, that's the number that starts the whole calculation in motion. So we've very pleased by that. Without question, when you get into new lines of business or when you are correcting an underperforming line of business like our large property international book, it takes time for that to show up on the bottom line. But the things that we're looking internally at and we're very pleased by, again, with the exception of the urgency we have around that property book. And so if I look at the casualty work we've done where we've done, as we call them, fresh starts or deeper views of those business, I'm very pleased with the early actions and the early indications that we're looking at. It's just not ready for that to show on the bottom line. And what pleases us most is where we do have this problem that we have a lot of urgency around. By the way, when we're communicating about this, we do it on purpose. We very much wanted you to know how we're thinking about the book, and this is something that's sticking out us. And I know a lot of our underwriters are listening, and I want them to know that we're paying a heck of a lot of attention to it. But the good news on that is it's short-tail line of business. I'm very pleased with this progress we see with similar actions in our North American property book, and I expect that to be -- soon to show on the international property book. But it does take more of a 0.5 year to 1 year's delay from action to result. But know that these aren't actions that are newly started in this quarter. They've been going on during the year. I just think we're communicating to you and broadly and to all of our constituencies the sense of urgency we're feeling about it because the reality is you don't want to be fixing books. As pricing gets better, you want to be hitting on all cylinders. And we've got a lot of urgent work to do to make sure we are fully positioned even though at this stage where I would call us broadly positioned.", "Michael G. Paisan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Do you mind if I follow up on that just...", "Michael S. McGavick", "No, no, no. Go right ahead.", "Michael G. Paisan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Because that's a very good answer. But I was just kind of wondering about when we talk about the progress, because you've been talking about the progress for the better part of couple of years now. And I guess, at least in this quarter, maybe there was one large property loss that kind of hindered underwriting. And if you could quantify them, maybe you did and I missed it, but if you can quantify that, that would be great. But I guess, I'm just trying to -- as you say, you got another couple more quarters until you really start to see it come to fruition. By that time, there will be a good 2, 2.5 years along the lines of progress. I know where you started from versus where you are today is a big, big difference. It's been a ton of progress. But I guess what I'm trying to get a sense of is when does that progress become, I guess, kind of reality because I don't think we've seen it yet.", "Michael S. McGavick", "Again, what I -- look I would observe that you are seeing it in 2 parts. You're seeing it in top line growth and net earned premium growth, which is the first thing you will see. The second thing you will see is in the next handful of quarters, we would expect that to start dropping to the bottom line as well. Now the real question, in terms of it being more immediate, is when will we stop seeing this broad pattern of larger pops, which has really been then the thing obscuring the fundamental progress. When will see that? I don't know. Some of that is pure futility and some of it is some things we think we can improve. So it will just -- we're both going to have to wait for that. But I don't expect to wait very much longer, and I think we have a proper sense of urgency around it. Yes, we've been working on improving the profitability of XL for a couple of years, that's true. But I would suggest that the intensity of the work that we discussed about at Investor Day with our new strategy in mind, which is really a year old, is what I would focus on. If you go back to 2009, we were really focused on stabilizing the franchise, not on executing the strategy. So I think your time frames are maybe a tad excited relative to where it will come through. I didn't size the loss with respect to the one large loss. It was about a $40 million net loss to us. And of course, that will have about a $10 million reinstatement premium. So you're talking about a $50 million event on the quarter on that one large loss.", "Michael G. Paisan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And if you could just address the...", "Michael S. McGavick", "Yes, on the second part, with respect to share repurchases. As I've told you before, this is always a balancing act across 3 dimensions. Number one, a proper buffer relative to the rating agency capital required to maintain our rating. That buffer meant to protect us against adverse events of multiple kinds in any one period. So we always first make sure that we're maintaining that buffer. Second, we then think what are the opportunities for our shareholders that are present in the current market to put any excess to that buffer to work. And then third, if we cannot find sufficient exciting opportunities and maintain that excess position, we would think about returning that excess to shareholders. But generally, we have found that to be most efficiently done through share repurchases. Although we have used some of it, as we have -- as Peter mentioned, for reducing our debt ratio to produce a stronger franchise. In this period, as respects those 3, we're obviously -- given that we've been repurchasing, we're obviously comfortable with our overall capital position. And I think probably commentators have it right that we are in a very healthy position. We like the flexibility that affords. Second, the only thing I tried to signal early on is as we see the markets improving in the opportunities, we would want to make sure that we had room for growth so that we could do all 3 things, as Peter said, and I believe we can. And that is maintain the buffer that we expect to have, reduce our debt ratio, go ahead and invest in growth where we find returns attractive and repositioning for what we see as an improving market. And then repurchase shares as the board sees fit. And while we never comment on our future actions, I think my comments on directing you toward sizing properly, those future actions probably gives you something to go on.", "Peter R. Porrino", "This is Pete. The only I would add there is -- on the share repurchase thing is, and I'm sure you realize, that we do not as a matter of course, preannounce when we're going to do share repurchases.", "Michael G. Paisan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Yes, that makes sense. I guess, along those lines, my last question is, do you have any sense in terms of what types of price increases you may need in order to get to, all else being equal, get to a return level, an ROE level next year, that would be comparable to what you would get in buying your share at 70% of book?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Yes. It's really -- first of all, let me talk about the nature of what I'm seeing in the marketplace. This marketplace, right now, reminds me very much of '98, '99. You may remember then that the first signs of a market change were at hand. But it would -- I would describe that market change or that phase of the market change as a management-led change. In other words, there was no big events in '98 or '99 to speak of. What was really going on was managements were looking at their budgets for the next year. They were looking at the positions of their balance sheets and they were saying, \"Enough is enough. We're going to have to start driving rate into this book.\" You'll recall that the rate achievement during those periods was relatively modest, and then it was accelerated dramatically, of course, by the completely unexpected events of 9/11. In this case, I think we are similarly in a managements-driven nascent [ph] turn. It's not full and broad yet, it's uneven but it is clearly gaining steam as the year ends. To really gain the benefit of that kind of turn, you can't just wait until there's been multiple years of it. You have to enjoy the compounding effect yourself. So you've got to be making capacity for the growth implicit, even if it isn't quite at the levels you would you yet like it or need it to be. In answer to your direct that question, I think there's a very, very simple way to look at this, that doesn't require sophisticated modeling or anything else. If you step back from it and you consider this investment environment, these combined ratios to solve for the kinds of returns that should satisfy investors need to be roughly around 90. And they're roughly around 100. You do the math. It's a pretty simple rate, it's just more complicated than that because it will compound over time and depend on, of course, a mix of business, questions we've been moving toward shorter tail lines, there's a lot of other variables that can affect it or accelerate it. But that's a pretty simple way to think about it and, at the highest level, that's how I think about it.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Donna Halverstadt from Goldman Sachs.", "Donna Halverstadt - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "How about another question on capital? You have done a lot to simplify and evolve your capital structure and to bring financial leverage toward that of peers. But looking foreward and assuming a perfect world of no restrictions, economics or otherwise in getting from point A to point B, what do you view as the optimal capital structure for the XL tomorrow across 4 key components. Specifically, what's your optimal allocation to, in terms of percent senior debt percent hybrids, percent regular preferred and percent common. So I'm interested in the composition of total capital not just the blended leverage ratio.", "Peter R. Porrino", "Donna, it's Pete. I'm glad to talk about that offline, it's probably a little more detailed than we'd go into on this call. I think what we said before is that we want to see us to get down to where our peer group is. And that would be total debt plus preferred at about 21% of total capital. And what we said is that we would do that over time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.", "Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Mike, you made the comparison to it feeling a lot like 1998. The one thing I think that's left out of that equation of course, there were huge losses building in 1998 that didn't come to fruition until a few years later. There's been a lot of losses over the last 2 years in property, so I'm not surprised to hear that property rates are up. I'm wondering are there losses for this industry brewing in the other lines that are being affected or would this be the first time that we've seen rates anticipate loss cost rather than technically trail them ?", "Michael S. McGavick", "I think it's a grind to be clear. I think, as I commented in my opening remarks, as I study the entire industry and particular results, it strikes us here at XL that a number of our competitors are really running out of the favorable results from the early part of the decade. And as that comes true, it's going to flip over and they're going to have really difficult environments, especially given the yield out there. So it's the new variable that makes it different from what was -- well, I suppose there's a couple of variables to make it different from '98, '99. First of all, you have fewer management teams than you had back then. I think that's a plus for the industry. Second, I think you are running out of the reserve environment that has -- that the industry has enjoyed heretofore, but the biggest is the reinvestment yield rates. I mean, it just so changes the game. And it was only really, if you're paying attention, I think, for 0.5 year or more, you've known, it was be a protracted event. But somehow, I don't know why. Psychologically, these things happen. But if you think about all the comments that were made by the central bankers during the course of this quarter and you think about the euro prices, and you think about the U.S., it just seems to have locked in everybody's recognition that this is not a short-term phenomena and you better stop acting like it is. I just think, when you add all of that to the stew, and then managements have to sit down at the end of year and produce a plan that is acceptable to their shareholders and their board, I think that just creates a different environment for behavior. And then you look at an industry that has seen such a huge portion of its capital wiped out by catastrophes during the first 3 quarters of the year, I just think it creates an entirely different environment. Even the brokers who, to their credit vis-a-vis their customers, like to talk down these events are finally conceding that there is something going on. And I think it's a very, very real if still in it's infancy and it's still less than will be required over time to put the industry on a proper footing.", "Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And just a little bit more depth, in terms of -- you said the rates are about 2% excluding D&O. To what extent are loss affected-lines driving that? I mean to what extent is property which clearly aligns this experienced losses? I probably would mention that's up more significantly. Is design color there sort of subsegment, that 2% number?", "Michael S. McGavick", "I'm going to ask Dave to kind of break it up by the 4 main blocks of business we operate. But I would just start by saying we're positive in specialty lines, we're -- except for U.S. D&O, we're positive in many of our professional lines. And when we talk about an average overall rate number, we're really, I think, again, I think it masks the actual acceleration. We do our tear-down reviews of the performance of all of our businesses at the end of the quarter and before this call. And the kind of rate we're seeing in some of our sublines gets pretty exciting and tells us a lot about what's going on. And we're seeing that of course at the comments that Jamie has made earlier on the reinsurance side. But Dave maybe you could break it out because it will show that it's not just the property block at all.", "David B. Duclos", "Sure. Josh, let me start with giving you some perspective on the 4 business groups, as Mike alluded to. For Q3, IPC, which is our International Property Casualty operation, which is predominantly, it's actually almost split 50-50 between property and casualty, it's increase was 2.4%. North America Property Casualty, which is an augmation of different businesses but it does include property, was up 3.2%. Specialty was up 1.5%. And then professional, as we alluded to, the most intense competition now was down almost 4%. So those were the 4 business groups, but underneath that, let me give you some color and address specifically your question about property and then I'll see if Jamie has anything to add from a reinsurance perspective. Bermuda property, I'll just give you a little flavor from what's happened the last 3 quarters. And again, Bermuda property, would be our excess property capability. In the first quarter, we still were seeing rates that were decreasing as much as 5%. Second quarter, that improved to a plus-4, third quarter that's up 12%. So excess property, out of Bermuda, has moved almost 20 points. Now again, there are some specific accounts that influenced that outcome, but that gives you a little bit of a feel. Our North America property book sort of the same trend line. First quarter, we were still seeing negative price. Second quarter, it about leveled off. And then in the third quarter, we actually saw a 4% rate increase. International Property, again the same thing, minus-3% first quarter, 4% up the second quarter, 6% up the third quarter. So we are seeing increases, where we're seeing losses. And I would say that probably what's driving some of those increases is in fact, the cat exposure. The other lines, in the range in terms rate, price changes anywhere from -- Professional is the only one that's still down consistently. The rest of the lines are probably went from 0 to low double digits right now. And each month, for the last 6 months, have been building. And I've said this for the last couple of previous or preceeding quarters. October 1, looks very encouraging. Again, it's a stronger rate than we achieved in the second quarter and third quarter. Jamie, anything to add from the reinsurance perspective?", "James Veghte", "No, obviously, we're not in a sort of daily traded environment. But at our last major renewal period, I previously reported we saw high single-digit risk adjusted improvement in the short tail cat market at July 1. We go into January 1 fully expecting similar improvements in the cat market, even for non-affected geographies from the natural catastrophe losses. And will feed off of the improvement in the primary market that Dave describes on our Casualty portfolio.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Two questions. One, just a clarification. I think you mentioned there were $25 million gain in your investment manager affiliates. Is that correct or was that a realized gain?", "Sarah Elizabeth Street", "This is Sarah, that was actually a realized gain, that we sold one of our affiliate stakes.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So that's not in the operating earnings number?", "Sarah Elizabeth Street", "Yes, no, it's [indiscernible] the earnings.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And the second one, Mike, could you give us a sense of kind of what P&Ls are looking at, like, right now? It was 12.7%, was your North America or U.S. at the end of the last quarter, you guys are continuing to push those pretty good growth in the property areas. How close do you get in that 15% level? And then I guess also, are you willing to take a 15% perhaps of the 20% as you continue to take advantage of opportunities in the property markets ?", "Michael S. McGavick", "First of all, we are continuing to grow our exposure because we do find some of those markets appropriately priced. I'm going to ask Jamie to comment on the specific level at this time. I know we have that in mind. Whether we'll change the limits or not, we constantly review our limits in all aspects. From the appropriate buffer to hold relative to our rating, to the appropriate level of exposure to have at any point in time. And I can just say to you that, certainly, in the discussions that we've had with our board, I think our board is very anxious and understanding that this is a relative competition and that at the end, while we like to run our firm with a appropriate dose of conservatism, especially given our history, recent history. That said, we're well aware that at certain times, when the market starts moving hard, you've got to be a participant and we're well aware that that's the right attitude with which to approach any changes in limit structures going forward. But I have none to announce at this time.", "James Veghte", "Brian, I think we mentioned on the last call that we were still analyzing the impact of version 11, which is our risk management tool. I think you'll see in the Q when it comes out that hour revised number after that review is no 13.7%. Our P&Ls were significantly impacted by the model change. Having said that, we had made adjustments to version 10 significant adjustments particularly around storm surge, which offset the impact of version 11. So we're now planning for 2012, our current Tier 1 outside is 15% of shareholders' equity. We haven't made a decision to adjust that upwards yet but we're very comfortable with our risk management position.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "A couple of questions. First is, on the volatility in the market, the potential impact for the fourth quarter, do you have any visibility of what that could mean for you? It's hard to analyze because you have different strategies in these investment managers.", "Sarah Elizabeth Street", "I mean it is hard because flowing through that line we had 3 items. We have our alternative portfolio, which is on a 1-month lag. So it's purely September that's not being picked up. August was already in the numbers. We generally perform better than the hedge fund industry as a whole because we're position in a down market. And that's certainly based on estimates seems to be the case. So I wouldn't expect too significant a number. It depends on what happens. The investment managers and the private investments, it's too difficult to estimate at this point.", "Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. I guess, secondly, back to the underwriting side, you talked about professional lines being the one area where you're still seeing decreases. And obviously, lower interest rates given that's a medium to long-tail business. That puts additional pressure on returns here yet you grew in that business. And it just doesn't quite -- why you would be growing that business given those 2 pressures that you cited.", "Peter R. Porrino", "Jay, let me take that. We're actually not growing in our U.S. Professional D&O book. We've got some growth in international where we see a slightly different pricing competition environment. But actually, the one area where we have seen a reduction in terms of premium is in fact, our D&O standard book in the US. So we're conscious of the long-term interest rate impact that you alluded to. That's why even though the combined still look pretty attractive on a relative basis, the team there has scaled back in terms of some of their writings. I would also add that we have a couple of books in Europe that are getting some strong rate that's generating some of the premium increase as well. But in terms of new business, professional in the quarter was probably one of the least amounts that we written both specialty and Professional show decreases as a result of the competition.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike Sorensky [ph] with Credit Suisse.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "First, regarding the pretty healthy top line growth. Thinking going forward, I believe you expended the U.S. property retentions to 750 recently. And I also believe you're going to lose some crop Insurance adjustment in '12. I was curious if those are items we should be thinking about going forward.", "Michael S. McGavick", "Yes. First, with respect to the U.S. Property, we increased the limits we offer, not the retentions that we take. So I would not be overly aggressive in modeling that especially as you think about it in terms of net earned premium. It's really more about what we're able to offer our clients and the expertise we bring. They want us to be able to offer higher gross limits and we've worked out a program to do so. But I wouldn't focus on it as a significant net or in premium item. Jamie?", "James Veghte", "On the crop, you'll recall we -- when the MGA that we've been dealing with for 10 years was sold, an agreement was reached with the new owner that in exchange for them being a significant reinsurer of us in 2011, we would have the option to reinsure them in a significant way in 2012, we've made no decision around that option yet.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Okay. I think lastly, Mike, you talked about earlier the 9 loss cost trends that you continue to reserve at \"more normalized trends\". I'm just curious, at what point do the 9 loss cost experience, what point has become a trend that is factored into underwriting assumptions?", "Michael S. McGavick", "No, our actuaries, and of course, our chief reserving actuary is sitting right next to me ready to kick me if I get this wrong. But we encourage our reserving actuaries to be very conservative in their view. It is the devil to be wrong and optimistic early. So we just are very patient to wait for them to come through. Now, one of the reasons that I'm so bullish about the progress you're making in the underwriting actions we've taken is we do view ourselves, we do have indicators that we view for ourselves of what we think about what's going on. We just don't drop it to the bottom line until we're sure about what's going on. So that's one of the reasons we talk optimistically about where things are going because we're looking at early indicators in terms of loss cost trends. but we won't take it until we are convinced. And to give you an example, in the much discussed on this call, U.S. D&O space, the loss cost trends continue to be really impressive. I mean, given all of the worry and all of the angst that we all have towards that line. And even with the some of the settlements that we've seen in the recent period. When we look at them as against the whole of the sub-prime events and your made-off events and all that has followed, we continued to see it playing out, very favorably. But we're simply not going to react too quickly. And when you factor in our view that we should be very conservative with respect to inflation, in the medium term, that too weighs on us. And if we're wrong, to the conservative side, the shareholders will benefit on that over time and we simply feel we can sleep better at night with this disposition and we're just not going to change it. We just aren't going to overreact to the short-term positive trends and even as they turn into medium-term positive trends. We're just unwilling to overreact. We've seen too many good companies burned by positive attitude before.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Randy Binner with FBR.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "I'm just trying to isolate kind of a core run rate number for the quarter. And so obviously, the affiliate income Cat losses and FX should be taken out. I think the 50 million large property loss would be normalized out as well. Is there anything else in all these conversations that we should kind of pull out to get to more of a run-rate number?", "Michael S. McGavick", "I appreciate the question. This is a difficult kind of noisy quarter, and obviously, we're trying to signal a number of things, including a lot of optimism in the general sense. But a real awareness around a couple of isolated underwriting areas that we still feel real urgency about. We just feel an obligation to communicate about that directly. But the one other piece that I would isolate on is you do have the pattern of reserving and prior year development that we have encouraged you to remember. Just to be very blunt about it, when I look at the models that analysts use for the quarter, I see a lot of plugged-in numbers around PYD. That would indicate to me a likelihood that people have smoothed over the year rather than remember that, generally it's going to be kind of a second and fourth quarter event. So that to me would be another thing I'd be isolating on. And then more trivially, we did have a better quarter in terms of expenses because we've recognized that our compensation costs will be lower this year given all that's gone on. And we would want you to be remembering that we are making investments in the underlying business so that we can gain in a leveraged way from the market we see coming. And the first quarters, the first 2 quarters were more representative than I think was the third. Those are the only things I would add to your list.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "So on expenses, it's more representative on the over the corporate expense lines collectively than what we saw in 3Q?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Yes.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "One other quick one, if I can. This is a follow-up to an earlier question. But as it relates to the yield on the investment portfolio and how that ties into how you price the business. I don't know if I quite heard the response. But is that something that's actively going into the pricing process? The yield on the portfolio. And if so, is it assuming kind of the current yield environment or is it something that gets reset periodically?", "Michael S. McGavick", "No, priced to the new money yield rates. We do not price to the -- so we get a double dose of conservatism here. We're pricing to the actual yield rates we are experiencing as influenced by the new yield rates. And at the same time, we are reserving to what we believe will be a return to a more normalized yield environment. So you've got 2 doses of conservatism at work and we believe that's the only way to run the business. Now the actual pricing that's experienced, that's a negotiated process. But that's how our models go into effect as we discover what our appropriate pricing should be.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Vinay Misquith from Evercore Company.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "The first question is on the ROE that you are getting on your new business. Just curious what that is. Just trying to figure out, so what's more attractive: growing the business or buying back stock ?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Again, Vinay, it's not quite that simple because you don't take -- first of all, we don't break it out in that way. Well, I know that we believe we are remixing to new business to a more profitable overall portfolio. That is and over-time view. You don't take -- you have to take it as, where would you be when it's a mature business? For example, when we enter a new line of business, because in the early days, the expense ratio of the new line of business overwhelms the result. So you can only have the confidence to march into a new line. When you look at it, where will it be when it's developed? And what are the opportunities given what you see in that particular pricing environment? When you talk about new business in an existing line of business, we're constantly trying to underwrite our way towards a better mix of business. You've seen us grow our short-tail lines, you've seen us decline in our longer-tail lines. We think this is perfectly appropriate in a low interest rate environment as we are currently experiencing. You take all of that together and you say, what is the book of business you are building? What are the opportunities you are building for your shareholders? Over the medium term, not the short term? Because that's the book of business we're really building, is what's the earnings power of the bloc? And so it just isn't as simple as a point in time what does a share repurchase look like. Well, trading as we are, it's not hard to do the math. But that's very attractive. But you can't throw everything to that. Or you're going to fail to position the book of business for the superior turns we think are ahead. And that would be a failure on our part in terms of managing your investment. So it really isn't as simple a question as the way you framed it. And that's not how we think about it. That said, I think Peter's already said it quite correctly. We can afford the 3 major capital activities that are going on. Bringing down our leverage ratio, growing our business, and as we see fit and as the board directs purchasing shares.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Fair enough. The second question, was just a numbers question on the operating expense, just a clarification. You mentioned that that should be looked at similar to the first quarter and the second quarter. So would that be for all the subsegment operating expense or is it only for the corporate operating expense?", "Peter R. Porrino", "That would be across all the lines.", "Operator", "Your next question comes Steve Edison [ph] from Addage Capitol [ph].", "Unknown Analyst - ", "I just have 2 quick follow-ups hopefully. First, can we clarify on the large losses in the international Property. What specifically is driving that? And you sort of hinted that this was something recurring?", "Michael S. McGavick", "No, with respect to recurring, if I have confused, I want to be clear. This was 1 event that doesn't have a recurring feature. In fact, if it has a future feature, that there will be subrogation and that subrogation could lessen our exposure to that loss. I'll ask Dave in a moment to give a little more color on that 1 loss. When I was observing, is you go back through the past 3 years, you'll find in '08, and then again in '10 and '11 some, we've described often, an unusual degree of large losses. And we're just saying that we don't view that as an acceptable answer. We think that in general, particularly we've isolated that particularly that IPC property book has been responsible for too high a number of those. And we think that is correctable. And that's not a new thought but it's one that we wanted to make sure we were discussing with urgency on this call. Dave, could you talk about the one event in this quarter?", "David B. Duclos", "Jay [ph], this is certainly what we would consider a bit of an anomaly from a loss standpoint. But we sustained a large property loss due to an explosion in an adjacent noninsured location. As Mike alluded to, we will certainly pursue subrogation vigorously and the loss reserve we booked this quarter, if anything, will just be positively impacted going forward. But the point there is it doesn't have any reflection on the quality of the book of business.", "Michael S. McGavick", "I would just add one thing. While we've experienced this trail turbulence and while were not accepting it as something you should expect into the future, I would still observe that, that book of business historically, has been very profitable. So we want to make share that we address it in a way that reflects the urgency of having books of business performing well as we go into what we see as better pricing. But also, we won't approach it softly. The historic performance of the block has been quite good.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "That was my concern, was by recurring it seems there's there seems to have this trend of large losses. And I don't know if there's any underlying pattern you've seen or there was just a long string of bad luck.", "Michael S. McGavick", "I sure wish I could say that there was an underlying pattern because that would be to get after. But we're just saying, we don't accept it. We don't say, \"Gee, that's the way the brags [ph] bounce. We think that we can do better.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "And then my other one is just to this question of when is the right time to start growing and do you need to be there? And stop me if I'm misrepresenting the way I heard you explain it. But the way I understood it was, you feel you sort of have to be there early, if you will? And maybe the market doesn't turn for, let's take a number, 2 years. That the opportunities are going to go to the ones who are already established in those markets rather than people who try to jump in at the last minute. Is that a fair representation before I proceed?", "Michael S. McGavick", "No, I think that's a good thought. In the end, if you think you have a line of business that can produce good over-cycle returns, you want to be as established as possible if there is an inflection point in the market. And again, I've not said there's an inflection point, there's just an improving trend that we're very encouraged by and that we think makes a lot of sense. We can explain why managements are behaving this way. We think that gives it a sustainability over time. And just the simple thought is, the better-positioned you are when that happens, the better you're going to do during that period. I want to add one other thought though. The correcting books of business takes time. And I got a question earlier that I thought expressed an appropriate impatience. I have an impatience too. But the reality is, fixing a block of business during a time of positive rate is a heck of a lot of easier than with the wind in your face. And that's one of the things that makes me kind of excited about where we are. But the sooner you get that behind you and can focus on the future, the better off any book of business is. And across XL's 36 book of business, boy, I'm sure happy that we are where were we are for the vast majority of them and there's a couple that we've signaled we're focused on.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Can I challenge the premise a little bit that we need to be there early? Because I guess I look at past market turns, it seems that people who got there early take the worst losses. When things get bad, before it finally hit bottom. And then they get gun-shy about growing. When the tables have turned they don't take advantage of the market leadership because they feel burned. And the people who end up winning are the new startups like XL in '85 or Arch and Axis last time. And the people who are established, in some cases they have, but it's really not uniform. They're showing a number of cases where the established players don't participate to the extent the new players do, and maybe it would actually be more prudent to wait and try to be sort of secondary player in these lines and then jump in once you've seen the turn.", "Michael S. McGavick", "Let me take what you said and refine a degree further. Let divide it into a few. [indiscernible] It's something we've studied a lot. It's one thing when you get a turn that is of such a magnitude and crisis that it requires an entirely reinvented marketplace. That's what XL and our Bermuda brother did in '85. That's a really different thing than what we're dealing with here. With what we're dealing with here, the question isn't whether when to put your teams on the field. The question is waiting to tell them to go nuts. And the reality is, I wouldn't tell any of our new teams to go nuts right now. This is a time to get yourself ready. You can establish a book of business in a disciplined way during this uneven phase. But there's a number of phenomena that work for you. First, broker-driven markets always love a new entrant, and if that new entrant is smart and has an established reputation and relationships, they can drive some profitable business to them because the brokers and the clients are encouraging new entrants. So there is a period during which you can get an unfair share of better business early in the establishment of a team, as long as that team has the right kind of track record and personality. What comes next is the important thing. And I would tell you, I've noticed some of our best underwriting competition thinking about this pretty smartly and I've seen some do it not very smart. There are 2 approaches. One is, accept that, not team may not have, outside of that initial establishing activity, a lot of to do for a little while. And they'll have to bear higher expenses for a while. And that's okay. And that's okay. I won't go through -- you would know some of the companies that we around here really respect and you've seen them put really high-quality teams at work. Teams that we back in our reinsurance programs and they aren't writing a lot yet, and that's okay. The question is, when do you take the leash off? When do you push the pedal? And that comes as markets take shape. So it doesn't really matter if you hit it. You can't time a market perfectly. None of us are prescient enough to do that. So you take it when you can get it in terms of talent. You accept the higher expenses if you can't write a lot yet and you just keep getting ready. If you do it that way, you don't get burned. What I have seen and what you've seen and what we won't do in XL is burn our way into a market thinking we've timed the market turn right. Those are the guys that get themselves sick and then get burned. We aren't going to do that. We haven't been doing that. And we won't do that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Cliff Gallant with KBW.", "Cliff Gallant - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Just a quick one on, you mentioned the D&O book that you had great recent results. And a lot of things of course can change pretty quickly. And I was wondering what your outlook is going forward in the near term? Particularly with all the market volatility we've had and we, of course, get MF [ph] Global and Energy this morning.", "Michael S. McGavick", "Sure. The D&O marketplace, the pricing has been under pressure. But the pricing has been under pressure because the results in the early part of the decade were so extraordinary that clients and brokers have properly challenged whether the pricing is right. And then of course, the pricing stayed strong because you have these huge events that people rightly assumed would lead to huge class-style losses. But as we have talked about earlier in the call, losses of the magnitude that were anticipated by what went on in '08 and '09 and, to a lesser degree, more recently, simply haven't materialized to that same level. So I think the market is continuing to challenge whether we found the right appropriate clearing price yet. And I think I'm not bothered by -- in fact, I really like what our U.S. D&O underwriters are doing. We tend to be, we tend to shine when markets get into distress, we tend to shine when there's dislocation. Things like the event this morning, increased dislocation or perceptions of dislocation. We like this marketplace. And the fact that our guys up there are shrinking a little bit, are accepting that rate is going down kind of in the 3%, 4% range, 5% range. I think that's fine. I think they're really -- they are hitting their various levers, I think, with great art. And I'm very confident where they are. I'm comfortable with where that book heads over time. The fact that we're losing a little top line in that particular space makes sense to me. The fact that we're losing a little bit of rate makes sense to me. The fact that we're being conservative on reacting to the short-term trends in reserving make sense to me. That group I have an enormous amount of confidence in.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "You brought up the Thai loss as one of the 4 factors for the quarter. And I wanted to just -- certainly it's been a difficult year. Is this a -- is this an Australian flood loss type of a thing, is this a Japanese earthquake? Is this a New Zealand quake? Is it Irene? I mean how do we bracket this thing in the early days? I know it's premature.", "Michael S. McGavick", "I apologize. I tried to -- I suppose I tried to encourage this question not to be asked earlier, not that we shouldn't ask it. We really don't know enough to say. But I just observed it's a very broad event, and it's going to be meaningful for the industry. How it'll fall in terms of individual losses is extremely hard to predict and we certainly have nothing to say on that at this stage. Although, I would point out that so much of the flooding has been in industrial parks, and when you get into flooding in industrial parks, that's where you get those kind of pinpoint losses that certainly I would expect to show up in our insurance book, because we're specific clients, specific locations. And if one gets hit in the flood, it's going to get hit. But I don't have any thing other than to add that I do think that there's been a lot of talk about BI [ph] losses just as there was a lot of talk of BI [ph] losses in Japan in the earthquake and tsunami. And there, I continue to see less reality for losses than I see talk of losses. Maybe that's a need for the market and a gap that the market needs to be innovative to solve. But that's so far been true across both events. But we'll see, we'll see. I just wanted to make sure no one was missing that one because it is a big deal.", "Operator", "And I'm showing no further questions. I'll turn the call back over the speakers.", "Michael S. McGavick", "We've obviously gone over the usual length of time, but given the complexity of the quarter, I thought that was completely appropriate. We appreciate that we may, at least in terms of the broad questions for the group, have exhausted you at this stage and I know that David and the rest of our people are certainly available for follow-up questions as they come up. Again, as I opened, I thought it was another of these interesting quarters, there was some good, there were some difficult. But in the end, we are extremely excited about where we see the markets, we're working hard to be prepared and fully engaged in that effort. And I just want to say to my colleagues and our clients and brokers who are listening around the world, XL ends the quarter a stronger company, and more focused and with greater urgency about what we've got to do, and I'm excited to be representing our shareholders at this time.", "Operator", "Thank you.

I will now turn the call over to David Radulski, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.", "David Radulski - Director of Investor Relations", "Thank you, Laurie. Good morning and welcome to XL Capital's first quarter 2008 earnings conference call. This call is being simultaneously webcast on XL's website, at www.xlcapital.com. Also on our website you will find last night's press release, our financial supplement and a webcast presentation.", "On our call today, Brian O'Hara, XL Capital's President, CEO and Acting Chairman, will offer opening remarks. Brian Nocco, our CFO, will review our financial results, followed by Sarah Street, XL's Chief Investment Officer, will discuss results in our investment portfolio. Henry Keeling, our Chief Operating Officer, will review current market conditions.", "We will open it up for your questions before returning to Brian O'Hara for closing remarks and for his introduction of XL's CEO-Designate, Mike McGavick. While Mike will be making some comments he will not be participating in Q&A. As you recall, it's not our practice to update guidance on a quarterly basis so nothing today should be construed as updating or reaffirming previously provided guidance.", "Certain of the matters we will discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our most recent Annual Report on Form-10-K, our quarterly reports on Form-10-Q and other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.", "Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise. And with that, I will turn it over to Brian O'Hara.", "Brian O'Hara - Acting Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, David and good morning everyone. Before turning to our review of the first quarter, I would like to make a few comments of our management of the SCA situation. We remain intensely focused on the resolution of this issue. We have added to our strong team of advisors and have placed two XL nominated Directors on SCA's Board. Continuing our commit to transparency, on March 27 we posted to our website updated SCA related exposures and we have made no changes to our assessment of ultimate losses for our SCA related reinsurance or guarantees since the filing of our 10-K.", "Many of the same forces driving market uncertainty regarding SCA have also impacted our investment portfolio and Sarah Street will be providing an update on the portfolio and related activities.", "Turning to our underlying business; our dual platforms of insurance and reinsurance continue to demonstrate solid performance. The first quarter of 2008 was quite active, with global property loss events and individual risk losses totaling in excess of $10 billion. But thanks to our underwriting discipline, we expect the exposure to these events to be less than 1.5% of industry losses. We believe this to be a testament to our Property & Casualty Risk Management practices.", "Finally we intend to publish our second annual Global Loss Triangle report during the week of May 4. As was the case with last year's Triangles, our intend is to provide continued transparency and we welcome your feedback. And now with Brian Nocco for a review of our financial results, Brian?", "Brian Nocco - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Brian, and good morning everyone. Turning to our summary of financial results on slide four; operating income was $1.57 per share for the quarter, when annualized to our operating ROE to 12.9%, as compared to $3.01 and 22.3% respectively for the prior year quarter. Our Property & Casualty underwriting profit of $108 million reflect the generally softer market conditions and active quarter for property losses, Henry will talk about this further. Income from both Investment Fund and Investment Management Affiliates were down from last year's exceptionally high levels which Sarah will discuss.", "Our total operating expenses of $264 million for the quarter were lower than last year's $281 million when SCA's expenses were included. On a like-for-liked basis, expenses were essentially flat with the prior year. We reported a foreign exchange loss of $68 million on our income statement. This was largely due to the weakening of the US dollar and sterling against other currencies. While we attempt to moderate FX income statement volatility, our primary focus continues to be on managing the economics. In this regard, FX had a positive impact of $30 million in capital in the quarter.", "As Brian indicated, we have analyzed and posted updated and expanded SCA related data, and are committed to do continuing disclosure on transparency related to this exposure.", "We have made no changes to our assessment of ultimate losses for our SCA related reinsurance for guarantee since the filing of our 10-K. Accordingly, the only entries in this regard have been for the accretion of the discount on loss reserves established at year end, for which we recorded a charge of $5 million in the quarter: We wrote-off our remaining investments in SCA and Primus at year end, and have included no share of earnings for either this quarter.", "The paid to incurred ratio for our P&C operations is 110% for the current quarter. Excluding the impacts of the favorable year prior year development, paid losses related to the 2005 hurricanes and recoveries recorded related to the Lloyd's adverse development cover, the paid to incurred ratio is 92%.", "Our fully diluted book value of $50.29 per share at year end declined to $46.11 per share as unrealized losses on our investment portfolio more than offset our net income. In these challenging conditions with extraordinarily thin market liquidity, we successfully raised $4 billion of cash from our fixed income portfolio to repay the muni-GIC liabilities trigged by SCA's rating down grades.", "We have developed a contingency plan and executed with minimum financial impact on XL. The related asset sales resulted in a small gain during the quarter. We now have only have $11 million of muni-GIC liabilities outstanding. And now to our Chief Investment Officer, Sarah Street to review our investment portfolio and results.", "Sarah E. Street - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Thank you, Brian, and good morning. Today I am going to cover three areas. First I'll review the market for the quarter and its marked-to-market impact on our portfolio. Second, I'll discuss the asset sales that we made to pay down the muni-GIC liabilities and finally I'll review investment earnings for the quarter.", "So to begin; the market turbulence of fourth quarter 2007 gained further momentum during the first quarter of 2008. It was a brutal period in the compartment triggered by increased concerns about the US economy, massive de-leveraging by financial institutions and an enormous flight to quality with sell off of risk assets without regards to economic value. While the overall tone of the market has improved somewhat in recent weeks, large [inaudible] of store remains with the capital markets due to ongoing recessionary and housing concerns.", "On slide eight, we show the decline in the quarter of our net-unrealized position, before tax of $1.1 billion. Approximately $130 million of this decline in our unrealized position is due to the impact of the dollars declined which was included in the overall book value impact previously noted by Brian. Not surprisingly, given the asset price erosion that we witnessed across all credit sectors of fixed income, this was a significant decline.", "Falling government rates in both the US and abroad positively impacted our net-unrealized position. However, what we've seen since mid 2007, these movements were more than offset by the impact of corporate and structured credit spreads. The main difference so far in 2008 has been that the spread widening in corporate and particularly the financials have had a much larger driver than in previous quarters.", "Our aggregate holdings and financials are $6.6 billion with an average rating of A+. We also saw further price decline in mortgage related assets. The deleveraging of financial institutions and hedge funds led to significant amounts of forced liquidations which had a real negative pricing impact. The Fed actions on Bear Stearns making the discount window available to brokerage firms certainly stabilized markets towards the ends of March. This was most transparent in the tightening that we saw in most credit and mortgage indices.", "However cash markets have not reacted as quickly, given the lack of liquidity in those markets and spreads were still at their wide at the end of the quarter for many assets. We continue to be comfortable with the quality of our portfolio and watch [inaudible] and principally reflect a liquidity in the market, we do not believe our remaining impairments are permanent.", "The second area I'll discuss which Brian previously mentioned is the repayment of $4 billion of muni-GICs during the quarter. The repayment of these obligations was funned by the sale of assets in both muni-GIC segregated portfolios as well as the general investment portfolio. Our approach was to avoid selling assets at the low intrinsic value, or those with excessive liquidity costs. As a result, we have retained many of the topical assets originally purchased for the muni-GIC facilities, and selling in today's markets which where pricing reflects poor sales with both un-economic and also inappropriate given the fact that we have the ability to hold them until markets stabilize.", "As a number of the US assets have floating rate, by retaining these, our P&C general dollar portfolio duration declined which we feel will help protect book value if interest rates rise.", "The trade-off was at the yield on this portfolio declined by ten to 15 basis points, although it will be more responsive to increases should rates rise. When we weighed the current yield give outs against the book value benefit of shorter duration in the US, shorter duration won.", "You will see the changes in our portfolio mix in the financial supplement. Our overall credit sector allocation is relatively consistent after the impact of sales and Marked-to-markets. Most notable was a decline in our structured credit securities as we use many of these to fund the muni-GIC liabilities. Our average credit rating remains at AA.", "Moving to our financial results, on slide nine, we have summarized the net losses... net realized losses on investments for $102 million which was driven by charges for other than temporary impairments for $115 million including $49 million related to Topical assets and $30 million of sales and for losses for asset sales we expect to make in the next couple of quarters to satisfy $900 million of maturing funding agreements.", "Last May we announced that we would exit this business and these maturities marked good progress towards that goal.", "On slide ten, you will see that our total net investment income for the quarter was $499 million. Of this net investment income from our primary P&C operation, excluding structured products was $308 million. This declined by $19 million relative to fourth quarter 2007, principally due to lower rates and the slightly lower asset base. Turning to slide 11, net income from investment fund affiliates was $12 million for the quarter and was principally driven by a flat return in our term sheet [ph] portfolio.", "The markets during the quarter were and continue to be in March challenging for alternative strategies given the extreme volatility and the overall pull back of credit availability. Our fund results reflect December to February returns. We are pleased with our performance relative to equities and the results further reinforce the strong risk adjusted returns of this asset class.", "Before I turnover to Henry to discuss our insurance and Reinsurance Operations, I'd like to emphasize the depth of analysis we've undertake to validate the quality of our portfolio and the appropriateness of our positions going forward. We have clearly felt the pain of the most credit markets in history. However we believe financial stability will ultimately return and when it does we are well-positioned. Henry?", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Thank you, Sarah. The strength of XL's global franchise again exhibited itself in a quarter with cat activity and individual risk losses significantly higher than the seasonal average. Published losses list... publishes sources list 19 separate loss events that produced individual risk losses of greater than $100 million each, totaling over $5.5 billion. In addition there were various tornado losses in the US and another large winter storm loss in Europe known as Emma, making it the third year in a row that Europe has suffered a storm loss in excess of $2 billion. In total we are aware of 27 risk and/or cat events in Q1 exceeding $100 million per occurrence and $10 billion in the aggregate.", "Due to disciplined and selective underwriting, our involvement was limited to just three of these accounts on the insurance side. Total estimated losses from both segments as Brian O'Hara mentioned earlier, are less than 1.5% of the industry estimated losses for these events.", "The quarter source spending even more time with our customers and brokers, emphasizing our commitments to them through our customer service and communications efforts, which have been and will continue to be pillars of XL's business franchise. While there will undoubtedly be some impact to our writings, especially new business as we see the effects of rating agency actions on our business, but we see these as remaining very manageable as our customers and brokers understand the strength of our core business operations.", "Turning to the insurance segment; gross premiums written increased by 3.1% year-over-year. The main drivers for this were positive foreign exchange movements, favorable customer retention and selective writing of new business. These were partially offset by the impact of declining market pricing and the run off of ICAP business. We saw an increase in long-term agreement premiums, largely in Europe, where we also achieved better than expected pricing on our January 1 renewal book. Net premiums earned were down 4.1%, primarily due to an increase in seeded premiums related to the purchase of an adverse development cover which closed out the open years of certain of our Lloyds operations.", "The insurance segment loss ratio for the first quarter was seven-points higher than the previous year quarter after adjusting for prior year development in both quarters and benefit from the adverse development cover I just mentioned. Approximately four-point of this difference relates to an increase in natural peril property losses with the remainder primarily attributable to the impact of premium rate decreases and an anticipated increase in loss activity in professional lines that I will discuss later.", "Favorable prior year development in the quarter was $17 million with $13 million counting from property and other short tail lines. The amount of net prior year reserve releases was consistent with Q1 2007.", "Market conditions generally followed recent trends, with early indication showing insurance premium rates on renewals down on average by approximately 7%. We also saw strong renewal retention ratios of just over 90% across our core Property & Casualty lines reflective of the strong loyalty of our European client base of the January 1 renewals. And, of course, our insurance segment results do not included the results from ITAU XL, which we report in from affiliates. Our share of the premiums from this Brazilian joint venture was approximately $73 million for the quarter.", "In reinsurance, the fact that we do not focus on our top line was particularly apparent this quarter. While we did take advantage of some new business opportunities, much of the reduction in gross premiums written resulted from selective non-renewal or un-attractive business. This was most notable in our U.S. casualty portfolio.", "Another area impacted was our portfolio of quota share reinsurances of Lloyd Syndicates. This portfolio has performed very well in recent years, but given where we are in the cycle, we took a more conservative underwriting position and this together with some impact from the well publicized recent M&A activity in that market, resulted in $17 million of foregone gross premiums written.", "We also saw premiums affected by the timing of renewals and we expect to bind approximately $15 million of business in the second quarter that was previously written in the first quarter of last year. Net premiums earned were substantially flat year over year as lower net premiums written in prior quarters were partially offset by the positive earned impact of cessions to Cyrus Re were reduced. The reinsurance current year loss ratio was 4.7 points lower than in Q1 2007 driven by lower cat losses with the segment's exposure to Emma being only $20 million compared to Kyrill's $45 million in the prior year quarter. Prior year development in Q1 2008 was $50 million versus $45 million in Q1 2007.", "We discussed January renewal conditions on our last call. Since then, the only significant news is that rates on our nowadays small and selective portfolio of Japanese business renewing on April 1 remained generally flat, which given the very competitive nature of the Japanese market was in itself something of a victory for pricing.", "Turning to our life operations, these contributed earnings of $27 million this quarter compared to $23 million in the previous year quarter. Our life operations segment continues its trends of growth in long-term regular premium business in both the U.K. and the U.S. though this growth is not immediately parents this quarter due to a single premium annuity contract having been written in the prior year quarter.", "We spent a fair amount of time on our call last quarter discussing the sub-prime issue and its impact on our insurance and reinsurance segments. We presented a snapshot analysis of our book of business and discussed our product and geographic diversification as well as underwriting related risk management. Since that basic profile doesn't change materially on a quarter to quarter basis, I would refer you to last quarter's comments for an overview of our operations and I will use the time this quarter to give you a quick update.", "As this is an evolving issue, we regularly review our position in regard to sub-prime in both insurance and reinsurance. Specifically, we have updated our analysis of 2007 losses for the insurance professional lines portfolio. While there has been an increase in the number of notices for 2007 from 26 to 50, this increase is within that anticipated in our year end analysis and we continue to be comfortable with the adequacy of the inherent clash load and our overall loss pick for 2007.", "With regard to the 2008 year, 27 notices have been received during the first quarter and we continue to track potential exposure associated with insurers that have been linked in the media to credit market related activity. In recognition of the potential for heightened loss activity in 2008, we have increased the clash provision in our 2008 loss ratio over 2007 for our major professional lines businesses by five points. We believe that this is prudent given the evolving and long-term nature of this issue from an insurance perspective, and we have done this despite the fact that at this early stage attritional losses continue to be favorable and in line with prior years.", "Also general rate reductions this year have been less than expected and we see signs of price firming in portions of the market most impacted by sub-prime. In reinsurance, please recall that the potential sub-prime exposure in our assumed reinsurance portfolio is much more limited as our average treaty line size is in the $2 million to $3 million range and our experience here continues in line with our previously discussed analysis.", "In summary, we continue to monitor our exposure to sub-prime very closely and remain comfortable with our reserve position for 2007 and feel that our loss picks for 2008 are currently appropriate. We do expect to pay claims related to the sub-prime issue, but that is our business, and we are comfortable with the idea now we have put up for those potential losses. I would also emphasize that based on our current loss picks we would expect both 2007 and 2008 years to be profitable and give us returns in excess of our long-term hurdle rates.", "In closing, I'd like to also mention that strategic initiatives for organic and profitable expansion across our organization continue to bear fruits. Our insurance branch in Singapore has now been open for a full quarter and has already landed several key accounts in property, casualty, marine and professional. We have successfully integrated XL Gas, our recent engineering services acquisition, and this generated $11 million of additional insurance premiums through cross-selling.", "And we recently announced that with the opening of the Brazilian reinsurance market, we have applied for both admitted and local reinsurance licenses and we expect to commence operations there as soon as possible. And with that we will open it up for Q&A.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Tom Cholnoky of Goldman Sachs.", "Thomas Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs", "Yes, a couple of questions if I can. First, Sarah, on the unrealized losses recognizing that much of this was probably driven by ill liquidity in the marketplace, is there a time frame or a time threshold that you have to somehow potentially come up against whereby you might have to classify these as other than temporary impair, so if you can discuss how you treat that and what the tests are and then I will follow up?", "Sarah E. Street - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer.", "Yeah, hi, good morning. We obviously have a robust process around our OTTI and this is not solely dependent upon the accounting rules and is based on the evaluation of securities and weather [inaudible]  impairment has occurred. We do keep an eye on the time and also the degree in which the securities have been in the loss position and where we reach a conclusion that the impairment is other than temporary, we do take the OTTI charge and write it down to the current market value.", "In accordance with GAAP even if we take the ultimate impairment is less than the current level we will continue this, and it is really very difficult to predict the level of OTTI that we might incur. I mean there are certain accounting rules like EITF 9920 that might mean that we will be required to take additional OTTI but really until we get to that quarter we don't know.", "Thomas Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs", "And where...  I mean, what is that... I mean can you give us a time frame? Do you have the ability to go three, six, nine, 12 months on this or where, what point do you start getting some pressure?", "Sarah E. Street - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer.", "We look at every asset irrespective of the time. We look at assets that are over 12 months in consecutive loss a lot more closely. And anything that has been in the loss and this is actually in our financial notes so that you could read it in detail. Anything above 25% in consecutive losses of more than 11 months we automatically take.", "Thomas Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Great. And then, Sarah, also on the investment affiliates I think you've been targeting somewhere between, I don't know, 8% and 11% kind of returns. On roughly, what $1.5 million kind of portfolio, how should we think about that given the obviously very weak start to the year?", "Sarah E. Street - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer.", "Tom, as you know we've been fairly consistent in terms of our long-term expectations for what we would generate off the alternative portfolio. It is now 1.7 billion.", "Thomas Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs", "1.7.", "Sarah E. Street - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer.", "I think we are sticking with our 10 to 11% returns expectations and if you look back over our track record for the last six years that's actually what we've generated.", "Thomas Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs", "But those were clearly in periods that were a little bit more accommodating than the current one we're in.", "Sarah E. Street - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer.", "Well, the last couple of years have clearly... we've been, I think last year the return was 17%. I think it is definitely more challenging, but I don't think you can measure a year off a quarter.", "Thomas Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And sorry, Brian, just real quickly the tax rate seemed quite low in the quarter relative to where it might have been in previous once. Anything going on there?", "Brian O'Hara - Acting Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Nothing unusual. It's not really materially below.", "Thomas Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. I'll hop back in if I got anything else. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel of Langen McAlenney.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "Good morning. I was wondering if you guys would help me out on just a technical question on SCA and that is if you chose to try to negotiate with them to buy out of the pre-deal IPO, is that legally possible? Is there, is that an avenue that possibly could be done for practical point of view? ?", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Hi, Bob, it's Henry. I would say that we are in discussions with our advisors and with SCA around a wide range of possibilities and we are considering all aspects that we can look at but it would be premature to make any observations about where we think this is going to go because we are still in a discussion with them.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "I was actually just asking a legal question, Henry, not a practical or which way you're negotiating. Is it possible to negotiate out of the pre-deal IPO cover?", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Well, I think we discussed this on the previous call or when we discussed SCA on the previous call. This is a very complex situation as I'm sure you appreciate. The terms of the guarantee are unconditional, irrevocable, and obviously it's not just SCA that is involved with that, it's the bondholders themselves. So it's a much more complex thing to just say, can we negotiate out of it with SCA.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "Okay, I got the answer. One other final answer, you are sort of in the sort of half pregnant stage of management leadership with Mike McGavick coming on board hopefully shortly. How much are you involving Mike in day-to-day important strategic decisions that have to be made that would clearly impact his leadership going forward?", "Brian O'Hara - Acting Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Bob, at the end of the call Mike is going to say a few words and he can answer that.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "Okay. Look forward to hearing the answer. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shankar of city.", "Joshua Shankar - Citigroup", "Good morning, following up on Tom's question; I'm curious to know first of all given the experience this quarter with the marked-to-market and last's quarters OTTI, Marks, whether a, in regards... whether you feel there's any chance of recovery from the fourth quarter OTTI marks and, two, if you go into a little bit more depth on the process by which you thought those fourth once were impaired permanently potentially in these current losses are just merely going to reverse at some point. A little more depth would be much appreciated.", "Sarah E. Street - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer.", "Okay, Josh, I'll have a go at it. When we went through the OTTI impairment analysis in the fourth quarter, what came out of that was really a recognition of losses associated with many of our topical assets that where we felt there really was permanent impairment. I mean given the deterioration in the housing market and where cumulative losses are moving on those, we felt that when we did the analysis and did the stress on the individual securities, we had real losses there, so it was appropriate to take them. This quarter when you actually look at where the change in the unrealized had come from, it's pretty evenly split between corporate credit and structured credit. Corporate credit definitely experienced dramatic spread widening during the quarter and particularly financials which is as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we do have $6 billion of holdings.", "But we very much feel that that is a reflection of the market turmoil in March that culminated in the bail out of Bear Stearns and that, what you are seeing recovery along to the credit default swap spreads of many of the financials, the cash markets have reacted more slowly. So the recovery is taking a bit more time. But we feel pretty good about our financial portfolio exposure. I mean if you look at our top ten names in terms of financial supplement, they are all extremely familiar names which I certainly feel extremely comfortable about in terms of the portfolio being money good. The other $0.5 billion change in the portfolio did come in the structured credits. And if you go through the financial supplement that we, the credit supplement that we posted on the website last night, you'll actually see that most of the losses in terms of the change in the unrealized actually came in the AAA and AA portions of the portfolio. And this wasn't really a surprise given a lot of the forced liquidations that took place during the quarter particularly in alternative A, Alt-A portfolio which just put significant pressure on those asset prices in March and in fact were are already starting to see those recover in the cash markets quite nicely.", "So it's a combination of all of that. When we looked at the difference between the fourth quarter and the first quarter, the fourth quarter was recognizing the real impairment that we had taken as a result of the housing market decline while this quarter the marked-to-market was a liquidity that's happened in the investment portfolio which we do not believe is permanent.", "Joshua Shankar - Citigroup", "So that being said and not that you would do this but, I hear from a lot of your peers that if we could by assets at the same level that we are being forced, to quote them at a marked-to-market loss, we would be buyers at these levels. I see you have other capital issues but does that jive with your opinion about your own portfolio?", "Sarah E. Street - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer.", "Absolutely; we spent a lot of time looking at our portfolio and if you go and talk to... as you know we work with XL and the managers, if you go and talk to the managers today about, if you gave them a new portfolio and what would they buy? They would be buying a lot of what we already own, and particularly financials.", "Joshua Shankar - Citigroup", "Okay. Well, thank you for the disclosure. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Josh Smith [ph] of TIAA Cref.", "Josh Smith - TIAA Cref", "Hi, thanks for taking the call. A couple of questions, following up on Josh's question on the unrealized losses. Page eight you showed that you had, I see the OTTI losses of $400 million or so sequential change. I see you had a benefit from the drop in the treasury and  I see the corporate credit spreads widening. What is that other bucket that brands [ph] structured credits spreads, if it is not OTTI, what does it apply to?", "Sarah E. Street - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer.", "Well, none of this is OTTI. This is --", "Josh Smith - TIAA Cref", "I'm sorry, I meant topical.", "Sarah E. Street - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer.", "Change in the unrealized. This is a combination of commercial mortgage backed securities which had a roller coaster quarter in terms of prices in the marketplace. As you know our portfolio from our... we've disclosed is 98% AAA but definitely road that roller coaster in terms of price.", "Josh Smith - TIAA Cref", "Yeah but I thought that would have been, sorry, the topical, if you add up all the topical pieces which you do give a great amount of detail in the structured data credit supplement. All of those change quarter-to-quarter is about $400 million which looks like --", "Sarah E. Street - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer.", "Right, we've always defined topical as being sub-prime, Alt A, and asset backed CDOs.", "Josh Smith - TIAA Cref", "Okay.", "Sarah E. Street - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer.", "Which has been our definition of topical which we haven't changed.", "Josh Smith - TIAA Cref", "Fair enough.", "Sarah E. Street - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer.", "It's a CMBS and it's our core CDO portfolio, which would be the other area which definitely felt the knock on impact from the price volatility that we saw in the leveraged loan market during the fourth to first quarter as many of the bank's thought to reduce their inventories and sold very large amounts of leveraged loans into secondary markets that caused real pricing pressure there.", "Josh Smith - TIAA Cref", "So it's just coincidence, all of those numbers were closed. They would have to add the gray, the background and offset some portion of the light blue to get there. Okay. I got it.", "Sarah E. Street - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer.", "Correct. And that's like net to 1.1 net.", "Josh Smith - TIAA Cref", "Right. On the Forex impact, could some one explain briefly why you had a Forex loss and we think that you have... intuitively I would think if you have foreign operations where you are collecting in Euros or pound and you are converting back to dollars that a drop in the dollar in the quarter would help you? You took a Forex Gain.", "Brian Nocco - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We have operations around the world and a lot of this has to do with holding nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities in different places around the world. So an example would be in the UK which is a pound functional currency if we have US dollar assets and liabilities. Revaluing of those go in different places in the financials, revaluing the liabilities goes through the income statement assets through the CTA or the currency translation adjustment line directly to the balance sheet. So part of this is GAAP convention. Part of it also is, there were significant movements in certain currencies, and particularly the Swiss franc during the quarter which had a negative impact on us. But I think the important thing to keep in mind is while we try to damp down the P&L volatility, we try to... we certainly manage first and foremost the economics of FX. And so what we gave up on the income statement Juan we gave up in the marked-to-market in the portfolio, which is $130 million roughly of the $1.1 billion that Sarah referred to, we picked up an equivalent amount in the currency translation adjustments plus another 30. So net on the balance sheet we picked up 30 for the quarter.", "Josh Smith - TIAA Cref", "Okay. Thank you. And final question on the cat's large losses, I thought I heard you say that annual was 20 million hit but you didn't really say if there were any other cats and then you talk about having 1.5% of... less than 1.5% of industry losses. I thought you referenced $10 billion in loss, but then you said, you were exposed on three out of 27 so is it 1.5% of the loss on 3 out of 27 out of the 10 billion? It was kind of confusing?", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Hi, Josh, it's Henry here. Sorry if it was confusing for you. On the reinsurance segment as you're correct we said we had $20 million of losses from winter storm Emma. The total estimated losses from natural peril cat... natural peril cat losses was in total for the cat and risk losses impacted by natural perils, $50 million in insurance and $26 million in reinsurance. And that compares to $10 million in insurance and $61 million in reinsurance for the prior year. Now the point you are raising on the 10 billion as I mentioned there were 19 individual risk losses that we tracked during the quarter totalling $5.5 billion and in total there were 27 risk and cat impacted losses over $100 million totalling nearly $10 billion. We only had three of those risk accounts in the insurance segment.", "In other words, we through selective underwriting essentially we saw and declined the vast majority of the other once or we excluded it through terms and conditions. And in total across all of those risk and cat events aggregating up to $10 billion, our total exposure was less than 1.5%, i.e. less than $150 million.", "Josh Smith - TIAA Cref", "Total exposure.", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah, total losses.", "Josh Smith - TIAA Cref", "Total losses.", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "And I think you might want to put that in context that, for example, our large risk property portfolio in the U.S. we reckon we probably have a 2 to 3% market share and in Europe it's more like 6 to 8%. So I think that's a pretty good outcome from an underwriting processes to have such a low percentage of the total losses.", "Josh Smith - TIAA Cref", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb of Lehman Brothers.", "Jay Gelb - Lehman Brothers", "Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you could touch base within the insurance segment, I believe there was a reference to long-term agreements. Are those multi-year deals and can you talk about how much that may have accelerated book premium in the current quarter?", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Sure, Jay. We have long-term agreements of totalling $220 million this quarter, which was $60 million more than we had in the previous year quarter at $160 million. Now bear in mind that a very large proportion of our European portfolio renews at January 1. It's about 85% of our European book renews at January 1 and by far the largest proportion of that LTA business comes out of Europe where this is very standard practice, and they are typically three year transactions and we still see good opportunities there and it also speaks to the customer loyalty whereby doing these long-term agreements the average rate reduction on our European portfolio through these LTAs was about 3% as opposed to about 7% on the whole portfolio. So at the moment and once we keep a very close eye on this obviously bearing in mind where market conditions are, we still see this as a very good tool particularly bearing, working together with our very loyal European customer base.", "Jay Gelb - Lehman Brothers", "To what extent are you seeing demands for that sort of spill-over to the U.S. like we saw in the last market?", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "We don't see a lot of demand for it and we are very cautious about it in the U.S.", "Jay Gelb - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Then on a separate issue on the professional liability on the sub-prime related issues, is the right premium base to think about this the $1.5 billion of casualty professional lines that was written for the full year '07? Is that the premium base we should be thinking about that?", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Well, that would actually include all of our design and select professional, et cetera. The actual written premium for professional line in the first quarter was $304 million on insurance and was $83 million on reinsurance.", "Jay Gelb - Lehman Brothers", "Right. But of that $1.5 billion a year ago how much is related to the topical issues?", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Well, our core D&O book which would be relevant to that discussion is about $1 billion for professional lines.", "Jay Gelb - Lehman Brothers", "I was also thinking, I mean, it seems like we should almost look at this issue in terms of gross limits exposed like you would on property & casualty if there is going to be a class issue and some of these could be limit losses, would you ever consider providing that level of disclosure as opposed to claim counts and advertise limits, just to give us a better sense of kind of worse case exposure here?", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "We went through a discussion on this last quarter if you recall, Jay, and we actually look at this in terms of what has happened on the average because a lot of the business is exposed to side A only. We have reinsurance only. Some claims don't materialize at all. Some claims are purely expense related. Some claims can be full limits losses. But typically on large clash events like this in the past when we've looked at the previous market events it absolutely isn't a full limits loss across the portfolio.", "Jay Gelb - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alain Karaoglan of Banc of America.", "Alain Karaoglan - Banc of America", "Good morning. I have a few questions, Henry, you mentioned that you moved the loss ratio out by five-point on the professional liability this quarter. Does that change your views of what the insurance can achieve in 2008 in terms of a result? Is that worse than what you would have anticipated at the beginning of the year?", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Well, we moved it up by five points, which is approximately one percentage point on the... in fact it's slight less than one percentage point on the incurred loss ratio for this quarter. I don't think we would be into re-forecasting our guidance or anything like that. But it's as I said it's less than one point and it's about 12 to $13 million of incurred losses in the quarter.", "Alain Karaoglan - Banc of America", "Okay. Then the second question is on the life operation. Are you considering whether you should be in that business given the volatility that it may add to your book value? And I'm just looking at the change in net asset value in the supplement going from 800 and some change to $500 million. Could you give me... give us your thoughts on that?", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "I think on the life business and obviously people who are a looking at this as a life specifically as a life business, one of the reasons why we split out the balance sheet for the life business is this is long duration business, the investments are very much held matching the liabilities and we would see these movements working their way through over time. And I think typically people look through movements in the short term relative to the long-term nature of that business.", "Alain Karaoglan - Banc of America", "The next question is on the capital position maybe for Brian, how do you feel about your capital position of the company, your conversation with the rating agencies and how comfortable you feel with it generally?", "Brian Nocco - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We communicate regularly with the rating agencies. I think we've got good open communication and transparency. Our capital levels as we indicated last quarter were very strong and in fact supportive of ratings at a level higher than our current ratings when we look at our capital today and compare those to our own economic capital model as well as the capital models from the rating agencies, it's still very solidly supports our risks and our book of business.", "Alain Karaoglan - Banc of America", "And then the last two questions, Henry, maybe if you can comment on the Florida catastrophe fund situation or other opportunities that may occur in Florida? There was some thought that demand may increase in Florida? And then the second question related to SCA, if you could, when you give the disclosure in the first quarter around $10.9 billion is disclosed as other CDOs, could you give us the details on that? If you can't give it on the conference call when you give us the next update, could you break that down into more detail? And if you think that it's not a big issue in terms of potential losses maybe tell us why is that and why we don't need the detail?", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Okay. On Florida, as you know it looks as though the $3 billion layer, the hurricane fund, the tickle layer is going out of the market and then it depends really what is going to happen relative to citizens and what they buy. We could see and we do expect to see increased demand from Florida generally through that. In fact, we think that could be in the order of $500 million of additional reinsurance premium becoming available to the reinsurance marketplace. So we think there will be increased demand there. Having said that we think there is enough capacity to take that up as well.", "The second thing is the 12 billion other CDO bucket, it's made up of CDOs, which are essentially comprised of CLOs, CDOs of investment grade corporate debt, CDOs of CMBS and we don't put those into the same sort of topical risk category as the residential mortgage-backed CDOs.", "Alain Karaoglan - Banc of America", "Could I ask if you could consider breaking it down in detail on when you give us your next update?", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Alain, as ever, thank you for the input, and obviously we'll look at that and see if we can provide the information.", "Alain Karaoglan - Banc of America", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Brian O'Hara - Acting Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Alain. Appreciate it.", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "And actually just on the guarantee thing I may have left people with the impression that whilst this is a very difficult situation, of course, we are looking at every possibility to remove this overhang from us. So, I wouldn't want anybody to believe that this is something that we're not focused on trying to resolve. As Brian said at the beginning, we want to resolve this issue, and clearly, resolving the matter of the guarantee is very high on our agenda.", "Operator", "You next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill.", "J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill", "Good morning. I have a question about how the investments are managed, in particular. And I guess one of the things I'm curious about is whether or not you're managing your investments in buckets, corporate separate from mortgage backs, because it does seem like, and maybe this is just erroneous view, but it does seem like you've got credit exposure across all different sorts of asset classes but it doesn't seem like you're kind of looking at it at a holistic perspective. Do you have essentially managers that are sort of looking independently on each of these asset classes?", "Sarah E. Street - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Hi, this is Sarah. I mean, we use a combination of both core managers who have the ability to take credit, but also credit specialist managers as well. We have tended to use credit specialist managers for lower rated credit because we think that they can have more resources available to them to be really focusing on the underlying credit analysis of individual securities.", "Having said that, even our core managers we are comfortable have very robust credit processes. But, no, we absolutely look at our core credit across the overall portfolio in a way that we've allocated the money out doesn't really drive that. We are looking at what our total credit exposure is.", "Now, we're probably overweight credit relative to many of our peers and that has come from being in a number of the spread businesses, which, as you know, we are exiting, but it will take us time to do that and also by being in the life business. We have a long duration in UK and Euro portfolio for our life operations. And given the fact that it's a long duration, it is more sensitive to changes in credit spreads. And that's what we've seen in this quarter.", "J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill", "As a broader question, does the investment book take into account the risk that you're taking in other businesses? And if it doesn't\u2026 it doesn't look like it does, why not? Because I think one of the things that investor are struggling with is that you've got essentially the same risk in a very long number of different pots whether it be a variety of investment portfolios, the insurance operations, and then, of course, the off balance sheet SCA stuff. Why isn't there some offset of\u2026 you recognize you have a big credit exposure for the SCA, so therefore you adjust the investment portfolio to have lower than average credit exposure?", "Brian O'Hara - Acting Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, as you will recall, well over a year ago we decided and agreed with our Board that we would exit the financial services strategy that we embarked on 10 years ago. And unfortunately, it's not a switch you can just turn off but we're selling down our SCA position as you know. We were exiting the muni-GIC business. And we're mindful of these accumulations and why we were exiting as soon as possible.", "However, events caught up with us before we could fully execute it. So, we will\u2026 as we mentioned before, we are out of the muni-GIC business now, and we're committed to exiting all the rest as we've stated in our Investor Day a year ago May.", "J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Small of Bear Stearns.", "David Small - Bear Stearns", "Good morning. There's been a lot of press about the Merrill Lynch case against SCA. Could you just help us understand how the outcome of that case would impact XL?", "Brian Nocco - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I think, to be honest, David, you would need to speak with SCA about how that impact\u2026 what that would have impact on them. SCA posted their case reserves at the quarter end of the year, which included exposures from those CDOs as we understand it, but you'd really have to discuss that situation with SCA.", "David Small - Bear Stearns", "Okay.", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "And if I can add on, it really\u2026 if SCA wins the case in any degree, it's upside for them and for us derivatively. All of the credits in question are post-IPO credits as well.", "Brian Nocco - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "But also, David, you should be aware, of course, we are not privy to the merits of this case one way or the other.", "David Small - Bear Stearns", "Okay. And then, just on the D&O issue, I mean how many more\u2026 how should we be thinking about this? You said you went from 26 to 50 claims and you are comfortable with the reserves that you've put up. I mean, how many we should be thinking about this, and if you get on next quarter and that's gone up to 75, should we be thinking, well, that's not within what you were expecting? I guess, maybe put some more color on that.", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Well, 2007 in terms of notifications because this is on a report year basis is essentially done in terms of number of cases. Obviously 2008, we've seen 27 cases. We actually saw a slowdown in the number of cases reported in March, but I wouldn't say that one month is going to change our view on this. But it's an interesting data point. But we continue to monitor cases in the press through published sources, et cetera, et cetera, and keep a close eye on what's happening.", "Brian Nocco - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And if I may add, not all notices are created equal. I mean some obviously are generated by a real problem or lawsuit. Others are excess of caution by the insured to make sure that they've got coverage.", "David Small - Bear Stearns", "And so, you look at your 50 cases how would you break them down between those buckets?", "Brian Nocco - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, I'm not sure that we at hand have that kind of information. But keep that in mind in future analysis.", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "And David, please keep in mind that was 50 in 2007. We have 27 in 2008.", "David Small - Bear Stearns", "Okay, great. Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith of Credit Suisse.", "Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse", "Hi. Good morning. Could you comment on your client retention ability? You said that it was in the 90% range and how that has been trending?", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "This is on our core Property and Casualty business and it's been pretty consistent. In fact, in Europe for January 1, it was slightly higher this year than it was last year. So we are very pleased with that. But it's been pretty consistent over the last two, three years. We did see a slight drop-off towards the backend of last year, but as I say, in fact, January 1 in Europe compared to January 1 last year we were slightly better.", "Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse", "And the US, have you seen anything in the US?", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Well, US for January 1 is not a big renewal season.", "Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse", "Okay. That's fair enough. And the second question was a follow-up to Alain's question. On the $10 billion of other CDO as a guarantee for SCA, how would you compare the credit quality of that as compared to your own core CDOs of $931 million that you have in your own books?", "Sarah E. Street - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "I think I believe SCA's exposure is principally at the AAA rated level and our portfolio and the detail in this in our credit supplement that we posted on the website is more weighted in the AA and the BBB. We still continue to feel very good about that portfolio. I mean, there's a very big difference between collateralized loan obligations and the asset-backed CDOs that we've had the issues in. I mean it's an asset class that has been tested before in a credit metal down and refinements were made by the rating agencies to make those structures even more robust than they were, and we still feel very good about our CDO exposure in the investment portfolio.", "Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse", "All right. Fair enough. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Heimermann of JP Morgan.", "Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan", "Hi. Good morning, everyone. I'll try to make things quick. On the adverse loss development cover at Lloyds you said it covered open years. Could you just remind us what years those are specifically, and I guess, I'm curious as to whether or not this gives you any protection on D&O potentially?", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "It closed out the 2001 open year on Syndicate 1209, Matt.", "Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan", "Okay. So, it's a very, very old action.", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Yes. It cleared up an outstanding item, if I can put it like that, puts it behind us.", "Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan", "The other question I had was on the long-term agreements, I would assume that even though you enter into these long-term agreements and you're bounds to the three years that the clients can cancel if they so choose? Is that correct?", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "The answers is that this becomes something of a dance in reality. I would say that this is very normal practice in Europe and essentially what it really does for you is it gives you first right of refusal at renewal and you have a discussion where you agree to, what the basis is going to be going forward. There's often a lot of changes in the client's portfolio and so you need to discuss that. But it's not ironclad in both directions but it does become a relationship and we... but the experience of these has been very good and our pricing experience has also been very good.", "Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan", "Okay, can you give us a sense, is the right question, what percentage of the 220 you wrote this year reflects deals last year that were renewed differently?", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "The vast majority were renewals.", "Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan", "Okay. So, three-year deals a year ago that are now three-year deals a year later?", "David Radulski - Director of Investor Relations", "No, they are three-year deals that have come up as a new three-year deal.", "Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan", "Okay. All right. Perfect. Thank you.", "David Radulski - Director of Investor Relations", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith of UBS. Mr. Meredith, please state your question. Hello?", "Brian Meredith - UBS", "Hello.", "Operator", "Yes, sir, please go ahead.", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Brian, we can hear you. No, we can't hear you. I'm sorry.", "Operator", "That question has been withdrawn. Your next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen of Merrill Lynch .", "Brian Nocco - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Jay, are you there?", "David Radulski - Director of Investor Relations", "Lori, is there an issue with the dial in line?", "Operator", "Mr. Cohen, please state your question.", "Jay Cohen - Merrill Lynch", "Hi, can you guys here me?", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Yes, we've got you.", "Jay Cohen - Merrill Lynch", "Good. Sarah, you had mentioned that within the corporate that you guys own, about $6 billion related to financials. I'm just adding it up, I am on page 16 of your supplement, it looks like total corporate between US and non US is 13 billion suggesting almost half of that is financials. Is that right and is that typical or are you kind of overweight financials?", "Sarah E. Street - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Jay, your numbers are correct and we are slightly overweight on financials.", "Jay Cohen - Merrill Lynch", "Has that been a historical thing or is that relatively new?", "Sarah E. Street - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "No, that's been historical.", "Jay Cohen - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you, next question is for you, Sarah, as well. Since quarter end, what have you seen happen with the spreads in your key asset classes?", "Sarah E. Street - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Well, as I mentioned I think the tone of the markets have improved. The best transparency to see that is obviously in a lot of the indices out there and if you look at where the CDX has tightened, it's tightened very significantly since about March 10. You are starting to see that on the corporate credit flow through on the cash side. I think the ABX indices at this point are up about 5% or 7% for the quarter from end of March. I think the cash markets recovery will lag on that. They lagged on the way down. I expect them to lag on the way up. But I think generally, and CNBS has improved. I think there's concerns around the financial stability have decreased, I wouldn't say gone away yet by any stretch of the imagination. That is starting to be reflected in portfolios.", "Jay Cohen - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. Next question, the muni-GIC side, you have liquidated I guess $4 billion of securities to funds these payments. Is there any additional liquidity needs coming up where you will have to sell more securities?", "Sarah E. Street - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "As I mentioned in the prepared script, the only thing that we've got is $900 million of funding agreements that mature over the next two quarters and we have taken some OTTI in advance... because we know we are not going to hold those maturities until maturity, or until recovery; we have already taken the unrealized or realized that we would expect to credit on funding those obligations and repaying.", "Jay Cohen - Merrill Lynch", "And the last question, I guess still with you, Sarah; the current credit market and the types of hits you're taking to your balance sheet from a Marks standpoint what are the chances of this happening? What I'm saying is, on the CAT side you look, you model these things out and you say it's a one in 100 year event and one in 50-year event, what kind of event is the current credit crisis that we're seeing?", "Sarah E. Street - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "I'd have to think about that because we've obviously had a number of different components on top of it happening at the same. In our filings in the 10-Q and the Ks, we go through our bar [ph] results and our Stress Test Results and what we've seen over the last nine months in terms of potential marked-to-market that we expected could occur in certain stressful events, it's pretty much in line with that. So, I mean, it is within our expectations. And it's really, I mean it's, it's pretty fare standard deviation but it varies very much depending on which asset class you look at. So, I'm not sure I can answer it in a total simple response.", "Jay Cohen - Merrill Lynch", "The reason I'm asking is just because you do take risk on your insurance side. Maybe it is what Paul Newsome was asking, but just seems... you lost about 12%, 13% of your shareholder's equity in one quarter. If that happened on the CAT side; that would be a very sizeable event and it could happen later this year. It just seems that it was kind of outsized hit on the balance sheet given that you do take risk elsewhere. That was my only sort of comment.", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "This is Henry and since you are asking about CAT maybe I can look at it from a slightly different perspective. Of course a CAT event of whatever size it is absolute destruction to the balance sheet. This in the investment portfolio A; the Mark could have been a positive and in this instance it's a negative and B; it's only a Mark and we anticipated over time it will come back. So, yes, it is a big percentage of the shareholders equity but I wouldn't characterize it in the same way that you would pure catastrophe losses.", "Jay Cohen - Merrill Lynch", "That's a fair point, Henry. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Bill Wilt of Morgan Stanley.", "William Wilt - Morgan Stanley", "The question I'll be quick. I guess first one for Sarah, I'm looking at the core CDOs of $931 million. Does the unrealized loss provision, I guess totaling $254 million; does that represent the totality of the losses you've taken against that portfolio or were there previously... whether OTTI or realized losses on those that if I was trying to get at a cumulative loss position on that portfolio?", "Sarah E. Street - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Bill, that is pretty much it. The only OTTI that we have taken on that portfolio in the last 12 months was the $7 million that we took this quarter and there were just a couple of CDOs that we saw deterioration on that we felt appropriate but the rest of the portfolio which are cash flow CLOs are in pretty good shape I should say.", "William Wilt - Morgan Stanley", "So, you are using the $254 million against the $931 million segregated by rating category would give a reasonable approximation for the current marked-to-market, I guess?", "Sarah E. Street - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Absolutely.", "William Wilt - Morgan Stanley", "Thank you for that. And then Henry, on the insurance portfolio, the D&O discussion of increasing the run rate loss ratio by five points; just to confirm, what's the right basis to which that should be... premium base to which that should be applied? Or is it the $1 billion core D&O portfolio that, core meaning it pertains to financial institutions or is it some other premium base against which that five point run rate increase is being applied?", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "I think you circled that question very well for yourself, Bill. It's five points on roughly the $1 billion for the full year. It's about $250 million for Q1 and it's $12 million to $13 million in this quarter. So hopefully that gives you enough points.", "William Wilt - Morgan Stanley", "That's great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Brian Meredith of UBS.", "Brian Meredith - UBS", "Hello, can you hear me now?", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Yes, we can Brian. Welcome --", "Brian Meredith - UBS", "All right. Fantastic, sorry about that. A couple quick questions here. First, Henry, if I look at the other specialty line in insurance, a big increase, is that related to these European long-term contracts or is that the E&S business that you're growing.", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "On a specialty line, no, what you're looking at is an increase in the gross written by 14%.", "Brian Meredith - UBS", "$239 million of gross versus 162 in the first quarter '07.", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "It's probably in our aviation and also some growth in the E&S business.", "Brian Meredith - UBS", "Okay. So you have some growth in the E&S business.", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "It's principally growth in the E&S business, I'm sorry.", "Brian Meredith - UBS", "Next question, you mentioned that you expected some impact on new business from rating agency down grades. Is that a change from what you thought at the end of the fourth quarter on the fourth quarter conference call?", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Well, I think what we should say here is that during the first quarter obviously January 1 business was not impacted by this because of the rating actions occurred later. We spent a lot of time with our customers and our brokers and they've been very supportive of opposition. Obviously we do have very detailed discussions with them and we come under pressure from our competitors. So I don't think our view is really any changed. We have to fight every day out there for business and on new business particularly it can be a bit more difficult. But we are working very closely with our customers and brokers and they've been very supportive of us.", "Brian Meredith - UBS", "Great. And then lastly on SCA, last quarter obviously when the 10-K filed, you had full information from SCA to increase your loss provision, did you have the ability to actually go in and look at the development of the book this quarter when you reported your results or could there be subsequent information that comes out where you will have to actually increase your reserves when they report?", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "We don't have any information at this point that we can analyze to comment one way or the other.", "Brian O'Hara - Acting Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, let me just add on that. We are really talking about reinsurance contracts, the excess of loss reinsurance agreement and facultative contracts, we would react to claim notices that we receive relative to those. We received no new claim notices from SCA, which would cause us to reassess or re-value those reserves.", "Brian Meredith - UBS", "But if they increased their reserve positions for any of the contracts that you've done in the facultative side, I assume that would impact your reserve position, right?", "Henry C.V. Keeling - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Yes. Of course, if they increase their reserves on facultative, we would [inaudible].", "Brian O'Hara - Acting Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "And as you'll recall we already took a full limit loss on a present value basis on the XRL [ph].", "Brian Meredith - UBS", "Right. It's more of the facultative, I understand it. Okay. Thank you. That's all.", "Operator", "At this time there are no further questions, I will now return the call over to Brian O'Hara for final remarks.", "Brian O'Hara - Acting Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you. As I move from XL's CEO to Chairman of the Board, I do so with confidence that our organization is well positioned to building our fundamental strengths. I have appreciated the immense support of our customers and brokers over the years and I thank all the XL family worldwide who have made my career such an outstanding experience. Although this will be my last investors' conference call after participating in 66 quarterly earnings calls since 1991, I hope to have the opportunity to see many of you again in my new role. But in the meantime thank you for your steadfast support, your belief in our great franchise and for affording me the privilege of leading this company.", "Before I sign off, I would like to say how pleased I am to have Mike McGavick, XL's CEO-designate here with us. As you know, Mike is an experience insurance executive and a proven leader and he has dedicated to the underwriting discipline and high ethical standards that have been XL's hallmark since our founding. Mike's official start date is May 1st. But he along with all of our senior management have been working hard to ensure that he will be up to speed on day one.", "Now I'd like to invite Mike to say a few words. Mike?", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer-Designate", "Thank you very much, Brian. And I did hear an awful lot of familiar names on this call to those of you who I already know, greetings; to those of you who I don't know I look forward to working with you. I'm eager to get to work. I'm here in Bermuda as a result of the board meetings this week and have taken the opportunity to continue my preparation for this job. I'm particularly because I am even more confident these days later than I was the day I signed that this is one of the great insurance franchises in the world and that by working our way through the issues that confront us now many of which have been discussed at great length today, we can get back to focusing on the great insurance and reinsurance operations this company possesses.", "In addition to the ordinary transition preparation meeting people, reviewing plans and evaluating them, finding the bathrooms, all the rest of the stuff, I've also been asked by the board and Brian to become intensely involved in the SCA matter which I have been doing. I can't add anything to the comments that were made earlier, but I can attest to the truth of what Brian said when he says that the focus and resources and intensity and urgency are present that are necessary to I think over time resolve this issue. This has made the transition much less restful than one might assume it would be given the level of travel and what not. I can only say that I am very grateful for the many kindnesses and support that I've received from Brian, Henry and the entire XL crew throughout this transition. It's been very much appreciated.", "One of these people was so kind as to observe that since I'm not yet being paid, this may be the period of greatest value that I have ever added to this company. I thought that was very funny. My wife thought it was less so. A couple of thing at the very highest level my priorities are pretty obvious. Get SCA behind us as fast as fully can be done rationally.", "Second, through additionally urgency to a process already underway here at XL, to do all I can to lead an end to the current and unpleasant pattern of having our very strong earnings in core reinsurance and insurance operations lost through one-offs every couple of years. This simply has to end. We all know that. There are tools we can use to do so, and I'm intent on bringing that fully to bear.", "By doing so, I think we can bring a real focus on strengthening the view of others of our capital strength. I would focus particularly there on our A.M. Best rating. These things take time. That's been discussed before, but I feel a sense of urgency around that entire process.", "Through all of these actions, these three particularly, I hope to be able to get us all back to\u2026 when I say all, I mean shareholders, my colleagues here at XL, our customers and partners around the world, to get all of us back to focusing on these core and great franchises. And I think that is particularly important at a time when underwriters, and particularly great underwriting organizations like this one, can show their real relative strength as the insurance marketplace globally enters choppier waters. So getting back to that focus and having the confidence to do it right is exactly what we all need to be doing, and it's my job to do all I can to quickly clear the decks so that that can again be the focus.", "In terms of activities, obviously, that means I've got to get around this vast organization, get to know its people, our partners, our customers and get to understand each of those businesses at a granular level, so that we can make the kinds of decisions that enable them to be successful as quickly as possible. But you can guess that some of that work is already engaged. And then, I would add that you can expect a meeting sometime early in my tenure\u2026 exactly when, I can't yet say\u2026 where I can describe to you directly what I've learned and can describe the actions we collectively and the leadership of XL intend to take based on those learnings.", "So that's just a little bit of what I've been thinking about and what I've been working on, and in preparation for taking over for Brian on May 1. I will tell you I find these extremely big and frightening shoes to take on. I've known Brian a long time. We went to the same high school perversely out in Seattle a decade apart. And so I am well aware of what this job entails and well aware of what a marvelous person I will stand in for, and I am honored to do so.", "At last, I'll end with one completely unrelated comment. But I'm keenly aware that there's an enormous irony to being on this call on the day that Safeco's announcement with Liberty was announced. And I would say, number one, and I know if we had a question period I would get questions on it, so I will take care of it anyway. Number one, I've learned long ago to never second guess a person who has succeeded you, so I have no judgment on the transaction whatsoever. That's the current leaderships business.", "I will say that on a personal level given my objectives when I went there were, number one, to rebuild that great franchise, which clearly we did, and number two, to remain independent. I can say this is personally very saddening. And I would just say to Ted Kelly and his friends at Liberty both congratulations, but most important, I'm confident that he knows and will appreciate the simply wonderful group of people that are acquired through this acquisition.", "So after that, I just look forward to working with you all in the future.", "Brian O'Hara - Acting Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Mike, and thank you everyone for joining us today.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in XL Capital's first quarter 2008 earnings conference call.

My name is Abigail and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the XL Capital Ltd. second quarter conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question and answer session, at which time instructions will be given. And now, David Radulski, XL Capital's, Director of Investor Relations.", "David Radulski - Investor Relations", "Thank you, Abigail. Good evening and welcome to XL Capital's second quarter 2008 conference call. This call is being simultaneously webcast on XL's web site at www.xlcapital.com. We've posted to our website several documents, including press releases, our Q2 10-Q, our financial supplement and our structured credit data supplement.", "On our call today, Mike McGavick, XL Capital's CEO, will discuss priorities for XL Capital, including the SCA agreement and associated capital raise. Dave Duclos, our Chief Executive of Insurance Operations, and Jamie Veghte, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations, will review current market conditions and second-quarter results. Sarah Street, XL's Chief Investment Officer, will discuss our investment portfolio, followed by Brian Nocco, our CFO, who will review the financial impacts of the SCA agreement and capital raised and our second quarter financial results. We will open it up for your questions before returning to Mike for closing remarks.", "Please note that since we are currently in the process of offering securities, we must limit our discussion today, including our responses in Q&A, to information filed in our public documents. And since it is not our practice to update guidance, nothing today should be construed as either updating or affirming previously provided guidance.", "Certain of the matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of which they are made and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise.", "And with that, I turn it over to XL's Chief Executive Officer, Mike McGavick.", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "Good evening, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As I've told people, I came to XL because I admire its operations. I've been a competitor to its insurance operations and a client of its Reinsurance Operations. It is simply one of the great collection of underwriting talent in the world.", "But it has had its history of its great earnings being wiped out by big mistakes, especially over these past eight years, and this is a pattern that can and must end. To achieve this outcome, in my only brief comments to analysts on the Q1 call before I took the job\u2026 before I started, I should say, I described three priorities at the heart of delivering on this promise of less risk and stronger earnings.", "First, to work to solve the SCA matter; and of course, we have done it. Second, working to make the business less prone to large one-off events, and fulfilling that is going to require a number of actions. You can see them listed on slide four, and I'll come back to it in a moment. And third, I said I would do what it takes to\u2026 to take the action to strengthen over time our ratings, protect our ratings in the near-term and of course, that relates to the capital raise that we are engaged in at this time.", "If you turn to slide five, we can dip into the details on SCA. In recent weeks, the right parties were drawn into complex negotiations facilitated by the New York Insurance Department. I want to pause and thank Eric Dinallo and his staff for their hard work in these past weeks, as well as Matthew Elderfield and the staff down at the BMA who have worked very hard. At the present, in addition to SCA and XL, we're the CDS counterparties, mainly the large banks who represent some of the largest potential claimants to SCA.", "In the end we agreed to extinguish the vast majority of our exposures. In other words, almost $66 billion in notional exposure was relieved at closing of this deal, $3 billion to $5 billion of what could have been potentially immediate claims from the Pre-IPO, CDS counterparties are avoided, and our other various meaningful contracts are extinguished.", "Note that there are some contracts, in total, referenced as the European Investment Bank, or EIB contracts, that are still being worked on and to which we may remain attached. The notional value of these contracts is about $1.1 billion or less than 2% of the total exposure. These contracts relate to project-financed risks and are performing well. The costs for extinguishing these risks are detailed on the slide and are clear. We will pay to SCA $1.775 billion.", "We will transfer to them 8 million shares of XL stock with a six-month lockup, and we will transfer back to SCA our 46% ownership in that company. This will lead to a charge in Q3 of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion for XL. In the end, this was a business judgment that was influenced by a number of inputs, and our view is that this is a solid outcome for us. It is final and behind us. The XL and SCA boards have approved this deal, as have the New York State Insurance Department, the Bermuda Monetary Authority and the Delaware Insurance Department, as well as other regulators.", "Though they will speak for themselves, we expect upon the completion of the current capital raise that the rating agencies will take us off of negative watch. While several agencies are likely to maintain negative outlooks, we believe that all of the rating agencies will ultimately affirm our financial strength and debt ratings as they are. To pay for the cost of this agreement, we are currently raising capital. Brian Nocco will discuss the details of that shortly. But, I firmly believe that we have structured it in a way that enables our investors to participate in XL's return to strength.", "Turning to slide six, even if our headline tonight is SCA is resolved and capital being raised, that is hardly the only thing we have been working on. Leading up to June and before the final negotiations on SCA became all-consuming, I had the chance to visit 12 of our offices in seven countries around the world. I did town hall Q&A sessions with more than 75% of our workforce and had extensive meetings with our local leadership, often in one-on-one settings.", "The result of this education was a series of recommendations for change at XL which were reviewed and approved at our June strategic board meetings and which are now being announced and in many cases already underway. The goal is simple\u2026 to reduce the risk of the large losses that have dogged our franchise and return the core earnings power of the franchise to prominence. We will focus on our core P&C businesses' proven winners as the second quarter results show yet again despite the downward pressure of dealing with the market with SCA out there. One major related decision is that we will begin to explore strategic opportunities for our Life Reinsurance business.", "We will also flatten our leadership structure to increase accountability. With the decision of Henry Keeling, our Chief Operating Officer, to retire, and I want to emphasize emphatically, Henry chose to retire, I wish he would stay. I understand, however, and respect his choice, and I wish him absolutely the best in any future endeavor. It has been a pleasure working with Henry. But, with his decision and with the willingness of others to be reassigned, we are able to eliminate a layer of management.", "The business leaders, our chief actuary and the heads of our functionaries to support the move to report directly to me in the future, more of a traditional operating company model rather than the complex holding company model that was being worked toward in the past. To that group, we will expect to soon add a chief enterprise risk officer to help maintain complete focus on our risks, especially those that go beyond that which we underwrite.", "With this simplified mission, also comes the chance to make the business more efficient by removing the vestiges of the holding company model and eliminating nice-to-have activities that are simply not either in keeping with the new business model nor this time in the cycle. We will move towards savings of approximately $110 million to $120 million over our 2008 run rate's expenses, resulting in a charge of $50 million to $60 million in the third quarter, at least the majority of which we expect to take in the third quarter; net-net year on\u2026 net year-on-year savings of $70 million in expenses.", "But, we're investing at the same time. We have kicked off a multiyear program called Operational Transformation, in development for more than a year to rebuild the underlying global technology platform from which we work. This will lead to significant savings and further extend our global platform advantages.", "Now also on the topic of investing in the business. Know that we plan a highly targeted options grant program for key employees for retention purposes. To the extent that we include senior management, senior leaders will have performance-based thresholds for vesting.", "While we are investing in the underlying technology platform, it should be noted that the global network itself in both insurance and reinsurance is largely built. We have 77 offices in 27 countries that can provide global platform business in 100 countries. That this is already built means that we can eliminate a major historical source of risk. Two of the sources of major losses over the past decade were unexpected loss development after large acquisitions. Today, we have no need for such major and risky acquisitions either to compete or to grow. This alone eliminates a major source of risk to our owners.", "Finally, as to our investment portfolio, today it has more sources of volatility than we would like because it has more elements than were accumulated for the support of the financial lines businesses, which we have exited. Over time, we will work to make it a more traditional P&C investment portfolio. Taken together, these actions meaningfully reduce the risks of this firm, position it to compete well in tough market conditions and will allow our underlying underwriting excellence to shine through.", "You can see some evidence of that excellence in slide seven, our second-quarter highlights. Our second quarter financial results illustrate why I'm so confident in these core businesses. In a quarter that had exceptional industry-wide losses, our core P&C combined ratio was outstanding and underpinned our 13.3% operating ROE.", "With that, I would like to turn it over to Dave Duclos, our Head of Insurance, to discuss his operations results. Dave?", "David Duclos - Executive Vice President and Chief Executive of Insurance Operations", "I'll speak to slide eight in the presentation that captures insurance financials. We feel good about the results produced in the second quarter, in light of the market conditions that exist. With strong earnings, evidenced by our 94% combined ratio, and revenues coming in slightly below prior year period, we continue to execute our strategy which focuses on retention of existing business and selectively writing new business while carefully extending our reach via product segment and geographic expansion.", "I think it's important, given where we are in the cycle, to provide a bit more color around our premium results for Q2, since we're only seeing a slight reduction compared to prior year on a quarter basis, down 2.1%, and a slight increase on a year-to-date basis, up 0.7% year over year. Similar to the results achieved in the first quarter, our overall retention ratio is coming in as expected for this market and just slightly lower than prior year. While new business flow was down and our writings compared to prior-year quarter are off, as you'd expect in this pricing environment, we have offset some of the market impact as a result of new product capabilities.", "Most noteworthy is the new business impact from our US E&S, US private D&O and global construction units. These initiatives along with others are generating new profitable business, offsetting much of the impact felt in the existing book, where we have also been aided by favorable foreign exchange movements on a quarter and year-to-date basis of $43 million and $109 million, respectively.", "The message here is that our customers and brokers value our franchise, and to a large degree we've managed through both the current market cycle realities and SCA-related noise effectively. The competitive environment remains largely unchanged from what we described last quarter. Depending upon what line and in which part of the world you are, we're seeing decreases in price that range from single digits to high teens.", "We're seeing some exceptions to this where specific classes of business are seeing stronger pricing due to actual results for loss concerns which exist. The best example would be the US financial institution sector.", "On the loss side in the second quarter we saw much of the same as what we reported in our Q1 call. Industry property losses were approximately 50% greater than average for US cats at $6.8 million, and there also were a number of a non-cat loss events.", "We estimate XL Insurance's share of these global Q2 market losses to be approximately 1.3%, a result similar to what was reported in Q1 of this year. This speaks to the disciplined and selective underwriting of our product lines. The insurance segment loss ratio for the second quarter was 7.2 points higher than the previous year quarter after adjusting for prior year development in both quarters. Approximately four points of this difference relates to an increase in property cat losses with the balance attributable to the softening rate environment, where our pricing is down on average 7%, impacting most lines of business, and the increase in our anticipated loss activity in professional lines, which was five points or approximately $14 million for the quarter, which translates into a 1.3 point impact on the segment loss ratio.", "I can also report that the rate of D&O claims related to subprime currently appears to be tailing off with 12 notices in April, five in May and only two in June. It is still early days, but it's a good trend.", "Before turning this over to Jamie, I feel a quick comment regarding the support we've continued to receive from our brokers and customers is warranted. In two words, thank you. We understand the past quarters have been challenging, but your ongoing support of this great franchise and what we bring to the market won't be lost on me or any of my associates. With the SCA closure that Mike spoke of secured, we look forward to continuing to work with our clients and brokers by delivering high-quality risk solutions.", "And now, over to Jamie to comment on Reinsurance Operations.", "James H. Veghte - Executive Vice President & Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations and Chief Executive Officer of XL Reinsurance America Inc.", "Thanks, Dave. I'm turning to Slide nine. Our results this quarter demonstrate how well our reinsurance platform can perform, even in challenging market conditions. We achieved a solid combined ratio of 89% despite the fact the industry has endured significantly above-average catastrophe losses in the first six months of the year. One industry source estimated the insured loss level from global catastrophe losses at 45% above the 10 year average.", "From a top-line perspective, gross written premiums were $397 million for the quarter, which represents a decline of 24% compared to the prior-year quarter. This decline comes from a combination of the following factors. We have seen rate deterioration across the market, which I'll discuss in a moment. In addition, we have previously commented on the tendency of our clients to increase their net retentions, and this practice continued in the second quarter. Third, we have selectively canceled business that does not meet our hurdle rates. We have said repeatedly that our underwriting will not be market share driven, and we adhere to strict underwriting standards across XL Re.", "Finally, we referenced a timing difference of $50 million during our first quarter call which we expected to renew in the second quarter. This renewal did not take place. Trading conditions remain competitive. The second quarter renewal is largely focused on US, though there is also business emanating from Latin America and Asia-Pacific. Renewals and new business opportunities continue to be assessed against well established hurdle rates.", "In the quarter US cat exposed property lines experienced risk-adjusted rate reductions of 10% to 15%, while non-US cat-exposed property lines dropped 10%. Non-catastrophe-exposed property business saw rates decrease 15%. Ocean marine and aviation were off between 5% and 10%.", "Casualty price trends in the US market experienced deterioration of up to 15%. However, the business actually bound by XL Re saw reductions of 10% due to the selective cancellations in this portfolio.", "Finally, I would also like to comment on the effect the SCA situation has had on our business. Our signings on July 1 renewal business were satisfactory. We've had a small number of clients restrict our new and/or renewal activity since then when rating agency actions were taken. Given the time of year we are in, this principally affected the facultative account, and the overall impact has been limited to date. While some competitors have taken this opportunity to attack our franchise, I am personally gratified by the support demonstrated by our clients and brokers. The relationships and technical reputation we've developed over the years has been very beneficial in this period of uncertainty.", "Now that we've put the SCA situation behind us, we would expect our trading relationships to stabilize across the market.", "On the operational side, I would highlight continued progress in our plans for the newly opened Brazilian market. We recently received approval for our admitted license application and work continues to build out our infrastructure in that market.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Sarah Street.", "Sarah E. Street - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer for XL Capital Ltd and Chief Executive Officer of XL Capital Investment Partners Inc.", "Thank you, Jamie, and Good evening, everyone. Today, I'm going to briefly run through this quarter's financial results, which I'll follow with an overview of our plans to realign the portfolio over time to support our focused P&C operations.", "Touching on our results on slide 10, net investment income from P&C operations was $298 million, which declined 8% relative to second quarter of 2007, primarily due to lower investment yields. Following our liquidations associated with our financial lines business, we now hold a higher proportion of floating-rate assets, and our investment income is more sensitive to rate changes at the short end of the US yield curve.", "Our realized gains for the quarter were $2 million including charges of $48 million for other-than-temporary impairments. We continue to diligently scrutinize our topical assets on a security-by-security basis to identify those where we believe we have principal impairment and will not fully recover. Since March 2007, we have taken over to $600 million of OTTI and realized losses on approximately $3 billion of topical assets affected by the mortgage crisis. These OTTI charges have been primarily concentrated in our asset-backed CDO portfolio as well as lower-rated tranches of subprime, Alt-A's and jumbo mortgage-backed securities. Many of these lower-rated securities are now valued on our books at prices ranging between $0.05 and $0.30 on the dollar.", "Our net unrealized losses increased by $707 million during the quarter, which was primarily the result of dramatic rises in both US and UK interest rates partially offset by modest credit spread tightening in both corporate and structured credit.", "We incurred a loss in our investment fund affiliates of $20 million, driven primarily by an 80 basis point negative return for the quarter in our alternative portfolio. These results include March returns, as we record this portfolio on a one month lag. We have demonstrated our ability to generate attractive returns from this portfolio, with an 11% compounded return over the past three years.", "But, as we have noted regularly, it is not always going to be earned evenly between quarters or even across years. We are satisfied with the results, given the turmoil in the markets. We have again posted data on our structured credit portfolio on the web site and have added detail regarding our exposures to agencies.", "The supplemental presentation covers the highlights of our $34.3 billion fixed income portfolio, including its average credit quality, allocations to cash and government securities and provides granular detail on our $10.9 billion structured credit portfolio, which is in aggregate is AA-plus rated and holds 82% AAA bonds. Our exposure to Fannie and Freddie common and preferred stock is de minimis at $18 million.", "Turning to slide 11, I would like to highlight our plans to simplify the investment strategy going forward. A number of the assets that we hold in our fixed income portfolio relate to the legacy financial lines businesses. We will be realigning our portfolio at a time to one that supports our focused P&C operations, with the goal of reducing book value volatility by being less sensitive to credit spread movements. We will continue to hold credit assets, although they will focus on higher credit quality.", "Through a combination of maturities, coupon reinvestment, cash flow from operations and opportunistic sales, we will reduce our allocations in four key asset classes; firstly, those historically held for the financial lines segment, lower-rated corporates, particularly BBB's, financials and CMBS. We have $6 billion of natural cash flow from the portfolio over the next two years, so we can make meaningful progress towards these goals in that time frame.", "I will now hand over to Brian Nocco, our CFO.", "Brian Nocco - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Sarah. As Mike mentioned, we will be significantly enhancing our capital position. We intend to issue $2.5 billion of dual-tranched securities consisting of approximately $2 billion of common stock and $500 million of mandatory convertible securities. We will be exercising our option to convert our $500 million contingent capital facility into preferred stock. Additionally, we announced a 50% reduction in our per-share common dividend. We intend to maintain a strong capital position supportive of our aspirational credit ratings, which are a level higher than our current ratings.", "You can see our actual June 30 capitalization and pro forma for the SCA agreement and planned capital actions. As you can see, our total capitalization is projected to increase by $1.4 billion. Additionally, our debt to capital ratio is projected to decrease from 18% to 14%. Based on discussions with the rating agencies, as Mike mentioned, we expect our ratings to been affirmed at current levels, although some of our outlooks are likely to be negative.", "There's some noise in our earnings in the second quarter and there will be more in the third. The second quarter reflects $82 million in charges related to SCA exposures. The third quarter will reflect a charge of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion related to the SCA agreement. We also expect to record charges of $50 million to $60 million in the second half of the year related to our expense reduction initiative.", "As you heard from Dave and Jamie, we achieved solid underwriting results in the second quarter. On an aggregate basis, premiums were down, reflecting where we are in the cycle, more in reinsurance than insurance. We had positive prior-year development of $183 million in the quarter, partially offset by property catastrophe losses of $98 million. Our combined ratio was 92.3%.", "As Sarah mentioned, income from investment affiliates was down in the quarter due to the turbulent investment markets. Our total operating expenses of $298 million for the quarter were lower than last year's $307 million, when SCA's expenses were included. Excluding SCA, they would have been $287 million.", "And our Life Operations, which Mike referred to as the subject of a strategic review, contributed earnings of $28 million in the second quarter compared to $25 million in the previous-year quarter.", "And now we can open it up to Q&A.", "David Radulski - Investor Relations", "Abigail, before you open it up for Q&A, this is David Radulski again, I will remind you that since we are currently in the process of offering securities we must limit our discussion today, including the responses that we give to your questions, to information filed in our public documents. Now, Abigail, can you give instructions for the dial-in?", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Jay Gelb with Lehman Brothers. Your line is open.", "Jay Gelb - Lehman Brothers", "Mike, can you talk about on a strategic level what you would view the target business mix being between commercial insurance and reinsurance for XL?", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "The exact mix between the two is something we're still reviewing. Clearly, those are the two core operations and one that deliver the lion's share of what goes on around here, especially under this simplified model.", "But we haven't set a precise ratio between the business, and they will vary over time. As you may have noticed before, in the way we think of them strategically, the different businesses have different advantages. In Dave's operations, we have this global platform advantage that limits the number of competitors that can do the kind of business we do, but in Jamie's operation we have this real ability to grow and shrink according to market conditions and that alone disrupts any predictive relationship you would have between the writings across the two enterprises. And we'll be judged by market conditions, Jay. But there's no formulaic thing in place.", "Jay Gelb - Lehman Brothers", "Okay and the separately on the capital raise with the charge anticipated being up to $1.5 billion and then you're raising more capital than that. So does that imply that there is a deficient capital position? Or, maybe you could explain that.", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "Not deficient, but we did want to come out of this and in our constant consultations with the rating agencies, they wanted us to come out of this in a strongly capitalized position relative even to our aspirational ratings. It was important to us to do so. And you'll notice in the quarter, as was described by Sarah, we did have $707 million in negative marks in the quarter. In our investment portfolio, obviously, we still have those as money good and expect them to come back. But at the same time, the rating agencies do take those kinds of movements into account. So, when you take all of that together, this drove us to this size of capital raise.", "Additionally, I would add, look, we have been getting noise from the investment portfolio. We are entering a volatile time, entering hurricane season. And, it was wise to us, if we were going to be in the markets raising capital, that we would raise it sufficient to be comfortable even going into those times before we can -- so that we would not be back to you. And that was the idea behind this size of raise.", "Jay Gelb - Lehman Brothers", "Okay thanks very much and best of luck.", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Alain Karaoglan of Banc of America. Your line is open.", "Alain Karaoglan - Banc of America", "Good afternoon, two questions. In terms of the $1.8 billion in cash to be paid to SCA, could you tell us what the rationale was and your thought process into coming up with that number? And in terms of the loss of $1.5 billion, what are the components of that? Is it just the 1.8 tax affected, or what happens to the reinsurance reserve that you had put up, if you could describe that a little bit more?", "And the second question relates to people. Mike, do you have any concern about keeping people within the XL franchise in order to be able to continue to write the business that you want to write, both on insurance and reinsurance?", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. So, I have that as -- Alain, by the way, it's nice to talk to you again. I have that in two pieces. One, how do we come up with the number, how do we justify this number, and what's the difference between the 1.8 in cash and the 1.4 to 1.5 that we are talking about for a charge into Q3? And then, second about people, any concerns about retaining them and what efforts will we make?", "First, as to the amount of payment, we looked at this across three economic points of view and then a business point of view. Informing our judgment on the three economic points of view were, number one, the amount of a notional exposure. When you are kind of $65 billion, $66 billion in notional exposure, there is obviously a value to no longer have that theoretical exposure to you. And that has a value, so that's the first prism.", "The second prism is our own ground-up analysis of the exposures. And, those of you have been studying our website in prior quarters would have known\u2026 and I've heard it done by many analysts\u2026 amounts of our view at that time of $900 million to $1.1 billion of ground-up exposures to SCA.", "I would add very quickly, though, that I would have argued that those numbers were right until very late in June, when we were informed by SCA and it was expressed as being to their surprise and to ours. But you'll get a chance to ask them themselves in their calls. But we were informed that they had had very substantial deterioration during the quarter, that there were some differences in how things were playing out that many of you shared with us before, and that would have influenced our view of that number somewhat higher. So that's the second fact you need to know is, that number was accurate until we got that information. And you'll be able to see their own release for a description of what was going on there.", "And then a third economic point of view is, of course, as you see in their release, and particularly the release from the New York Insurance Department this evening, there was the specter of a potential seizure by that department. And you all know that with a seizure, those CDS contracts, the swap contracts, would have acceleration triggers, bringing those negative marks immediately full and payable due as claims that clearly would have arrived at us, because that would have been tens of billions of dollars of claim to SCA, and even in the pre-IPO section of that book of business would have represented somewhere between $3 billion and $5 billion of claims to XL.", "So, when we looked across those three economic data points, it was our judgment that this particular settlement, we talk about it as about $1.9 billion when you add in the 8 million\u2026 value of the 8 million shares, plus the cash, plus the stock returned to them of their own. That's why we judged that this size of solution was, in fact, in the interest of our shareholders, and we do think it represents, as indicated by the various regulators, a full and fair consideration for the extinguishment of our exposures.", "Now, your\u2026 as to your\u2026sorry. And then, when you add that economic backdrop, you would add a business judgment. I mean it's simply true that, as the rating agencies were raising the pressure in recent weeks, the noise around SCA was getting to levels that we thought it was best to dispose of as quickly and rationally as possible. That had always been our theme, but clearly, our urgency was increased by the sense that the clock was ticking and that there could be, in the future, damage to the franchise if we didn't get this behind us. We were starting to see the signs that gave us pause.", "Now, as Dave and Jamie have both spoken to, we think we have avoided that risk. We saw very little actual damage and now, with this solution, can go back and think, re-establish our place in the market in a fine way. So those were the four points of view, three economic and one of business judgment that led to our belief that this was an appropriate consideration.", "Then about people, well, you've got it right, Alain. People are our core asset. That's true of all businesses, I suppose, but it is particularly true here, when you're writing some of the world's most complex risks. We are known for the quality of our underwriting prowess, and we intend to keep it. I can report to you a few things.", "Number one, I'll ask Brian\u2026 excuse me\u2026 I will ask Dave Duclos and Jamie Veghte to quickly talk about the retention of their people in their operations. But to add weight to that, we will be, as I described earlier, doing a highly targeted, and I emphasize highly targeted, set of options grants to key customer-facing people particularly in order to give them a real incentive for this next phase and to energize and retain those people.", "As I've already described, to the extent those are used for the senior team that reports to me, first of all, I will not participate. But to the extent they are used for senior people who report to me, there will be a significant performance feature. In fact, I can share with you the total amount of shares involved is 2.8 million or thereabouts. This will be in our 8-K.", "And I can share with you that for those that are done for the senior team, there will be a 130% performance rate hurdle. And moreover, this won't even be priced until 10 days after the capital raise is done, to give the market time to calm down and not take advantage of the particular effects of the market raise. We were very thoughtful, I think, in designing this in an investor-friendly way.", "I think that will go long ways as well. And then, finally, we'll get out there and communicate again. It's been frustrating for our investors, it's been frustrating for us in management, and it's been frustrating for our colleagues, clients and brokers that, during this period, we were engaged in confidential, highly sensitive and intense negotiations and could not communicate fully, as we would have wished. We are happy to be\u2026 finally be able to talk again.", "And I'm reminded, by the way, that's with respect to people. I'll ask Jamie and Dave to follow up in a second. But I'm reminded, there was a second part of your ask on the SCA settlement. Yes, in total, it's about $1.9 billion when you add in the stock transfer, and that will be netted down to get to the charge for the third quarter by reversing out that which we had reserved around the FAC and the excessive loss and even a small amount that it was now reserved at the end of the third quarter of $58 million around the guarantee itself. So that's how you get to that gross number.", "Jamie and Dave?", "James H. Veghte - Executive Vice President & Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations and Chief Executive Officer of XL Reinsurance America Inc.", "We haven't loss any personnel over this issue. Our attrition rates are at historic levels, and no loss of key underwriters, whatsoever. Mike, Dave and I are hitting the road tomorrow to go visit many of them around the world. We're looking forward to getting them back, energized and excited about going forward.", "David Duclos - Executive Vice President and Chief Executive of Insurance Operations", "Yes. From an insurance perspective, Alain, I would have the same comment as Jamie. We have had some blip up, if you will, in our retention of staff post comp distribution in mid-March, but actually May and June retention levels have come back to historical numbers. And when we have lost people, and this speaks to the value, I think, of the franchise, even within the last 10 days we have been able to attract new talent into the organization from some reputable firms. And we are very proud of that.", "Alain Karaoglan - Banc of America", "In terms of the commutation, are you comfortable that it's done, once you do it, it's done, and it cannot come back to XL?", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, we're highly confident that this will stand any test. First of all, there's no provision, once closed, for it to come back from any particular source. Second, let me clarify, since it's a moment to do it, let me clarify that there is one small set of contracts that is outside of this agreement. It's referenced in the press release and elsewhere. But that is the European investment bank risks.", "Now, that is $1.1 billion in notional value. It relates to public infrastructure projects in the EU. Its seven contracts, five projects, for example, include toll roads, a couple of toll roads, a hospital, this kind of thing. It is performing well, according to surveillance. It's BBB rated, on average, according to S&P. And, you have to understand that our guarantee of SCA's wrap only applies to the principal and interest payments. So it's a diminishing risk. And it can only be triggered if those projects fail, first.", "And second, if then claims were presented to SCA, due to the project's failures that they could not pay, only then would we be involved. And so you know, the contract actually specifies that SCA will continue to use commercially best efforts to extinguish those contracts as well. They were just too complicated and viewed as too benign to worry about, and so we chose not to hold up the deal over those contracts.", "And in fact, in the contract, it requires further that if those contracts do stay in place, that they are attached to the largest capital pool remaining at SCA. So we feel very comfortable with that. I wanted to make you clear. I knew that was going to come up at some point. I thought I'd address it now.", "And then your\u2026 the larger question is, what's the way this could somehow come undone. And the most discussed risk\u2026 and by the way, I refer you all to the public documents, the prospectus on the public offering. That's where you are going to get all of the lawyer representations and all that, and that is the governing risk profile. But I will say to you this.", "We had to make this decision as a Board and as businesspeople and judge the effectiveness of this solution. Our driving force throughout was that it be economically rational, which I answered in part one of your question; and then, second, that it be durable, that it stand the test of time and that it be behind us.", "The most discussed risk is the risk of fraudulent conveyance. In other words, that some policyholder could later sue that somehow this risk was wrongly transferred. Our greatest protection to that, and we think it is extraordinarily strong, is the fact that the Department of Delaware, the Superintendent of New York and that department in New York, and the BMA have approved this deal today and declared it to be fair and full consideration for the extinguishment of these risks. And you can judge for yourself, well, that the regulator whose legal concern is the policyholder would not do that without it in fact reaching to that level.", "And I will give you another point that is important in respect to this. The fact is that because the specter of insolvency was in play toward the end of these negotiations, the facilitated negotiations with the department included the CDS counterparties or at least a significant number of them represented in coalition by a law firm.", "This, to us, was in a sense bad news because you knew with them involved, it brought in the $3 billion to $5 billion theoretical claims and was going to raise the cost. And we knew, with the department governing it, they would be governing it for all time, and as a department they sure weren't going to do anything on the cheap.", "But at the same time, we viewed it as substantially strengthening our agreement because it would be clear that the counterparties of the greatest size of the claim would be involved in establishing the right level. And we knew that that would give even greater confidence to the departments to put their blessing on the deal.", "As a result, our lawyers have described the risks of this transaction as losing in any subsequent lawsuit, should there be one, as remote. We're highly confident that we will prevail and that SCA is behind us.", "And one last point with respect to those CDS counterparties; we were waiting for news on this throughout the day because many of them offered to sign the agreement itself, and in fact that has been happening throughout the day. They have until the deal closes to keep signing up, so there could be more, later. But as of the signing of the master agreement today, thirteen counterparties, representing a substantial majority of SCA's total and notional amount of ABS, CDO counter\u2026 CDO exposures and this would be exclusive of SCA's Merrill Lynch ABS CDO exposures, which were separately negotiated and are, by their own announcement, separately extinguishes.", "Now, when I say those thirteen that will represent 97% of the total notional amount of the ABS CDOs written by SCA prior to the IPO. So we see this as behind us.", "Alain Karaoglan - Banc of America", "Thank you very much.", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "Of course, we get the releases at the closing.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jay Cohen with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Jay Cohen - Merrill Lynch", "Yeah, thank you, two questions. First is, Mike, as you looked at the Company, obviously, the one business that sort of jumped out is a potential change to the Life Reinsurance business. What about the investments you have and the investment managers? That's clearly not a core business and probably carried less than those investments are worth. Is that something that you have considered or will consider?", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "I'm well aware of these affiliates. They are an example of some of the smaller activities that I'm continuing to review. We have no announcement to make at this time, but you can bet that I'm continuing to review all of our activities. And, bluntly, we're down to smaller activities that I'm examining into the future. Obviously, kind of the headline announcement is the strategic expiration on the Life Re business.", "Jay Cohen - Merrill Lynch", "That's fair, thanks Mike.", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "Good luck, Jay.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dan Johnson with Citadel Investment. Your line is open.", "Dan Johnson - Citadel Investment", "All right, thank you very much. All right, can we go into the segment line by line premium disclosures; the other property line, if you would, in contrast, obviously, to the casualty lines, which were down an expected fair amount, the other property line was up quite a bit. Can you just remind me what's in there, and is that well, let's just do that.", "David Duclos - Executive Vice President and Chief Executive of Insurance Operations", "What's in the other property line that represents the growth is actually our construction business. We've expanded our global construction capabilities, both product and resources, and that represents the majority of the growth you're seeing in that line.", "Dan Johnson - Citadel Investment", "Would you mind talking a little bit more about that business in terms of risks that are going in?", "David Duclos - Executive Vice President and Chief Executive of Insurance Operations", "It would be a combination of infrastructure, energy, high valued properties. It's a product and service capability that we've developed over the years, and it's a global product offering. In fact, we are seeing a good share of our growth in emerging markets, in particular the Middle East, Asia so it's a global product. It combines the product capacity and technical engineering capabilities, which has just been supplemented with the recent acquisition of GAPS.", "Dan Johnson - Citadel Investment", "Great, thanks, that's all I have.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan", "Good morning or good afternoon, sorry for one day. A question on the amount of capital raise. Is another way to think about this that if you look at the shareholders' equity of the Company, there's obviously quite a bit of minority interest associated with some of the affiliates? And as a consequence, you need to raise excess because, effectively, some of that holding company capital in the form of those investments just isn't liquid, to make good on the cash obligation, etcetera?", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "No, that would not be correct. The reasons are for those specified. We wanted to have space to our aspirational ratings. We knew that there was noise coming up both out of the kind of marks we've seen in the investment portfolio, hurricane season. We have the need for the cash to cover the payment, so that will go out in the third quarter with the charge of the $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. Then, we have the marks in this second quarter of the $707 million.", "Those were the driving forces, and ultimate driving force in this is our ratings. That is the game changing event here, and that is what we're pursuing, is getting those ratings stabilized and then, over time, hopefully improving them.", "Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan", "Can you just remind me, then, how much of the\u2026 what the stat capital looks like or surplus looks like in the insurance entities, and then just where the losses are going to be incurred, from a legal perspective?", "Brian Nocco - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "I don't have to stat capital of each of the insurance entities in front of me. We'll be happy to follow up with you later on that. The lion's share of the liability to SCA will be paid out of XLI Bermuda, which is the entity that issued the guarantee.", "Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan", "Got you and then, on the Life Reinsurance side, can you talk about what percentage of your invested assets and what percentage of the topical assets you break out are actually on that balance sheet?", "Sarah E. Street - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer for XL Capital Ltd and Chief Executive Officer of XL Capital Investment Partners Inc.", "Yes, the assets in that portfolio at this point are $7 billion, as there is minimal negligible topical assets.", "Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan", "Okay and then, the last question, Michael was just; you made this comment in the press release about keeping some of the expenses save available for reinvestment. I know its early days on this, but from your experience in the past, what would you consider a normal reinvestment?", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "That savings on a year-over-year basis winds up being about $70 million and I would expect to see some of that reinvested. You've heard projects already discussed in the press release like operational transformation and such. But all of that said, I do expect to drop a substantial portion of that $70 million to the bottom line.", "Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan", "Okay and then\u2026", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "But we haven't given color around the exact amount.", "Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan", "No, that's fair. And is it fair to say that that doesn't contemplate any changes from where you sit today? In other words, if you decided, your review with life decided it was to be sold or some other disposition, that doesn't\u2026 whatever expense ramifications that has would be incremental, not inclusive?", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "That would have no relationship to that $70 million\u2026", "Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan", "Okay", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "We still capture the $70 million.", "Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan", "Just wanted to make sure, thank you.", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "No; I totally understand. And by the way, on this topic of savings, I want to be clear. Because we're streamlining the Company, this is an opportunity. And it's one that we should take. It's painful that there will be people impacts, obviously. But we thought this was the time to do it and to get sailing set for better days, and that's the work ahead.", "But no one should be confused. This remains a world-class employer of world-class talent. We are not thinking or confused about who we are. And this isn't going to turn into some cheap commodity play. That's not the thinking that. The thinking was, we've changed the way we are approaching governing our business; we should change the way in which we, therefore, our cost structures. But this is done, and then we will manage our business with a traditional eye, keeping expenses under control into the future.", "Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan", "Okay, fair enough, appreciate that.", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Vinay Misquith with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse", "Hi, good evening. I believe you mentioned that you made a few hires. Could you just add some more color on that? And, Mike, if you could share with us your plans, if you plan to make some more higher-profile hires for the Company?", "David Duclos - Executive Vice President and Chief Executive of Insurance Operations", "Yes, I'll comment on the hires comment. Actually, from an insurance perspective, it comes in two general categories. Part of it is related to our organic growth strategy, and we've continued to hire new underwriters into the organization that complement or add to our current capabilities. We've also made hires in our risk engineering area. And the last area where we've had a focus most recently and it relates to what Mike just mentioned about operational transformation, we are starting to hire people into the organization with strong operational orientation.", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "Good this is Mike. In terms of the senior management team, it is substantially present. The people who will be in this direct reporting relationship to me, starting with Dave and Jamie, whom you are listening to, they are here and ready to go. I have mentioned already that Susan Cross, our -- it's in the release, I believe -- our Chief Actuary, will be stepping onto that senior team as well, to give it the right kind of balance and weight.", "I am very pleased with all of that. There's one place for certain that I'll make an add, and that is, as has been advertised, we are down to what I think are going to be the finalists for the chief enterprise risk officer position. That continues to work toward a close. And we are very pleased with the quality of candidates that we have in that effort.", "And then finally, with the change with Spike [ph] Lavelle, who was running our global business services and with that being broken into the businesses, it remains an open question whether I will choose to have someone on the senior team as a direct report who is focused on what you might call a simplified OT at the corporate strategic level. But that's a decision I'll make in time and not ready to make today.", "Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse", "So, I think it was mentioned that on the primary insurance side you lost a few people after March. Have you managed to replace those people?", "James H. Veghte - Executive Vice President & Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations and Chief Executive Officer of XL Reinsurance America Inc.", "Yes, we have.", "Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse", "Okay fair enough", "James H. Veghte - Executive Vice President & Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations and Chief Executive Officer of XL Reinsurance America Inc.", "Actually, as I mentioned before, in addition to replacing existing positions, we've hired new underwriters to complement existing capabilities. But I would make a comment that, as we've gone through this process of transitioning staff, we've actually upgraded in some areas.", "Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse", "The second question was on the investment portfolio. Obviously, you're restructuring it. Should we expect to see a lower yield on your total portfolio because of that and, of course, lower risk?", "Sarah E. Street - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer for XL Capital Ltd and Chief Executive Officer of XL Capital Investment Partners Inc.", "It very much will depend upon what interest rates are at the time that we restructure it in terms of when we reinvest any of the proceeds. So I think it really very much comes down to what you think will happen in interest rates going forward.", "Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse", "Do you expect to sell off some of your topical assets?", "Sarah E. Street - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer for XL Capital Ltd and Chief Executive Officer of XL Capital Investment Partners Inc.", "We are certainly going to work very diligently to reposition the portfolio. We did spend a lot of time in the quarter considering whether we should accelerate the realignment of the portfolio by taking an OTTI charge associated with the change to intent to hold. We made a conclusion that, given the fact that we have such strong cash flow coming out of the portfolio, including, actually, out of the topical, we get quite a lot of cash flow out of the topical on a quarterly basis, that actually we could achieve a lot of the repositioning over time.", "But that's something that we will consider, we'll continue to consider over time and we may make that change.", "Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse", "So would it be fair to assume that it's more of a longer term goal and not some short-term change in your investment portfolio?", "Sarah E. Street - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer for XL Capital Ltd and Chief Executive Officer of XL Capital Investment Partners Inc.", "That is certainly the current plan is that we work ourselves out some of these assets over time, yes.", "Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse", "Okay thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ian Gutterman with Adage Capital Management. Your line is open.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management", "Hi Mike, few questions I guess first the ESU that comes due in February, the $750 million, can you talk about your plans? Will that just convert or do you have plans to buy back the dilution depending on what happens between now and then?", "Brian Nocco - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "You're correct. We have got roughly $750 million of ESUs which convert to equity in February of next year. We do not plan to repurchase shares to offset that. That's capital that we generally do get credit from our rating agencies for and was considered in conjunction with the capital raise to support the business.", "With respect to the debt that would be associated with those ESUs and the remarketing of that debt, it actually is our intention to retire that debt.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management", "Okay so I guess -- I know this has been asked, Mike, but if I can try it one more time. I guess I am a little confused, still, and maybe this is just the rating agencies are playing hardball these days. But a $1.5 billion charge, you are raising $3 billion in capital, essentially. That's 2X the charge. I understand there's the investment losses and there's cat season. But, given the price of the stock that seems to be either incredibly conservative or you really had a big gun to your head. Why couldn't you do some other shareholder-friendly things, like have sold the Life Reinsurance quicker, sold off the hedge funds, things like that, to try to reduce the pain and not issue so many shares?", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "First of all, I want to be clear that you may be assured that the punitive nature of such a capital raise weighed very much on our thinking. And we explored everything we could think of that would have made it less painful.", "The fact is that, as we got into the last and frenzied parts of these negotiations, alternatives that I had seen widely reported in the analyst community particularly simply became unrealistic given the demands for cash and the requirement that to make the this deal that it be immediately funded, or shortly thereafter.", "And that really left us subject to a public raise. There would not have been the opportunity to raise money through any of the other mechanisms you have described in an orderly way in the time frame that was required to satisfy the extinguishment of the SCA exposure.", "We made the judgment that for this franchise's long-term health and the ability to earn back over time for our shareholders what they have lost, that we have made our judgment that the most important thing was to get SCA behind us and that that would require a capital raise as a method of funding.", "Now, we also thought long and hard about the size of the raise and it pained us to need to take it to this level. But I have already described the reasons. They are what they are and I would never comment negatively on the rating agencies, given the way they hold our lives in their hands. But the reality is that you are well aware of their situation and the pressures that come from their situation and they were very aggressive with us. And we have been responsive.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management", "Fair enough, and I wouldn't expect to do the same thing in negatives [ph]. I'll take the hit on that one. Just a follow-up. When you mentioned, again, part of this is having --", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "They've been thoughtful with us. Look they've been in constant contact with us, absolutely.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management", "When you said part of this is to make sure you don't have to come back for the investment portfolio or hurricanes and so forth, can you give us a sense of how big a hurricane you think you can handle without the agencies asking you to raise more capital?", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. Look, we have talked publicly about how significantly we have reduced our hurricane season exposure. When you get into events like Katrina, for example, when we model it today as opposed to what we took then, you get a 40% reduction in the losses.", "We talked about that publicly. I, by the way, have spent a lot of time being educated by Susan and others about how we have done our risk management around class risk in major events and I am satisfied that, since the days of KRW, this firm has come a great ways.", "So we are in a situation now where, for our Tier 1 events, we have a maximum possible loss limit that we have that we are -- that is in these public filings of 10% of our shareholders equity. We are managing below that level today. That includes the shareholders equity. That's at a 1% likelihood event that was one in a 100. And with that in place, we are below it. Will be below it after this capital is raised. And with that kind of event, we do not expect to be back at the window, which is why we've raised it this way.", "Now, look, we can all sit around and we're in the business of doing so, I suppose, and I imagine some way, way out on the tail event that might cause the whole marketplace to be back at the window. But is there anything we see coming at us in this hurricane season or the noise in our investment portfolio? We always expect to be raising capital again. We think that's critical.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management", "That's great. I was just going to make sure we were at a sufficient number. So that's very helpful.", "And then just a couple little small ones, the European exposure. That remains; you said SCA is trying to commute that. If they do commute that, could you have a small charge for that in the future or would they bear that? I wasn't clear on that.", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "It is expected to be borne by them. But look, the bottom line is its minor and they are supposed to use commercially best efforts and we expect them to do so.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management", "Okay and the very last one he senior debt you're retiring, can you just explain why you are retiring debt at the same time you're issuing capital?", "Brian Nocco - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. This is a private placement that had provisions in it similar to our bank agreements that we didn't violate any financial covenants, but it had restrictions in relative to transactions with affiliates. And, while we requested and achieved waivers from all of our banks, that in the case of the private placement, it was deemed more prudent to simply retire it or redeem it early.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management", "Okay, that makes sense. Thank you for all the time and good luck.", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "Before we get to our next question, I want to add something, since it's likely to come up later if it doesn't now. You've opened the question, sort of the size of the raise, and you could step back and say, boy, you are de-risking the franchise if you are successful with that. You've talked about how well you are managing your hurricane exposure. This is a very, very large capital raise, even relative to the SCA payment.", "A logical question then comes, when you are exploring the Life Re operations and what you can do there, and the logical question comes, I suppose, why so much, and where does that lead us? Could that lead us to an excess capital position over time and I just want to make it very clear that the size of the raise is heavily influenced by our need to have ourselves at the right level, day one, after funding SCA. So that is why you get to the size.", "Now, if you go out into the future, you should observe, if you've followed my work before, that I'm not a believer in insurance firms keeping money beyond that which is comfortable to their ratings away from their investors unless they're putting it to work. So you may recall, when I was at Safeco, those of you who don't know, we had a significant moment after we got that franchise turned around where we sold some businesses that were no longer core to us, and in selling those businesses wound up having a lot of capital. And, since we couldn't find a way to put that to work at the profit levels we were enjoying, we chose the method of a special dividend to get that capital back to our shareholders.", "Later with that same franchise we began again, through our strong earnings, to deliver more capital than we could put to work. And in that case, we used the method of significant buybacks in order to, again, get our capital back out in a way that we thought was shareholder-friendly. So I don't believe in holding onto a bunch of your shareholders money unless you can put it to work very usefully. I do believe in being comparable relative to aspirational ratings, and that's it. And we won't wait until we have those ratings. We will evaluate capital and its uses right along, and we will view that in the shareholder friendly way.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Susan Spivak with Wachovia. Your line is open.", "Susan Spivak - Wachovia", "Good morning, just a couple of questions, quick numbers question. On page 13, where you do the pro forma cap, how many shares are you assuming for that $29 '09 book value number? That's number one. And then I was just wondering, Mike, if you could give us some kind of projection of what you expect when you do sell the life health reinsurance company. In what range should we expect proceeds from that to be, if you'll answer that?", "And then, finally, Jamie, could you talk about\u2026 we know that the ratings issue has some impact on the FAC business on the reinsurance side. That happened now in July, but the real renewal season for that business is coming up in December and January and how do you feel as if you'll be positioned for that important renewal season in that line?", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "Well, why don't you let me start, because I want to make sure it's very clear to everyone on this call. When we talk about life, we are exploring strategic alternatives. We have not decided what we will do, Susan, so I just want to make that point of emphasis crystal clear. For what it's worth, you would observe for yourself in our numbers that the capital behind the business is about $420 million right now. But again, we're just exploring what we'll do in the future.", "I'll turn it over, for the question on the pro forma, to Brian and then to Jamie.", "Brian Nocco - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "On the book value per share, it, of course, reflects the payment on the SCA transaction as well as all of the capital actions we've announced. Because we had to pick a number relative to the issue price, we used, for purpose of this chart last Tuesday's close of $19.68 per-share. And that's what's reflected in the numbers.", "Susan Spivak - Wachovia", "How many shares are there?", "Brian Nocco - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "The total number of shares after the capital raise is 289 million shares. I also will mention that in February of next year is when the current ESUs, the $745 million of ESUs that are currently on the books, convert into common stock. It's approximately 11 million shares converting at $65 a share. So actually, it will be $0.59 per-share accretive to book value when that occurs. So that $29.09 would adjust upwards.", "James H. Veghte - Executive Vice President & Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations and Chief Executive Officer of XL Reinsurance America Inc.", "Hi Susan, we have been given assurances by many of the companies that have chosen to take some action that, once we get the SCA situation behind us and our ratings situations clarified, then we'll go back to normal commercial relationships. I'm very optimistic that we have kept the damage to a limited level.", "Susan Spivak - Wachovia", "Well, when they say get their relationship with the rating agencies back to normal, does that mean off of negative credit watch? And have they given you any indication of when that would happen?", "James H. Veghte - Executive Vice President & Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations and Chief Executive Officer of XL Reinsurance America Inc.", "I can't speculate on what each company will do. They've said the ratings situation clarified.", "Brian Nocco - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "This is Brian and let me address, as best I can, the rating agency. We expect all of the negative watches to come off in a relatively moderate period of time. Now, some of the agencies may continue to have negative outlooks, which is partly related to cycle and partly waiting for the dust to settle around all these transactions. But we expect negative watches to be resolved.", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "And we believe, with our ratings affirmed, that that will give us the ammunition to go back to those who were giving us noise. And I should tell you, that process isn't going to wait for future days. We've already started. We've already been reaching out to our broker partners and walking them through this and getting ready to go to work.", "Susan Spivak - Wachovia", "And the capital raise, what's the date that that needs to be completed? Is that August 15th? Am I reading that right?", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "August 15th is the last date by which we can finance. But obviously, we expect it to\u2026 we expect a successful capital raise much sooner than that. But that is the end of our opportunity to fund.", "Susan Spivak - Wachovia", "Okay, great, thank you very much for your answer.", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "Okay", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Josh Shanker with Citi. Your line is open.", "Josh Shanker - Citigroup", "Thank you, a few quickies; I just want to follow up on Alain's question about the charge. The $1.775 billion that comes to $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion\u2026 that's pretax and post-tax are the same?", "James H. Veghte - Executive Vice President & Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations and Chief Executive Officer of XL Reinsurance America Inc.", "Most of this is out of Bermuda, so the tax benefit is quite small.", "Josh Shanker - Citigroup", "Okay.", "James H. Veghte - Executive Vice President & Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations and Chief Executive Officer of XL Reinsurance America Inc.", "And the charge in total is $1.9 billion. It includes the value of the 8 million shares of stock.", "Josh Shanker - Citigroup", "Okay, thank you very much. Second question, of the $1.6 billion in AOCI, how much of that currently relates to interest rate movements, do you think?", "Sarah E. Street - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer for XL Capital Ltd and Chief Executive Officer of XL Capital Investment Partners Inc.", "Not to differentiate, but I would say most of the ACOI at this point has really been driven by credit over the last 12 months.", "Josh Shanker - Citigroup", "And so the interest rate hit that for this quarter gave back gains that you had previously on the books?", "Sarah E. Street - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer for XL Capital Ltd and Chief Executive Officer of XL Capital Investment Partners Inc.", "Correct, yes.", "Josh Shanker - Citigroup", "Third, when you talk about having aspirational capital, do the rating agencies share your view just on pure capital that, after this deal gets done, that the capital at XL will be far and away higher than what it would need if that were the only issue at the Company?", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "We've been in constant contact. That is for them to say, not for us. But I can assure you that that was what we were driving toward, and that is where we believe we will be.", "Josh Shanker - Citigroup", "Okay and finally, let's just say SCA can turn things around. What would be the status of those shares put into the trust?", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "That is really for the Department of New York, SCA and the others to work through. I think you can take it, given that the counterparties, the CDS counterparties, were significant participants in the design of the solution. I think you can take it that they will have a real interest in where those shares go, particularly in terms of establishing governance over the\u2026 especially in establishing governance over where SCA goes from here. But it's really not our issue. Our issue is that we need to give them those shares, and they will go from there.", "Josh Shanker - Citigroup", "Okay, thank you for your quick answers and having all my questions answered.", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "And remember that, at the point that we're transferring them, we hold those at zero on our balance sheet. We'd already written them down.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from William Wilt with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "William Wilt - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks for that, two quick numbers questions, the first for Jamie on Slide nine, the reinsurance results, but its\u2026 I guess it's shown as a 14.7-point deterioration in the accident year loss ratio, including cats, in the reinsurance segment, looked like maybe four or five points of CAT was the difference last year to this year, which would\u2026 if that is right, then that would leave about a 10-point deterioration. I just wondered if, A, if that's right; B, if you could add some color as to the reasons for that level of deterioration.", "James H. Veghte - Executive Vice President & Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations and Chief Executive Officer of XL Reinsurance America Inc.", "The difference was 6.1 points from increased cat activity, 3 points from some losses from our XL financial solutions structured indemnity portfolio and 5.6 points from a variety of other issues, including a small adjustment in our sub-prime exposure in London and some reserve strengthening in our European trade credit portfolio.", "William Wilt - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, thanks for that. So those sum up to the\u2026 those are the sources of the 14.7?", "James H. Veghte - Executive Vice President & Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations and Chief Executive Officer of XL Reinsurance America Inc.", "Correct.", "William Wilt - Morgan Stanley", "Perfect, thanks, the second numbers question, I'm sorry if I'm being a bit slow on this, in the share count, the $2.1 billion of capital raise at whatever price, at least a certain number of shares plus, then, in addition to that 8 million shares, newly issued shares related to going to SCA? Is that the math, $2.1 billion\u2026", "Brian Nocco - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Sorry if it wasn't clear. It's $2 billion that we've assumed in the capital raise. And of course, as we have firmed this up on pricing, we might tilt a little bit more one way or the other on the mix between common and mandatory converts. The total we'll raise will be $2.5 billion. This assumes $2 billion in the capital raise. The 0.1 actually relates to the 8 million shares that we're giving to SCA.", "William Wilt - Morgan Stanley", "All right, I see, okay, perfect, thank you very much. Good luck.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steven Labbe with Langen McAlenney. Your line is open.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "It's actually Bob Glasspiegel, how're you doing, Mike? Can I guess, we say good evening, not Good morning or Good afternoon, although it feels like all three. Investments, I think you said, from your perspective; that was a minor issue relative to, certainly, SCA. You haven't gone through it fully. I was wondering, to what extent, given that we're talking about four times your capital, there's a lot of leverage if any of those numbers or valuations are wrong. But can you say we've got your seal of approval, subject to market swings, from here? Or, does that still need some time for you to go through and get comfortable?", "Sarah E. Street - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer for XL Capital Ltd and Chief Executive Officer of XL Capital Investment Partners Inc.", "I think, as Mike and Brian have talked about, we've done a lot of work on modeling in terms of what we think could happen in the investment portfolio in relation to our capital. And that was factored in, in terms of the analysis of how much capital we wanted to raise.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "So, Mike, you feel comfortable with the investment portfolio to date? The reason I ask the question is, I see in the S&P commentary, clearly, the charges that have been going on, nags at them and sort of relative to the enterprise risk management, and you've announced some changes with your enterprise risk management.", "So I guess it just leaves the question whether this is still a work in process or something that has been given your stamp of approval.", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "Bob, I appreciate the question. Look, we are certainly comfortable with our investment portfolio. There are clearly classes of investments we are in today that are not traditional for a pure P&C play. We got into them as a result of getting into these financial lines businesses, which we are now exited. And we would like, therefore, to rework or reposition the portfolio away from those classes of instruments.", "So we really have the opportunity to do that because we generate so much cash and because the portfolio itself generates sufficient capital to be able to rework it. But it takes a fair amount of time, given conditions in the marketplace, of course, a lot of these instruments are not that easy to trade. And of course, there are limitations because of a fair amount of this we view as money good, and therefore, it's held to maturity.", "So there are boundaries around how much we can do over a period of time. To your point, though, would we continue to look at it hard and keep being thoughtful about how we could reduce the sources of risk? Yes, you bet we will. We have examined carefully alternatives to it. We have thought them through.", "We have noticed other players in the market that are using some of those opportunities. And I will keep thinking about it. So I wouldn't say to you that there could be no more change announced in that area, but I can say, as we come to the end of this period, I am comfortable with where we are and the plan going forward.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "Thanks for that thoughtful answer Mike and best of luck.", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "Bob I appreciate nice talking to you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill & Partners. Your line is open.", "Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners", "Good evening, thanks for the call. Just one big picture question, could you talk a little bit more, perhaps, about maybe the possibility of plan B? Your stock is down 10% in after-hours, as we speak. I know you mentioned that you might think about rejiggering the structure of the capital raise. There's always the spectrum in this crazy market that you just can't raise $2.5 billion [ph]. Is there a plan B? And how \u2026?", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "As we have said at the beginning, we are in the middle of a capital raise and I can't comment on it, except for to say that, as I have said all along, we're very confident in our plans.", "Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners", "Fair enough, good luck.", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Paul, appreciate it.", "David Radulski - Investor Relations", "This David Radulski is I am afraid that ends our time for Q&A today. Mike McGavick offers some questions and I ask for those of you who did not get a chance to ask your questions, please contact us and we will be happy to do what we can to help.", "Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer", "I have just a couple of closing thoughts. First, I want to thank you for your time. I appreciate that, for a surprising number of you have been much better at keeping a job than I have been. So it was nice to be back on the line with many of you from my past.", "I also want to note something. I believe in owning up to mistakes immediately; it's just a rule of thumb. And earlier, I renamed the name of the head of the Bermuda Monetary Authority, which is somewhat shocking to me, given that I worked with him quite regularly during this process. But Matthew Elderfield, if you are listening to this call, I apologize. And now I won't have to do an 8-K saying I renamed you, which would be good.", "A couple of things, last thoughts. Look, this is a tough time in the cycle, no question about it. And it's been made tougher still by the fact that we have had all this noise around our franchise. And we are extremely excited, Jamie, Dave and I, to hit the road and go out to our colleagues and share with them that this burden is lifted, that SCA is behind us and that we can go forward and compete again.", "So let's be realistic. We see significant deterioration results across the industry. The soft cycle has not hit bottom. We sure don't see it hitting it in '09 and it might even go into '010, for all we know. But our job then is for focus on outperforming our sector in these tougher times. That's what great underwriters do. That's what we've done in the past. That's what we're going to do into the future. That is our goal, and we think we can deliver it. We have superior underwriting talent.", "We will maintain our underwriting discipline. It's demonstrated most visibly by the decline in reinsurance premium. It's appropriate to where we are in the cycle in that business, and I admire the way the operation has been diligent to do so. Will pay close attention to expenses. We demonstrated this in this quarter with this reduction we've described. And we'll streamline all that we do around these core P&C businesses.", "We set our sights high. While we don't give guidance, I will share with you that our plans and capital allocation models are set at an expectation that we will produce a greater than 15% ROE as averaged over the pricing cycle from these core P&C operations.", "To that end, I would tell you, we expect to deliver double-digit ROEs, even through the low end of the cycle, at least as we forecast and model today. We're doing it right now with the 13.3 that we delivered in this quarter in ROE.", "So what are the big takeaways from the way we see it? We've successfully -- when we have successfully closed this capital raise, as we expect to do, SCA will be behind us. We will reduce the risk in our franchise by focusing solely on our core and well positioned P&C insurance and reinsurance businesses and through these comprehensive actions we will have strengthened our balance sheet relative to our needed ratings.", "In the end, I would say it this way. We have a strong management team. It has been realigned in a more focused way and we expect to come roaring back. Thank you very much for your time.", "Operator", "This concludes your conference call for today.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. David Ridowski, XL Capital's Director of Investor Relations.", "David Ridowski", "Good morning and welcome to XL Capital's fourth quarter and full year 2008 conference call. This call is being simultaneously webcast on XL's web site at www.xlcapital.com. We've posted to our web site several documents including press releases, our financial supplement and our fixed income data supplement.", "For your information we've also posted a selection of communications materials that we are sharing with our customers, brokers and employees.", "On our call today Mike McGavick XL Capital's CEO will offer opening remarks. Brian Nocco, our CFO will review our financial results followed by Chief Investment Officer, Sara Street who will discuss results who will discuss our investment portfolio. Dave Duclos, our Chief Executive Insurance Operations and James Veghte, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations will review market conditions. Mick McGavick will return to discuss guidance, then we will open it up for your questions.", "Certain of the matters we will discuss today including our guidance are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.", "Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other documents filed with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.", "Forward-looking statements speak only as the date on which they are made and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise. With that, I will turn it over to Mike McGavick.", "Michael McGavick", "I have to believe that all of you feel like us here at XL. I have never been happier in my professional life to put a year in the rear view mirror. Obviously the world has gone through extraordinary change and we have faced extraordinary market conditions. Yet XL delivered solid fourth quarter and full year underwriting results that are both solid on their own and in respect to our historical performance.", "Our P&C combined ratio of 89.4 for the fourth quarter was in fact four points better than for the same period last year, and our overall year of a 95 combined is the kind of results you expect from XL even at the most difficult part of the market cycle.", "Along with our fourth quarter favorable prior year development of $268 million, this shows not only the prudence of our reserves but also the strength of our underwriting over the years. And XL remains one of the few companies that can stand by its initial Gustaf and Ike loss estimates as originally announced last September, losses we were proud of both in terms of our share as relative to the market and in our insight to understand the effects of those storms.", "Other key metrics also point to strength. These include the retention of our customers and of our employees. Dave Duclos who runs our Insurance operations and Jamie Veghte of our Reinsurance operations will give you greater detail on these shortly.", "Now I know given all the noise, some of these results may surprise you. They may even displease our competitors, and that's fine with us. These point to a franchise at XL that is ready to take on the opportunities that 2009 presents. The fact is, that in many different parts of the Insurance and Reinsurance space, rates are improving and we expect with our solid franchise to be able to take full advantage of those opportunities.", "Our capital is not an issue in this pursuit as we have said repeatedly. We have no need to raise capital and the rating agencies tell us they agree. We have taken several steps to make that strength more obvious. We took a non cash charge against good will on our acquisition of Mid Ocean Reed. ", "And let me be blunt. This is a great business. XL is the better for having bought it back in 1998, but GAAP requires that we recognize current market valuations in how we carry the good will that came with Mid Ocean. Simply put, Reinsurance franchises of this kind were valued more highly in days gone by.", "This non cash charge will remove any good will questions that people could have about our balance sheet, making its underlying tangible strength more evident and this has no impact on our rating agency, regulatory or tangible capital.", "We have also announced a reduction in our dividend to a yield closer to industry and historical norms. I can't make any promises about the future, and it's ultimately a decision for the Board, but we are looking forward to the day when XL can raise it again because our yield is too low.", "Further, we continue to de-risk our investment portfolio. You will hear from Sara Street some of the details on what we've been doing in the past and if you look forward, we expect the investment portfolio will generate a run rate cash of approximately $3.5 billion this year, allowing for further de-risking of the portfolio, bringing it more and more in line each day with the traditional P&C portfolio.", "We have also announced today that we will take a restructuring charge of $400 million. We chose to take it in the fourth quarter, and that charge will allow us to accelerate the repositioning of the portfolio. In fact, it allows us to reposition securities worth several times that without changing the accounting treatment for the rest of the asset base.", "We also want to update you on our strategic review of Life. As previously announced, we continue that. We had hoped to have that concluded by the end of the year but conditions in the Life space did not allow for that at that time. However, we have made a bit of progress. We have announced a recent renewal rights transaction with our GA for the Life, Accident and Health block. ", "The balance of the book has performed in line with our guidance for 2008 so we're pleased with the continuing performance and we will continue to examine our strategic options for the remaining blocks of our Life Reinsurance book.", "Now in the end of the last year, the noise around our franchise including the ratings created the greatest challenges. We have spent a great deal of effort communiCATing our plans for the future as well as what occurred in 2008 to the rating agencies. I think it's safe to say that they understand what we are doing. ", "They appreciate the steps we have taken to do this franchise and that we continue to take, and everything that I have heard in these recent days, though they can speak for themselves, would indicate to us that there will not be any changes to our ratings.", "In addition, I would say that with AMVest who has us on an A with a stable outlook, has told us they will not even take us to committee at this point which of course is a good thing, leaving the ratings in place as they are.", "They have also assured us as I mentioned before that we have ample capital for our ratings. We are ready to go compete and put that capital to work for our clients. We know that we must continue to improve our risk management disciplines as stewards of capital. We have real rigor around how we evaluate this and other firms.", "I've said before that I think we could do a better job in our own firm. We have advanced considerably even in these last months not only with the adding of Jacob Rosengarden to head up our operations here, but also with the bringing online of new risk measurement techniques in our portfolio management. All of this has given us greater insight and the ability to de-risk the firm more quickly.", "Another example of this is the adding of Tom Hutton to our Board. Many of you know Tom. He served on many Boards and many positions of leadership in our industry in the past. He is a co-founder of Risk Management Solutions, RMS, and he's one of the very best in thinking through the risk that Insurance and Reinsurance companies face. We welcome him to the Board.", "Turning to 2009, I'll offer guidance after Dave, Jamie, Brian and others discuss their business segment results, but I want you to know that the plan for next year went through a very rigorous process. ", "This is the first of the planning exercises that the new team has led, and that has led us to be very aggressive in saying that we must focus XL's resources on those places where we compete best in the market place on those places that in this particular global condition can deliver the best results and in line with the reality and this affected the budget to a lesser extent, to tell you the truth, but in line with reality of the ratings we now have.", "In the end, before Brian covers our financial results, I have one other piece of important work. We'd like here at XL to extend our gratitude to Fiona Luck on her retirement from XL. All of us at XL have appreciated her exceptional efforts over the past 10 years serving as Chief of Staff and acting and interim CFO in 2007, but most importantly throughout as one of the leaders of the franchise and a true advisor to me during this transition times. We wish Fiona all the best in her future pursuits.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Brian Nocco to discuss our financial results.", "Brian Nocco", "Turning to our summary of financial results on Slide 4, P&C net premiums were about 11.5% in the fourth quarter primarily due to the rolling effects of prior period's lower written premium. Total P&C underwriting income was $161 million for the fourth quarter compared to $108 in the prior year quarter.", "The P&C combined ration during the fourth quarter was 89.4 and benefited from favorable prior year development of $268 million with $183 million from the Insurance segment and $85 million from the Reinsurance segment.", "The Insurance segment's favorable development included $81 million related to the Winter settlement we announced in December. Foreign currency movements resulted in a gain of $120.7 million for the quarter compared to $39.7 in the prior year quarter.", "Operating income was $0.58 per share for the quarter with an annualized ROE of 12.4% compared to $0.55 and 4.1% respectively in the prior year quarter. Sara will discuss the investment results shortly.", "We took a good will impairment of $990 million during the quarter. $975 million was related to our Mid Ocean acquisition and the balance to our Latin America Reinsurance and U.S. Life operations.", "The Mid Ocean impairment in particular, resulted from the requirements under GAAP that we consider current market conditions at year end. Both the increased cost of capital and decline in market multiples in the industry resulted in our belief that we could no longer justify carrying the good will at previously established levels.", "Our book value declined from $21.65 per share at September 30 to $15.46 per share at year end, being the main drivers in the quarter being a good will impairment charge of $200.99 per share and the mark to market in our investment portfolio of $2.60 per share.", "Finally, as we have mentioned in previous calls and filings, our ESU's issued in December of 2005 will settle on February 17. The forward sale portion of the ESU will result in XL showing 11.4 million shares of common stock to ESU holders. The net result of this transaction is that debt will be reduced by $745 million while tangible book value will increase by $1.75 per share.", "And now to Sara, to discuss her investment portfolio.", "Sara Street", "We posted our fixed income supplement to our web site last night and I'll highlight that we've added more disclosure on our U.S. High Mortgages and Hybrid Holdings.", "Turning to Slide 5, our net investment income on the P&C general portfolio was $276 million, a decline of 16% compared to the prior year quarter and 6% from third quarter 2008. This decline has been driven by lower yields as we increase our allocation to lower yielding U.S. Treasury agencies and cash which was a prudent step to preserve capital during these turbulent markets as well as our long term de-risking strategy.", "Our net investment income from investment fund affiliates was a loss of $124 million in line with our previously provided guidance. The principal driver was a negative quarterly return of 12.5% in our alternative portfolio. Our results were disappointing but favorable relative to both our own benchmark as well as institutional quality fund peers.", "The actual fourth quarter mark to market movement consisting of realized and unrealized gain movement totaled a decline of $852 million. On Slide 6, demonstrates that the key negative driver of the unprecedented credit spread widening we saw during the fourth quarter, which were much more dramatic than the positive contribution rate through interest rate decline.", "The result is also favorable relative to our mid December pre-announcement as in the last couple of weeks of December, we benefited from the modest credit rally in certain U.S. corporate sectors and continuing rate declines. However, this was offset by significant year end pricing pressures on mortgage backed securities as well as widening in U.K. corporate spreads.", "Additionally, we benefited from a change in the valuations on our class loan obligation or CLO portfolio. Our valuation approach remains unchanged and is entirely based on independent third party pricing, but with one exception. ", "In line with the fair value guidance on evaluations for liquid assets, we determined that the market for CLO represents approximately 1% of our portfolio had become so irrational that we believe that what limited trades exist will result in a truly distressed fire sale and accordingly, a modeled fair value approach would be more appropriate.", "Working with an external advisor, we established a valuation approach that we believe appropriately recognizes the presently elevated expectations of the losses and the liquidity risk while applying less weight to some of the currently irrational pricing that we're seeing in the market. Our portfolio would have declined a further $212 million had we continued to use the externally soft prices. We want to be fully transparent about this change and its impact. ", "During the quarter, we realized losses of $569 million. This includes OTTI of $209 million on securities where we believe that the security is not likely to recover to its current cost basis. We also took an additional intent to hold OTTI portfolio restructuring charge of $400 million which Mike mentioned and I will address in more detail in a moment.", "We've made significant progress in 2008 in de-risking the investment portfolio. As you can see in Slide 7, we have reduced our allocations aggressively to a number of severely impacted or risk asset classes. During the fourth quarter, the largest change was our decision to reduce the size of the World Homes Portfolio. This now stands at $1.1 billion, down from a peak of $2.4 billion in 2007.", "In aggregate, since March of 2008 we have reduced our sensitivity to credit spend movements by approximately 18% which will result in less credit spread driven mark to market in the future. We expect that this will decline further as we take more de-risking steps.", "As mentioned, we recorded a charge of $400 million in certain holdings in our core P&C portfolio in the quarter. This was solely our decision and gives us more flexibility. Our goal is to simplify the investment portfolio to one that is line with our singular focus as a P&C underwriting operation.", "While this could be accomplished naturally over time, since we currently believe the assets are likely to be money good, we made the decision to accelerate the simplification process by selling certain assets before their full recovery. Given this decision, we can no longer assert our intent to hold these securities until such time as they recover.", "As I have previously described, the majority of these actions will involve our structured credit portfolio including CMBS, ABP and non agency mortgages as well as targeted sales in our corporate bond holdings and a reduction in our equity portfolio.", "I'd like to emphasize that these sales will be executed in an orderly manner and we will not sell at prices significantly below intrinsic value. These sales combined with the other steps we have already taken, represent significant progress toward de-risking the portfolio.", "Our $32 billion fixed income portfolio is already very high quality and well diversified. It has an average rating of double A and there have been 927% as investment grade quality. Over 40% is invested in the highest quality assets of government agencies and cash securities.", "Our de-risking activities will further strengthen this position. Now over to Dave Duclos to talk about our Insurance Operations.", "David Duclos", "Before getting into the Insurance numbers, I'd like to briefly touch on key drivers impacting our results and the markets in which we compete. First, we're encouraged by increasing signs of stronger pricing and we intend to be a leader in this movement. We will not chase underpriced business as the industry works through this transition period.", "Second, we have reduced our writing of long term agreements significantly in the fourth quarter and expect this trend to continue as we work through 2009. Third, it's important to note that only a very small portion of our premium variance in Q4 was related to market noise given the December developments we had to fight through and which we have done so very effectively.", "This outstanding result would not have been achieved if not for the support received from our brokers and clients. For that, we say thank you.", "The financial highlights for the quarter are as follows: gross written premiums declined by 15% or $190 million from Q4 of 2007 due to market conditions and largely due to the reduction of long term agreements which accounts for two-thirds of $127 million of the reduction. FX accounts for another $17 million of the variance.", "For the full year 2008, gross premiums written and net premiums earned were down 2.3% and 2.9% respectively which is an excellent result for this point in the underwriting cycle and in line with the guidance provided last year.", "On the loss side, we completed detailed reserves covering virtually all lines of business in Q4. These reviews resulted in overall favorable prior development that Brian mentioned, but also some strengthening of the 2008 loss ratio in several product lines. These actions contributed to higher loss ratios for the quarter but it's the full year loss ratios that are most representative of the results expected for the portfolio. As such, my comments will focus on comparing full year 2008 results to the full year 2007.", "The full year loss ratio of 68.4% in 2008 is 5.4 point higher than the full year 2007 loss ratio. Excluding the favorable net prior year development experience in both years, as well as cap losses, the full year 2008 adjusted loss ratio of 72.5% is 6.5 points higher than the 2007 adjusted ratio.", "Approximately one-half of the increase is attributable to high non cap property losses. The remaining difference is attributable to higher loss ratios in professional lines associated with sub prime and the related credit crisis, lower premium rate levels in 2008 versus 2007, and to a lesser degree, some changes to the earnings patterns on certain contracts.", "Also during the quarter, as we've done in the past four quarters, we completed a detailed review of potential exposures in our professional liability book from sub prime and related credit crisis claims.", "Policy notes stand at 71 for 2008 and this level of notice activity is in line with our class loss provision. However as a further measure of prudence, we did strengthen the 2007 year reserves by another $140 million during the quarter. This strengthening was more than offset by reserve releases on the 2003 to 2006 years which continue to develop more favorably than expected.", "One final comment on the losses. Given that 2008 will be the second or third costliest cap year on record depending upon how final losses associated with Ike and Gustaf shake out, I'm pleased to report that our total net cap losses globally stand at $138 million. ", "Further, with a $29 million reduction in our initial assessment for Ike and Gustaf in Q4, our total loss for these two storms is at $59 million, a good outcome and a strong testament to our risk management practices that work on the front end in accepting risk and also on the back end as we monitor.", "All in, the quarter and full year combined ratios of 94.4% and 98.4% respectively, reflect XL's effective risk management, solid underwriting and prudent reserving over a number of years.", "Looking forward to 2009, I want to share some insight into our current views on the market. In addition to the excellent 2008 retention which Mike mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong retentions in 2009 based on January 1 renewals. Specifically in continental Europe, we're just under 50% of the book renews of January 1. We experienced very strong renewals across all product lines, averaging 87%.", "Indications in other regions are also at or near historical levels. The only significant impact is where you would expect, the longer lines that are most rating sensitive, U.S. professional lines, and U.S. and Bermuda excess casualty.", "With regards to pricing, initial indications based on Q4 results and January 2009 renewals reflect continued rate improvement with positive rate movement in property, professional and many specialty lines. Even casualty rate decreases are clearly slowing.", "But as everyone is aware, reductions in exposure base for commercial customers a result of poor global economic conditions will offset some of the rate increases, creating what one of our colleagues has recently described as the invisible hard market.", "In looking at the past year, I can't think of a more challenging trading environment in which to compete, and yet we achieved strong results, a testament to the value of this franchise that's built, the support of our brokers and clients globally and the will and determination of our staff around the world.", "With that summary, I'll now turn the call over to Jamie.", "James Veghte", "Reinsurance results for the fourth quarter were once again very strong. A combined ratio of 79.6% in the quarter compared to 84.8% for the prior year illustrates XL's ongoing commitment to core underwriting and reserving discipline. In what is generally the lowest premium quarter of the year, gross written premium declined 24% versus Q4 '07 due to the market conditions I'll detail in a moment, and the commutation of a structured indemnity contract which included a return premium of $35 million.", "Net premiums earned declined 18% year on year due to the strengthening of the dollar against the Euro and the decline in net written premiums over the rolling last eight quarters. As Brian mentioned, the segment had the benefit of a prior release of $85 million in the quarter. ", "Excluding prior year development, our combined ratio was 97.4%. This was principally driven by development from Hurricane Ike. For the full year, we enjoyed a combined ratio of 90.4% producing an underwriting profit of just under $400 million on net earned premiums of $2.26 billion.", "We view these results as outstanding given the competitive market conditions and the very high level of natural catastrophe activity around the world this year.", "I'd also like to provide some color around the January 1 renewal season. As Mike mentioned at the outset, this franchise has faced and met some very significant challenges. Relative to the renewable premium we had entering the season, we've lost only 11% of our portfolio due to security decisions made by clients as a result of the December rating agency actions.", "Not surprisingly the impact was most significant in Europe given the timing of the actions and Standard and Poor's significance in that market.", "The balance of the decline in overall premium written was primarily due to selective cancellations by us and by industry wide trends including increased retentions by clients and others expanding their Reinsurance panel to dilute concentrations of securities. ", "The January 1 renewal process reconfirmed our status as a lead market. We were asked to provide quotes on 86% of our renewal premium in the Bermuda cap book and 100% of the business that we renewed in our U.S. casualty portfolio. Our success in this regard is due to the skill and dedication of our underwriters. I would like to thank them and to express my appreciation to our customers and brokers for their support and commitment they continue to show this franchise.", "Turning to general market conditions, short tail lines and CAT exposed geographies showed risk adjustment strengthening between 5% and 15% and there is emerging capacity constraints around large U.S. cap programs. We would expect this tightening to accelerate as we head towards the significant Southeast Wind business renewing in the second quarter.", "Other property lines in non CAT areas were generally flat although directionally I would expect tightening in this area in the later part of 2009. While U.S. casualty rates excluding D&O are down slightly, casualty motor rates in Europe increased by up to 10% with rates in other casualty lines in that geography flat to down slightly.", "Aviation and marine lines of business experienced rate increases between 5% and 10%. Given the recently soft market conditions over the last several years and the current interest rate environment, we would expect to see a hardening across the markets over the next several quarters and into 2010.", "In summary, XL had an excellent financial year, a very successful renewal season and is well positioned to remain a leader in what I believe will be an increasingly attractive market conditions through 2009. With that, I'll turn it over to Mike for guidance.", "Michael McGavick", "If you turn to Slide 11 in the presentation, it walks you through the general guidance that we are giving. I just want to reemphasize a couple of points about how this plan was built with the fresh eyes that this management team has, we added several areas of focus.", "Number one, concentrate our fire power on those lines of business that are meeting or exceeding our long term hurdle objectives. This is one of the advantages of the XL franchise being in both Insurance and Reinsurance and in many lines of business. We can move around our efforts to where the opportunities are best.", "This means we can reduce efforts where those aren't currently good and bring them back to greater activity when market conditions change. This is exactly how this franchise should be operating, so the first real driven effort to focus around those businesses with the appropriate returns.", "Second, we want to focus in those businesses that not only have those appropriate levels of returns predicted, but we also felt will deliver well in this global environment. It's a very difficult world out there as we all know and we wanted to make sure we were matched in both way.", "And then to a lesser extent, in the line particularly that Dave mentioned that were affected at some level by renewals by the rating agencies to reflect the rating agency reality. So what do you see? You'll see an emphasis on shorter tail lines. In Insurance you can expect us to reduce long term agreements to capture the benefit of hardening markets.", "And as you'd expect, this total effect will be to reduce both our gross and net written number meaningfully as you see on the sheet. Obviously if you're going to see the top lines come down, you're going to have to do real work in terms of your expenses in order to meet the kinds of returns that are expected by our shareholders and by all who are connected to this organization.", "So you will see us making painful decisions. We've announced last night and we'll be traveling around the world, the leadership team to meet with many of our colleagues to discuss them in person that we will be trimming about 10% of our global work force in this year.", "This will be focused on the corporate and functional support areas overwhelmingly in order to give an expense base that can be afforded by our underwriters so they can go do the job as described.", "You'll see about $60 million to $80 million in restructuring costs now, and we expect to lower our underlying base of expense by $100 million to $120 million from this action from the year 2010 on.", "We will be communicating the details of these plans to our employees, to our clients and brokers in these next days so I'm not going to get into greater detail on these actions on this call, but I can tell you that this plan is thoroughly developed. It was reviewed with the rating agencies as a part of our review of last year's results and led as I described at least with Amvest not even going to committee but leaving the ratings in place, and I understand that it's now crossed the wire that S&P has confirmed our ratings where they stand, and we appreciate their understanding of these actions as well.", "When you take all of this together, you look at the net investment income, it will move more in line with the norm for P&C company. Obviously these are difficult times in terms of net investment income and the generally lower interest rate environment, but with the de-risking we will come more in line with what you would see from our peers which is good from all points of view as we look at it in XL.", "Taking it all together, we believe that we will provide operating ROE in the low to mid teens for 2009 which we think will be a terrific result driven by underwriting for this point in the cycle. Obviously when we talk about guidance we're talking about the future and the normal caveats don't even seem worthy of these extraordinary market conditions that we're all facing, but you can find them of course on our regular filings and statement of all the different items that we always reference for risk into the future and uncertainty.", "With that, I think we have given you a description of what is a very powerful underwriting franchise that has continued to aggressively de-risk the noise around it to allow our strength to show to our clients and our broker partners and to our people, and our people have met great tests this year and passed them and we look forward to success ahead.", "With that we'll open it to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Joshua Shanker \u2013 Citigroup.", "Joshua Shanker \u2013 Citigroup", "I was curious if you could go through more slowly the moving pieces in terms of the favorable and unfavorable development. In the disclosures you labeled the favorable development rather clearly but the unfavorable development I lost a little bit. If we go through segments and the offsetting factors that would be appreciated.", "Michael McGavick", "Could you repeat the question.", "Joshua Shanker \u2013 Citigroup", "You mentioned it briefly in your opening remarks but can you go through more slowly the moving pieces in favorable and unfavorable development by segment.", "Brian Nocco", "Let me give you the pieces. On the Insurance segment, there was $183 million of favorable prior year development. As we indicated $81 million of that is related to the actual Winter Settlement so the actual settlement, not just our view of the future. There were $57 million of releases related to casualty reserves, professional releases of $35 million, property releases at $16 million, partially offset by $11 million in adverse development or strengthening on specialty lines and another $5 million release related to a reserve for Reinsurance credit or recoverables.", "On the Reinsurance side, there were $85 million of prior year development, $40 million from property and short tail classes, $32 million from casualty and $13 million of other stuff in total.", "Joshua Shanker \u2013 Citigroup", "The way it looks to me and I'm sure you'll correct me, it looks as if the combined ratio is up about 11% from what it was a year ago stripping out the effect of cap and favorable development. Is there something I'm missing when I'm making that statement?", "Brian Nocco", "Actually the difference isn't quite 11%, but let me walk through the loss ratio story for the Insurance segment. First of all I would say there were losses in 2008 and I've talked about in prior calls, in fact provided an update on Q4 numbers that in Q4 we saw a continuation of unprecedented large losses attributable to the property line outside of CAT activity. So that continues to impact the results.", "There are also, as I mentioned in my piece of the update, the second or third largest CAT activity in 2008, and then there has been a surfeit of losses in some of the other products lines, and given how we write business, we're going to see some lumpiness quarter to quarter, but on a year to year basis, when you look at the loss ratio variance, it is predominantly driven by our property incidents increasing and by the sub prime load that we announced in the first quarter of 2008, the $50 million.", "Between those two product lines, the majority of that variance is in fact driven in those areas. Now you ask what's our outlook going forward, a couple of things; number one some of what Mike alluded to in terms of actions taken that reflect our 2009 guidance, does reflect underwriting actions taken in several lines and several of the lines that have had what I'd say marginal results.", "We're also driving rates very aggressively that impact and reflect that focus in terms of our retention guidance for 2009 as well. So it's a combination of underwriting actions really geared towards specific areas that cause the losses and then also aggressive rate price actions in a number of lines. That sums the Insurance story.", "James Veghte", "On the Reinsurance side, a year ago excluding prior year releases we had a combined ratio of 94.8. This year it's 97.5. That's principally from development in the segment from Ike and Gustaf of $35 million after the effect of reinstatement premium. As was mentioned at the beginning the overall corporation had losses from those two storms in line with the original guidance but actually it was an increase in Reinsurance and a reduction in Dave's portfolio.", "Michael McGavick", "We're saying that you should expect given the size of lines we write that there will be lumpiness in our results and the fourth quarter reflects that in the Insurance base, but overall we see the same continuing underlying loss ratios that give us confidence that the results that I predict in terms of ROE will be delivered and we have taken underwriting actions to further assure that as well as continuing to move the needle on price.", "In fact, from my point of view the most powerful combination of statistics you can think about where our achievement of price improvement in the fourth quarter. We were really hard on the pedal on the price in the fourth quarter and we have had retentions overall that were in line with our historical marks. I don't think there's any greater proof of franchise power than to have pricing power at a choppy time like this.", "Joshua Shanker \u2013 Citigroup", "Going forward in the past XL has been about a 70/30 split Insurance/Reinsurance. Would you care to offer a future vision of the company? What split of business will be?", "Michael McGavick", "I think that split roughly will continue in the plan we have for the year. You'll see that they're down kind of equally in percentage terms across the two businesses in the guidance we're giving. I do think that over the long haul, I would expect in good market conditions that you would see over the long time that it would shift a bit more towards the Insurance side, but of course we have this strategy around Reinsurance to shrink aggressively when pricing is not where we want it and to grow aggressively when we think it is, so you'll get some fluctuation due to that strategy.", "But Insurance over the long term after we get on the solid footing that this plan implies, I would expect over time to be more dominant.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bijan Moazami \u2013 FBR.", "Bijan Moazami \u2013 FBR", "In your structured credit portfolio, the CMBS portfolio in particular, are you pricing it to a cash spread or are you pricing into a synthetic spread?", "Sarah Street", "We're pricing it to the cash spread. The synthetic market, the CMBS is a very different make up of the portfolio than what our existing, of what's actually in our portfolio. We have very little overlap between what's actually in the CMBS.", "Bijan Moazami \u2013 FBR", "Just in case if you have a downgrade, what kind of assets do you have that could lead to a collateral call? Is there anything in there that you can describe to us?", "Brian Nocco", "I guess the question is, what vulnerability do we have to credit rating declines. One notch decline will have a diminished impact on us. If we fall below A minus or into the B category in particular and AMBest, it does require as we've disclosed in our filings collateralization on the various revolvers that we have that we use for letter of credit issuance. ", "And there is a smaller amount of collateral required for things like is the contract, some of our Insurance contracts and some return of premium, but the largest by far of those would be the collateralization of the bank revolvers. But again, that would require downgrades of two notches.", "Bijan Moazami \u2013 FBR", "So at triple B or below triple B?", "Brian Nocco", "At AMBest, the rating vernacular is A, B. They don't use triple B so it would be at below A minus or in the B category at AMBest. I will tell you that our overall liquidity continues to be very strong as Sara indicated; 40% of our portfolio is in government agencies and cash and cash like securities. We have $5.8 billion in cash in short term investments on the balance sheet, so we are very conscious of the liquidity requirements that might exist at a financial services company and pay a lot of attention to it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O'Neill.", "Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O'Neill", "Follow up on the combined ratio commentary. The actual for this year was pretty high or at least for the quarter was pretty high and just to be sure, is that because of these lumpy large losses we see in the fourth quarter or is there some sort of shifting of money around the [inaudible] very much the story. It does seem well north of 100.", "David Duclos", "The quarter number that you relate to there is a result of the lumpiness of the losses as I described, but also a result of an analysis of reserve review we completed reflected in our Q4 results which for some lines increased our reserve position. In other lines it reduces it.", "It's a combination of the lumpiness that we've referred to as well as the reserve review completed for all of our product lines. And again we have had loss activity, in particular in the property line. Just an example, we had one loss in the fourth quarter of a $30 million net loss, so that's going to have an impact on our quarterly result.", "Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O'Neill", "You're making operating earnings in your Life operations but the assets, the troubles assets seem to be much more over there. Are we in a situation where this thing is making a low return equity or be profitable or is the investments over there such of a nature that it isn't profitable even though it's showing operating earnings? Just an assessment about how much of a weight this is having on the overall returns.", "Brian Nocco", "The overall impact of Life earnings is relatively modest on the company as you can see in the quarter. It was $27 million. The investment portfolio I would point out, I wouldn't call it more troubled. It does tend to have longer duration assets and a heavier concentration of credit risk and in particular the financial institution portfolio is concentrated in the Life business.", "It doesn't have any of what is commonly referred to as a topical asset, so I would say it tends to have assets that would be more out of favor today, but I wouldn't call them troubled assets.", "From an earnings standpoint, the accounting for our Life Insurance business is one that tends to spread earnings over time. There is a tight match between assets and liabilities and that tends to be reflected in the accounting and we would expect the Life business absent some action coming out of our strategic review to continue to report reasonably good operating earnings and ROE's.", "Operator", "", "Your next call comes from Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "I have a couple of questions on the guidance. First on the combined ratios, the outlook for 2009 would be similar to 2008 on a full year basis for the calendar year result. I was wondering what type of catastrophe expectations and reserve releases you may have embedded in that.", "Michael McGavick", "With respect to reserves, we do not plan on reserve movement in any direction. The CAT load in total is about $220 million which is of course based on historic performance.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "I'm wondering how you can keep the combined ratios pretty much the same level without reserve releases if premiums are going to be down pretty substantially?", "Michael McGavick", "That's one of the reasons we have to work so hard on our expenses in order to bring them into line. I've noticed a lot of the questions have to do with what one quarter, the fourth quarter shows, but we focus on the longer term trends in our loss ratios and the businesses performance in order to judge what it will do in the future, especially as we understand which of those lines we'll be emphasizing during the course of the year and where rates stand in those lines and where our rate.", "So that's why we're able to give such confidence to the kind of combines and ROE's that we're forecasting and I would give you one other piece of insight. We did choose to do this plan a little bit later in the cycle that we ordinarily would have because we knew that there was so much going on in the fourth quarter that we would have deeper insight if we held off on the final putting together the plan until we had everything that happened in the fourth quarter.", "So we have all of that insight kind of more insight from last year than we would normally have to give us even greater confidence in the performances of book. One last statistic, in terms of the CAT load I mentioned, it's about $220 CAT load for this year.", "If you look back at '08 even with the very extraordinary level of CATs, our actual was about 389, so I think that gives you a sense that unless we face another extraordinary year, if it's not an outlier year, this is a very reasonable loan.", "", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "On the net to gross within the P&T operations, how much CD premium should we take into account for 2009? You gave us the gross written and the net earned but I just want to make sure I'm thinking about this the right way.", "Michael McGavick", "We would expect it to be about the same percentages as prior year, but we can get some statistics back to you.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Could you give us your loss picks on the professional liability book D&O and E&O?", "David Duclos", "I'll give you an update. I'm not sure about the loss picks, but first of all in 2008 we did increase our class load by five points which brought the class load up to 25 points in 2008. We also have a class load of 20 points in 2007 and in 2009 we're carrying that same class load. And I think maybe part of your question is to just ask about how we feel about our overall reserve position relative to what started out as a sub prime crisis growing into a broader credit crisis and now also involves Maddoff.", "I can tell you we have looked at our results a couple of different ways. I remind everybody that we do have a quarterly process in place where we work with the actuaries, underwriters and claims folks and analyze our positions and I can tell you that our reserve position has been strengthened significantly. ", "We're actually carrying two times the reserves we had in 2003, 2006 for 2007, 2008 and now going into 2009. Based upon recent trends notices that are referred to that actually peaked in the fourth quarter of 2007 and first quarter of 2008, we feel that our current reserve position is quite adequate.", "And we also feel very bullish about this business. It's still producing very attractive returns, and that's built into the 2009 plan.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America.", "", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America", "The investment income guidance, that is just within the property casualty business, is that correct?", "Sarah Street", "That is correct.", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America", "Can you talk at all is it at the industry level or the XL level what kind of claims might emerge from these Australian wildfires?", "James Veghte", "It's very early days or weeks. We've seen estimates around the $500 million Aussie dollars. The hourly cost in Australian CAT covers with respect to fire is quite broad. It's basically an event type of language, so it's unclear how much of that may get into the Reinsurance market. Again, those are very preliminary estimates.", "David Duclos", "From an Insurance perspective, as of yesterday we had two claims reported in less than $1 million in terms of exposure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS.", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "I'm wondering if you could talk about you're going to be retaining some of your key people or better people in light of obviously with the stock prices and you're going through obviously a pretty significant head count reduction, what are you doing to keep the good people? We're seeing some press reports of some teams of people leaving of late.", "Michael McGavick", "First of all, why don't we deal with these press reports. My favorite was a tabloid report out of the London market place that I think it referred to four or five people who had left that they had coupled together from different releases that those who had taken these people and then referred it to as an exodus.", "I've been looking forward to having this call so I could talk about our retention of people and I get a chance to actually meet with that person later this week, and he and I will have a clear conversation about the term exodus.", "We have very extraordinary talent at XL and that's well known in the market, so we are always being picked on. That's an ordinary course of event for us to have people, our people preyed upon by others, and I think it is a greater testimony to the strength of the franchise that so many have stayed than it is a few have left.", "I would point out that our turn over in the last year was actually slightly below historical norms. Slightly below historical norms. I would point out in the month of December for example in Insurance we recruited more people than we lost in the month of December.", "I point out that we have 75 people in Reinsurance that can have underwriting authority and only three of them chose to leave before the end of the year. I mean, this franchise is holding together. People want to be insured by XL and they want to work at XL because this has the kind of underwriting culture that truly respects great underwriting.", "Now, when I think about what's going on right now, there's a reality. There's a lot of people out there wondering with all this tumult going on, with all that's going on at XL, I'm sure there are people even in our own ranks as there are at other companies wondering what they should do next.", "My message is very simple. XL has been made tougher by what it's gone through, and as a result our view is, especially with this further de-risking that we're going to be stronger going forward and better able to weather these storms.", "I'd rather be at the firm that's already got that hard work done behind me than a firm that has yet to recognize how difficult this economic crisis is. So my view is, this is a time to be with XL and to enjoy the benefits of the comeback that we believe we will deliver. And that's my message to our colleagues.", "We have done some work with some of our more high profile people to make sure they have incentives to stay. We have done some work in terms of how we design our compensation schemes to make sure that people have confidence that they'll be appropriately awarded if they deliver the results that are in line with the shareholders interests.", "That's the work we've done. We think that work will keep the work force together, and it's our job to do so. It isn't going to get harder in our view. I don't like forecasting, but it's hard to imagine being more difficult than it was in the fourth quarter and we continued to deliver.", "That's the short answer.", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "How much of the European book did you actually lose at the run rate renewal?", "James Veghte", "We lost about $119 million of business due to security concerns. 64% of that was from XL Europe.", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "The LOC facility, when does that renew and if indeed there are some issues with renewing it, what are your options?", "Brian Nocco", "We have a number of them but there are two large one. The largest of the two is a $4 billion facility. It doesn't come up for renewal until into 2012, so we've got a considerable amount of time to work on plans to moderate usage of that facility before we get there. In fact today our total LOC usage is less than that $4 billion.", "We have some small ones that just renew annually and if they renew, they do, and if they don't we can roll those into the $4 billion facility.", "We've got a $2.25 facility that renews in the middle of next year which we may or may not choose to renew. ", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "Looking at our internal capital models, I'm wondering if you've got any kind of sense what your capital cushion is at current rating levels right now in the event we do have a CATastrophe loss or something coming forward?", "Michael McGavick", "We've never talked about those kinds of numbers. We would just tell you we believe we have ample capital and the rating agencies tell us so as well. With that in mind, we look forward to competing into the future.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from [Dave Vidden \u2013 King Street Capital]", "[Dave Vidden \u2013 King Street Capital]", "The $2.5 billion LC facility, is there anything drawn on that now? And also, can you explain what type of business you need these LC's for? Is it business at Lloyd's? Can you give a little more detail on that?", "Brian Nocco", "First of all it's a $2.25 billion facility and there is no usage of that at the present time. We use letters of credit for a multitude of reasons. Some of it is supporting internal quota share. Some of it would be Lloyd's. Some of it would be a variety of other client supporting purposes, so I would say there's a whole multitude of reasons why a company with our business model uses letters of credit.", "[Dave Vidden \u2013 King Street Capital]", "If you do get down to triple B plus from S&P, how would you react? Would you just have to liquidate monies in the portfolio and post cash collateral? What's the contingency plan there?", "Brian Nocco", "The first thing I would say is that it's not tied into S&P ratings. It's tied into AMBest ratings and only AMBest ratings. We have obviously thought long and hard about what we would do at that point in time. There are provisions to provide cash collateral in he event that we fall to those ratings which we think highly unlikely.", "As you might expect, we'd  probably have some conversations with the banks, but that's as much as is relevant to say on a call like this.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from [Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital]", "[Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital]", "On the good will could you talk about, I'm curious why you wrote off Ocean but did nothing to Nac read. Can you talk about the difference between the Nac read and the Mid Ocean.", "Michael McGavick", "We think about the good will that remains on it, it continues to by all of the accounting tests to perform very strongly so it was our view that we should focus where the accounting tests showed us that there was reason to take.", "I'm a little confused by your comment because we don't show that we're carrying any good will on Nac. But generally what modest amounts of good will we continue to carry simply because it continues to perform on all the various accounting tests very strongly.", "The lion's share of what we did invest was with Mid Ocean and again, that just relates to the difference in valuation of those kinds of businesses today and at the time that we bought it back in 1998.", "[Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital]", "Can you talk about what happened with the bank leaks in December?  Do you have any comments you want to offer on that? The leaks in December about the company being for sale at values down here. Can you give any comments? Is the company for sale, not for sale? Just anything further that you can add to that from the press release you did back in December.", "Michael McGavick", "We made it crystal clear at that time and it continues to be our exclusive focus that we will operate XL as an independent company and deliver these plans and results for the benefit of our shareholders and our clients and our colleague's period.", "[Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital]", "The decline in the gross premium, can you give me any sense of if you broke that into pieces, part of that is lost business due to the rating, part of that is probably you being more disciplined in pacing, and I'm wondering if there's a part that's partially preserving capital to give you more flexibility. Can you just give me a sense of how that breaks down in the guidance?", "Michael McGavick", "Let me give you a couple of high level comments and ask Dave and Jamie if they want to make any further comment. At the high level, we didn't make these decisions with respect to capital. If we saw better market conditions out there, and believed there was a better opportunity than we had anticipated, we would have the flexibility to go ahead and pursue those additional opportunities. That was not a driver in the design of our plan for the year.", "By far the biggest impact was our decisions on where we felt we were meeting or beating our hurdle rates and deemphasizing writings in those areas where we don't. Remember, that doesn't mean that we just walk away from lines of business, we just deemphasize them in the relative capital allocated in the plan to keep pilot light on them and those businesses for better economic times.", "It's really about how you weight the usage of capital around the business, and here and there, there are some sub lines if you will where there may be some more dramatic action, but it's really very modest.", "The driver is obtaining our hurdle rates and that's what drove the plan. I already talked about long term agreements. That's one of the main effects, is we're not going to be booking to the extent we can avoid them, long term agreements because of course in a rising interest rate environment, a rising rate environment for the risk, why would you want to lock yourself in?", "That of course leaves the mast effect, but again it's minor relative to the main planning and that is where those businesses did show some effects from the rating agency action, so we take that into account in our plans as well.", "David Duclos", "Just to give a little bit more perspective in terms of the Delta with the Insurance numbers, the $5.3 billion to $4.1 billion. Actually 30% of it relates to what we assume we're going to do relative to the long term agreements. And again the driver here is, we're not losing accounts. We're not losing clients. We're just not offering, and in some cases the clients don't want to accept because of our pricing terms, two or three year terms.", "So a big piece of it, $260 million roughly is tied to LTA's. Another impact affecting Insurance number is FX. FX is a bout 90, so if you think about that Delta at $1.2 billion 20% of it comes from just LTA and FX.", "As Mike said, the emphasis of certain lines in the Insurance area which ties to my comments about strengthening pricing and the progressing underwriting issues, is about roughly $300 million, a little bit over that. Keep in mind that $300 million against a base of $5.3 billion is 6% or 7% of the total book, so I think it's a normal portfolio management.", "The rest of that Delta is associated with what I'd say pressure from a ratings perspective, but also the recognition that we believe we're going to have some tougher retention ratios in the first and second quarter tied more to our pricing directives and not necessarily any noise around our ratings.", "Michael McGavick", "Just to be clear, Dave spent so much time in the planning that he's just given specific number, but really we would only forecast a range around those number because no one can predict for sure what will  happen out there.", "[Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital]", "If the market hardens faster than you thought or if the market came to the pricing you're asking for, you might be able to add 10% above your plan and there's no capital constraint on that.", "Michael McGavick", "We have the capacity to write more if we need to or desire to.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from [Trevor Winstead \u2013 Strategic Value Partners]", "[Trevor Winstead \u2013 Strategic Value Partners]", "I was hoping you could comment on where you stand away from ratings triggers on your credit facility covenants.", "Brian Nocco", "We have no covenants that we're anywhere close to on our credit facilities so it's simply not a concern.", "[Trevor Winstead \u2013 Strategic Value Partners]", "Would you also be able to give an update on holding company liquidity and cash out there?", "Brian Nocco", "We have ample liquidity at the holding company to take care of cash needs that we have for the entire year with some contingencies. We manage our upstream movements of capital largely through dividends on a regular basis and so we think we're in a very adequate cash position at the holding company.", "Michael McGavick", "We have reached the end of our time. We very much appreciate your willingness to be on this call and the thoughtful questions. Obviously our team stands ready to handle any clarifications that are necessary and I'll just sum it up the way I left it earlier.", "We're really very proud of what' been achieved here. We have shown the power of this franchise in the most difficult of circumstances and we are prepared to weather the rest of this storm in a way that we think will be very reassuring to our clients, to our brokers, and to our colleagues.", "That's the job ahead and we plan to do all we can to deliver it.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions) Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. David Radulski, XL\u2019s Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "David Radulski", "Thank you, Lindy. Good evening and welcome to XL Capital's third quarter 2009 conference call. This call is being simultaneously web cast on XL's website at www.xlcapital.com. We've posted to our website several documents, including our quarterly financial supplement and our fixed income data supplement.", "Before Mike McGavick, XL Capital's CEO offers his opening remarks, I like to remind you that certain of the matters we'll discus today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and projections. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors including those identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q and other documents on file with the SEC, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.", "Forward-looking statements speak only as to the date which they're made. And we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise.", "And with that I will turn it over to Mike McGavick.", "Michael McGavick", "Good evening. As always, I am joined on the call by XL senior leadership team, although there is an exception this quarter. Jamie Veghte, our Head of Reinsurance is recovering, recent reports recovering well from (inaudible) so he will not be with us. Greg Hendrick, the head of our Bermuda reinsurance operations is going to be filling in for Jamie on this call.", "I'm pleased to share with you some of the results of XL\u2019s continued resurgence, solid underwriting, careful expense management and proven reserving practices provided a very healthy combined ratio of 93.2% from the P&C operations in this third quarter.", "Our book value per ordinary share rose by 26% in the quarter to $23.84, and our tangible book value per share rose by 30% to $21.36. Our total shareholders equity as of September 30 stood at $9.6 billion.", "We are obviously pleased to report these numbers, but at the same time we noted a couple of areas were continued improvement would, I am sure, be appreciated by all. For example, gross written premiums in our P&C operations were in line with our most recent guidance. That still means that it was down 17% year-over-year. Now to be clear, this is due to global economic conditions, our owned planned reunderwriting, as we told you at the beginning of the year and the fact that it is a difficult time in the pricing cycle. But still we over time expect our company to grow as I'm sure.", "Now continuing our strong performance given market conditions means we must remain vigilant in the face of challenging pricing conditions and we will. There are a couple of exceptions to the soft market. For example, we wrote more professional lines of insurance business in quarter three of \u201909 than we did in quarter three of \u201908.", "We will not let pressure from either economic conditions or the underwriting cycle to deter us from taking on the right risks at the right price.", "The second area obviously, which could use improvement is in our investment portfolio. This we have been hard at work on for more than a year. Our very strong Q3 operating income of $306 million or $0.89 per share was obscured by our recognition of $311 million in after-tax net realized losses mainly related to OTTI.", "We continued the realignment of our investment portfolio to one more suited to a P&C company. We are well on our way to that goal and even in this quarter we did reap the benefits of $1.3 billion in improving marks in the quarter. Overall, I'm pleased that our third quarter results demonstrate to you what we are hearing from our customers and brokers everyday. XL stands ready to serve and to continue to succeed.", "We are seeing their submissions, we are leading their programs, and we are committed to leading their needs for their January renewals and beyond. Bluntly, we are committed to being the best insurer and reinsurer that we can be.", "Before I hand it over to Brian to discuss our financials, I would like to thank Brian for his dedicated service to XL in times of great change. We all here at XL wish him the very best personally and professionally and all of us at XL, and I think our shareholders particularly should appreciate his willingness to manage this CFO transition in such a professional way. Brian.", "Brian Nocco", "Thanks, Mike, and good evening. Operating income was $306 million or $0.89 per share for the third quarter with an annualized operating ROE of 16.7% compared to $108 million or $0.39 per share and 5.8% respectively in the prior year quarter.", "Turning to our summary of financial results on slide four, total P&C underwriting income was $88 million for the third quarter compared to a loss of $95 million in the prior year quarter.", "The P&C combined ratio during the third quarter of 93% benefited from favorable prior year development of $74 million with $8 million from the insurance segment and $66 million from reinsurance. Prior period favorable development in the same quarter last year was $93 million. Natural catastrophe losses in the quarter totaled $31 million, net of reinstatement premiums with $15 million from insurance, and $16 million from reinsurance. Natural catastrophe losses in the same quarter last year were $208 million, primarily due to hurricanes Gustav and Ike.", "Foreign exchange markets in the third quarter were relatively stable. Our book value increased by $58 million due to FX, including a P&L gain of $17 million.", "Turning to operating expenses, the $231 million for the quarter included $9 million in restructuring charges, whereas in the prior year quarter the total operating expenses of $319 million included $42 million in restructuring charges. Using constant exchange rates, our underlying operating expenses were $46 million lower this quarter than the third quarter of 2008.", "Our paid-to-incurred ratio was at 139% in the quarter. Excluding prior year development, the paid-to-incurred ratio would be 127%. Paid-to-incurred in the quarter was impacted by payments of $47 million associated with selling \u2013 settling certain reinsurance of Lloyd's Syndicate via reinsurance arrangements. Excluding these RITC payments, the paid-to-incurred ratio would have been 122%.", "The estimate of our underlying effective tax rate for the year declined 12% in the third quarter from 13% in the second quarter due to a change in the mix of geographies of our expected sources of profits. Net realized losses from investments were $326 million of which $322 million arose from OTTI.", "Before handing of to Sarah, I would like to mention that our review today has covered no insurance reinsurance or investment exposure to (inaudible). Now, to Sarah to discuss our investment portfolio.", "Sarah Street", "Good evening. The aggregate mark-to-market for the third quarter consisting of realized and unrealized loss movements was an increase of $1.4 billion. Slide seven shows the key drivers of this positive result for both our P&C and life portfolios, which benefit from both a significant rally in both corporate and trust credit spreads, a modest interest-rate decline in the major currencies.", "For the first time in a while, we saw an improvement in the values of our non-agency RMBS closing 150 million, and our hybrid securities continued their strong price recovery gaining $250 million over the quarter.", "We no longer believe the CLO market to be distressed and have reverted back to the pricing vendors and brokers as our surprising source rather than the internal model valuations.", "Our available to sale fixed income portfolio is now fully marked using third party [ph] prices. Turning to slide eight, our net investment income on the P&C general portfolio was $212 million, a decline of 28% compared to the prior year quarter and down 3% relative to last quarter. These declines has been driven by lower yields as we have $5 billion of our P&C general portfolio invested in floating rate securities and as a result the investment income continued to decline due to currently low levels of short term rates.", "We continued to deploy cash given the improving market conditions, but we have limited purchases to high quality assets, principally agency CMBS, selected corporate names and municipal bonds. In aggregate, we achieved an average yield of 3.9% on these new investments, and the book yield on the P&C portfolio before expenses was 3.6% at the end of the quarter.", "The duration of our P&C portfolio has increased slightly to 2.9 years as a result of these investments. So we remain focused on keeping duration at the shorter end of our range.", "Net income from investment affiliates was 42 million. Again, primarily reflect the strong results from our alternative portfolio, which earned 5.7% for the quarter which is substantially above our normal quarter expectations as well as exceeding market indices.", "As Brian mentioned we had net OTTI of $322 million for the quarter. Included in this amount is 210 million of impairment or our European credit exposure, which we hold in the form of various medium-term notes. As a result of the recent strong rally in European credit markets as well as some realized losses in the underlying forms of assets our discounted cash flow projections, including the reinvestment income declined to a point where we are forecasting a shortfall relative to the par value and coupon [ph] on the notes.", "We took an OTTI charge to address this shortfall. In addition, we have recognized approximately 90 million of net impairments within our structured credit portfolio. The majority related to further deterioration on intrinsic values of lower rate, non-agency RMBS that we had previously impaired. One encouraging sign though is that the number of new impairments was nominal and the charge was driven largely by securities our processes had previously identified as impaired.", "We remain focused on derisking our investment portfolio and transitioning it to one that is more typical of a P&C company. Today we have 54 percent in cash, government related and government supported assets. While our structured portfolio increased in size during the quarter to $9 billion that was due to purchases of agency CMBS, which our government supported as well as the favorable mark-to-market on the assets including the nonagency RMBS that I previously mentioned.", "We reduced our exposure to more volatile assets by $400 million in the quarter, including $200 reductions in nonagency RMBS and CMBS principally due to financial cash flows. We are encouraged to see the gap start to narrow between the market prices and the estimates for intrinsic value of some of our more challenged assets.", "We will continue to monitor this closely and will likely take action where we see price levels approach those close enough to be intrinsic values, when we consider selling to eliminate any downside risk. White line shows the aggregate progress we have made to reduce our allocations for a number of severely impacted or risk-asset classes since January 2008 totaling $9.1 billion. Last quarter, we shared with you our model comparisons between our actual P&C portfolio during the credit crisis, our current P&C portfolio and our targeted P&C portfolio compositions.", "Have we held today's P&C portfolio at the beginning of 2007 through the end of March 2009, we estimate that we would have exposed the negative mark of approximately $1.8 billion compared to the actual P&C portfolio, which excludes negative marks of about $4 billion. Our targeted P&C portfolio would have experienced negative mark of under $1 billion in that same time frame.", "To put another way, we estimate that we have achieved over 70% of the portfolio repositioning. We like to remind everybody that these are modeled comparisons, but based on the fact testing that we have done we are comfortable that these estimates are reflective of the overall results that we would have experienced.", "Now, over to Dave to talk about our insurance operations.", "David Duclos", "Thank you, Sarah. In addition to covering insurance results for the quarter, I will provide an update on our D&O business including our view of sub-prime and Madoff-related exposures. And also provide commentary on market conditions and the strength of our franchise.", "Insurance results for the third quarter were strong despite the challenging macroeconomic conditions impacting many of our clients, and the knockdown effects, which this and other factors are having on the market environment. Life renewal premiums being down as a result of exposure-based reductions globally, both underwriting income and revenues were better than expected. Our combined ratio of 98.6% for the quarter was eight points better than our Q3 2008 result of 106.6%, which was adversely impacted by hurricanes and (inaudible).", "Adjusting for restructuring charges, the insurance segment\u2019s Q3 \u201909 combined ratio was 97.9%. Gross premiums written declined 15.8% or $192 million from Q3 2008, materially better than the first-half decline of 26%, and continuing the improving trends we saw in both the first and second quarters. An example of this improvement can be found in our US professional D&O book, where in the third quarter the book actually increased by 9% compared to Q3 2008.", "Contributing to this result was the \u201cSide A\u201d endorsement agreement with NICO, where this book increased by 2% in September compared to declines that averaged over 45% during the first five months of the year. The gross premiums written variance for Q3 can be explained through planned underwriting actions.", "A reduction in long-term agreements accounted for $85 million, the termination of two MGA programs accounted for $75 million, and changes in our environmental book accounted for another $16 million. The remaining difference was attributable to the strengthening of the US dollar as well as the continued global economic pressures and our push for rates.", "Noticed what I didn\u2019t say about premiums. This is not about the XL noise [ph] factor that we discussed at the end of 2008 and early 2009. And with the results we are announcing today, we expect to be singularly focused on our future.", "Net premiums earned were down 13% or $136 million mostly due to the earn-through of lower gross premiums written as well as FX movements, which accounted for $26 million. On the loss side, our CAT activity for the quarter was limited to $15 million related to the recent Asian earthquakes and related tsunami events and as such these losses were fully covered within our CAT assumptions [ph] for the quarter.", "Our Q3 2009 loss ratio of 69.6% was 10.2 points better than Q3 '08 again driven by lower CAT and large loss activity in the current year.", "My last comment on financial results relates to our Q3 '09 operating expense ratio of 17.2%. While 1.1 points greater than Q3 '08 when normalized for non-recurring adjustments, including restructuring charges, the ratio was 16.1% for the quarter and 16.6% year-to-date. This is in line with expectations and reflect decisions that we made and communicated to you earlier in the year.", "Now let us turn to sub-prime and Madoff. For D&O, E&O, and Fiduciary exposures there were three new sub-prime and nine new Madoff identified reported notices during Q3 \u201909. As anticipated the number of new reported incidents has slowed down and we do not expect a substantial number of additional client counts in the near term related to these events.", "Our focus going forward will be the regular monitoring of these matters through their ultimate resolutions. And while there has been a material number of court decisions involving sub-prime plans where courts have ruled in favor of our insurers. After conducting our most recent review, we believe that remains too early in the life cycle of these outstanding claims for XL to react to the positive trends. That said the current activity does give us confidence in our held reserve levels at this time.", "Now, on to market environment. In a word, challenging. Due to the global economic conditions as well as the competitive environment we find ourselves in as an industry. While we have seen some modest improvement in rates in our books in the third quarter, achieving rates is challenging and has resulted in some losses. In effect, what we saw in Q3 was a continuation of the Q2 story in terms of rates.", "And on an industry basis, we continue to see only selective hardening and the rate price gains which are achieved are often offset by reductions in ratable exposures tied to global economic conditions.", "With that as a backdrop and despite the market challenges just described we continue to see clear and steady improvements in retention and new business submissions throughout the book. Q3 premium retentions continue in the high 70s for all business with casualty lines now in the mid-80s. This improving trend, which began midway through the first quarter, has continued throughout the second and third quarters.", "Third-quarter pricing also shows modest but continued improvement with an aggregate price change of plus 1%. Price trends are improving across some lines of more meaningful increases reflected in both properties at plus 4 and casualty at plus 3.", "The aggregate rate change for the month of September was plus 4%. While encouraging, we all know that one month does not make a trend. Given where we are in the market, we believe these results to be right where they need to be. Retentions and pricing are improving; loss activity is in line with if not slightly better than expectations. New business submission flow continues to increase. In fact, we saw more submissions in the first three quarters of 2009 than we did in the same period last year, and our staff attrition is now better than historical levels.", "In summary, we remain focused on delivering value to our clients and brokers, while generating acceptable returns on the capital we have been entrusted. And with that over to Greg to discuss reinsurance.", "Greg Hendrick", "Thanks, Dave, and good evening. Reinsurance underwriting results for the third quarter were excellent with a combined ratio of 80.5% and a resulting underwriting profit of $76 million. This compares favorably to our performance in the third quarter of 2008, when we had a combined ratio of 105.4% and underwriting loss of $26 million.", "Excluding the impact of catastrophes in prior year development, our combined ratio of 93.4% was down 1 point year-over-year. Gross premiums written for the quarter of $562 million and net premiums earned were $389 million. These represent year-on-year declines in the same period in 2008 of 18% and 20% respectively. 70% of the drop in gross premiums written was due to lower commodity prices, impacting our agricultural portfolio, the continued run off of the structured reinsurance portfolio and the reinstatement premium in the prior year quarter.", "Most of the balance of the drop was the natural result of our continued vigilance for profitable underwriting. New business volume at close to $45 million helped to offset the premium drop, demonstrating the continuing strength of our franchise. Turning to market conditions, short-tail lines of catastrophe exposed regions continue to show improvement. In particular, a significant amount of our third-quarter catastrophe portfolio emanated from the United States.", "On a risk-adjusted basis, we saw a 12% rate increase in this portfolio in line with our experience during the first six months of the year. The long tail lines of business continue to resist upward movement in most areas and classes. While financial institutions\u2019 D&O had a positive rate growth across the globe, the reminder of the casualty classes were flat to down 2.5%. We continue to watch this part of our portfolio closely, and we will take further underwriting actions in order to achieve adequate returns at the upcoming renewals.", "With respect to our life operation, we continue to manage the runoff of the various pieces of assets. During the quarter, this segment did report net income of $20 million. The sale of our US life operations remains on track for completion pending regulatory approval.", "Finally, I like to end the commitment of our employee base is confirmed by the fact that our voluntary retention levels remain consistent with our historical experience. I believe the loyalty of our staff, brokers and customers combined with our stronger balance sheet and less risky investment portfolio leaves XL reinsurance very well positioned for January renewals.", "And now, over to David for Q&A.", "David Radulski", "Lindy, please open the lines for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) Our first question is from Jay Gelb of Barclays Capital.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thanks and good afternoon. My first question is on reserves, the paid-to-incurred level for the third quarter, I believe was 122% even banking out prior year development and reinsurance (inaudible)? Doesn\u2019t that seem elevated? I mean is that too high and how should we think about that in terms of reserve adequacy?", "Brian Nocco", "This is Brian Nocco. I don't think you should think of it as too high. I mean keep in mind that the level of premium that we wrote in the years past was much higher than what is being written now, and so part of this is just the normal process of the reserves paying down from earlier years and taking in premium at lower levels. And I think while you are going to get some variability quarter-by-quarter, I don't think the 122% adjusted for the factors that we discussed is aberrantly high?", "Michael McGavick", "Jay this is Mike, I would add only one thought to that, and that is that if there has been absolutely no change to the deserving approach of philosophy at XL certainly during my tenure here, and in addition if there is anything that we are thinking about is more conservative view we have when it comes to inflation of (inaudible). So, there is no change in the historically conservative approach.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, and then more broadly Mike, can XL generate P&C premium growth in 2010? Will 2009 be the last year of climbing premiums?", "Michael McGavick", "Well, certainly the factors that are driving decline at this time start to fall away. As we moved out of the long-term premiums, as we see our \u2013 the reunderwriting move into the past, I think that puts us on a solid footing. The question of growth though, would really have more to do with the market than will have to do with us. We are very conservative technically driven underwriter, and as you know the pricing environment has been difficult.", "So, well, we have a few areas that we are certainly pushing where we think we have some opportunity to write profitable business. Several lines come to mind, where the professional (inaudible), several new initiatives come to mind like our upper middle market initiative, our INS [ph] initiative. These all give some opportunities to grab some profitable share, but whether that will result in actual \u2013 result in net top line improvement will really depend on market conditions and (inaudible).", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "(inaudible). My final question is on the investment portfolio. Does XL intend to exit the alternative assets as you simplify the investment portfolio?", "Sarah Street", "Hi, Jay. This is Sarah Street. No, we will still have an allocation to the alternative asset class. It will be a smaller size than it has been historically, but we still see a role for the alternative portfolio within a P&C portfolio.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "What magnitude, 5%, 10%?", "Sarah Street", "It is in the 5%, 6% range.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Vinay Misquith from Credit Suisse.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Hi, good evening. The first question is on excess capital if any, and when would you be able to keep (inaudible) debt or preferred stock or maybe even your common stock?", "Michael McGavick", "Vinay, this is Mike. Look, we are constantly examining our capital position, and I would put it in a couple of ways of thinking about it. First I just have to stop for a second and acknowledge what a delightful question that is compared to some of the questions a quarter or two ago. I think that sets the first notion I would put in your mind in motion right.", "The way I think about the economy now is that back in September and October if fell through the ice [ph]. And since then all of us are finding our ways forward on ice that were are little less trustworthy of. And as a result we are going to take a very conservative view because in the end our primary requirement to serve our clients and reward our shareholders is to maintain and improve our ratings. So that is the first consideration we look at this through, and we look at it through that concern with wary eyes, given all that has gone on in the global economy.", "The second thought I have is that while I obviously am cautious about growth, there are nonetheless pockets of opportunity out there, and we want to make sure always that we are ready to take advantage of such opportunities, and third I will recommit to you as I have in the past if it is the collective judgment of our management team and board that we cannot put our shareholders money to work at appropriate returns, then we will look for ways to get that money back to shareholders as we see it appropriate given the concerns that I've just delineated. But you know, well from track record of companies that I have been involved with we take that last commitment very, very seriously.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Sure. What sort of ROE are you targeting in the near term?", "Michael McGavick", "You know, we're still in the middle of our planning process for next year. So I think it is just inappropriate to give guidance at this stage, but I would tell you that we are awfully pleased with the performance of our underwriters in these difficult conditions really, really pleased.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Credit Suisse", "The second question is on the yields on the investment portfolio. I believe new money yield is at 3.9% and the old money yield, I believe at 3.5% is that correct, and so therefore if you start to move more of your cash into new money, should we see an up-tick in the investment?", "Sarah Street", "Your assumptions, your numbers were correct. The money that we are put to work this quarter, we achieved 3.9% and the book yield on the P&C portfolio at least at the end of the quarter was at 3.6%. As we put more new money to work, however, I would say we are managing the constant tensions between putting money to work and extending our duration out too far given the expectation that at some point I think the rates will rise.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Credit Suisse", "But as we put more money to work, hopefully net investment income will improve. Sure, and one last question if I may, on the life of the reinsurance business, some thoughts (inaudible), how should we look at that in the near term in terms of contributions to earnings?", "Michael McGavick", "The life business.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Yes.", "Michael McGavick", "I would say the life business, which as you know the heart of the life business, which is the annuity business and the mortality and critical illness business we put in to run off, that will run off over many years in the absence of permutations or some kind of recapture, and therefore I think you can expect a continued result from the life business that is similar to what is being reported now.", "As you also know we sold the accident and health business in France, which was small. That is out of the results and our US life business, we have an agreement to sell (inaudible) is quite small and so the projections for the life business should continue roughly in line with what you have seen recently.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Brian Meredith with UBS.", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "Hi good evening. A couple of questions here. The first one, I'm curious looking at the insurance business and just the amount of seeded premiums, it looks like you are seeding less business away, and I would have thought with the books (inaudible) transaction that number would have actually gotten greater. Am I missing something?", "David Duclos", "Brian, this is Dave. Actually from a seeding perspective on a reinsurance basis, we have not any structural changes, material structural changes to our reinsurance programs that have been put in place from 2008 compared to 2009, and as a result of this the Berkshire transaction isn\u2019t reflected in the reinsurance proceeding.", "That is actually an expense item that we have. So, that is accounted for separately, so the Berkshire costs are not reflected in the seeding.", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "Okay. Terrific, and then Dave I wonder if you could comment a little bit about what your views of the professional liability market is going to here going forward. It seems like AIG has kind of got its feet under it right now and you know as they get more aggressive here going forward, what are your thoughts in that market?", "David Duclos", "Well, Brian, I guess as Mike alluded to it, it remains one alliance that from an insurance perspective we remain pretty bullish around given our results. So what we expect for 2009 and as we look forward, you know, we have been able to achieve a slightly better than a flat rate change through September in professional. Some parts of that operation we are actually seeing flush rates. In other parts like \u201cside A\u201d business, which is A, extremely profitable and B, very competitive. We are seeing some rates below flat, but we feel we have a very strong franchise.", "It has been reinforced and endorsed certainly with the NICO and Berkshire endorsement, but the result turnaround for this business isn\u2019t simply because of the Berkshire endorsement, we have are very, very good team. We have a business model that we believe adds value to the client and broker, and in a way we sort of take pride to the degree with the contrarian view we have from an underwriting perspective, and we see the dislocation in some cases from a professional standpoint is opportunity for us going forward.", "You had mentioned a particular company. We don\u2019t focus on any particular company. We continue to sell based upon what XL brings to the market, and frankly Brian it has been reinforced and staged relative to the value that brings to us. So we are very pleased with the recovery in this book of business. If you think about what we communicated to you in the first quarter, and we look for opportunities and ways to grow this business smartly as we proceed into 2010.", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "Okay, great. And then just back to Berkshire thing, where is that hitting, is that in the insurance operations, in the administrative expenses, corporate, where can we see it, would that be a reason maybe your expense ratio is a little bit high also?", "David Duclos", "It is slightly \u2013 it is reflected in our insurance results. And the cost obviously it is under fees and other income from an insurance perspective, but I would say from a P&L standpoint Brian, we continue to benefit from the investment we have made, i.e. because of the retention strengthening and because of how we are able to price that business, the costs associated with this are actually offset by the benefits that we are accruing from a profitability perspective.", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "Great. Thank you.", "David Duclos", "Thank you.", "Michael McGavick", "If I could underscore on that last point, I just want make a really important point. I know that there is a lot of reasons, when ranges like this coming into being. We didn't do it for perception. We did it to make more money.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill & Partners.", "Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners", "Hi, mostly a housekeeping question here, here but most companies in the US benefited from CAT losses. It doesn't sound like your insurance operations and maybe your reinsurance benefited that much in this quarter, could you just walk through that for us how much you know was better than we typically have in the third quarter as we try to sort of get to some sort of run rate type of \u2013 sort of normal third quarter number?", "Michael McGavick", "This is Mike. Let me start, one of the \u2013 I would have thought the same thing before I had joined XL, I would have thought as somehow the whole place being very much defined by third quarter CAT. I got to tell you that it's just not the case, as I have learnt the book better that is so not the way it really works in insurance.", "Certainly we have CAT loads and certainly they are seasonally sensitive, with operations all around the world, we could see CAT activities spread through the year. It is just not as concentrated as you might expect. And in reinsurance similarly, while certainly our Bermuda operations particularly have a CAT focus and US focus, that is one part of our reinsurance book, not our entire reinsurance story.", "So it is a bit less than you might have thought going into understanding XL, and a bit more smooth across the year than you might have expected. With that I'm going to turn it over to Dave to talk about how we view the loss ratio in the quarter so that you get some perspective of where we really stand.", "David Duclos", "Yes, thanks Mike. And Paul, the first comment I would make specific to your question about CAT activity in terms of comparing insurance, the Q3 2009 CAT loss for insurance was $15.1 million on a net basis. In Q3 2008, that CAT number was $160 million. So a significant different story, a better story for us from a CAT perspective.", "I would also want to say that how that translates into loss ratio is also very important. For the quarter, the third quarter, when you take out the prior year and CAT activity the comparison is 70.5 in 2009 compared to 80.7 in 2008. So we did see a materially improved loss ratio as a result of less CAT activity and also less attrition of large loss activity.", "On a year-to-date basis in addition to the quarter numbers, we have 70.2 on a loss ratio totally stripped out, no CATS, no prior year as compared to 74.7 in 2008. So 4.5 point improvement on a peer loss ratio basis stripping CAT activity and prior year development and as an outcome and a story [ph], we feel very good about especially given the rate environment he just talked about.", "So to answer your question, we did benefit from the lower CAT activity and lower loss ratio activity in the third quarter.", "Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners", "So how does translates as we think about particularly insurance operations, a 98 combined ratio, obviously you got some expenses to pull out of there related to restructuring, but are you at a comfortable level of ROE all things being equal on an operating basis in the insurance operation at that level?", "Michael McGavick", "All things being equal, and also assuming we are at the bottom of the cycle, and our rate activity would support that if you think about what has progressed from quarter-to-quarter starting in mid-2008. I do believe that is an acceptable expected ROE outcome, and you did point out something from an expense standpoint that we probably are operating somewhere around the 1 point, 1.5 point higher than we normally would again related to the restructuring charges that we took in the first quarter.", "But given our mix of business long-tail and short-tail, and where we are right in the cycle, we feel very good about this outcome, and again in the context of this being at the bottom of the cycle.", "Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners", "So, I understand you should feel good about the fact the company is still around, but I am looking at the sort of 96, 97ish it looks like the range we are at today if you take all these one-timers out. That is okay at the bottom of the trough cycle.", "Michael McGavick", "I would think so, yes.", "Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners", "Thanks. That is great.", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) Your next question comes from Jay Cohen from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Yes, thank you. I just wanted to follow up on a earlier question, you were asked about sort of the retention in net to gross, you mentioned there was no change, but it looks like related to the year ago quarter, you kept a lot more risk and thus you saw net premiums written down a lot less than gross, and going back it looks like every third quarter that retention tended to go down. So what is the change from a year ago because there seems to be a change?", "David Duclos", "This is Dave, and I think this is more a reflection of the composition of the book of business. In particular, our casualty writings which are down, which carries a combination of a (inaudible) and then also the professional restructuring around our reinsurance that was effective 4/1 of this year. Those would be the only two specific issues that would drive any sort of ongoing change in terms of our seed.", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. We should be looking at this change in net premiums written as a measure of how you guys are doing because that was actually pretty modest?", "David Duclos", "It is \u2013 and I think it is somewhat of an indication. We had a \u2013 I think the other phenomena here is we had a very short but steep spike down, if you will in late 2008, the first part of 2009 and as we talked about from a quarter standpoint, we have seen the premium retentions improve almost by 30% in a matter of six months. So that also plays into it a little bit.", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Got it. The next question, if you could just identify maybe on the gross or the net line, probably gross line, what the currency impact was for the overall company, if you can break it down by segment that would be helpful too. In other words, what were the constant dollar, what does the premiums do?", "Michael McGavick", "I'm not sure we have that at our fingertips at the moment. We'll comeback for that.", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, and then the next question, rating agencies, will they look at the realized losses and sort of raise a flag. Is that going to be an issue for them or do you have a sense that they're pretty content with the balance sheet as it is?", "Michael McGavick", "As you know, we always let our rating agency friends speak for themselves, but we have had conversations with the rating agencies as these numbers became clear and we are very pleased with those conversations.", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. I'll stop there. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your final question comes from Ian Gutterman with Adage Capital.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital Management", "Hi, I have some questions for Sarah on the portfolio side. I guess, first I'm looking at the financial corporate exposure, and you know, the non-hybrid portion, the senior and stuff that is about $3.5 billion is pretty much at par right now on average anyway, why not reduce that significantly at this point?", "Sarah Street", "Well, it all comes down to weighing up the investment income give up on those because they are bonds that we purchased some time ago, and generally they are in pretty high quality institutions, and that top of the capital structure. So, we are fairly comfortable with that versus the net investment income.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital Management", "What about just the issue of concentration? I mean isn't that the bigger issue. I'd rather (inaudible) and just to not be so concentrated in one sector.", "Sarah Street", "We were reasonably comfortable with the level of financial institutions exposure that we have. I would tell you that I would actually given the improvement that we've seen in the prices of number it is a hybrid. That would be where I would seek to reduce my concentration risk more.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital Management", "Okay.", "Sarah Street", "One of the important things is that lot of our financial institution exposure comes from the life portfolio, because we need to own long duration assets, and financial institutions are generally the issuers of the longer duration assets for the assets and liabilities matching. That has to be factored in.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital Management", "Okay, sure enough. If I can ask for the opposite of that question, you have a large position of agency CMBS, has the policy done very well. Some people would argue that there has been a \u2013 a lot of people are hiding there and they're overvalued. Does that make sense to you, maybe diversify out of that some instances have been a good position for you and put it into something else?", "Sarah Street", "Yes, that's an issue that we debate on a regular basis with the investment committee. I think the key thing is that we are seeing significantly on the weight basis CMBS relative to most CMBS portfolios [ph]. So we have actually being pushing money towards the less forceful, less money towards than you would expect it in terms of both transitioning towards a P&C portfolio exactly because at this point they seem fairly valued, and we would not be surprised once the government purchase program in the second quarter or the first quarter next year I am convinced [ph] that we might see a little bit spread widening there. We would see more opportunity to actually put more money in agency CMBS.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital Management", "Got it, okay, and my last one is can you just talk about the confidence you have in the ability to get recovery out of, I'm looking mainly at the CLOs, but I guess you could also argue about the subprime and Alt-A that is below investment grade, but those three asset classes have still significant, you know, significant negative marks and high below investment grade content. What's the story for these recoveries and without having to be impaired at some point?", "Sarah Street", "Well, obviously at the end of each quarter we do our impairment analysis, excluding looking at security by security basis and based off our assumptions at the end of the quarter, we had confidence that those assets would recover or otherwise we would have been required to make the (inaudible). We started to see prices improve quite dramatically in those assets, certainly on the CBOs where there is a large unrealized at this point.", "I mean I think it's important to know, we work with a specialist manager and they have a pretty disciplined impairment approach factoring in both (inaudible) and it is based off that analysis that we've done the impairment up to date. In addition, we've actually have them run some scenarios for us using default rates that are considerably higher than what is being forecasted by the market, unless we might see some small additional losses within that portfolio if that happens. It's not material for us.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital Management", "Okay, very good. Thank you.", "Michael McGavick", "You know, sometimes \u2013 this is Mike \u2013 one thing I would add to all of that is you know, what \u2013 you heard Sarah in her earlier opening comments refer to the real progress we've made towards getting to kind of the strategic asset allocation that we want to manage the portfolio on an ongoing basis, and I want to emphasize next year questions very strongly.", "We are always going to be examining that portfolio for ways to accelerate our progress towards that as a destination. We understand that our North Star is not to grab yield, our North Star is to have a portfolio that is viewed as in the pack and not an issue and that's the real North Star we are driving.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital Management", "I agree 100%, Mike. You've done a great job out of the only one that still stands out a little bit is financials. Everything else I think you made great progress on. Thank you.", "Michael McGavick", "We appreciate the comments and Sarah and her team have done a great job here. It's amazing when you think about the progress in here \u2013 and we just look for ways to make that progress happen even faster.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital Management", "Thank you.", "Brian Nocco", "This is Brian Nocco. Let me get back to the question on the impact of FX rates on our premium volume, and I'll give you some statistics or data on that. First here today the impact on\u2013 and I only have it for the company as a whole. I don't in front of me have it by segment. Gross written premium was suppressed by $229 million, net written premium $164 million, and net earned premium $206 million. That's year-to-date. For the quarter same three numbers impact on gross premiums, $25 million, net written premium $19 million, and net earned premium $43 million.", "Keep in mind that we also have somewhat of an offsetting impact on our expenses as you are working your way down the income statement, but specifically in response to the question those were the impacts year-over-year as a result of FX rates on the premium losses.", "Operator", "We have one more question from Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thanks. I just wanted to follow up on a prior question with regards to the gross retention within the P&C business. Year-to-date it is running at about 76%. I'm trying to get a sense. Is that the right run rate for the year and directionally would you anticipate that that detention increases in 2010?", "Michael McGavick", "Jay, I'm assuming you're directing that from insurance, but directionally that's \u2013", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "What actually for the insurance and reinsurance combined.", "Brian Nocco", "Okay. Well, let me comment first and ask Greg to comment about on it from a reinsurance perspective. The retentions from an insurance perspective are actually now approaching close to 80, and again keep in mind that our plan \u2013 our initial plan assumptions was something less than that, actually several points less than that. Historically we've operated as we have indicated in the past, in the mid-80s, especially when you strip out the nonrecurring renewal for policies in that.", "So we are quickly moving back to a spot exposure to historical level from a retention standpoint. I give you just a bit of caution relative to how soon will we get back there. It also relates to the comment Mike made earlier about growth. It's somewhat going to be dependent upon market conditions, and I guess just one example to sort of make this point. When we looked at third quarter large account impacts, the four largest impacts weren\u2019t accounts we lost, but actually accounts that had their exposure basis reduced so much that our premiums written as compared to the prior year were actually down by over a half million dollars.", "So, you know, again these are premium retention numbers and largely influenced by what happens from a macroeconomic perspective. Hard to try and quantify when you strip that out, but I would say that when you try and normalize for that fact, we're actually getting very close to what would be on an apples-to-apple basis a mid-80s number. So directionally, we do feel good about it from an insurance standpoint. I will now ask Greg to comment (inaudible).", "Greg Hendrick", "I think, looking at a nine month year-to-date number of 76% in reinsurance, as the capital comes back onto the balance sheet we can take a little bit more risk back on particularly in some of that driven line. But in general, across the whole book, we wouldn't expect that to change dramatically in the future.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, so if I \u2013 so to summarize that would be insurance maybe up a little, reinsurance where it is.", "Greg Hendrick", "Yes, yes.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to your speakers for closing comments.", "Michael McGavick", "Yes, this is Mike. Just a couple of closing comments, obviously overall we are very pleased with the quarter, particularly with the operating results we produced here. This is very gratifying and I'm sure our people around the world will feel very proud. You all know very well that excellence is made up of things large and small, and during the quarter a few things happened that are not in the world of things, you know, that big a deal, but they were just reminders that through all that's gone on XL continue to do some really special things.", "We climbed into the top 100 in the 2009 InformationWeek 500 at XL Re [ph] because of the quality of the systems improvements that have been made. We are proud of that. We showed up at 239 in the Greenest Big Companies in America in the Newsweek rankings. We're proud of that and it's small, but important at the formal meetings which Dave and I attended along with our European colleagues. We won the Best Booth Award [ph]. You know, excellence comes from a lot of things and these results are a lot of things done well by our colleagues around the world, and we are really proud of where we stand and working hard to get these last items out of the way for that excellence shines without further comments. Thanks for being a part of the call and we look forward to talking to you at the end of the year.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL\u2019s Director of Investor Relations.", "David Radulski", "Good evening and welcome to XL Capital\u2019s first quarter 2010 earnings conference call. This call is being simultaneously webcast on XL\u2019s website at www.xlcapital.com. We\u2019ve posted to our website several documents including our quarterly financial supplement and our fixed income portfolio data. ", "On our call today, Mike McGavick, XL Capital\u2019s CEO will offer opening remarks. Simon Rich, our Interim CFO will review our financial results followed by David Duclos, our Chief Executive of Insurance Operations and Jamie Veghte, Chief Executive of ReInsurance operations who will review the segment results and market conditions. Sarah Street, our Chief Investment Officer is with us today and available for Q&A.", "Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that certain of the matters we\u2019ll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, and therefore you should not place undue reliance on them.", "Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. ", "Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise.", "And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike McGavick.", "Michael McGavick", "Good evening. I\u2019m pleased to report to you another quarter of solid operating results even as the global P&C industry experienced some of its worst quarter one-cat events ever. Our nearly break even P&C combined ratio of 100.5 included a 14.3 points from the Chilean earthquake and storm Xynthia as our estimates from these losses from these two events remains within the preliminary range we published in March.", "We did see some offsets against these caps with 6.9 point of positive prior year development, mostly from short sale property lines in both Insurance and ReInsurance. For the fourth consecutive quarter, we grew out book value for ordinary share, this time another 7% to $26.38 and by 8% intangible book value per share to $23.92, and total shareholders\u2019 equity increased from $9.4 billion to $10 billion.", "The first quarter caps impact on operating income and the continued increase in our shareholders equity resulted in annualized operating ROE of 6.9% for the first quarter. Without the impact of the two named cats, our operating ROE would have been 14.2%.", "We see these results as an endorsement of our continued discipline in both underwriting and risk management, and I\u2019ve said before, and I\u2019ll say it again, perhaps as much for the benefit of any XL underwriters who are listening in, XL will not write coverage at uneconomic price levels.", "So while we grew our P&C top line by 2.3% year over year, much of that growth, as we had anticipated and predicted at the beginning of the  year, came from lines we found attractive, including aerospace, cat and DNO as well as several long time customers returning to XL. We welcomed them back.", "Meanwhile, we continue to lower our premiums written for multi-year Insurance premiums and from uneconomic businesses such as casualty, factory and Insurance that we exited last year. ", "It was a quiet quarter for our investment portfolio, which is looking more like the P&C portfolio should, as our optimization program continues. And while we saw the benefit of a $522 million in favorable marks to market this quarter, I should remind you that what goes up goes down and as interest rates can rise or fall, we\u2019ll just have to see what happens next.", "We do know that our excellent liquidity and well-matched asset liability profile will let us ride out any interest rate volatility.", "On a risk management note, in March of 2009 we instructed our portfolio managers, and here I guess I\u2019m more in line with current news, I instructed our managers back in March of 2009 to stop purchasing sovereign debt from Greece and Ireland and severely restricted exposures to the debt of Portugal, Italy and Spain.", "So our cumulative exposure to sovereign debt from these five countries is down to approximately $34 million or less than one tenth of one percent of our entire investment portfolio, including no exposure to Greece.", "Likewise, we made significant progress on another risk management initiative. Last week, as you well know, our ordinary shareholders approved several proposals, most notably our change of parent domicile from the Cayman Islands to Ireland.", "There are several more conditions to satisfy before this move will be complete, but shareholder approval was a significant move in the right direction, and we thank our shareholders for supporting the recommendations of management and the Board.", "Also in current news, as you noticed in our release yesterday, we are very pleased to announce that Irene Esteves has agreed to join XL as our Chief Financial Officer. She is a deeply experienced business leader and we\u2019re delighted to have her on our team. Irene joins us on May 17.", "You can also look forward to the release of our global loss triangles this week. Now I\u2019ll finish my remarks on the first quarter by saying that XL is once again firing on all cylinders in a very difficult market condition. ", "Our underlying P&C results are solid and showing positive trends. Our risk management efforts are proving out and our organization, we believe, is getting stronger by the day. While the entire P&C faces challenges deploying capital in this kind of pricing environment, we believe we can build on XL\u2019s success by providing our brokers and customers with the coverage\u2019s they value and the service they demand.", "Before I turn it over to Simon, I should comment on the terrible events in the Gulf of Mexico. Like anyone on this call, we deeply mourn the loss of life and we\u2019re all watching with horror the continuing and likely environmental damage. ", "It\u2019s much too early to know what the insurable losses are on a total basis, and what portion of these losses XL might cover, but we can say this. We believe that our total property damage exposure to the rig itself is approximately $30 million including $5 million in reinstatement premiums and we have in fact, already paid much of this in claims. For what it\u2019s worth, that would equate to a roughly $900 million industry event.", "Now as I hand it over to Simon, I would like to thank him publicly for his outstanding service as XL\u2019s interim CFO since the first of the year. Thanks Simon, and on to you.", "Simon Rich", "Thanks Mike, and good evening. Before I comment on the results of the quarter, I wanted to take a moment to expand on the comment in our press release on our calculation of operating income.", "We manage foreign exchange volatility from an economic perspective through the matching of assets and liabilities. However, GAAP provides an asymmetrical treatment for the movement of assets and liabilities with the results of a foreign exchange gain or loss in the income statement really doesn\u2019t represent any underlying economics.", "We\u2019ve discussed this with a number of you and what you\u2019ve told us is that you too, really don\u2019t find it a relevant indicator of performance. Accordingly, we\u2019ve decided that we will no longer include foreign exchange gains and losses within our operating income, and we\u2019ve represented prior periods on a consistent basis.", "Page 30 of our financial supplements shows the operating income for each of the quarters since the first quarter of 2009 on this new basis. And now to the results themselves.", "Operating income for the quarter was $150 million or $0.44 per ordinary share with an annualized operation ROE of 6.9%. This compares to $191 million , $0.57 per ordinary share and 14.9% respectively in the prior year quarter.", "Turning to our summary financial results on Slide 4, P&C gross premiums written were up by 2.3% from the prior year quarter, reflecting targeted new business growth including the recapture of certain business lost in 2009, and $15 million more of non catastrophe related reinstatement premiums than in the prior year quarter.", "P&C net premiums written increased by 6.1% reflecting a reduction in the levels of seeded premium in the quarter. I would say that part of this is a timing difference and we expect some $25 million of ReInsurance purchases that would otherwise have been made in the first quarter to occur in later quarters this year.", "P&C net premiums were down 4.4% in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2009. This reflects the rolling effects of prior period\u2019s lower written premium. The P&C combined ratio for the first quarter of 100.5% shows the effect of first quarter cats of $181 million, which as set out on Slide 5, added 14.3 points to the loss ratio for the quarter.", "This was offset in part by favorable prior year development of $87 million, which is line with the $90 million recognized in the prior year quarter. In the current quarter, $72 million of the releases were from short tail lines.", "Our underlying combined ratio excluding prior year development and natural catastrophe\u2019s was 93.1%, 3.8 points better than the prior year quarter. This improvement reflects the restructuring costs in the first quarter of 2009, changes in our business mix and the benefits of the higher non-catastrophe reinstatement premiums I referred to earlier.", "Investment income on the P&C portfolio decreased in Q1 compared to the prior year quarter. This was due to lower portfolio yield, driven by the decline in LIBOR, combined with high concentrations of cash and governments as we move towards a portfolio that\u2019s more typical of a P&C insurer.", "During the quarter, we put new money to work largely in investment grade credit, achieving an average rate of 3.2% and as a result P&C\u2019s duration increased marginally to three years. At March 31, 2010, the P&C portfolio book yield gross of fees, was 3.6%.", "As a result of recent developments in certain European government markets, we\u2019ve added additional disclosures to our fixed income supplement. As you can see, within the Euro zone, 94% of our government holdings are in France and Germany. ", "At $229 million of operating expenses for the quarter, with $39 million or 15% lower year over year. The reduction arises principally from the fact that we incurred some $40 million of restructuring costs in the prior year quarter, with this reduction offset in part by $6 million of higher reported expenses arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations.", "In the first quarter, we recognized a gain to ordinary shareholders of $16.6 million from the further repurchase of Series C preference shares and now the remaining par value outstanding of those shares is only $71.9 million.", "The main drivers of our 7% growth in book value per ordinary share were operating earnings and the favorable mark to market of $522 million during the quarter. This arose from tightening credit spreads and from lower interest rates, and as set out on Slide 3, we ended the first quarter with over $12.5 billion in total capital, an increase of over 4% in the quarter.", "Now over to David.", "David Duclos", "Insurance segment results for the first quarter were strong considering the impact of Q1 cats including most notably the Chilean earthquake. Our combined ratio of 101.6% for the quarter was 2.7 points higher than our Q1 2009 results of 98.9%, which had been favorably impacted by limited cat activity. Adjusting for both cat and prior year development, the Insurance segment\u2019s 2010 combined ratio of 96.4% was 2.7 points better than the same period last year.", "Gross premiums written in Q1 increased 3.7% or $41 million year over year. We are fully aware of the difficult trading environment, and I can assure you that we are in no way relaxing our underwriting discipline. Our growth was led by selected business wins and increased participation in attractive lines including professional, marine, upper middle market and aviation.", "As Mike mentioned, it also included some significant win backs in several lines including professional, which is particularly rewarding. Net premiums earned were down just over 1% or $13 million as we recognized the anticipated earn through of last year\u2019s lower gross premiums written.", "On the loss side, Q1 cat losses were partially offset by some favorable prior year development largely in our short tail lines.  Our Q1 2010 loss ratio was 72.3% compares to 67.6% last year. However, when adjusted for both cats and prior year development, our underlying loss rate ratio is slightly better year over year at 67.1% versus 67.85. This was driven primarily by a lack of property losses, exiting less attractive businesses and the related shift in business mix.", "Acquisition expenses were up slightly, reflecting modestly higher brokerage commissions in some line as well as a change in our business mix to lines such as professional and specialty that have always had higher brokerage commission structures.", "This was partially offset by reduced operating expenses as our previously announced expense and organizational initiatives took hold. Total expense ratio for Q1 2010 of 29.3% was two points lower than Q1 2009.", "Before I move on to market conditions, let me provide a couple of comments on our Professional book and why our profitability outlook remains in line with expectations. First, we saw lower than expected claims activity during the first quarter in our core professional book as the overall industry SEC class action frequency was lower than for the same period of 2009.", "Second, various financial crisis related matters from the 2007 and 2008 period developed favorably for XL along with the rest of the DNO industry during the quarter. As a result, we remain comfortable with our initial valuation of XL\u2019s financial crisis exposure and the reserves we hold against it.", "Regarding the market, despite the challenging macro economic conditions faced by many of our clients we continue to see clear and steady improvements in both retentions and new business submissions throughout our book. Our premium retentions for the first quarter were just over 85% on a segment basis, significantly better than the low 70\u2019s experienced in Q1 2009. We are now back on track for historical retention levels.", "What does give us concern is broad market pricing. After three quarters of modest increases of plus 1% and plus 2%, we saw some give back as our overall pricing declined 1% for the first quarter, slightly better than the Q1 2009 decline of 1.6%. We saw this reflected across most lines, with the only notable pricing increases recorded in our specialty book.", "While we recognize the challenging market, we continue to build on our Insurance foundations of underwriting and claims bank. We successfully recruited two market leaders, [Zarana Mogg] and Patrick Tannic to join our team. Zarana will be joining us as Chief Executive of our North America P&C unit and Patrick is already on board as our Bermuda country manager. Welcome.", "Operationally we turned the switch on our new centralized global claims management system in the U.S., Canada and Bermuda. We see improved customer service, faster response, and lower cost as only three of the benefits of this upgrade. We intend to expand the system throughout South American, Europe and Asia next year.", "XL is approaching 2010 much as we finished 2009. We continue to renew existing books of business where rates are acceptable. We\u2019re selectively writing new business at the right price, and we continue taking necessary actions to lower our expenses, all while remaining disciplined in our underwriting and engage with our brokers and clients.", "I\u2019ll finish with some observations we made at RIMS, which was held in Boston last week. XL hosted over 225 client meetings at RIMS and we heard time and again what they were looking for; a lead writer than can provide existing and new products and services supported by solid risk engineering, a clear history of claims performance and a global presence, all supported by a solid capital foundation. It was reassuring to hear that what they want, we can provide.", "And now to Jamie to discuss ReInsurance.", "James Veghte", "Thanks David and good evening. XL RE also enjoyed a positive quarter in difficult market conditions and significant levels of natural catastrophe activity. Our underwriting results for the quarter were good with a combined ratio of 97.8% resulting in an underwriting profit of $8.1 million. This compares with a combined ratio of 77.2% in Q1 of 2009.", "Embedded in these results were losses of $81.6 million and $19.9 million from the Chilean earthquake and windstorm Xynthia respectively. The result also included positive prior year reserve releases of $53.8 million.", "Adjusting for cat losses and prior year releases, the segment had a combined ratio of 84.8%, a seven point improvement over the first quarter of 2009. This improvement was driven by 3.5 points on the expense ratio related to our U.S. crop portfolio, acquisition, the cost of adjustments in Bermuda and Europe and non-recurring severance charges from the first quarter of 2009.", "The loss ratio also had a 3.5 point improvement driven by the benefit of reinstatement premiums in Europe on non property business and a mix of business impact on property increase proportionately and a decrease in our trade credit business.", "Turning to top line gross net premiums written were $790 million and $695 million respectively, basically flat year over year growth and a 3% increase net driven by reduced sessions on our multi-carrier crop portfolio.", "Finally, turning tour Life Operations, contribution during the quarter was $49 million. This included a one-time gain of $13.8 million as a result of three treaties being commuted with clients.", "I\u2019d like to comment briefly on the Chilean earthquake before turning to market conditions. While it\u2019s still early, and we are relying heavily on model results to establish our net loss estimate, we feel very good about our performance in this event. Our Latin American business unit contributed $66 million of the $82 million total loss to the segment with the remainder emanating from Bermuda and our London retro book.", "Based on our estimate market share as published by the Superintendant of Insurance in Chile and assuming an industry loss of $6 billion to $8 billion, which we believe to be the case, our net loss is well below what peer market share analysis would indicate. This is principally due to fairly aggressive use of what I would describe as spot retrocession purchasing in the region.", "The distribution of this loss into the industry with perhaps upwards of 80% to 90% into the ReInsurance market, is reflective of some broader issues in emerging markets we believe need to be addressed by the industry. This would include heavy reliance on proportional Insurance, event or asses the limits on these structures at levels that make them virtually meaningless, inadequate underlying rate levels and commission structures that do not allow sufficient margin to fund events of this magnitude.", "While the event will obviously provide the market with an opportunity to address underlying rate adequacy, we will also advocate significant structural change in the market, principally a reliance on non proportional ReInsurance, our preferred product.", "As we\u2019ve mentioned in our last few calls, market conditions remain challenging. We\u2019ve kept our top line flat due principally to recaptured business that was lost at year end 2008 and selected new opportunities, mostly in Europe.", "We are broadly concerned about market conditions however. For example, our Japanese cap portfolio jus turned over April 1, with a risk adjusted reduction in pricing of 5.5%. This is in a market that clearly needed more rate as we entered the renewal, and as a result, we reduced our position in this very important market yet again.", "On the long tail side as David mentioned, there is broad competition across the market although we do see pockets of positive in some areas of the professional lines and U.K. for example. Overall, we\u2019re very pleased with our underwriting performance against this backdrop and we will continue to be vigilant with our underwriting as this phase of the market plays itself out.", "With that, I will turn it back to David for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank.", "Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "First, regarding the operating expenses for the quarter, should we assume that these lower expenses somewhat resemble perhaps a run rate for modeling going forward?", "Michael McGavick", "Yes, you should.", "Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Irene Esteves coming to live in Bermuda?", "Michael McGavick", "In the ultimate, that\u2019s always up to the Bermudian government, but she has been granted a temporary work permit and she\u2019s expecting to work based in Bermuda.", "Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Regarding what may happen with the stock and the indexes.

I would refer you simply to our general guidance about capital management. We believe the first job is to make sure we have enough capital to weather any storm according to our standards, not just the rating agencies and the regulators.", "We would second of course, look for where else in our sector we could put it to work for good advantage for our shareholders, and then third, if we had enough by the first test and by the second test, and had nowhere advantageous to put it, then we would look at returning it to our shareholders by whatever we thought was the best method and obviously in doing so, we would always want to do so in a wise way and being opportunistic would be one of the wise ways to do so.", "Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Have you had any discussions with the rating agencies about capital assets monitoring. You monitor your own capital, but the rating agencies do have the badge and the gun to some extent.", "Michael McGavick", "There\u2019s no doubt about that. It\u2019s a big gun. We are in constant contact with our rating agencies. I always have to let them speak for themselves. It\u2019s inappropriate for me to do so. I can only tell you that from our end, we consider those conversations to be very constructive. Obviously, they can see these results just as you can. We think all the markers of the strengthening and healthy franchise are present.", "Operator", "You're next question comes from Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Can you give us a sense of the normalized premium growth versus the 2.3% that was reported X sort of one timers and foreign exchange. And on Page 13 of the supplement, the action at year loss picks were mostly stable X cats and prior year development. I\u2019m just looking at that in light of your commentary that pricing continues to be weak.", "Michael McGavick", "There is noise in the year over year top line numbers and we would suggest that when you normalize for all of those various elements, the noise whether FX or programs that we\u2019re exiting that are running off versus growth in lines that we\u2019re very positive about, I would put it really in Insurance kind of near the 10% range would be the actual kind of preferred book on preferred book growth.", "So we\u2019re very pleased with that number. We examine ourselves very closely given the market conditions and remain pleased. On ReInsurance, it\u2019s flattish over time, maybe even slightly negative.

I have no reason to change what we told you at the beginning which is we\u2019re looking at low single digit growth.", "David Duclos", "Let me take both questions, both your premium question as well as your loss ratio questions in terms of the stability of the accident result. First, just to amplify what Mike said, from a premium standpoint in the segment, you\u2019ve got to recall, we certainly do painfully, the first quarter of 2009 was the most challenging time for us and our retentions had actually dropped down to 73%.", "This quarter, our retentions are up almost to 86% so keep that in mind as you think about growth quarter to quarter. The other piece is new business. We had planned for a considerable increase over the new business result we achieved last year this quarter. We actually surpassed new business on that basis, but we\u2019re far short of what the planned assumption was primarily because of market conditions.", "And I would also say as Mike commented on, that part of our new business success was tied to customers coming home if you will, people that we know very well in terms of profitability. So from a production standpoint, we feel good about the segment results when you flatten out all the one off anomalies.", "Let me quickly also before I turn it over to Jamie, maybe address your observation on the loss ratio, and actually when you do strip out cat activity and prior year development, we saw a slight improvement from first quarter 2010 as compared to first quarter 2009, and actually a fairly stable result quarter to quarter.", "And your point was how are we doing that despite rate earn through which would suggest a negative impact. First of all, we actually started to change the pricing trend about a year ago this time, but I would say that earning though now would create a bit of an increase in the loss ratio. But a couple of things to keep in mind, first in the first quarter, we had less non cat property losses, especially in our international book.", "That is one positive effect. The other, we  have exited less attractive businesses over the past six quarters. Abco, W. Brown, and some parts of our environmental, U.S. Marine and the remaining remnants of our surety business. We are picking up a bit of it in a related shift if you will in related business.", "And then the last one I\u2019d say is we\u2019ve continually become better at risk management and underwriting modeling. All those things have added up to stabilize the loss ratio despite pricing pressure.", "James Veghte", "As far as ReInsurance is concerned the accident year loss ratio is affected by several facts. One is business mix. In the first quarter of 2009, property cat represented 16% of our net earned premium. It\u2019s now 21%. And we did reduce our position in the trade credit business quite substantially, so there\u2019s a big business mix change.", "In addition, during quarters three and four of 2009, we took 2.7 and 2.5 loss ratio points from impacts from old structured product contracts. And finally, during this quarter, we enjoyed the benefit of $12 million of reinstatement premium on a non property program in Europe, which contributed quite substantially.", "In terms of growth, in ReInsurance we try not to predict things too much because it can be lumpy depending on the amount of renewal activity we have in each quarter. As you know, the first quarter is very heavy, the second quarter is reasonably light and then we move into July 1 very heavy and then virtually none the rest of the year.

So we continue to report what we consider to be our good progress and we continue to hope that this will cause from them a reaction.", "By the way, we very quickly looked up the expirations you were looking for, or maturations I should say.

They\u2019re spending more time closer to the markets. I would only preface any comment with a simple observation that if logic dictated pricing, we wouldn\u2019t talk about declining pricing in many of our segments at all. So we have to be careful before we predict where the market will do even with what logic would tell us what it should do.", "On the win backs and sensitivity to ratings, gosh you know, we noticed throughout the crisis if the market had been overwhelming rating sensitive, we would have lost a lot of business. Instead, a lot of business stayed with us right through the challenges.", "We like to think that\u2019s because our front line people are so capable and stayed together.

I think over the last couple of years, and you have to keep in mind, clients are also very aware and interested in what rating agencies do from their own business perspective. I think they\u2019ve become much more sophisticated relative to understanding the true financial strength and trends of companies and I think there\u2019s a couple of different places clients look for now to give them insight and they don\u2019t rely solely on rating agencies.", "Operator", "You're next question comes from [Amud Reza \u2013 Bauman Capital]", "[Amud Reza \u2013 Bauman Capital]", "It sounds like this pricing is taking the wrong turn for us right now in the primary markets.

I think around this table we have people who have been through several complete cycles and we all know that there is theoretical tea leaves and we also know that every cycle we either lived through or have examined on a historical basis, acted in an extremely unpredictable and idiosyncratic way.", "The most obvious is when you have some massive change in the capital base of the industry.

And I just think you could get a turn from any of those things, but the reality is, right now whereas there were some optimistic signs in our pricing as you moved through last year toward the end of the year, it\u2019s kind of reversed itself in a small way at this stage, and we\u2019ll just have to wait and see.", "I can\u2019t give you a better answer than that. I think it will be what it will be and we know that our job is to manage through the cycle, and that means we stay disciplined about our underwriting criteria.

Would it be fair to say you might be opportunistic on the capital management or buy back issue but those first two pillars have been fulfilled, i.e. believe you have a rock solid capital base and that organic opportunities may not be abundant.", "Michael McGavick", "No question that XL feels very good about its capital position today and as a result, we are examining the other stages if you will of our examination.

They were recaptured by decedent and we did record a gain of just over $13 million from that. As ever, these things are impacted by foreign exchange movements.

Are there other lines where it makes sense for the picks to be lower versus what we think as a general trend of prices getting worse?", "James Veghte", "Let me take the casualty growth because a fair amount of that was with us. If you\u2019ll notice we had $42 million of growth in ReInsurance casualty writing. That\u2019s split basically equally between the reinstatement premium item that Simon mentioned before, about $12.5 million of recaptured business that we had lost in that market at the end of 2008.

And really, the key thing for us is the benefit that we\u2019re starting to see earnings through on business that\u2019s been shed, that has been not as attractive, i.e. lower margins. And it doesn\u2019t necessarily show up on the one page in the financial supplement.", "A good example of that is within our specialty and casualty, there\u2019s some pieces that are actually growing a bit with some of our sub products where the profits are pretty strong still and then there\u2019s other lines that are being to a large degree, eliminated totally.", "So underneath those product line groups you see a lot of action. But for Insurance it is really the benefit of earning through a better loss ratio, because we\u2019ve got a  higher concentration of more profitable business.", "Michael McGavick", "I wouldn\u2019t want to leave with you with the sense that you framed the question of a combined ratio too, and do remember that we were still in the throes of our expense reductions when you look on a quarter over quarter basis and so 2.7 points of the improvement are directly attributable to the charge that we had taken for the expense reduction. So while we\u2019re very pleased with the underwriting performance and what we do see as real improvements, you could over read them if you don\u2019t back that out.", "Operator", "You're next question comes from Vinay Misquith \u2013 Credit Suisse.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Credit Suisse", "A follow up on the exposure to Spain and Portugal. On the financial guarantee, would there be any way that you would be forced to make the payment earlier than the maturity date if that debt was restructured?", "Michael McGavick", "If you question is if there is an acceleration in these contracts, the answer is no. ", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "On your daily limitations for share repurchases, do you have that number? So should we see XL moved out of the S&P, how much stock can you buy back maximum per day?", "Michael McGavick", "Again, we\u2019re into a speculative area that I\u2019ve chosen not to comment on earlier, so I think I\u2019ll still choose not to comment on it now. The one thing we could have the limitation up on our current authorization, and that\u2019s obviously the first place to look, but again, these are matters that we consider on a regular basis as part of our overall capital management and we\u2019ll just have to leave it at that for now. I appreciate the point of curiosity, but it\u2019s just something that we\u2019re going to keep thinking about.", "Operator", "I\u2019m showing no further questions.", "Michael McGavick", "Just to conclude, on this end we very much appreciate your time. I know David and the team are available for further questions and if there\u2019s anything that we can further clarify around some of these questions, we\u2019re always happy to do so. ", "I will tell you we are very pleased with this quarter. We think it is showing the real signs of what, I guess the real financial evidence of doing what we say we will do and we hope that will be a continuing mark of this management team.

My name is Shirley (ph) and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the XL Group TLC Second Quarter Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL\u2019s Director of Investor Relations.", "David Radulski", "Thank you, Shirley. Good evening and welcome to XL Capital\u2019s Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being simultaneously webcast on XL\u2019s website at www.xlgoup.com. We\u2019ve posted for our website several documents including our quarterly financial supplement and our fixed income portfolio data.", "On our call today, Mike McGavick, XL Capital\u2019s CEO will offer opening remarks. Irene Esteves, our CFO will review our financial results followed by David Duclos, our Chief Executive of Insurance Operations and Jamie Veghte, Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations, who will review the segment results and market conditions. Sarah Street, our Chief Investment Officer is with us today and available for Q&A.", "Before they begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that certain of the matters we\u2019ll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, and therefore you should not place undue reliance on them.", "Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.", "Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they\u2019re made and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise.", "And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike McGavick.", "Michael McGavick", "Good evening. XL Group provided investors with another quarter of solid results.", "We generated net income to ordinary shareholders of $192 million or $0.56 per ordinary share.", "For the fifth straight quarter, we grew book value per share, this time by 5% and tangible book value per share was up by 6%. These gains were driven by investment portfolio market to market and net income.", "Operating return on equity for the quarter was 10.5%. Our investment portfolio\u2019s favorable market to market of 349 million this quarter was driven by interest rate declines even as corporate credit spreads widen. We believe our repositions to be in sheet portfolio weathered this latest credit market turmoil relatively well aided by its limit of exposure to the impacted Euro denominated governments.", "Our P&C combined ratio is 92.2% and was still at 99% excluding prior year development.", "In addition, we made another big step forward to complete our focus on our core team sheet strategy with our previously announced termination of the Syncora EID guarantees.", "In the quarter, we also completed our redomestication to Ireland and we are very pleased that both S&P and Russell decided to retain XL in their U.S. indexes.", "Also, our advances in risk management continued to bear fruit. One example of this is the fact that Fitch (ph) recently confirmed our insurance financial strength rating at a strong and upgraded our outlook to stable. Another example of our ERM progress in seasoning is the fact that our current loss estimates for the Chilean earthquake and windstorm Cynthia remained within our original arrangements as has been true for every cat events since your current management team was assembled.", "Likewise, we have seen no material change in the property losses, we announced for the Deepwater Horizon Tragedy. Now, I\u2019m on this Deepwater topic, perhaps I can save some time later. Similar to our peers in the marine and excess casualty markets with regards to the reliability as too complex and we think still too early to predict anything meaningfully.", "Before handing it off to Irene, I would like to take Tom Hutton for his service on XL\u2019s Board of Directors and particularly for his role as Chairman with our Special Committee on Enterprise Risk. Tom\u2019s time with us and his success during that time is well illustrated by our Board\u2019s recent determination that ERM at XL is now seasoned enough to allow our Special Committee on Enterprise Risk to be merge into a newly combined Risk and Finance Committee, and you can look forward to seeing transparency around XL\u2019s approach to risk management in our upcoming 10-Q.", "Now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Irene Esteves. This is her first call, of course, as our CFO. I can tell you that she has hit the ground running, already made substantial contributions and we are delighted she is here. Irene?", "Irene Esteves", "Thanks, Mike, and good evening. Turning to our summary financial results on slide four, operating income for the second quarter was $243 million or 0.71 for ordinary share. An annualized operating ROE of 10.5% compared to $291 million or 0.85 for ordinary share and 20.1% respectively in the prior year quarter.", "P&C gross written premiums were up less than 1%, reflecting continued underwriting discipline.", "P&C net premiums written were up 3.4% versus the second quarter of 2009, reflecting a continued reduction seeded premium as well select new business opportunities in the Reinsurance segment.", "P&C net premiums earned decreased by 5.1%, primarily due to the rolling effect of prior period\u2019s lower written premium.", " The P&C combined ratio for the second quarter of 92.2% were slightly better than prior year\u2019s 93%, and includes $83 million of positive prior period development, which is inline of the same quarter last year \u2013 $47 million of the releases in the current quarter or from short tale lines.", "A significant portion of the remainder of the favorable development relates to 2006 and prior years for professional lines, particularly from business written outside the U.S. This favorable development was partially offset by strengthening of casualty reserves related to U.S. primary and international excess casualty exposures.", "Our underlying combined ratio excluding prior year development and natural catastrophe\u2019s was 97.6% or 2.4 points better than the prior year quarter. This was driven primarily by lower current year losses in acquisition cost. Dave and Jamie will provide you with additional detail on this in a minute.", "Turning to slide five, investment income on the P&C portfolio decreased in the second quarter compared to the prior year quarter. This was due to lower portfolio yield, driven by low U.S. interest rates along with the cumulative impact of holding a portfolio of a P&C insurer. New purchases were mainly in high quality investment grade corporate credit as well as agency mortgage back securities.", "The average new investment rate was 2.1%, reflecting the lower absolute levels we are currently facing.", "Our P&C duration decreased to 2.7 years and the P&C portfolio book yield gross of fees at the end of the quarter was 3.5%.", "Please note that on page 31 of the financial supplement, we have expanded our disclosure on government and corporate holding by country of risk. I\u2019d also like to mention that we have elected, effective August 1, 2010, to designate another $2.1 billion from our live books investment portfolio is held to maturity. This is in addition to the 546 million that we designated in Q4 2009 and is intended to reduce the interest rate sensitivity on our GAP space book value.", "Slide six includes the con-covenants (ph) of our increase in market to market, which was driven by lower interest rates on government securities partially offset by widening credit spreads.", "Our $245 million of operating expenses for the second quarter of 2010 were $19 million or 7% lower year over year, reflecting the benefits from prior expense management initiatives.", "Turning to slide seven, the largest drivers are our 5% growth in book value per ordinary share in the second quarter or an increase in the value of our investment portfolio and our earnings for the quarter, offset in part by charge to currency translation account.", "The overall impact of foreign exchange movement during the quarter was a reduction in shareholder\u2019s equity of about $50 million reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollars much like NC (ph) or European currencies. While the capital of our European subsidiaries as reported in our 10-K, totals approximately $3 billion, part of that capitals already held in U.S. dollars.", "In addition, we have active hedging programs in place to reduce our exposure to non-dollar currencies, net of these activities where now long non-dollar currencies by about $400 million using June 30th exchange rates.", "We set out on slide eight, we ended the second quarter with $13 billion in total capital an increase of 3.7% in the quarter with common equity at $9.5 billion, up 5%, and or book value per share is now $27.74 up 12.8% for the year-to-date.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dave to discuss our insurance business.", "David Duclos", "Thank you, Irene. Insurance segment results for the second quarter were strong given current market conditions as we continue to enhance our risk management activities and operational effectiveness while lowering exposures to less attractive markets.", "Our combined ratio of 97.6% for the quarter was 2.1 points better than our Q2 2009 results of 99.7%. Adjusting for both cuts (ph) and prior year development, the Insurance segment\u2019s Q2 combined ratio of 99.6% was 4.1 points better than the same period last year.", "We are fully aware of the difficulty in sea environment, so as we face market conditions as competitive as pre-9/11 in many lines in geographies, we continue to fix, call, and grow our Insurance lines on a very selective basis.", "We wrote 38 million or 3.4% less in gross premiums in Q2 than in Q2 2009, primarily driven by programs that we acted last year. Walking away from new and renewal business due to market pricing is also impacting premiums adversely.", "Our premiums written for the second quarter were just over 95% on a segment basis, significantly better than the low 70s experienced in the depths of last year. We are now back on track with historical retention levels, a good spot to be as we see no imminent change in how this market is pricing business, which is quite competitive.", "Our Q2 2010 loss ratio 68.2% was basically flat compared to 67.9% last year. However, when adjusted for both cats and prior year development, our underlying loss ratio was slightly better year over year at 70.2% versus 71.9%. This improvement was driven primarily by a lack of property losses compared to prior year, exiting less attractive businesses and the related shift in business mix to a more profitable line.", "We are well aware that the majority of this benefit continues to be offset by deteriorating rate environment that is adversely impacting the loss ratio.", "Acquisition expenses were favorably impacted by true-ups and are guarantee fund assessments and other non-recurring adjustments. Excluding these adjustments, acquisition expenses as well as operating expenses were right in line with expectations and on par with 2009.", "Before I move on to market conditions, let me comment on our Professional lines business. Claims trends year-to-date continue to lower than historical averages and our core professional DNO book, and while we continue to maintain reserves from Professional lines, which we consider appropriate given the uncertainty, we note that various financial crisis related matters from 2007 and 2008 developed favorably for XL along with the rest of the DNO industry.", "Regarding the market, health economic conditions mean many of our clients are buying less insurance from an industry with more than enough capital to meet those needs. As a result, broad pricing pressure remains. This was reflected in our second quarter\u2019s overall pricing decline of minus 1.8% following the Q2 2009 rise of plus 2.1%.", "While macro conditions may not change soon, we can\u2019t say that pricing does react often very quickly but sometimes not in the sustained matter to large loss events especially in aviation rates, the last year\u2019s loss event is an example and of course, marine and offshore energy rates to this year\u2019s events in the Gulf of Mexico.", "We are also booking trends in global programs in terms of price particularly in casualty where our leadership role allows us to drive summary and we continue to see good margins in our Profession liability book.", "Operationally, we continue to rollout of our claims processing initiatives, service is a vital part of our business, of course, especially claims performance and we are proud of our strong track record. A record which most recently included the number one rating in service from the American Consul then generic companies for our Design Professional business.", "I mentioned selective growth earlier. We see that coming from several sources. Our expansion into Asian markets, our extensions in the U.S. and global general aviation, our pushes into lines that complement our existing strengths including U.K. Professional and targeted the up our middle markets in DNO. We\u2019re also proud that we attract recognize names in this areas of growth, recent examples includes Bob Shine, who is now leading our North America Casualty team and Garry Kaplan in heading up our North American construction practice. They join an already strong team and accomplished a great deal here at XL. We believe all of our actions and results are demonstrating discipline in our underwriting and responsiveness to our brokers and clients.", "And now to Jamie to discuss Reinsurance.", "James Veghte", "Thanks, David and good evening. XL RE enjoys yet another strong quarter of underwriting results and market conditions that continue to provide significant challenges.", "During the period, we achieved the combined ratio 78.96% resulting in an underwriting profit of $73.4 million. This compares to combined ratio of 78.2% in second quarter of 2009. The results included positive prior year reserves development of $48.9 million, which compares to releases of $55.2 million in 2009.", "Adjusting for both cat losses and prior year releases, the Reinsurance segment had a combined ratio of 92.7%, a 0.7% deterioration from last year. This delta is driven almost entirely by deterioration in the operating and expense ratio resulting from a reduced net earned premium year-over-year.", "In fact, our current loss, year loss ratio of 58.6% is actually showing a slight improvement over the 59% produced last year.", "Turning to top line, gross and net premiums written were $421 million and 357 million respectively, up 12% year-over-year on growth and 15% net. This was driven by new business opportunities in Bermuda, additional recaptured clients, some new business in Latin America and some timing issues in both Bermuda and Brazil.", "As we\u2019ve said before, the lumpy nature of Reinsurance portfolios sometimes creates movements of this nature in written premium and does not reflect broader issues around strategy or an improvement in market conditions. I can assure you the market is very tough and we remain very disciplined.", "Turning to the market, the July 1st, renewal environment was certainly more challenging than we expected going in. As you\u2019ve no doubt read and heard repeatedly over the last week, U.S. cat rates deteriorated on a risk adjusted basis by 10% and international rates were down 5% during the renewal.", "With respect to floor to business, we were pleased to be named the first Bermuda Company named an eligible reinsurer by the insurance department in the State. This reduces our post loss collateral obligations substantially and allows us to operate more freely in this very important market.", "In addition, significant amounts of property proportional business were moved. During last quarter\u2019s call, I outlined what we believed are the necessary changes to that market. Frankly, while improvements were cheap it was nowhere near what we quoted or expected and we produced our capacity commitments in that market accordingly. This was a significant disappointment.", "On the long tail side, we continue to see competitive conditions across the market with pockets of exceptions such as the U.K. motor market. The U.S. is very challenging across the market.", "Finally, turning to our Life operations, the contribution before net realized losses during the quarter were $23 million. This quarter there was no one off gains from treaty computation, whereas few ones contribution of $49 included a one-time gain of $13.8 million as a result of three treaties being commuted with one client.", "Overall, we are very pleases with our underwriting performance against a back draft of continued difficult market conditions and we will be vigilant as this phase of the market plays itself out.", "With that, I will turn it back to David for Q&A.", "David Radulski", "Shirley, can you please open the lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Yes, thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital. You may ask your question.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thanks and good afternoon. First one, I guess for Mike and Irene. Could you talk about plans to potentially deploy the excess capital that XL Group has especially maybe after hurricane season and what are your thoughts about retaining the additional liquidity you have on the books currently?", "Michael McGavick", "Hi, Jay. This is Mike. Thanks for the questions. With respect to the capital situation, the situation remains unchanged. We think about it the same way we have since this management team has assembled. The first thing we look at as you know is the sufficiency of our capital particularly as it relates to our own internal view of risk of the company, which is the most stringent of the test we would apply including rating agencies and regulators.", "And then we look at if there is excess and I know many of you judge there to be. We then look at first where could we put that money to work ourselves and then we look second if there\u2019s nowhere whether we would choose to return to shareholders in some fashion such as through a share buyback. This is a process we analyze continuously. We are well aware of the situation. We\u2019re very well aware of what we\u2019re trading and we keep a close eye on it, in regular communication with our board about it and if we make a new judgment on that we\u2019ll let you know.", "In the mean times, I would remind you as does our quarterly reports that we do continue to have $375 million in occurred authorization available for action should we choose to do so.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. And then just to follow-up on that, I believe in the prepared remarks you talked about changing the classification for around $2 billion of life fixed income assets to being held to maturity. Does that change the equation given that it probably reduces the impact of interest rates, if it were to rise?", "Irene Esteves", "What does Jay is it impacts our book sensitivity, so it doesn\u2019t really change our economic sensitivity, which is what our capital requirements are really looking at our inter-models are looking at the economics. So, it really does change our view on the amount of capital we need.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "That\u2019s helpful, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Heimermann with JP Morgan. You may ask your question.", "Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan", "Hi. Good morning, everybody or good afternoon. Sorry, it\u2019s been one of those days.", "Michael McGavick", "I got it.", "Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan", "For Jamie, can you comment with respect to the insurance side sauce (ph) and adverse development on U.S. casualty excess lines. Is there any read through for the reinsurance book and I guess I\u2019m really thinking more prior years given that the portfolio shift quite a bit.", "James Veghte", "No. As you know we had a fairly significant release this quarter. The casualty component of that was about $20 million and as we\u2019ve said repeatedly over the last several quarters, we\u2019re very cautious about prior year releases on long tail business in recent underwriting, so that\u2019s majority of those releases were 2006 to prior.", "Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay. I guess then maybe for David, is the development we\u2019re seeing on the insurance side maybe specific to a couple of clients rather than broad transcend?", "David Duclos", "Yes. Matt, it\u2019s actually specific to a very specific program actually that we have. It\u2019s year is 2006 and pass, so it\u2019s about \u2013 I\u2019d say it\u2019s 80% of the cash we released, the North America is tied to the specific that we have in the casualty North America book.", "Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay. And then I guess just with respect to, I guess two numbers questions. One was you mentioned a cat number, a cat in Verizon number in the press release for the total company, which is a little bit different than you classified cats in reinstatement in the supplement. And so I was just hoping you\u2019d give us the impact of Verizon by segment, both the loss and reinstatement. And then also just, if you could just touch on the strategies that contributed to the affiliate income this quarter.", "Michael McGavick", "Sorry, on the Deepwater question, the Deepwater isn\u2019t a natural cat. It\u2019s a large loss and treats it as such. And do we have it (inaudible) \u2013", "Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan", "Do you still break that impact up by segment?", "Michael McGavick", "Sure.", "David Duclos", "Yes, we do.", "Michael McGavick", "Let\u2019s walk through.", "David Duclos", "Yes. Matt, the insurance impact on Deepwater was just under $15 million for the PD loss and reinstatement.", "James Veghte", "$12 million for reinsurance.", "Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan", "And what was the reinstatement by segment because that seems to be pretty significant.", "Michael McGavick", "Yes. Reinstatement for insurance was just over $3 million, just under $3 million, Matt.", "Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay.", "James Veghte", "700,000 for reinsurance.", "Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay, much appreciated.", "David Duclos", "Hi, Matt. Did you get that on reinsurance?", "Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan", "Yes, I just got that. Thanks.", "Michael McGavick", "Okay, good.", "Sarah Street", "And then Matt, this is Sarah. On your follow-up question, the two main drivers, the hedge fund portfolio, the alternative portfolio was I mean it had a good relative performance, but it was weaker than we would normally expect it about a 1% return. The investment managers had a sort of we\u2019re pretty much in line with where we would\u2019ve expected them to be. The stronger performance from the private equity portfolio, where we like many of our peers have actually seen some markups and some distributions on those private equity funds that directly accounted.", "Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay, much appreciated. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. Two questions, first there, just to follow-up. Could you remind us and I should know this but the lag in reporting for the alternative investments, for the hedge funds?", "Irene Esteves", "It\u2019s a one month lag.", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "One month lag. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then I guess for Dave, I may have heard this wrong but I thought you said your retention, I assume this is your renewal retention in insurance was 95%? Did I get that wrong?", "David Duclos", "Yes, Jay you did. No, you didn\u2019t get it wrong, I said it wrong apparently. It is 85%, which is back to historical levels.", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, that makes more sense. That\u2019s all I need to know, thanks.", "David Duclos", "Yes.", "Michael McGavick", "Yes, we\u2019d all be panic if he was riding 95 right now.", "David Duclos", "Yes.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Mewerter with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question.", "Doug Mewerter \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Hi. Good afternoon. Just a couple small questions. First, do you renew a reinsurance program in your insurance business this quarter? I just noticed your retention, your net to gross retention drop, but it also seems like it was low second quarter last year, so I just wanted to confirm that. It wasn\u2019t just like a business mix or issue?", "Michael McGavick", "No, Doug. It isn\u2019t. In insurance, we did have treaty renew in the second quarter. We had our property treatment in 5/1.", "Doug Mewerter \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. And also was the terms about similar?", "Michael McGavick", "The structure was about similar and we benefited from what\u2019s happening in the marketplace.", "Doug Mewerter \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. And well have you Dave \u2013 I\u2019ve heard a lot of talk that DNO market is getting quite crowded and actually is suffered the curse of a hard market I guess. Can you confirm that? Is it getting to the point where it\u2019s getting pretty bad or is it still relatively stable because I guess it went \u2013 the rates went up quite a bit right after the (inaudible) enterprise opportunity backing way off again.", "David Duclos", "Well, Doug, you\u2019re certainly right about the question or observation that it\u2019s becomes a crowded swimming pool. Just today, a couple more markets introduced or announced their entr\u00e9e in the U.S. in particular professional liability. I think in the last three years, there\u2019s been over 20 new entrances. It is a competitive marketplace, I would say that we\u2019ve got very strong positions in a number of areas and in our core and we just don\u2019t write large standard public DNO, but in our core public DNO we\u2019ve carved out a niche frankly that we play a very significant role in for the marketplace.", "And I would tell you that pricing in the DNO business, as evidence by the second quarter pricing has been under some pressure. But, and I hope \u2013 hopefully this comment doesn\u2019t attract more attention to this line. We still feel really bullish about the profitability and in fact on new basis professional lines globally still present its more opportunities for helping returns in most other line, but you\u2019re right on your spot relative to your observation on competition.", "Doug Mewerter \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, thanks. And my last question, I noticed there were some sort of settlement for the World Trade Center bomb or attack and a lot of \u2013 a couple of your peers actually took some, I guess, meaningful reserve, payable reserve charges because of that. Did that show up at your balance sheet or were you not directly related to the \u2013 what came out of that settlement?", "James Veghte", "It\u2019s Jamie. Yes, we did participate in the settlement with the airlines. But the projected settlement we saw was already contemplated on our reserve, so we didn\u2019t see a significant release on aviation to quarter.", "Doug Mewerter \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, thanks. And that\u2019s all my questions.", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS. You may ask your question.", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "Yes. Good evening. A couple of questions. First one for Sarah, Sarah, can you tell us where were the realized losses coming from what classes and then where are we as far as the portfolio de-risking or are we pretty much all the way there or is there more to go?", "Sarah Street", "Yes. Hi, Brian. On the realized, most of it was pretty evenly split between structured credit. Well, I have to say we see encouraging signs there in the underlying performance of the collateral, but we did see some small deterioration. It was about $23 to 24 million from where that range. The last was \u2013 although it was about 10 million of sales that we made, we did actually reduced some of our exposure to some European banks earlier in the quarter as a result of the reviewing our exposure there.", "And then the last chunk was on the corporate securities, which was really a board of change of intent to hold or more likely to not because it\u2019s part of our de-leverage or de-risking activities. We\u2019re looking at \u2013 before we expect it would deem out of some of our MTNs over the next couple of quarters. So, that\u2019s really where we realized losses.", "On the \u2013 where on we\u2019re on the de-risking and I think as we\u2019ve said, we still have some assets that we will look to work out overtime in terms of the Legacy portfolio, particularly in the non-agency RMDS and the CDOs, which is actually south (ph) of non-agency RMDS this quarter. It was about $50 million, so we\u2019re actually pleased with the price that we achieved. But we are going to do it gradually when we see sort of prices that are economic and we\u2019re much more focus on sort of the optimization of the portfolio today than we are on sort of pure de-risking.", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "Great. And then next question, can you give us a sense of where your PLM stood at July 1 on (inaudible) to year? Hello?", "Michael McGavick", "As I mentioned, we have some tables coming that you\u2019re really going to enjoy in the Q, so Friday it gets \u2013 feeding all of that detail of beyond what we have presented in the past and we\u2019re still well under limits, but I think we\u2019ll leave it to read those tables to get to your, a deeper perspective on a jack to position.", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next comes from Vinay Misquith with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Hi. Good evening. On the yield on the fixed income portfolio, that\u2019s come down and new money yields are I think 2.1%, you mentioned, and also your duration has come down, I think from three years to 2.7 years. Are you changing your investment philosophy fee from the new money yield investing given the law new money yield?", "Sarah Street", "Hi. This is Sarah, again. No, I mean we\u2019re very much remaining consistent with the investment strategy that we\u2019ve outlined. We look at other options out there in terms of things that we could do to increase the yield that we\u2019re earning. We honestly don\u2019t believe that (inaudible) pay for it. So, no, we are not looking to stretch the yield and we\u2019re sticking with what we feel the portfolio should look like from the mix perspective going forward.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, that\u2019s good to hear. The second point is on the exposures of different national guarantee. I just want to be sure that you have no more exposures to any international guarantees now.", "Michael McGavick", "You would know for meeting the Q in the case carefully over the years that there are other financial guarantee exposures. This was the kind of the cleanup of the SCI settlement from a couple of years ago, where this basket the EIB lack of international guarantees had not been dealt with and we have come to agreement then that we would try to resolve them over time and date. I\u2019m going to let Sarah walk you through where that all that stands because it\u2019s really a great credit to her team, David and Todd (ph) and the rest of them, really get a hard work to get the progress we\u2019ve got and we even got a little more progress in the wings. So, Sarah?", "Sarah Street", "Yes. No, as Mike said, in population months we\u2019ve made a lot of progress elimination in sort of what we view was the negative financial guarantee and financial guarantee like exposure that came out of our old financial lines business. And as a result of that focus, including the recent termination of the EIB contract, in amount to we\u2019ve down to just under 900 million, at 874.", "Now, within that amount, the losses to transaction is actually just under $400 million, which is a financial guarantee related to a Chilean toll road (ph). Now, the good news here is that the issuer has already decided to repay the debt and then honor this agreement releasing XL from its financial guarantee who had been fined and its being now held in escrow subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions. We expect those pleasant conditions to be satisfied and if they are within the next couple of weeks that exposure to will go away, and at that point it leaves around about 500 million and we\u2019ll sort of be continuing to work our way diligently through getting rid of the recipes exposure in an economically sensible way.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Sure. And where is the 500 million exposed?", "Sarah Street", "Well, it\u2019s across a whole number of different deals. I mean just there\u2019s this one large transaction, which has a credit derivative, which was a deal that was done a long, long time ago about $190 million. The underlying class well is, predominantly class securitize pools of (inaudible) and bonds. The transaction is parting all of its tax with the exception of one and tax means that cash flow is actually being redirected to XL\u2019s box, where we would expect and we\u2019ve cleft the deal and up to sort of including 2008 stress event and we\u2019re very comfortable with the class rule. And the rest of our disasters (ph), there\u2019s a series of deals where no one is greater than $71 million and the average is 42 and they\u2019re all performing appropriately.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Credit Suisse", "That\u2019s good, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.", "Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Yes. Good afternoon. My question relates the business that you lost and then came back to you. Could you describe the competitors who took that business and the negotiations that wound you bring it back and why do you think they didn\u2019t try harder to retain that business, they got from you?", "Michael McGavick", "Let me give you kind of a general comment on and then I\u2019ve ask Dave and Jamie to jump in. First in some cases, it was just a pure panic reaction to XL\u2019s situation as 2008 closed down. We would even get messages that risk managers had been overruled in their desire to stay with XL, by others within the company, but they really wanted to stay. A lot of mixed messages at that time and never or at least rarely was it somehow a rejection of XL, but rather a reaction to current panicky conditions.", "As those conditions subsided, we often saw business come back very quickly because of that underlying depth of relationship. So, it wasn\u2019t so much that someone else took it from us, but rather they just felt they couldn\u2019t stay with us until things improved, and when it improved, they directed brokers or reach out to us and just got right back into the relationship. So, it\u2019s really to us a testimony to the strength of our core book and the relationships we built over many years through the kind of quality service and particularly claims service we provide.", "So, I would tell you it\u2019s more about that dynamic than it are about the current crazy pricing dynamic or anything else. It\u2019s about \u2013 I\u2019ll ask my colleagues to give you any further depth they\u2019d like to give.", "David Duclos", "Mike, just real quick in the insurance standpoint, the primary jobs for business is coming is related to service. Service one, in terms who ever took the business last year not performing at the level XL provided and then also addressing the primary concern that Mike just talked about, which was the capital concern, which went away.", "And I would say that the majority of business that we lost was in insurance was in the first half of 2009 and just to give you some perspective, the amount that we\u2019ve recaptured, if you want to use that word is about 25 to 30%, so it\u2019s not a 100% and I can\u2019t tell you it\u2019s not because of pricing. It is driven because of the fact that the capital concerns are gone and our service performance.", "James Veghte", "Yes, Jamie. The big positive variance in gross written premiums in our quarter was driven out of Bermuda $26 million, about half of that was a couple of new deals we found, which were very attractive and the other half were increased lines in business that we like and customers that may have had some hesitation about the security coming back. So, this has been repetitive quarter after quarter since our real recovery began about four quarters ago.", "And I would reiterate what Mike and Dave said, it\u2019s about our service, our reputation, the relationships we\u2019ve had over the years.", "Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Well, to what extent has business potentially want to come back but you just can\u2019t right under the kind of market conditions?", "Michael McGavick", "And that certainly happens, that\u2019s one of the reasons it\u2019s in \u2013 by this Dave said 25 to 30%. It would be a lot more, if we were willing to chase price but we pride ourselves on being technical underwriters will remain disciplined. I have to tell you it\u2019s very hard out there with these kinds of conditions. I really admire the hard work our people are doing to keep their wits about them and what is a very difficult pricing environment. I think Dave\u2019s got it right, I know there\u2019s some submission data that would help to make the point.", "David Duclos", "Yes, just to reinforce was Mike just said actually from a submission standpoint, year to year, we\u2019re actually up 8% and that\u2019s largely because we\u2019ve introduce some new lines but our underwriters clearly are working a lot harder to write let\u2019s new business. And our new business through six months is trending down and if you think about how 2009 evolved, the first quarter in particular, about the first half of the year, we were under some pressure and didn\u2019t raise much new business.", "The first quarter this year, that capital concern was off and so I can tell you that the trajectory, if you will, in terms of comparing 2009 to 2010 is heading different direction \u2013 i.e. new business writings continue to dwindle, but it\u2019s not because we\u2019re not seeing the business we should see and it\u2019s not because we\u2019re not pursuing it. It is because of what you said, it\u2019s not written or something written at the price rate.", "Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Well, I appreciate the answers. Have a good evening.", "Michael McGavick", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our final question comes from Ian Gutterman with Adage Capital. You may ask your question.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital", "Hi, guys. I guess maybe to start. Can you give an update on Chile? You said it hasn\u2019t gotten out your range, but it does look right there was some development from one of the footnotes in the supplement.", "Michael McGavick", "Yes, there was a small amount of movement. There\u2019s about 6.8 million in increase in our estimate, about 2.2 million of that is insurance in the marine cargo line and about 4.6 million is in the reinsurance side in \u2013 the property treaty really has got to do with one (inaudible). But as you can tell, given our range, which was 140 to 205 million, it\u2019s a very modest movement indeed.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital", "Okay, fair enough. Moving on, to follow-up on the average development and casualty, can you just give a little more color? Was it \u2013 is it a Fortune 1000 business, a smaller account, is it industry specific like farmer or environmental or something like that, any color you can give on that?", "Michael McGavick", "Ian, it was a very niche based program, without to saying what it does. It was relatively small programs in terms of premiums, just under $20 million and I can tell you that the remedy for us is that will pass on the program going forward because the latest development on a liability basis. The good news is it\u2019s not core to our \u2013 it\u2019s not key to our core lines of business.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital", "Okay, fair enough. And then moving on to in reinsurance, if I\u2019m looking at the loss ratio, X development, X cash and if I also put in the Deepwater loss, it looks like you\u2019re down about four to five points year-over-year. Where there other large losses last year to capture that that maybe are missing in that or I know it\u2019s a little bit of mixed shift, but four to five points seems like a lot.", "James Veghte", "It\u2019s Jamie. Some of that is purely mixed of business changing. We\u2019re carrying our cat, current year catalog ratio at about 16% this year and the percentage of net earnings premium in the overall portfolio has increased from about 18.5% now to over 23% cat. That\u2019s not because we\u2019re going wild on cat, it\u2019s because we continue to reduce in some of the more competitive areas.", "And just to show the trend line, back in the full year 2007, the cat component in the overall portfolio was about 11% of net earned premium. It\u2019s now more than double.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital", "Okay. I mean that gives me partially there I guess 18 to 23% even if I\u2019m picking up 30% of loss ratio that only gives me a 1.5 half for the way there. And underlying fixed price should be on by about 1.5, right, just because of price deterioration, so I\u2019m just wondering why we\u2019re not seeing something more like that in one or two as oppose to about 4.5?", "Michael McGavick", "Well, I think there were some fire losses in Brazil in 2009 that bumped the property non-cat loss ratio a couple of points.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital", "Okay. As far as I mean what about just sort of non-cat attritional losses, have they been much lower year-over-year?", "Michael McGavick", "Yes, they have.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital", "Okay, and was that true for last quarter as well?", "Michael McGavick", "Yes, one.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital", "Okay. And then just if I can move to Sarah real quick, on the Life insurance portfolio, the investment income seems to be coming down I guess faster than I thought and faster than a team\u2019s the assets are coming down. Is there anything going on there that\u2019s changed?", "Sarah Street", "That\u2019s just the impact of FX given the fact that there\u2019s also Sterling and Euro portfolio.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital", "Okay, that\u2019s makes sense. Okay. And then lastly, any thoughts on your MBS portfolio, your U.S. MBS portfolio is pretty large. Sometimes (inaudible) stuff here, just give me where interest rates are and what spreads on that class. Any thoughts that maybe it\u2019s time to tick your games on that and try to find someplace else to put your money.", "Sarah Street", "I\u2019m smiling here because that\u2019s a debate that we have at the \u2013 I see on a regular basis, and we did actually decide most recently that we\u2019re seeing quite a lot of prepayments out of that portfolio, so we\u2019ve actually naturally paying off pretty quickly given the buy outs and whatever the Asian (inaudible) are doing there. So, we have decided for the moment to that we\u2019re not going to redeploy money back into it and we continue to look at it. As you said, performed extremely well, but the spreads are relatively tight.", "And the big challenge is that we worry about used supply in the future, so we\u2019re trying to find the right balance there between what that allocation should over the long-term and where we are today. And it has some (inaudible) fields on it today, so when you look at the truth defense reinvestment rate its much (ph) bear back into consideration glove.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital", "Good point. Okay, thank you. That\u2019s all I have.", "Operator", "Thank you. We do have a question from Keith Walsh with Citi. You may ask your question.", "Keith Walsh \u2013 Citigroup Inc", "Hey, good evening, everybody. Two quick questions my first \u2013 just if you could touch on contingent commissions your, two of your larger distribution partners or in the market thing, they\u2019re going to take them now, if you can just tell us where we stand with your discussions with them and I\u2019ve got a follow-up.", "Michael McGavick", "We\u2019re not saying the continued commissions in this market. Obviously, we have some program business with contracts in it, but as far as this pronouncements that I\u2019ve seen, they don\u2019t \u2013 they aren\u2019t going out at XL right now.", "Keith Walsh \u2013 Citigroup Inc", "Okay. And then the second, I think it\u2019s pretty clear from your commentary your relationships with your distribution partners have stood up well over the past couple of years here. But I guess the question would be, if you could talk a little bit about your opportunity to write bigger pieces of each customers program and how that\u2019s evolved as the financial stress against your company has abated in the last year and a half.", "Michael McGavick", "So, that has been part of the pickup that you\u2019re seeing that\u2019s offsetting rate deterioration on the top line and that is where a common response to the crisis would be for someone to \u2013 maybe this is getting to be old days now, a couple years ago, but someone would take a stand, they want to keep us involved with the program, but they\u2019d take us down in terms of the line size. But that process has been in reverse now and we\u2019re able to be offered larger lines again and that again is a part of what you\u2019re seeing, offsetting rate deterioration in our top line.", "We\u2019re very pleased by that, but it speaks well to the franchise, which has held up just remarkably well and now, while we\u2019re able to continue to produce what we think are solid results in what is a very difficult market environment.", "Keith Walsh \u2013 Citigroup Inc", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. I\u2019ll turn the call over to the speakers.", "Michael McGavick", "This is Mike. I just want to thank everybody for their time on the call. It is delightful hear to XL to have a boring call that is just about pretty much regular insurance stuff and reinsurance stuff, I think that\u2019s a credit to the progress we\u2019ve made as a firm and to the now, five quarters of documented no surprises around here. We\u2019re going to keep trying to deliver on that promise and we think with the RM we\u2019ve developed and with our underwriters keeping their wits about it, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re going to do.", "So, thanks for the time tonight. We look forward to continue to fighting our way through this market, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you and that does conclude today\u2019s conference.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "David Radulski", "Thank you, Shirley. Good evening. And welcome to XL Group\u2019s third quarter 2010 conference call. This call is being simultaneously webcast on XL\u2019s website at www.xlgroup.com. We posted to our website several documents including our quarterly financial supplement and our fixed income portfolio data.", "On our call today, Mike McGavick, XL Group CEO will offer opening remarks; Irene Esteves, our CFO will review financial results followed by Dave Duclos, our Chief Executive of Insurance Operations; and Jamie Veghte, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations, who will review the segment results and market conditions, and then we\u2019ll open it up for questions. Sarah Street, our Chief Investment Officer is with us today and available for Q&A.", "Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that certain of the matters we\u2019ll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements and therefore you should not place undue reliance on them.", "Forward looking statements are sensitive to many factors including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and other documents on file with the SEC, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statements in response to new information, future development or otherwise.", "And with that, I turn it over to Mike McGavick.", "Mike McGavick", "Good evening. Our third quarter results reflect continued solid performance offset by an unusual number of unrelated larger losses. But to give weight to my view on our strong underlying results, I would point to the fact that our overall P&C loss ratio of 64% barely moved year-over-year, despite these difficult and soft market conditions and our reinsurance segment had another terrific quarter with a loss ratio of 43% and a combined ratio of 75%.", "At the same time, this is a quarter in which our earnings were affected by an unusual number of smaller catastrophes and large losses, such as the New Zealand earthquake, floods in Germany and higher frequency of other news worthy loss events.", "As I have mentioned in my previous calls, by the nature of XL\u2019s global footprint and the large limits and complex risk XL takes on, this kind of lumpiness will happen from time-to-time. Importantly, after review, these losses were consistent with our risk management and underwriting standards.", "Prior year reserve development was again a strong contributor in the quarter and while these benefits of past reserving actions are realized, we continue to exercise the disciplined approach to establishing current reserve levels.", "In reinsurance, we had an $86.8 million in a positive prior year development and in insurance we had a $4.5 million reserve strengthening. But let me point out, that in the third quarter is not one in which we do a deep review of some of the lines in insurance that have been among our best performing recently.", "The fourth quarter will affect a more comprehensive review of all of our product lines so stay tuned. As we again -- and we again delivered strong book value per share growth for the sixth straight quarter this time by 6.6% on a fully diluted basis. Our growth in book value was driven primarily by the positive impact on investment portfolio mark-to-market of lower U.S. and U.K. interest rates.", "You may recall at the beginning of the year we forecast a low double-digit ROE for the year, since then, between the caps that hit earlier in the year combined with the exceptional strengthening of our balance sheet in the year-to-date have held our operating ROE in the single digits.", "Likewise at the beginning of the year, we forecast we might be able to incur some growth in our P&C gross written premiums, but as the markets have developed of course, the competition has intensified and our view, for example, I would point out that aviation might have had the shortest hard market in history, and so, our view now as we look forward to the end of the year is -- it might be flat or slightly down in terms of total gross written premium. This current market pricing makes it unlikely that we would meet that top goal that we have laid out. Our underwriters are simply putting down them.", "Since there are currently fewer acceptable places to put your money work however, we have begin -- back to shareholders. We started buying back shares in August, since then have bought back $375 million worth of shares and reduced our Q2 2010 share count by 5.5%. And with that authorization or exhausted our Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion share buyback program.", "As I have said consistently our first priority is to put any excess capital to invest in our core business. But if there are no viable options to do that we will return our capital to shareholders. You can be assure that this deal is still the case.", "Now, let me turn it over to Irene to discuss our financial results.", "Irene Esteves", "Thanks, Mike, and good evening. Turning to our summary financial results on slide four, P&C gross premiums written for the third quarter 2010 were down 3.7% year-over-year. As Mike mentioned, this reflects our disciplined underwriting in the current soft pricing environment, including a limited appetite for viewing long-term business.", "For example, accelerated premiums from insurance long-term agreements were down $24 million versus the same quarter last year. P&C net premiums written were down 2.4% versus the third quarter of 2009 with an increase of 3.3% in reinsurance offset by a decrease of 5.1% in the insurance segment.", "P&C net premiums earned fell by 1.9%, primarily due to the rolling effects of prior periods lower premiums written. Prior year development in the quarter was a favorable $82.3 million or 6.5 loss ratio points. This reflects favorable development in the reinsurance segment, partially offset by small amount of strengthening in the insurance segment.", "To put this in perspective, it is important to keep in mind how our reserving process works. Q3 is what we refer to as an actual versus expected or A versus E quarter for our insurance segment and the U.S. reinsurance business. Since we do our detailed roundup reserve reviews in the second and fourth quarters with the interim quarters based on actual versus expected, you would generally not expect to see much movement in prior year reserves in the first and third quarters for these portions of our business which account for 80% of our reserves.", "In the A versus E reviews, we respond to movements in the shorter tail lines or to specific claim movements in older mature years and that\u2019s what you see this quarter. With the $4 million strengthening in insurance relating primarily to specific property claims activity. The remaining 20% of our reserves are dominated by non-U.S. casualty and shorter tail reinsurance business for which reserves are reviewed quarterly with more comprehensive assumption updates performed annually.", "This business is the source of a favorable development this quarter in reinsurance. These releases were somewhat higher than previous quarters due to favorable development in two specific areas. The processing of reinsurance to close of several whole account contracts from the 2000 year of account contributed $30 million in reserve releases and favorable developments on specific professional liability claims in the 2001 and 2002 report years contributed $25 million. The remaining favorable development for reinsurance was spread across all classes and all non-U.S. geographies.", "Our $236 million of operating expenses for the third quarter of 2010 were basically flat year-over-year but expenses for the first three quarters of 2010 were down 7.4% versus the first three quarters of 2009, reflecting the run rate benefits from our prior expense management initiative. Operating income for the third quarter was $175 million or $0.52 per ordinary share with an annualized operating ROE of 7.2%.", "Now turning to slide five, our investment income on the P&C portfolio of $218 million, decreased by 8% in the third quarter, compared to the prior year quarter. This was primarily due to the lower portfolio yields driven by lower U.S. interest rates. New purchases were mainly in high quality investment grade corporate credit. The average new investment rate was 2.3%, reflecting the lower absolute rate levels we are currently facing.", "Our P&C duration was stable from the prior quarter at 2.7 years and during the quarter the P&C portfolio book yield net of fees was 3.14%. As of quarter end, the gross book yield on the P&C portfolio was 3.5%.", "As of September 30th, the total of $2.8 billion from our Life books investment portfolio was designated as held to maturity and reduced the interest rate sensitivity of our GAAP based book value by approximately $300 million for every 100 basis point parallel interest rate change in the euro and sterling markets.", "There was a favorable $436 million mark-to-market in the third quarter, driven by lower interest rates on U.S. and U.K. securities and modest spread tightening. This has brought our entire available for sale portfolio into a net unrealized gain position of $157 million and our total portfolio to a net gain position of $236 million after tax. Net income from investment fund affiliates was down substantially from last year due to challenging market conditions for alternative managers, compared to an exceptional result last year this quarter.", "Now turning to slide six, the largest contributor to our third quarter growth in book value per share was $1.39 per share change in unrealized gains on investments. Our share buyback activity in Q3 added another $0.41 per share.", "Since the beginning of the third quarter to date, we have purchased 18.8 million shares at an average cost of $19.95 for a total of $375 million. During Q3, we repurchased 13.9 million shares at an average cost of $19.33. We purchased another 4.9 million shares after the quarter close. At the end of the second quarter we started -- we have 342 million ordinary shares outstanding. At the end of the third quarter we had 328 million and as of today there\u2019s approximately 323 million shares.", "As Mike mentioned, we also announced in our release this afternoon that our Board has authorized another $1 billion worth of share buybacks. Our timing if and when we buyback shares will be driven by market conditions.", "Please note that we also recognized $0.45 per share dilutive effect during the quarter. This was caused principally by our 2011 equity security units or ESUs moving into the money, as our share price rose above the price threshold of $18.88 for those units. I would remind you that XL will issue a maximum of just over 30.4 million shares in August 2011 in connection with these units.", "With all of these changes, we ended up the third quarter with $29.56 book value per share, up $0.07 -- 7% from Q2 and up 20% from the beginning of the year.", "With that, let me turn it over to Dave Duclos to review our insurance business.", "Dave Duclos", "Thanks, Irene. XL ensures again specialized in complex risks. From time-to-time we have quarters where our results are impacted by large non-cat losses. We last had this occur six quarters ago and it happened again in Q3 2010 as we had large property losses, excess casualty and aviation losses. This is to be expected given the nature of our business.", "The combined ratio for the quarter of 104% was 5.4 points higher than our Q3 2009 results of 98.6%. Adjusting for both cats and prior year development the segments Q3 combined ratio of 100.6% was 2.7 points higher than the prior result of 27.9%. The cat impact in this years third quarter result was 2.8 points as compared to a prior year cat impact of 1.7 points, driven by the New Zealand earthquake and the German floods. Our net cat loss in the quarter was $25 million.", "On the loss side, the large non-cat loss I previously mentioned impacted our results by $36 million. While these losses negatively impacted the quarter, our year-to-date accident year loss ratio ex-cats the 68.1% was actually slightly better than the prior year ratio of 69.5%.", "This loss ratio improvement was due to a mix of business changes offsetting rate reduction, as well as the favorable impact from a financial line contract, which benefited the current year loss ratio by 1.8 points and year-to-date by 0.6 points.", "Gross premiums written in Q3 decreased 3% or $30 million. Excluding the impacts of foreign exchange premiums decreased 1.6%. Considering the challenging trading environment we find ourselves in we consider this an appropriate result given our focus on maintaining our underwriting discipline.", "Net premiums earn were down 3.7% or $33 million, largely reflecting the earn-through of lower gross premiums written. As we have commented on in the past, we continue to remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves related to the financial crisis exposure.", "Although, D&O claim trends and favorable developments of various financial crisis related matters from the 2007 and 2008 period might suggest to some a bit of conservatism on our part. The most recent financial institution developments serve as an example as to why a careful and cautious view is appropriate. Here, again, we are carefully monitoring and analyzing the financial institution situation to gauge the impact, if any, on our D&O and E&O books of business.", "I expect my comments regarding market conditions won\u2019t be surprise any of you. It\u2019s a theme that you are hearing pretty consistently. Competition for business has gotten more intense in many areas and it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s an abundance of capital at work fighting for a shrinking insurance dollar.", "The market is not headed in the right direction in the recent quarters pricing results with some lines in geographies at pre 9/11 pricing levels. Well, our retention and submission flow are at or better than expected in most of our businesses, soft pricing means we have decided to write less new business than we did last year.", "That said, we continue to pursue selective growth initiatives including expansion into the Asian markets, build out of our European professional book, our U.S. and global general aviation initiative, as well as several other opportunities that are various stages of analysis and implementation like the new North America construction practice.", "We are staying disciplined and focusing on where we can improve profit while positioning our business for growth, especially as it relates to distribution and network development, operational efficiency, emerging markets and expanding our product suite.", "And now to Jamie to discuss reinsurance.", "Jamie Veghte", "Thanks, Dave, and good morning. XL re-enjoyed another very strong quarter of underwriting results in challenging market conditions. During the period, we achieved a combined ratio of 75% resulting in an underwriting profit of $99.1 million. This compares to a combined ratio of 80.5% in the third quarter of 2009. Our results this quarter included positive prior year reserve development of $86.8 million, which compares to releases of $65.9 million in the third quarter of last year.", "Adjusting for both cat losses and prior year releases, this segment had a combined ratio of 86.5%, which compares favorably to the 93.4% achieved in the third quarter of last year. The largest components of this improvement were reduced attritional property losses in our U.S. business unit representing 2.8 loss ratio points and a reduction in losses from our old structured product unit, representing 2.2 points and some business mix changes.", "Turning to topline, gross net premiums written were $534 million and $389 million, respectively, a reduction of 5% on the gross and an increase of on the net of 3.3%. The reduction in the gross book came principally from the Bermuda and U.S. operations, and resulted from reductions on new and renewal business, some timing differences in Bermuda, and reduction in our U.S. crop portfolio. On the net side, the increase resulted from reduced sessions on this crop portfolio.", "Finally, with respect to our Life operation the contribution during the quarter was $20.7 million, essentially flat from the third quarter of last year.", "Turning to the market, we commented on the July 1 renewals on our last earnings call. In a nutshell cat market pricing was off 10% on a risk adjusted basis in the U.S. and 5% internationally. Long tail lines remain a significant challenge other than in very specific pockets of opportunity. Otherwise, the quarter was as usual, a quiet one for reinsurance business activity.", "We have spent a significant amount of time with customers and brokers at various conferences such as Monte Carlo, PCI and CIAB. These discussions have been very encouraging relative to our franchise and in many long-term business relationships we have established over the years.", "Nevertheless, there is clearly an expectation that competitive trading conditions will continue for some time in most sectors of the market. We are confident that the quality of our portfolio and our analytical capabilities will serve us well in these conditions. We believe this is an underwriters\u2019 market and we will continue to exert discipline in our activities as we prepare for our year-end renewals.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to David for Q & A.", "David Radulski", "Shirley, can you please open the lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Yeah. Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital. You may ask your question.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "Thanks and good evening. Mike, on the share buyback, what\u2019s your sense on timing given over the past four months you\u2019ve been running at about $100 million a quarter?", "Mike McGavick", "", "Yeah. This is something we\u2019ll do on a market basis as we see fit, we really don\u2019t have any guidance to provide you on it other than that we have the authorization and have -- you can just observe the facts to date.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "Should we keep in mind the roughly $575 million of equity units that are converting in the summer as something you may want to offset as over the course of the buyback?", "Irene Esteves", "", "Well as -- this is Irene, Jay. As you saw from our -- the one chart on the impact from last quarter to this quarter, the ESUs being in the money have had a dilutive effect already, as we look at those, about $0.45 change from the prior quarter to this quarter. So we have in essence offset quite a bit of that already. So it will depend on our timing, but, yeah, it could be that, if our share price continues to go up, that will become more dilutive.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "I see. All right. And then can you just give us a sense on the net income from investment and operating affiliates. That number bounces around quite a bit, what should we be thinking about for modeling purposes going forward? I\u2019m referring to page 36 on the supplement.", "Sarah Street", "", "Yeah. Hi. Jay, this is Sarah Street. It does move around. We know it moves around. The principal driver of the change this quarter is the alternative funds, which effectively is the hedge fund portfolio. We still feel that the long-term average returns that we can generate out of that portfolio, is still 8%. So from a \u2013 for the long-term model perspective that\u2019s the number that you can use, but as we\u2019ve seen in the past, we will see in the future, it won\u2019t be earned evenly throughout the year.", "Irene Esteves", "", "And I think if you look at year-to-date we\u2019re down only like $6 million, so you really have to look at the lumpiness in those numbers.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "Right. And the asset base for that 8%, potentially?", "Sarah Street", "", "There\u2019s a schedule in the supplement that gives you the equity accounted piece running at about just under $600 million at this point. So, I think that that\u2019s, we are definitely looking to put more money to work in the asset class, because we\u2019re underweighted but it will be spread between equity accounted and non-equity accounted.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "Thank you.", "Sarah Street", "", "Pleasure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.", "Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "Yeah. Good evening. I wanted to just go over quickly the reserve development issues you spoke on the phone, the way it was written in the press release, I can\u2019t tell was the additional or 1.3% effect on the combined ratio reserve releases was that included or excluded from the $80 some million you experienced during the quarter?", "Irene Esteves", "", "For the current year.", "Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "So that was from the first half of the year?", "Irene Esteves", "", "The quarter\u2019s current year loss ratio \u2013 yeah, in fact prior year development.", "Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "Also prior quarter was in this -- it was like in the first half of the year.", "Mike McGavick", "Josh, I\u2019m going to ask you do me a favor, would you start with your original question, I think we just got confused about what you are asking.", "Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "Yeah. If you look in the press release you had $82 million of favorable development. It also mentions that the current quarter benefited from a financial lines contract, which helped the loss ratio by 1.3 percentage points. I want to know if that\u2019s included or excluded from the $82 million?", "Mike McGavick", "That is not in the prior year development.", "Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "And that\u2019s because it came from a prior quarter but not a prior year?", "Mike McGavick", "It came in the current quarter.", "Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "Can you explain a little bit more about that contract?", "Mike McGavick", "Why don\u2019t I, we happen to have our Chief Actuary sitting right here and she can do it better than anybody, so I give you Susan Cross.", "Susan Cross", "", "Yeah. Josh, that contract was a multiyear contract that we had established a premium deficiency reserve. And essentially when the underlying exposures fell below the attachment point of our contract, basically there\u2019s no more exposure to our contract and we were able to release that premium deficiency reserve. So as we did that -- that went through the net incurred loss line and it\u2019s considered current year loss activity. So there was a benefit due to that release of the premium deficiency reserve and that\u2019s considered current year.", "There was also some unearned premium associated with that contract and that premium was earned in the quarter. And that net impact of both of those actions, the loss reserve and the premium had a beneficial impact on the current year loss ratio.", "Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "Okay. So, but it feels like a very one-time in nature type of situation?", "Susan Cross", "", "Yeah. It is.", "Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "Okay. Very good. And the other question I had for you, I saw the dilutive effect, of course, showing up from the security units that will mature next year. And in terms of that situation, I\u2019ve been modeling out in my numbers, but to what extent -- is there idea of the difference between that number and the fully dilutive number?", "Susan Cross", "", "I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t understand your question.", "Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "The fully -- if you assume that the -- that all the equity securities were to convert the impact, how much of a reduction would that be to the book value per share overall?", "Susan Cross", "", "That\u2019s what you see in that one chart, it\u2019s the $0.45.", "Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "That\u2019s complete. Very good. Thank you.", "Susan Cross", "", "Yeah. Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Walsh with Citi. You may ask your question.", "Keith Walsh \u2013 Citi", "", "Hey. Good evening, everybody. I guess, first off Mike, you touched on in your commentary the competitive environment out there which is consistent what we\u2019re hearing from everybody. But you can just talk little bit about the term and condition deterioration you\u2019re probably seeing out there that would be helpful? Thanks.", "Mike McGavick", "", "As you know, Keith, when you get to this phase of the market the competition lights up across the Board. You\u2019re going to see it in price, you\u2019ll see it in terms and conditions, you\u2019ll see a lot of pressure from multiyear contracts. So you\u2019ll see it in every aspect.", "Our job as underwriters is to try and come up with solutions that work for our clients but still work for us and the net effect of that entire set of influences has us seeing our topline become more challenging to come by, which we\u2019re fine with, because we won\u2019t let our underwriters give it away.", "So, but you\u2019ll see negotiations across every dimension of that. And again, our job is to try and find a combination of solutions that works. Yeah, we started walking away from multiyear contracts. I can remember talking about this back a year ago. So we try to defend our position and get the answers that work for both clients and ourselves.", "Keith Walsh \u2013 Citi", "", "So within the D&O book you guys are not offering multiyear contracts at this point?", "Dave Duclos", "", "Keith, this is Dave Duclos and no, we\u2019re not. And I would also say that to amplify Mike\u2019s comments, the market use of that has actually picked up in the last couple of quarters, for whatever reason I don\u2019t understand given where pricing\u2019s at. But the two things that we\u2019re seeing most in a couple of our lines business, is the reemergence of long-term agreements and also on a property basis, folks just throwing in top side limits. And as Mike said, we are not playing that game and it\u2019s having an effect a bit on both retention as well as business activity.", "Keith Walsh \u2013 Citi", "", "Great. And then the second question just regarding the ROE overall of the franchise, I think it\u2019s pretty obvious from the share repurchase that you can do, that you can decrease the denominator to get that move, but is there any opportunity, for margins within the business, specific to excel, we know pricing is difficult but anything specific to you guys that we should be thing about?", "Mike McGavick", "Well, the thing that we would emphasize is that we did take a number of that underwriting actions over the last year and year and half and that is slowly remixing our book of business that\u2019s one of the reason that we are able to keep the loss ration over the period fairly flat despite the deterioration in pricing out there. So you are going to see that effect continue because those performing books continue to role off and have less influence.", "At the same time we do have some lines of business well we are thrilled by the results and we are still find them adequate in and so in those lines we continue to be able to write some new business to offset the impact of the loss business from the discipline underwriting. So we have some pockets where we are okay with that and we can keep writing the business. We are continue to have an impact from the re-underwriting actions and those will continue to roll up and net of that is that so far tightened hard we can able to keep our loss ration fairly flat.", "Keith Walsh \u2013 Citi", "", "Thank you very much.", "Mike McGavick", "In fact, we would tell you that in this market that\u2019s pretty result we think.", "Keith Walsh \u2013 Citi", "", "Thanks a lot guys.", "Mike McGavick", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yeah. Thank you. Some of my questions were answered, but there was one question I had. In the reinsurance business the results from structured products was a negative $9.8 million. It\u2019s been pretty consistently positive going back, looks like about 10 to 12 quarters. What gave rise to that loss restructured products?", "Susan Cross", "", "This is Susan Cross. I\u2019ll take that one. What occurred this quarter, we did an update of our periodic actuarial review on a particular contract that was deposit accounted and that resulted in a revision to the cash flow projections on that contract and as a result an increase in the accretion rate on the contract in the associated interest expense. The impact of that was about $13.5 million in the quarter.", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. So -- more of a one time issue that should not be an ongoing drag on earnings.", "Susan Cross", "That\u2019s right.", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thanks for your help.", "Susan Cross", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from the -- I am sorry Vinay -- Vinay Misquith with Credit Suisse. Please state your question.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "Hi, good evening. What debt to -- debt plus report stock to capital ratio would you be comfortable with longer term, right now it\u2019s around 26%?", "Mike McGavick", "", "Right. And we\u2019ve said in the past that in things like our use of debt or our investment yield, these things that are not central to the underwriting process we like to be generally be in the middle of the pack and you would observe correctly that currently we would be a bit higher than the group so that\u2019s something that we continue to have as a matter of attention but we have nothing specific to announce at this time but that continues to be a long-range goal of the firm. All of that being because we want all of the focus to be on the competitive advantage we create through underwriting.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "Fair enough. The second question on the ESUs, the $575 million of debt, are the rating agencies right now already granting the company equity credit for that? And once these are up for conversion do you plan to remarket the debt and use the debt again to buy back more stock in addition to the $1 billion that you have right now?", "Irene Esteves", "", "We currently are planning to remarket the debt but we have a number of options as far as our leverage and debt coming due over the next 15 months and we\u2019ll review the market at that time and make those decisions. The decision to buy back additional shares as we\u2019ve said has more to do with how we feel about our excess capital, what our other alternatives are for the capital and what the market is at that point in time.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. Is the company already being granted equity credit by the rating agencies for the ESUs right now?", "Irene Esteves", "", "To some degree, yeah.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thanks. Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sander O\u2019Neill. You may ask your question.", "Dave Duclos", "", "Caller, you might be on mute.", "Paul Newsome \u2013 Sander O\u2019Neill", "Can you hear me okay now?", "Dave Duclos", "", "Yeah.", "Paul Newsome \u2013 Sander O\u2019Neill", "Sorry about that. I was hoping you could revisit the trade-off between MNA and stock repurchase now that you\u2019ve clearly made a move in stock repurchase and does this really change your interest relative to what you\u2019re looking for in mergers or in acquisitions?", "Mike McGavick", "I go back to what I\u2019ve been saying consistently on these calls, I guess, really for two years although there were times, I guess when it was less relevant than it is now but the reality is our first test is not only do we meet our regulatory and rating agency the capital requirements but also with a buffer that gives us comfort for operating the business. Once we have that taken care of then we do look at what\u2019s left over after we\u2019ve satisfied those things and our first objective is to improve the franchise, strengthen the franchise and we do look for opportunities that would meet our long-range hurdles.", "And when we\u2019re not excited by anything we see then we turn to giving this capital back to our shareholders, through as we have in this case, share repurchases. That same process will be an active process and an ongoing process and as periodically we evaluate those three factors and as Irene indicated where the market is we\u2019ll make our adjustments accordingly. There\u2019s no change in this approach at all.", "Paul Newsome \u2013 Sander O\u2019Neill", "Are the kinds of business that you may be interested in any different than they were, I think you talked about actually [mutual fund] in the past and some other type of businesses.", "Mike McGavick", "Well, we\u2019ve talked about a lot of things in the past. We\u2019ve talked about the fact that we\u2019re under went in the U.S. in insurance, we\u2019ve talked about hidden insurance, we talk about the fact that EMS is an attractive business but we\u2019re a global player and as a result, we have a lot of products, a lot of geographies and a lot of places that we could improve the franchise. So we consider while there are some obvious things, we consider this on a very broad basis and on a constant basis and we think we can make a difference overtime for the shareholders we will invest.", "A good example was mentioned in passing in Dave Duclos\u2019 comments we are building out a unit in North America focused on the construction industry. We\u2019re very excited with the progress of that team. It\u2019s certainly not a time to be expecting big growth in that segment but as we look at where the economy\u2019s headed and some of the bigger, sort of bigger trends, we like being present and ready and we\u2019re willing to invest to be present and ready until the time is, right and that\u2019s the philosophy we\u2019re going to continue to approach this way.", "Paul Newsome \u2013 Sander O\u2019Neill", "Thank you very much.", "Mike McGavick", "You bet.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Heimermann with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.", "Matt Heimermann \u2013 JPMorgan", "Hi. Just -- question with respect to capital, I guess. If we look at where you\u2019re sitting today and we contrast it with 2006, property and catastrophe writings are down to a billion three from a billion six in \u201806, the especially writings like aviation marine are down to 640 from 750. You\u2019ve got basically stable reserves over that timeframe, asset leverage has come down so I guess as I\u2019m thinking about the amount of capital you need to run your business, are there some areas where capital charges have gone up that might offset the decreases in these areas?", "Mike McGavick", "I wouldn\u2019t -- first of all, I liked hearing your recitation, sounds like a stronger business and we get that ramp out. I wouldn\u2019t put it in that framework. The emphasis I would put it in is as you know we\u2019ve been getting very positive reviews from the rating agencies for our progress in enterprise risk management.", "And a big focus of enterprise risk management is establishing the right level of buffer beyond rating agency requirements, beyond regulatory requirements that gives you comfort in how you operate your business such that we can consistently meet our clients\u2019 needs and our shareholders\u2019 expectations.", "And I think there\u2019s -- I would -- not that I know with precision the thinking of the past, I would believe based on the performance of the present that we may take a more conservative view of that than may have been viewed in the past and that would probably be a bigger impact than some other capital requirement or emphasis.", "Matt Heimermann \u2013 JPMorgan", "I guess what -- I mean, I hear what you\u2019re saying there. What I guess I struggle with in that comment is that I would think that the required buffer given that you would even being conservative today versus \u201806 is likely lower given the CAT reductions, the exit from ICAT, for example, given the asset leverage has come down, since CAT, I think, at least, in the mid, middle of the last decade and the investments more recently seem to have been the back of those?", "Mike McGavick", "Yeah. No. I appreciate that view, and again, I\u2019m not going to -- we\u2019ve never been specific about nor, I\u2019m going to change the policy today on what our capital buffer is but I would just tell you that we\u2019re and the board obviously are pleased with where we stand today and continue to approach capital management with the exact three-part approach that I mentioned just a moment ago.", "Matt Heimermann \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay. Fair enough, I won\u2019t belabor it. I guess for one quick for Jamie, is it possible to quantify the amount of business that was impacted by the renewal timing and also what the premium reestimate was just rough order of magnitude?", "Jamie Veghte", "Yeah. In the delta and premium was, in the U.S. was principally because of reduced premium from the heartland crop program which was about $22 million. In Bermuda, about $9.4 million was from lower premium on new and renewal business incepting in the quarter and the remainder of the $28 million delta was timing issues and so forth.", "Matt Heimermann \u2013 JPMorgan", "", "Okay. And then, for David, I guess the multiyear reduction in multiyear contracts, what line of business did that disproportionately impact, if I\u2019m just trying to put into context some of the changes of your year-over-year volume?.", "Dave Duclos", "Yeah. Matt, the majority of where we had long-term agreements has been in our European property and casualty books. We had a little bit in professional but the majority of it was in our property and casualty books in Europe and as Irene had mentioned, we\u2019ve come down from a high water mark of around 650 million in LTAs as we call them in 2007 and this year it\u2019s going to end up for a full year basis under 50 million.", "Matt Heimermann \u2013 JPMorgan", "", "Okay.", "Dave Duclos", "Primarily European property and causality.", "Matt Heimermann \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thanks. Our next question comes from Doug Mewhirter with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question.", "Doug Mewhirter \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "", "I had just a few smaller questions, most of them have been answered. First, in your casualty business the -- I guess, you said there was -- I guess, an assortment of casualty development that came in worse than expected. I guess, what kind of lines, I guess subcasualty lines were those and also what\u2019s the picture of worker\u2019s comp looking like right now from your perspective?", "Dave Duclos", "Doug, this is Dave. I guess, couple of things real quick on the casualty question. What we saw in the third quarter a bit of an uptick in terms of loss activity was in our access casualty book. And we don\u2019t get into specifics claimants, but I would say that the area, in terms of the segment where we\u2019ve seen increase in loss activity is in the energy segment which we\u2019re a player in and we\u2019ve acknowledged in the past.", "But again, I want to point out that  on a full year basis it\u2019s not abnormal it\u2019s just in the third quarter we\u2019ve had an increase over what we would consider to be average. And as far as work comp, I\u2019ll say what we\u2019ve been saying in terms of comp writings for the total organization it\u2019s less than 5%, we keep an eye on comp but frankly, we take a very cautious view and growing in comp at this particular point in the market isn\u2019t something we\u2019re looking to do.", "Doug Mewhirter \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Thanks for that. My second question is actually about the life business. The -- I know you\u2019ve been winding it down and it can be very lumpy quarter to quarter, I just noticed in the last couple of quarters your life benefits or claims relative to the amount of earned premium flowing through seemed to have been ticking up sequentially. I just wondered, was that just -- is that within the boundaries of the normal noisiness of the quarters or was there any kind of, I guess, longevity or mortality trends that are ticking up or is it industry related or what?", "Jamie Veghte", "No. We\u2019ve seen nothing on the mortality or other claim side that\u2019s giving rise to any concern in those books. I think, I\u2019m going to -- well, I won\u2019t hazard a guess. Usually, when it gets into movements in that book it winds up being FX but anyway there\u2019s been no claim trends that give us any cause for concern.", "Doug Mewhirter \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Thanks. And that\u2019s all my questions.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Paisan with Stifel Nicolaus. You may ask your question.", "Michael Paisan \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "", "Yeah. Hi. Good evening, everybody. Just a couple of quick ones, most of mine have actually been answered but on the reinsurance segment can you just tell us which accident years the prior-year development, the positive development came from and if you actually mentioned that in your prepared remarks I apologized, I missed it. That would be the first question. The second one is just more broad based on the crop business, what you\u2019re seeing in that business that causes you to kind of retrench a little bit in that particular market. Thanks.", "Dave Duclos", "Well, I\u2019ll answer the second one first, the reduction in crop was because of the commodity processes that existed in the winter when a lot of that business is bound. On the prior-year releases I will say that, again remaining quite conservative in recent underwriting years, 95% of the releases were from underwriting years 2007 and prior and of the $87 million that were released only $23 million came from the casualty that\u2019s for short tail lines of business and the $31.7 million that Irene mentioned in her opening remarks which was actually from the 2007 year of account, not the 2000.", "Michael Paisan \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "2007, okay.", "Mike McGavick", "And just on the store there, on the crop, we\u2019ve -- that\u2019s a longstanding book, we like that relationship and we like that business. It\u2019s just commodity pricing fluctuations, not appetite fluctuation.", "Michael Paisan \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Great. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Ian Gutterman with Adage Capital. You may ask your question.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital", "Hi guys. I have a few numbers one and then I have a question on market conditions. Can I clarify on Josh\u2019s question earlier on the financial lines product impact with the combined ratio. Was that insurance or reinsurance?", "Irene Esteves", "That impacted to be insurance segment.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital", "Insurance, okay. And then Jamie, you mentioned something structured product or something that had a 2% impact on the reinsurance combined ratio, what was that?", "Jamie Veghte", "We had losses last year that we didn\u2019t have this year which contributed to a 2.2% improvement.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital", "Okay. Got it. So it wasn\u2019t new in the quarter. And then the large losses can you give a little bit more detail on what caused those and seems everyone else reported so far has talked about or at least most people on absence of large losses so\u2026", "Dave Duclos", "Ian, this is Dave. And again, we don\u2019t get into naming-specific clients. As I mentioned, it\u2019s -- a couple of them were related to the energy field. We also have an aviation loss. And there\u2019s a bit of randomness to large loss activity. Although, I would point out that XL was not the whole 100% rider on any of these large losses. So it varies in terms of who participates. But it was maybe unfortunately our quarter to have a little bit more then uptick in terms of large loss activity.", "Not abnormal as I said if you look at this over a full year basis but that\u2019s about as much color that I\u2019d give you and it\u2019s nothing that causes any concern and the one thing I\u2019d say is we\u2019ve worked awful hard to get this franchise in the spot it is and we\u2019re looking very carefully and underwriting quality. We\u2019re looking at limits, we\u2019re looking at attachment points, we\u2019re looking at the primary risk underwriting and we feel good about that.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital", "Fair enough, that makes sense. One last number, one in the market conditions, one more for Mike. Do you have for the reinsurance segment the CAT and marine statements?", "Mike McGavick", "The New Zealand earthquake was $33.9 million of losses incurred. The reinstatement premiums were $1.2 million.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital", "Okay. And was there other to\u2026", "Mike McGavick", "We\u2019re trying to close for $5.5 million, I believe. European floods were $3 million.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital", "Okay. Good. Thanks.", "Mike McGavick", "", "Reinstatement premiums on the latter two.", "Dave Duclos ", "New Zealand, just to make sure they have a full picture for the company, that for 33 in reinsurance and we have another 11.5 in insurance. That\u2019s for the whole firm.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital", "Okay. And then just a question on marketing conditions, I assume you saw one of the major brokers put out what I would say is a pretty provocative pressure release essentially advertising that they\u2019re going to get a mid teens price reductions in a number of lines and basically if you want a reduction, expansion of your terms and conditions ask for it and they\u2019ll get it for you.", "What it seemed to -- I understand that\u2019s what the brokers do to some extent but it also seemed like a little bit of a shot across the bow and certainly no mention about, to be prepare for your underwriter to ask for price increases to make up for the -- to get-back in interest rates they\u2019ve had in the last few years. So, I mean do you have a sense that this one on one\u2019s going to be a little bit more combative than pass one ones.", "Mike McGavick", "Well, the only thing I would absorb is these are very difficult conditions and it\u2019s why we\u2019re so pleased with the discipline we\u2019re seeing in our underwriters. So we -- and I know there\u2019s a lot of them listening tonight and I just want to thank them again because it\u2019s not much fun to be an underwriter right now, but the reality is that kind of market noise is going on around us but it doesn\u2019t influence us. Our job is to write on behalf of our shareholders in what we think is a disciplined way.", "And, you know, the only other thing I\u2019d note just based on, what -- what many observe, the last phases of soft markets tend to be the wildest, woolliest and messiest, people started to scrambling disposition for the last bit and whatnot. And so I guess in these difficult days of softer pricing, kind of nothing surprises me. We just work on and keep going.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital", "All right. Just to be honest that was my concern is your exact last comment is do you think that we\u2019re headed towards that, crescendo toward the end this year where I think a lot of people think it\u2019s going to be sort of, stable, slow, steady bleed, do you think it will play out as usual?", "Mike McGavick", "Yeah. That\u2019s harder to predict, right? Because you never know when it was truly crazy until you look backwards. But I\u2019ll tell you our view is that -- our job is to just keep -- we\u2019re technically based underwriter, that\u2019s a huge advantage when it comes to these kinds of conversations and we just stick to our guns and from it just follow where they may.", "But just to go back to Dave\u2019s point on the kind of the higher frequency of, sort of, this severe events, now that\u2019s the business we\u2019re in. Six quarters ago I made the same comment about a quarter that had some of this, again and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t dance when they\u2019re light, we don\u2019t get upset when they\u2019re larger, it\u2019s the nature of XL\u2019s franchise and it\u2019s been a very variable franchise for a reason and the reason is this technical underwriting, we\u2019re not backing off.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital", "Yeah. I wasn\u2019t really particularly concerned about the large offsets, wanted to understand them better. Just to finish the pricing comments, I mean if there is lines and it sounds like maybe this is a renewal where if there\u2019s longer tail lines where you think maybe you need to hold the line on price to begin about with and then you need something for, yields maybe you need a 5% increase just to make up for what you\u2019ve lost on NAI, it sounds like it\u2019s should be hard to ask for that, but it basically going to be a renew or walk discussion, not a we need price discussion?", "Mike McGavick", "I can tell you what. We have without question been disciplined in this. We\u2019ve had a number of instances where we\u2019ve had very difficult discussions with some long time clients and we\u2019ve had to walk and if that\u2019s where the market takes the risk and that\u2019s what the buyers are expecting they going to have to get it from somebody else\u2019s capital.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital", "Sounds good. Pleased to hear it. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.", "Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Hi. Thanks and good evening. Wanted to just understand on page 30 of the supplement the unrealized loss aging schedule and how it folds in going forward. Are we stuck with realized losses or this unrealized kind of coming through the income statement for the foreseeable future?", "Irene Esteves", "I think it all depends on what happens in the quality of the assets. I mean, the realized losses at this point principally in non-agency RMBS and in our CDO portfolio and it\u2019s really going to come down to each quarter we sit down and we review those, updating our assumptions and if we see deterioration, we take the pain. But, I mean, we\u2019ll point out for the first time in a long time we\u2019re actually now in a net gain position on the overall portfolio which shows the amount of improvement we have had in terms of recovering in those assets.", "Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "I guess what I\u2019m wondering is, it looks like most of these assets have now been sitting in an unrealized loss position for more than 12 months. And we\u2019ve just come off of a one heck of a rally year-to-date in the fixed income markets. And so I\u2019m just wondering why this doesn\u2019t come through the income statement quicker. Are you guys marking to model in effect and just choosing to hold or how do we think about this and then how does it tie to your operating ROE goals or is it totally excluded from the operating ROE goals?", "Irene Esteves", "Well, one, it is excluded from the operating ROE goal because it\u2019s a net income number. I will say there\u2019s no hard time test that says once the security has been impaired with a certain period of time we have to write it down. It all comes down to the underlying credit quality and whether we think that\u2019s going to recover and we do every quarter, we\u2019ve continued to see recovery in a number of these legacy assets. Including this latest quarter and they are all marked to market using third-party sources so nothing is priced internally at this point.", "Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Great. Thank you for your help.", "Irene Esteves", "Pleasure.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our final question comes from Ron Bobman with Capital Returns. You may now ask your question.", "Ron Bobman \u2013 Capital Returns", "Hi Thanks a lot. And good evening. I just had a question on the buyback, I was wondering if business conditions sort of continuing their trend line and the stock price is somewhere in sort of the range of where it\u2019s been. If it\u2019s a buyback activity level that you conducted in the month of October is a reasonable activity level going forward on a monthly basis. Thanks. And best of luck, hope it continues.", "Mike McGavick", "Rob, thank you very much. And that\u2019s a completely understandable question, I\u2019m afraid I have to give the same answer I\u2019ve given before. We\u2019re going to keep reviewing what\u2019s going on in the market, we\u2019re going to keep reviewing what our position is relative to our writings, relative to our view of our capital buffers, relative in opportunities to put it to work and then whether -- at what level to return it to shareholders.", "That will be a constant evaluation so we\u2019re simply not in a position to give a forecast of what the answer to those changing factors will be in the future. But I appreciate the question and it\u2019s -- somehow it\u2019s a nicer question to have, than the question I was getting for the last few quarters which is always when the heck are you going to do something. At least it\u2019s -- at least we\u2019ve shown that there are tradition which we will and have. Yeah. I appreciate that.", "Ron Bobman \u2013 Capital Returns", "Thanks again.", "Mike McGavick", "Okay. You bet.", "Operator", "Thank you so much. And I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the speakers.", "Mike McGavick", "Yeah. Listen I just want to thank everybody for their time on the call. We continue to feel very pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made at XL and the strength of the franchise and the discipline that our underwriters are exhibiting in the markets and we look forward to brining you another update in a few months, hence.

My name is Lisa, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the XL Group Fourth Quarter and year end Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "David Radulski", "Thank you, Lisa. Good evening. And welcome to XL Group\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2010 conference call. This call is being simultaneously webcast on XL\u2019s website at www.xlgroup.com. We posted to our website several documents including our quarterly financial supplement and our fixed income portfolio data.", "On our call today, Mike McGavick, XL Group CEO will offer opening remarks; Irene Esteves, our CFO will review financial results, followed by Susan Cross, our Global Chief Actuary, who will discuss our reserving process and recent development. Dave Duclos, our Chief Executive of Insurance Operations; and Jamie Veghte, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations, will then review their segment results and market conditions, and then we\u2019ll open it up for questions. Sarah Street, our Chief Investment Officer is with us today and available for Q&A.", "Before they begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that certain of the matters we\u2019ll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements and therefore you should not place undue reliance on them.", "Forward looking statements are sensitive to many factors including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and other documents on file with the SEC, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statements in response to new information, future development or otherwise.", "And with that, I turn it over to Mike McGavick.", "Mike McGavick", "Good evening.  To open, I\u2019d like to note that on this call, we\u2019ll be structuring it a bit differently than we have on prior calls. You can expect this new template to be followed into the future. Three changes are most prominent.  First of all, in the past I\u2019ve opened with a talk that was mainly a regurgitation of the numbers that appear in the public materials that you have just received.  As Irene Esteves has moved in from being our newest team member to being a real leader in our financial operations, I think it\u2019s appropriate to have Irene go through these numbers and offer more granular commentary. So we\u2019ll have Irene taking that part of my presentation into hers. ", "Second, these being the days of tough, soft markets, I think it\u2019s appropriate to make available to you on a periodic basis our Global Chief Actuary, Susan Cross. Obviously attention to reserving is always important, but that\u2019s particularly a focus on reserving during this stage of the cycle.  Now I wanted to make sure she was available, because frankly, in this space, I feel XL has a great story to tell. We are very diligent and prudent reservers, and I think that\u2019s holding this company in good stead. ", "The final change in these calls is I think it\u2019s best if I focus my remarks on what we think about the five key drivers of shareholder value, and developments related to those five drivers during the quarter.  We\u2019ll follow this template into the future with, I hope, monotonous success. The five drivers of shareholder value that I\u2019ll be focusing on are first of all, of course, underwriting excellence.  Second, opportunities for strategic growth, third our strong risk management of the enterprise, fourth on optimizing our investment portfolio, and then fifth on operating and capital efficiency.  So those are the five areas where I\u2019ll bring forward some highlights of the quarter, and then Irene will take you into the details. Susan Cross will then provide the promised perspective on reserves, and then of course Dave and Jamie will talk about their respective operations. ", "So first, let\u2019s start with underwriting excellence, the first of the five drivers that I mentioned. In a quarter like this, when our underwriting operations provide a 91.4% combined ratio, and a 94.8% combined ratio for the year, we are very pleased with the underwriting performance of the company. This was led by outstanding performance in our reinsurance operation, though I\u2019d be quick to point out that a primary contributor to our results was, once again, prior year development, which reduced the current quarter by a combined 9.5 points. This is quality underwriting over time, and we feel good both about our results for the quarter and our results over time as reflected in this prior year development.  This resulted in an annualized operating ROE of 10% for the quarter and 9% for the year. ", "The second thing I would comment on is strategic growth. First, our top line had a managed amount of year over year growth, but we did have some increases in Q4 because of an innovative coverage we developed for a large insurance client, that was booked in this quarter. In other areas of strategic growth, we are constantly reviewing opportunities to expand into new lines and geography that we believe will add value. In Q4, this included receiving our license to offer primary insurance in Chinese markets, and adding experienced teams in several new lines of activity for XL, including construction and surety. We also recently promoted Greg Hendrick, a proven underwriter, and former leader of our very successful remuda reinsurance businesses to report to me as the head of strategic growth, searching for new opportunities to apply XLs talents.", "The third item I mentioned that I would comment on is our disciplined enterprise risk management.  Since we last talked to you, I would note that we had a review, a report card of sorts, from Standard and Poor\u2019s, that saw them increase our rating on enterprise risk management from adequate to strong, putting XLs ERM in the top quintile of companies that they rate.  So this overall grade and advance for XL is terribly important as we seek to put the dark days of the (inaudible) explosions behind us, and really strive to have our arms around, completely, what it is we do. We\u2019re very pleased with this achievement, and very proud of the work that Jacob Rosengarten and his entire team, and of many people involved in this across XL, and the progress we have made. As a side note, I would also mention that in the same period, S&P revised its outlook overall for XL to stable, and referred specifically to our strong franchise, strong operating performance, and strong, in fact in their words, extremely strong, capital position. ", "In the quarter we did see some other illustrations of our strength in ERM.  One of the things we focus on is when catastrophes do happen, what do we know about it?  What do we know about XLs exposure, and how good are we at getting it right as quickly as we can? Our New Zealand earthquake experiences are a case in point.  We\u2019ve seen a lot of changes around the market in estimates around New Zealand losses.  Our case has been somewhat different.  Our original loss estimates for the September earthquake have held up well, and we have strengthened our $44 million loss estimate by only $3 million in the quarter.  This speaks well for our ERM efforts, our knowledge of what events will cost, and what they will cost XL. And of course, it speaks well to the sophistication and effectiveness of our claims people on the ground. ", "Now, while speaking of catastrophes, let me comment on the Australian flooding.  Here, we\u2019ve had a relatively modest $23 million of loss in Q4.  Based on the preliminary data available to us, we would expect Q1 \u201911 losses to range between an additional $75 and $95 million for the firm.  Again, we take real pride in knowing that we can get these things right, and we have reason again to be confident in these numbers as well. Another part of risk management, of course, is focusing on our core businesses and removing distractions. We had another success in this space when we recognized a gain from the sale of the majority of our investment in Primus, and we continued in the quarter to reduce exposures in our financial guarantee portfolio. ", "The fourth driver that I mentioned, our investment portfolio, you may recall that in previous quarters as interest rates fell and we had positive marks to market, I mentioned that we\u2019d expect the pendulum to swing back as interest rates rose, and we saw a modest example of this effect in Q4. Overall, in the investment portfolio there\u2019s relatively little news.  We continue our pursuit of optimizing that portfolio, we\u2019re no longer in our all out repositioning, we\u2019re simply working to optimize the portfolio. ", "The fifth area I would comment on is our operating and capital efficiency.  Now here we are continuing to reap the benefits of previously announced efficiency initiatives, and our operating expenses are lower year over year on both the ratio and absolute dollar basis.  The benefits we sought were fully recognized, but we are not standing still.  For example, as you know, we are one of the handful of companies with a strong presence in the global program business, but we feel we can improve both our offerings and our efficiency, so we are reorganizing that operations to capture even more efficiency in our platform, and we think we can have it as an even more solid base for growth in future.", "Now when I talk about expenses, know that we will not shy away from making investments if we believe it\u2019s the prudent way to prepare for new opportunities, and you will see an uptick in our expense rate in 2011, as we install the systems we need to achieve both greater efficiency into the future and create a platform from which we can grow as market conditions allow.  We\u2019ll be sharing more examples and specific details of these kinds of initiatives over the course of the year, and we are making plans for an Investor Day sometime around mid-year, when we can give you more specific detail around these announcements. ", "Now these soft market conditions also require diligence in managing our invested capital, and as we said before, until we find appropriate investment opportunities, we remain committed to returning excess capital to our investors. In this quarter, we had an additional $250 million in share repurchases since we spoke with you last, and we have about $750 million remaining in our current authorization. So with our drivers of shareholder value, those five I\u2019ve just mentioned, all moving in the right direction, we believe we have put XL in a strong position to ride out the soft market storm and to profit from the opportunities improved conditions will bring, while still knowing it\u2019s our job to improve the company every day.", "Before I turn it over to Irene, a couple of other things.  As you know, we dedicated to applying best practices throughout our company.  We\u2019re expanding that to our guidance policy as well.  In the past, at this time of year, I would have given you some high level views on what we expected to happen in the future, but frankly I find the volatility in our industry makes it very difficult to give you meaningful predictions.  As we have asked representatives from across the investment community, they have shared with us that they find guidance to be a rapidly declining value, as they rely on their own models and the transparency with which we present ourselves.  We\u2019ve heard that providing you with timely and responsive disclosures is more useful than conjecturing about what will happen a year from now.  We\u2019ve decided to accept this advice, and we will forego providing formal guidance now and into the future.  ", "I will close on market conditions.  In the end, I cannot tell you when a market will turn, but I can tell you about  our book of business and a few things that we are encouraged by. First, we have seen some early indications of improving economic activity, especially in the US, where some of our clients, remembering that they tend to be larger, more complex institutions, have predicted some exposure growth for themselves, as we have negotiated their insurances.  This is good, and it\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve seen it in several years. The story for Europe is more uneven, with Germany continuing to perform strongly, and others, particularly the UK, performing weakly.  In the emerging markets, while it\u2019s a relatively small part of our books in terms of originations of writing, we do see the kinds of growth you\u2019d expect, and we\u2019re excited about what acquiring our Chinese license and other activities in Brazil can bring, and we think we have opportunities, real opportunities to participate in these growing markets. ", "As you\u2019ll hear from Jamie, we see some good signs from the reinsurance operation as well. So with all of that said, you can expect me to use this five part framework to update you each quarter, and with that I\u2019ll turn it over to Irene to go through the notes. Irene?", "Irene Esteves", "Thanks Mike, and good evening.  Overall, we had a strong quarter driven by a 91.4% combined ratio, and despite historically low investment yields, operating income for Q4 was $242 million or $0.74 per fully diluted share, with an annualized operating ROE of 10% for the quarter and 9% for the full year. P&C gross premiums written for Q4 were up by 13.8% year over year, excluding one large multi-year agreement, P&C gross premiums written were largely stable year over year, with moderate business growth in international professional, specialty, and other property insurance lines, offset primarity by fx movments. P&C net premiums earned increased by 2.2%, because as we had communicated before, a smaller percentage of bound policies over the last year were long term in nature. ", "Prior year development in Q4 was a favorable $122 million, or 9.5 loss ratio points. Our detailed round up reserve reviews resulted in favorable development of $66 million 16:01", "Of $211 million in Q4, was 9% lower than the prior year, as portfolio yields were driven lower by US interest rates. New purchases were mainly in high quality investment grade corporate credits.  The average new investment rate on our core P&C portfolio was 2.7%, reflecting a modest increase in absolute rates.  The duration of our P&C portfolio increased somewhat from the previous quarters 2.7 years to 2.9 years, and the P&C portfolio book yield, net of expenses, was 3.1%. As of yearend, the gross book yield on the P&C portfolio was 3.5%. ", "The unfavorable mark to market of $417 million in Q4 was driven by rising US interest rates, partially offset by modest US spread tightening.  This movement brought our entire available for sale portfolio into a net unrealized loss position of $153 million. Net income from investment fund affiliates was down $5 million, but our investment manager affiliates performed well, generating $25 million. It\u2019s important to note that the $56.1 million gain that we recognized from the sale of 76% of our interest in Primus was not included in operating income, since we had previously not included the impact on operating income when we wrote that investment down at yearend 2007.  ", "As you see from our press release, we continue to actively manage our capital, and in Q4 we bought back 11.8 million shares at an average cost of $21.29 for a total of $251 million dollars. Since the beginning of this year, we have purchased another 4.7 million shares for $106 million. The buyback since we restarted our program in August 2010 have totaled 30.4 million shares, or 9% of the beginning shares outstanding. As planned, the buybacks to date offset the dilution from the mandatory convertible preferred that will convert to a maximum of 30.4 million common shares in August of this year.We have $750 million remaining in our current buyback authorization, and we will continue to actively and prudently manage our capital base. ", "Slide six shows the growth in our book value per share.  For the year, we are up 21%, driven by the rebound in our mark to market and net income. While the negative mark to market in Q4 had an impact, it was offset by our net income and the share buybacks. So as you can see, we\u2019re delivering on our areas of focus for building shareholder value, supported by our dual top platform, we\u2019re delivering strong overall underwriting results.  We are not reaching for yield with an aggressive portfolio, we\u2019re managing business risks and being diligent with our expense base, and actively managing our capital levels. While demonstrating this operating discipline, we\u2019re also preparing ourselves for market turn by investing for strategic growth. ", "Let me now turn it over to Susan Cross to discuss our reserving process and our reserve levels. ", "Susan Cross", "Thanks Irene. I\u2019m going to cover two aspects of XLs reserving discipline with you this evening. First, an overview of our reserving process and how it impacts our (inaudible).  And second, what this process has contributed for our current reserves. We conduct detailed reserve reviews for all of our business lines at least twice a year.  The reviews are granular, with over 150 reserving profiles defined by element such as product line, geography, attachment level, and program. We consider growth, seeded, and net data separately. ", "For the majority of our business, these reviews take place in Q2 and Q4, based on data from the end of the prior quarter. We supplement these semi-annual comprehensive reviews with reviews of actual loss emergence relative to expected levels, which we do for all lines on a quarterly basis.  These semi-annual reviews mean that the most significant adjustment to prior year development are typically reported in our Q2 and Q4 financials.  We may also true up current year loss ratios in Q4, as we look back at full year experience. ", "In Q4 of each year, we have historically included updates to loss ratios on property and other short tail reinsurance business, written in the previous underwriting year, as this business matures.  In Q3, we have recognized final, reinsurance to close bookings on whole account reinsurance business written for Lloyd\u2019s syndicate, which for the past several years have resulted in favorable prior year developments. ", "In addition to our internal efforts, we engage both an independent actuarial firm to review our reserves on an annual basis, and our auditors, who conduct their own tests and reviews as appropriate. These external reviews provide a valuable perspective on industry profitability levels and loss trends, which are particularly useful at inflection points in the underwriting cycle. So what did we learn from all of these reviews in 2010? ", "First, our internal reviews resulted in us recognizing favorable prior year development of $122 million in Q4, bringing the full year prior year development to $373 million, which is 2.2% of reserves held at the beginning of 2010. This is consistent with our experience over the past four years, where favorable prior development has ranged from 1 to 3% of beginning of year reserves. For insurance, releases in Q4 totaled $66 million and were largely driven by favorable experience in professional. Most notably, in the 2007 and prior report years, for non clash D&O losses, as well as favorable clash development on report years 2006 and prior. ", "We made no changes to our clash provisions for 2007 through 2009 years, which cover sub-prime and (made off) exposures, and in fact, we incorporated a further reserve provision for potential clash exposure in 2010. Yet there were some reserving profiles we deemed it appropriate to strengthen. These were excess casualty, which was impacted by a large claim in 2007, a discontinued surety program, and a number of smaller profiles. For reinsurance, released in Q4 totaled $56 million, with over two-thirds from property and other short tail lines. ", "This is consistent with the full year 2010 experience, where 60% of the $245 million of favorable prior year development related to property, and other short tail lines. We continue to be cautious with respect to casualty reinsurance reserves, particularly in the US, due to uncertainty associated with the longer reporting and settlement patterns of this business. During 2010, we released just $19 million of reserves in the 2003 and subsequent underwriting years, as we believe it prudent to allow the favorable actual versus expected experience that we have observed through 2010 to continue seasoning. ", "I hope this helps you understand why we believe XLs reserving process is robust.  Internal and external reviews, comprehensive price monitoring, and a philosophy of prudence in the face of uncertainty are key components of managing reserve risk at XL. And now to Dave, to discuss results in the insurance segment.  ", "Dave Duclos", "Thanks Susan.  Our Q4 insurance results continue to be impacted by a very competitive marketplace, especially in the large client segment, where we focus. The insurance segment\u2019s combined ratio for the quarter, of 101%, was three points higher than Q4 2009.  Adjusting for prior development, this segment\u2019s Q4 combined ratio of 108.3% was 8.7 points higher, year over year. ", "This increase was largely due to the following; first, our current year net cat losses for the quarter were $15 million, compared to a release of $9 million in Q4 2009, a 2.7 point change. The recent Queensland flood accounted for the majority of this impact. Secondly, we exited and re-underwrote certain lines of business, which accounted for 1.2 points of the deterioration. This negative effect is temporary, and makes our book of business one that we believe will be more profitable in the long run. ", "The remainder of the deterioration came predominantly from our excess casualty and property lines, where we experienced a small number of high severity non cat losses. It is important to note, however, that this increase in inflated due to the particularly low level of property losses in Q4 2009. This underwriting result deterioration was partially offset by favorable acquisition and operating expenses, which resulted in a 2.6 point improvement year over year for the quarter. ", "Our year to date accident year loss ratio, ex cat, of 70.8% was 1.9 points worse than prior year ratio, due to the same reasons; exited businesses and a small number of high severity non cat losses.  We see no reserving trend in the loss producing accounts, just the nature of a sometimes lumpy business and the inevitable effect that flat to slightly negative pricing has on profitability. ", "Now to the premium story.  Excluding the large premium transaction that was previously mentioned, gross premiums written for the year were up 1%, and for the quarter increased 6.7%, or $68 million, with the majority of this organic growth coming from selective initiatives in our more profitable businesses, including international professional, instruction, and our marine lines. Regarding our professional lines book, while class action filings got off to a slow start in 2010, they did accelerate in the second half of the year, catching up to historical averages. ", "Developments like robo-signing, the recent increase in some foreign companies names in industry SEC class action suits, and the fact that over 60% of the credit crisis related lawsuits remain unresolved, continue to support our careful and cautious view on reserving. Moving on to market conditions, there\u2019s not much to add that you haven\u2019t already heard. It remains a very competitive market, and as I mentioned earlier, particularly challenging to the large client segment, where pricing pressures remain most severe. ", "While our retentions and submission flow remain strong in most of our businesses, soft pricing means we must remain extremely diligent in our selection of new risks. We continue to focus on select growth initiatives, including the recent announcements of our North American construction and surety business, our expansion into China and the addition of several new programs.  We also continue to strengthen our team with the most recent additions being Jim Tocco, who will head our North America Property and XL Global Asset Protection Services operations. We do expect to continue adding industry talent to an already strong global team. ", "Our experience so far in 2011 allows some optimism.  In our international P&C business unit, where nearly 40% of our book renews on January 1, we experienced strong retentions across all product lines, including 86% on an account basis, and 90% based on premium, and initial pricing indications are broadly stable. We do believe we\u2019re in a better position heading into the new year than we were 12 months ago.  Actions that we\u2019ve taken to increase efficiency and build on our underwriting capabilities, while remaining disciplined, mean we will be in a position to take advantage of  improvements in market conditions when and where they occur. ", "And now to Jamie, to discuss reinsurance. ", "Jamie Veghte", "Thanks Dave, and good evening. The reinsurance segment had an excellent result in Q4 on both the calendar and accident year basis, in market conditions that remain very challenging. Our combined was 69.7% for the quarter, and included the benefit of prior year releases of $56 million. This compares to a combined ratio of 92.6% in Q4 2009. Excluding the benefit of prior year reserve releases, we achieved a very strong combined of 84%, which compares to 97.1% in 2009. ", "For the full year, XL re had a combined ratio of 80.1%, which compares favorably to the 82.1% combined in 2009. Excluding prior year releases, the combined for 2010 was 96.4%, virtually flat to the 2009 figure of 96%. Turning to top line, gross written premiums in the quarter were $97.5 million, a 27% reduction from the $133.4 million written in Q4 of 2009.  For the full year, gross premiums written were $1.8 billion, a 1% reduction from 2009. ", "The reduction in the quarter was driven largely by XL re-America, and resulted from lower sessions on a property program, lower written premiums in our heartland crop facility, and cancellation of a substantial casualty quota share treaty. Overall, we view the underwriting performance in 2010 as outstanding. We are particularly gratified by the fact that virtually all business units had very strong combined ratios, with only Latin America producing an underwriting loss, which is understandable given the substantial market loss from the Chile earthquake. ", "Our Bermuda, Asia/Pacific, America, and European teams all had superb years, with combined ratios of 51%, 70%, 88%, and 77% respectively. This level of performance is a validation of our long term emphasis on underwriting discipline, and an excellent underwriting staff worldwide.  As respects our team, its depth was demonstrated in a significant way this quarter, with the appointment of new leaders of two of our business units.  Charles Cooper will lead XL re-Bermuda, and Philippe Rochaix will now head up our Latin America unit, having previously worked in both Europe and Asia/Pacific for XL. This action results from Greg Hendrick\u2019s new role that Mike mentioned previously, and Steven (Enoutabridge) moving on to other responsibilities within XL. ", "Turning to market conditions, I had a look at my remarks from our conference call a year ago, and I frankly struggle to deliver a message today that is any different.  I reported then that our January 1 renewal was competitive, but orderly, and that\u2019s precisely what took place at this yearend.  ", "On the short tail side, US cat pricing was down on a risk adjustment basis, between 7 and 10%, and the international markets were off by 5%.  There was plenty of capacity for the largest programs to get in place. Major market events such as Chile and Deep Water had limited impact outside of the markets they directly affected. ", "However, customers that got too aggressive with their pricing demands struggled to get programs finished. On the long tail side, terms and conditions held up well.  However, given the structure of these deals, the health of the market remains heavily dependent on pricing conditions on the primary side of the market.  ", "Overall, the renewal season went about as we expected, from a pricing perspective. In general, good deals got done fairly easily, and bad deals did not get finished. Despite this landscape, we were able to utilize our capacity, and found new opportunities in most of our business units.  ", "Of particular note was XL re-Europe, which found opportunities in the UK motor and marine markets, and put on significant new business.  In Bermuda, we were able to find some new catastrophe opportunities, and in the US we also wrote selected new business opportunities on both the property and casualty side. With that, I will turn it back to David for Q&A.", "", "David Radulski", "Lisa, can you please open the line for questions? ", "", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Yes, thank you. (Operator Instructions.) Your first question comes from Vinay Misquith, with Credit Suisse. ", "", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Hi, good evening. On the primary insurance side, the combined ratio on an accident year basis was about 104.6, and ex-cat was 100.8, how do you look at the profitability of this business right now and going forward? ", "Dave Duclos", "Vinay, this is Dave; first of all, let me be clear.  These kind of underwriting results are certainly disappointing to us, but I want to make sure that I give some perspective relative to what we\u2019ve experienced in 2010. The first half of the year was marked by Chile, and we do write catastrophe business, so that\u2019s a loss that we would expect, but other than that, actually the attritional loss ratio behaved and practically all of our lines. In the second half of the year, we did see some, as I said, some severity in non cat activity, specifically in two lines of business; our non US property and our excess casualty. ", "We have continued to analyze and monitor the book of business, and feel very good about the quality.  Now does this look like a lot of commercial books needs rate? I think you can define our book in three categories.  Some of book needs rate, some of our book needs to maintain rate, and some of our book probably still have some rate leeway, if you will, and still produce attractive returns. So I want to say that the actions we\u2019re taking the last couple of years aren\u2019t fully reflected in the loss ratio, we continue to do analysis, and frankly, while I\u2019m disappointed because we didn\u2019t make an underwriting income, we\u2019re not alarmed and know the drivers and are very much focused on making sure we get the rate that\u2019s going to produce the accident year results that we\u2019re projecting for 2011.  ", "I guess the last comment I\u2019d make about this is we\u2019re being real.  We\u2019re not kidding ourselves around our current year loss picks, and you\u2019ve heard other companies comment on trend in this area, and we feel very good about the projections.  Not just what we\u2019ve just announced for 2010, but also our expectations around 2011. But it is a competitive marketplace, one that we feel very good about the quality of the book, and also the continuing remits based on the actions we\u2019ve taken in the last couple of years. ", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Fair enough.  Given the way the stock price is trading and the situation on the excess capital level, do you think it makes more sense to write more business in the segment as you\u2019re doing right now, or how do you look at it like that, versus buying back your stock?", "Mike McGavick", "Vinay, this is Mike; you know, first I think I would sum up Dave\u2019s comments by noting that as we go back through where we had these pops, we write lumpy large lines of business, so there\u2019s going to be periods like that, just like in \u201909 there was a really, really quite year. We\u2019re just going to have these things. ", " When we go back and review, we didn\u2019t find anything out of order with our underwriting process. Generally speaking, where you see us seeking to grow, it\u2019s where we believe we have an opportunity to write at levels that reflect our capital goals.  So we would put our money to work only where we see real opportunity, where we see adequate rate, and we see real prospects for that market over time.  ", "So that, of course, we\u2019ll put money behind opportunities like that, and over time, we believe that will be positioning the insurance book to be more profitable, as the effects of exited lesser performing lines wear off. So that\u2019s a remix that I think investors should hope for, and that we\u2019ll keep searching for. When we don\u2019t see opportunities that are commiserate to the amount of capital that we have, then we turn to that next level, which is the share repurchasing.  As you\u2019ll note, we\u2019ve been active and continue to have room in our authorization. ", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Fair enough.  On the question of share repurchase, I was a little surprised that you only bought back $250 million, given the size of the excess capital.  Could you comment on the size of excess capital you have, and what if any, of a negative impact it\u2019s having on your ROE right now? Thanks. ", "", "", "Mike McGavick", "Sure, Vinay, we\u2019ve never commented within any specificity around our excess capital, as you call it, there are people that have noted to us repeatedly over the last year that with the significant improvement in our capital position and with the reductions in writings that were reflected in some of the discontinued activity that Dave referenced, there\u2019s been an assertion to us that there must be some room.  Certainly I think our buybacks reflect that at least in some part we agree, but we have not chosen to be specific about our plans for repurchases.  We prefer to do it in an orderly basis, and in a basis that will least impact the ordinary daily trading out there, and that\u2019s the approach we\u2019ll continue to take. ", "", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, that\u2019s great.  Thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays. ", "Jay Gelb -- Barclays", "Thanks, and good afternoon.  Mike, can you give us a bit, or perhaps Dave, can you give us a bit more color on the multi-year deal you did, and is this something that we should expect more of from XL? And the second question for Mike, with the company generating a 9% operating return on equity in 2010, what do you think is a reasonable expectation as the market continues to soften, here? ", "Mike McGavick", "Yeah, Jay, first on your first question on the multi-year program that was written, we can\u2019t and do not comment on specific accounts by name, but we can give you a little bit of detail around the financials of the transaction.  This was clearly a unique opportunity; one of the things we\u2019re proudest of is it really reflects XL\u2019s willingness and reputations for writing creative and complex risks, and while we can\u2019t plan on deals like this, we do expect to see similar opportunities into the future, but Dave, maybe you can give a little more information around the financials of it. ", "Dave Duclos", "Sure Jay, this is written on a primary casualty form, and it provides coverage for 10 years, and it acts as a product warranty cover for what is in essence a technology play.  As Mike mentioned, it\u2019s a sizable premium, it\u2019s in excess of $100 million, and in terms of replicating this success, we do have opportunities emerging where we can see similar products being made available, and I think the key thing that Mike mentioned, it\u2019s a result of our reputation in Europe and our willingness to be innovative in terms of crafting coverage that fits the client\u2019s needs. ", "Mike McGavick", "Jay, with respect to your second question, again, we\u2019re not going to be giving a guidance, including ROE guidance. We\u2019ll continue, as I mentioned a moment ago, we\u2019ll target those areas for growth where I think our technical underwriting skills give us the best opportunities to drive pricing and meet our (inaudible).  We\u2019re going to manage the capital side of the equation as well, as we have been doing.  But the only general comment I\u2019ll make is as we look at the market and where things have been trending, we see that the analyst community has broadly been forecasting industry ROEs in the kind of mid to high single digits, and with our \u201910 performance on the books, it\u2019s hard to take any difference of opinion from what I see the analyst community broadly saying about what the sector will be producing. ", "Jay Gelb -- Barclays", "Right, thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.", "Brian Meredith -- UBS", "Yeah, good evening.  A couple of things here.  Can you just comment a little bit, Jamie, you mentioned about the heartland quota share going away, I\u2019m just curious for our purposes, as we look at that, how much premium is that going to be going forward, and have you just gotten completely off the heartland business? ", "Jamie Veghte", "Let me walk you through a couple of things around that, Brian.  In 2010, our gross writings were $245 million.  We do rely on both the government and the proportional reinsurance market heavily in that class, so our net earned premium 2010 was $64 million. In addition, because of the structure of the SRA with the Federal Government, the business is actually still ours for 2011. It will not go to the new owner until 2012.  Finally, we reached an agreement with the new owner where in exchange for them becoming a substantial proportional reinsurer of us in 2011, we will have an option to reinsure them to a level in 2012. So A) on a net basis, it\u2019s not a significant impact, and B) whatever impact we feel will probably not be fully borne for a couple of years. ", "Brian Meredith -- UBS", "Okay great, and just one other quick question on the multi-year deal.  Just more from an accounting perspective, you said it\u2019s a pretty significant premium, so is that just a one time shot?  And it\u2019s a 10 year deal, I thought was what you said, so is it earned over a 10 year period?", "Dave Duclos", "Brian, this is Dave.  It was booked on a written premium basis in Q4 2010, but it earns over the 10 year policy period, yes. ", "Brian Meredith -- UBS", "Okay, okay, so that\u2019s that.  And one last quick one.  On the life operations, was there any kind of reserve releases there? Because it seemed like income was up pretty substantially from Q3. ", "Mike McGavick", "No, Brian, no reserve releases in that business. ", "Brian Meredith -- UBS", "Okay, thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jay Cohen, with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi, I had to jump off for a second, I don\u2019t know if you gave this, if you did I can follow up.  But on the multi-year deal, did you give us the actual dollar amount that represented? ", "Mike McGavick", "Jay, no I didn\u2019t.  I just referenced it as being over $100 million.  Not the specific amount. ", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "For modeling purposes, it would be helpful to have that, simply because we have to earn that out over 10 years as opposed to four or five quarters.

And then secondly, you mentioned some of the growth came in professional lines in Europe.  Can you talk about what kinds of professional lines you\u2019re writing there, and how that business might differ from the typical US professional lines that we\u2019re used to looking at? ", "", "Mike McGavick", "That\u2019s a great question, and I think it\u2019s a combination answer here.  We\u2019ve got the traditional D&O business that we obviously made a name for ourselves and a strong book here in the US.  We\u2019re writing that broadly in Europe.  We\u2019re also writing some specific classes on an E&O basis, we just opened up an opportunity, an operation that\u2019s going to focus on design professional, which is another well built US practice, so I guess the broad answer is it\u2019s a combination of the same kind of mix that you see in the US, and that growth is coming from not only Europe, broadly, but also Asia.  The one thing I would say is we\u2019ve added a lot of good quality underwriters through 2010 and Bernie and team have added more than a half a dozen capable underwriters that now are manning our various desks in London and Paris.  So we feel good about the penetration, but it\u2019s a fairly broad, diverse book, similar to what you see in the make up in the US.

First question, for Mike, at a time when pricing seems very difficult, I\u2019ve seen a flurry of press releases from you guys in the last four months or so, a lot of investment in people.  Maybe if you could just talk about that a little bit, the philosophy there, short term and long term, the objectives. ", "Mike McGavock", "Sure, we are very fortunate at XL to have very talented, technical underwriters around the world, but we\u2019re never of the opinion that we can\u2019t get better.  So we are always going to be looking for talented individuals and teams who we think can add in those areas where we think we can either take advantage of what we think are more acceptable rates for the risks, or areas where we think being positioned now will be important over time.  So each story, each individual, or each team would have its own story behind it, but the basic theme is we know that there are areas where we can achieve appropriate returns and we want to expand our achievement of them, or we know there are places where we know we can improve and we find someone who we think really brings additional capability and insight to the firm to grow forward.  ", "You know, the ones that we\u2019ve emphasized over recent quarters is the build out of construction in the US and the surety team.  Anybody who knows the backgrounds of the individuals involved knows that we have found some of the real leaders in the market, and when we look at what\u2019s going on in forecast construction spending, or US Government intentions, we see a lot of opportunity to be a meaningful player in something that we think will be more and more meaningful over time. So that\u2019s just an illustration of looking at how the world is going to play out, looking how we\u2019re positioned and making sure that we have great people able to take advantage of it.  You know, our general philosophy is quite simple; we think that talent is central to the competition and we want to always be willing to build out our investment and talent in order to take advantage of both current and future opportunities.

The majority of the adds to staff, in addition to the areas that Mike alluded to also support the comment I made earlier about the international professional build out, so there\u2019s a correlation between where you see new business success in 2010, where we\u2019ve invested in new people.  And the other comment, I\u2019ve mentioned, because you have to be prudent at this point in time of the cycle, we\u2019ve made all these hires and we\u2019ve managed our overall expense and head count budget, so we\u2019re doing it the right way. ", "Keith Walsh \u2013 Citi", "Okay, and then second question for Susan Cross.  You know, just thinking about frequency trends; I guess we\u2019ve been on a downward slope for the last several years, but how do you account for this in your inputs?  Thinking about that trend, especially at a time when just listening to the other underwriters talking out there, there\u2019s talk that this could be flattening, or even ticking up.  So how do you think about that?  Maybe some sensitivity around that issue. ", "Susan Cross", "Right, sure Keith, as you can appreciate we do monitor our life trends pretty carefully, and we certainly have seen some evidence of potential increases in frequency trends in the property and casualty, although we\u2019re just starting to see some signs of that in 2010, and I think that\u2019s one of the reasons that we\u2019ve looked at the 2010 launch ratio pretty carefully, as we finished out our year.  We continue to monitor that.  So I\u2019d say property and casualty, we\u2019ve been looking at those frequency trends; in professional, although we have seen some signs of some lower frequency trends.  So it really depends on the line of business, and we do monitor it carefully and reflect it in our current loss ratio fix. ", "Keith Walsh \u2013 Citi", "Okay, thanks a lot.

On the operating affiliates slide, what amount of that $75 million is in operating income, and can you just kind of talk about what happened there in the quarter? And then I have a couple of follow-ups, thanks.   Hello?", "Sarah Street", "If you actually look at \u2013 I\u2019m just trying to actually find the page here, our financial supplement, the one that\u2019s called Net Income from Operating Affiliates \u2013 the investment manager affiliate, the $25 million number, is definitely in operations earnings.  And then the rest of it isn\u2019t, the financial and other strategic investments is excluded.

And then just an expense question, you mentioned some new technology that would kind of run through the expense line in \u201911, and then the headcount that you added; I just want to think about how you\u2019re thinking about that line and in terms of the new teams, are they generally profitable now?  If you were to peel them out, and if not, how long do you think it will take to get them there, given where the market is right now? ", "Mike McGavock", "A couple of things.  First of all, again, we made very significant progress in our expense line over the last several years, fully achieving the savings that we had forecast through those two restructurings.  This year, even though as Dave said, we have added some people and teams, it has been within the budgets that were already built for those years.  So those did not reflect increased expense on a total basis.  Having said that, the new teams, it really would depend on which story. Some of them paid for themselves, or can pay for themselves quite quickly, because of opportunities that we\u2019ve identified.  ", "In other cases, it would take a couple of years to get those operations fully built out, so it really would depend on which individual team and what\u2019s the story behind that business.  Stories that we would be very uncomfortable, at this early stage, revealing to our competitors, so we won\u2019t get into those details at this time.  I did mention that we would make some investments around systems.  This is, by the way, consistent with the past, even in the last couple of years when we were reducing expenses, we were investing in new claims system, the build out of which was completed last year, on time and under budget, I might point out.  ", "Actually a little ahead of time and under budget, and we do have a few ideas for how we can continue to build greater long term efficiency through investing in technology and that will give us greater growth potential when appropriate in the market, and as I said, we will get into more detail around those, more granularity in the course of the year, in particular mid-year when we get to that Investor Day. But our discipline remains rock solid.  We have the soft market playbook out and fully operational, we believe in very disciplined underwriting and driving price as hard as we can, and monitoring our expenses with real frugality. The only thing where we will go outside of that is if we can see a real benefit and return to the firm, with a very reasonable payback period. ", "Mike Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Great, and just one more if I could, just on the portfolio. Where are you in terms of kind of re-risking that book, in duration to 2.9, with a book that seems to be shifting more toward the primary side, maybe more on the casualty side, does that duration start to creep out, or any thoughts on that side of the fence would be great.  Thank you. ", "Mike McGavock", "Yeah, I\u2019ll ask Sarah to make any specific comments she wishes; I would just say in general we\u2019ve been working toward this kind of duration level for some time and have no plans to significantly alter it. And generally speaking, of course, as you would know, going back over the last several years, our drive was to move to a more conventional portfolio and away from the more structured products that had caused us some challenges back during the credit crunch.  We\u2019ve been very successful, though not yet complete in that drive, but at this stage it\u2019s a very orderly process of working that position down as opportunities reveal themselves, and trying to stay ahead, as best we can, of new market phenomena, as we were mostly successful doing with respect to European financials explosion. So we feel very good about the way we\u2019re managing that portfolio, and we\u2019re going to continue to optimize it.  Is there any others you\u2019d add?", "Sarah Street", "No, I have nothing to add.  The extension of the duration this quarter would perhaps be really be putting a little bit more of the cash that we had sitting on the sidelines back to work, but probably now it\u2019s a level that\u2019s going to stabilize, so you\u2019ll see some market movement probably in some of our agency mortgages, interest rates go up and down, that can move our duration around, but no significant plans to change it, as Mike said. ", "Mike Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "So no significant sales of assets and reinvestments, just investing runoff and new cash proceeds? ", "Sarah Street", "No, we\u2019re tweaking on the margin.  We\u2019re working through all the assets when we find good opportunities, but no significant changes in investment strategy.  With the exception of equities, we are under weight equities at this point, and as we reduce some of our legacy assets, we will build up the equity portfolio, but that\u2019s going to be slow and over time.

", "Cliff Gallant \u2013 KBW", "Thank you, I think most of my questions were asked.  I was going to ask about the equity portfolio, but it seems like you just answered that. How about January 1 renewals, as a buyer of reinsurance?  Is there anything we can expect when we see Q1 results? ", "Mike McGavock", "Cliff, nothing really out of the ordinary. You\u2019ve got a combination, some of our treaty actually reduced in price.  One notable treaty went up and it\u2019s been broadcast by other companies, and that was marine, and that was specific to the deep water event. So it\u2019s a mixed bag.  I would say, as a buyer, I come out slightly happy compared to what we had planned for, which probably Jamie doesn\u2019t like to hear, but it\u2019s \u2013 I would describe it as prudent.  Obviously the marine area, in particular, in trying to get rate rise given the exposures that were highlighted with deep water makes sense.  In some other lines, there\u2019s still some competition for the business. ", "Cliff Gallant \u2013 KBW", "Okay, thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question some from Josh Shanker, with Deutsche Bank. ", "Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Good evening everyone. Two questions; the first one, I don\u2019t mean to belabor the multi-year contract, but as you know as outside analysts, we hear the words multi-year contract, and it makes us a little nervous.  If you can explain anything, without betraying anything of the client, how it comes to \u2013 you put together a 10 year price and why that\u2019s not a risky contract?  Explain just a little about the inner workings of that type of a business that you\u2019re writing. ", "Mike McGavock", "I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really possible for us to get into the reasons that we were comfortable with this kind of risk without giving you detail that would betray our agreements to confidentiality. So it is \u2013 it\u2019s so in the nature of the risk, why we were comfortable, that I think it\u2019s just not possible.  Sorry. ", "Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Is it possible that the price would ever change, depending on the loss experience of this product? ", "", "Mike McGavock", "The answer is no.  No.   Let me also, let\u2019s put this aside, and let\u2019s talk about long term agreements.  Just so there\u2019s a comfort here. You know, we\u2019ve talked about how much long term agreement business XL insurance had written, and I just want to give you a couple of numbers.  In 2010, we ended up writing $2 million in long terms agreements for our property and casualty book, largely out of Europe, and that\u2019s compared to $25 million that was written for the previous year.  For the full year of 2010, we wrote $50 million in what we call long term agreements, and that\u2019s down from a high water mark, if you will, of $631 million in 2008.  So I guess I want to make sure that this account opportunity was really a specific opportunity for us to apply our innovation and ability to solve a client need and it doesn\u2019t represent sort of the standard approach to how we think about putting long term agreements out in this marketplace. ", "", "Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, I appreciate your clarity on the matter.  And the second question involves the very good result in the reinsurance segment. It\u2019s stripping out the cat experience and the favorable development, as an accent period loss ratio you had about 46/46%, which is far better than anytime I can really go back, and I have a model that goes fairly far back. What\u2019s happened with business mix or what\u2019s going on there to make it so much better than what we\u2019ve seen previous quarters in the years? ", "Mike McGavock", "This particular quarter there were a large number of reasonably small items that contributed to the improvement.  Just to put it in context, if you strip out mat cat and prior development, we had a combined of 80.5%, which is about a 15 point improvement. The three biggest components of it were in 2009 we had $11 million of losses from our old structured product unit.  In 2009 we also wrote off some very, very old recoverable from an old macri of $8.6 million, that obviously is non-recurring.  In the current year, our A versus E on property in the US was very favorable in that it contributed a $10 million improvement. And there was a number of other smaller items that contributed a million or two million dollars here or there.  If you add it all up, it was this huge improvement. ", "Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Can we think about \u2013", "Mike McGavock", "I would say, and we have emphasized this on the call over the last couple of years, is that as the market has softened, the percentage of property tax business has increased substantially in the overall portfolio, and obviously you\u2019re going to have up years and down years in that portfolio, but as a percentage of the whole, it\u2019s virtually doubled from where it was in 2005. ", "Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "As I\u2019m thinking forward, you think the last nine months of the year or the first three months of the year are more indicative of the margins in the unit? ", "Mike McGavock", "Well, let\u2019s go over the year to date numbers, because I think that\u2019s probably more indicative of the numbers.  On a year to date basis, going through the same exercise, if you strip out mat cat and prior year releases, we had a combined ratio of 85.8% compared to 93% in 2009.  Again, we had financial solution losses in 2009 which were $21 million; we had a very large fire loss in 2009 which was $11 million, and going back to the A versus E on the property side in XL was another $10 million. In addition, there was some impact on business mix.  We have a line called other, which you may have seen, which is principally our London market whole account business.  That portfolio has dropped off; in 2009 it was $170 million at a loss ratio of 74, in 2010 it was down to $112 million at a loss ratio of 69. So there were a number of issues, again on a year to date basis, that contributed.  But I think broadly, if you looked at that sort of delta on a year to date it would be more representative of the overall situation than just Q4.

First, from Mike, can you tell me \u2013 I\u2019m just intrigued by this office of strategic growth, can you tell me one, just how does that operate, so that Greg isn\u2019t sort of stepping on Jamie or Dave\u2019s toes?

We keep talking about waiting for a turn, and all of that, but in the end we have to operate the business as though these are conditions in perpetuity. That\u2019s why we have to continue to look for ways to invest in our expenses so that we can actually lower those expenses over time. It\u2019s why we have to continue to be very disciplined about where we will put our underwriting expertise to work, and it\u2019s why we have to continue to fight the notion that there\u2019s nothing we can do. There are pockets of appropriate returns, and we should be seeking to make sure that we get as fair a share of those returns as XL can. ", "There are sectors of the economy that we see as more active and opportune than others, so it really is about how do we always be thinking about what can we bring, what can we innovate, what can we challenge ourselves to bring to bear in the market and make XL shareholders more money?  When we don\u2019t think we can do that, we purchase our shares.  So it\u2019s really about having a mindset that is always challenging ourselves to do better, no matter what the external conditions may be.  It\u2019s unacceptable to just sit and wring your hands and say it\u2019s a lousy market.  ", "It\u2019s more appropriate to always be scanning that market for what are often small but nice opportunities. And we see that at XL and we\u2019re going to exploit it at XL.  I\u2019m particularly delighted that Greg\u2019s the one doing it.  This is a seasoned underwriter, and Greg is a seasoned business person.  He thinks about it from a business perspective, he thinks about it over time, and he knows that the fundamental use of our shareholders capital is to make them money. So I\u2019m \u2013 you\u2019ll react in whichever way you want, but from my point of view, I think that challenging of ourselves is inherent in building a great business over the long haul. ", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital", "That makes a lot of sense.  I guess what I\u2019m trying to think through is what\u2019s considered success for him, I guess.  In this kind of market, if he looks at 100 things, and says I can only find one, is that good, or does he have to find 10 good things for it to be a success? ", "Mike McGavock", "No, no, the only real measure of success will come over time, on the bottom line, and there\u2019s no \u2013 we never put in place a top line goals.  All of our goals and all of our compensations are designed around combined ratio, ROE, and bottom line. So there\u2019s no \u2013 if he were to say to us, \u201cI have scoured and scoured the planet, and there\u2019s nothing we can do right now.\u201d we\u2019d obviously challenge to look at what he looked at, and then we\u2019d say \u201cGood job, keep looking.\u201d Because there\u2019s got to be something.  So it\u2019s not about top line growth.  It\u2019s about adding to the profits of the company.  Where there\u2019s opportunity there is, and where there isn\u2019t there isn\u2019t.  We\u2019re patient about this.  There\u2019s no short term imperative of any kind. ", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital", "Okay, perfect.  I just wanted to make sure that hadn\u2019t changed.  And then for Dave, you mentioned in a couple of places about excess casualty loss.  I think some in this quarter and I think Susan mentioned some in the adverse development.  Can you just talk about what\u2019s going on in excess casualty?  Is there anything that makes you a little nervous there? That tends to be usually a harbinger of reserve problems for the industry. ", "Dave Duclos ", "Well, I don\u2019t know about the harbinger of reserve problems for the industry, but I do know that we\u2019ve had two quarters now where we\u2019ve had an uptick.  I wouldn\u2019t call it a trend, we\u2019re looking at the book carefully.  It is associated with a class, I mentioned this during the Q3 call, there\u2019s quite a few of the losses that are related to the energy area, so it\u2019s energy driven in the excess casualty space, and as I\u2019ve mentioned before, we feel good about the quality book of business, and we\u2019re looking right now at how we use capacity, where we attach our limits, the rate on line, but it\u2019s not an area that we\u2019re going to run away from, because frankly XLs made its mark in the energy area in a number of lines, including excess casualty.  ", "It\u2019s something we\u2019re carefully looking at, and I would say that\u2019s a line in some cases where we certainly want to make sure that we push rate appropriate.  I would point out that one of the ways we\u2019ve managed this over the last 18 months, if you look at the premium, the premium is bound, both in 2009 and 2010, but that\u2019s the primary driver of that excess casualty result. ", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital", "Okay, and then just lastly for you, I\u2019m doing really quick math here, so I know I might be a little bit off here, but if I look at the yearend premiums for your book for the year, about $2 billion is in casualty, and about $1.5 billion is property or short tail, so it\u2019s a little bit more than 50/50, sort of mid long tail, if you will.  ", "I was just trying to do the math on how that gets to an accident year that\u2019s over 100, because I would have thought that short tail stuff would be closer to 90, and the mid to long, especially considering some of it is professional line, shouldn\u2019t be a whole lot over 100.  It implies either the short tail is closer to 100 than I think, or the professional lines are at like 110 or higher.  Is there something I\u2019m way off on there? ", "Dave Duclos ", "No, that\u2019s a good point, and it\u2019s not the professional book. The professional book is performing well. We did have, I referenced this in my opening comments.  In addition to the excess casualty line, we also had property non cat losses and our attritional loss in ratio is running a little bit high.  So our short sales performance, and I\u2019d say this is maybe more of a non US impact, but our North America property\u2019s holding up pretty good, but we have had some poor experience and some losses on an international basis.  ", "The same comment I made earlier about excess casualty, the kind of business we write, we\u2019re going to see the lumpiness, if we will.  Now again, I can\u2019t every quarter keep talking about lumpiness, so that\u2019s why we\u2019re looking at actually the two areas we\u2019re looking at.  Not looking at from a standpoint of planning on exiting, quite frankly, we\u2019re looking at it to figure out how we can solve a profit problem and also increase our ability to write business longer term, would be property and excess casualty.

Is it more the average daily trading volume, and capacity for \u2013 there\u2019s a limitation there for number of buybacks.

", "Doug Mewhirter -- RBC Capital Markets", "And I guess the following question to that, on the same topic, and I guess the real answer you may not be able to really disclose it, because it gets into client relationships, but there was a bit of controversy I think in the reinsurance industry about one event versus two events, and which program to put this on. Did you actually claim it as two separate events, or was it sort of one more continuous thing, and you sort of had a negotiation to parse it out between your last year\u2019s program and this year\u2019s renewing program?

My name is Shirley, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the XL Group plc Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "David Radulski", "Thank you, Shirley, and good evening, and welcome to XL Group's Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being simultaneously webcast in XL's website at www.xlgroup.com. We posted to our website several documents. These include our quarterly financial supplement, which we are reposting to ensure the file is complete and readable. Our apologies for the inconvenience. ", "On our call today Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, will offer opening remarks. Susan Cross, our Global Chief Actuary, will do our reserving process; followed by Dave Duclos, our Chief Executive of Insurance Operations; and Jamie Veghte, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations, who will review the segment results and market conditions. Then we'll open it up for questions. Sarah Street, our Chief Investment Officer; and Simon Rich, our Treasurer, are with us today and available for Q&A.", "Before they begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that certain of the matters we\u2019ll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations.  Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, and, therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them.  Forward looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other documents we've filed with the SEC, and could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of which they are made, and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise.", "With that, I turn it over to Mike McGavick.", "Michael McGavick", "Good evening. As we have discussed on previous calls, and shared with you during our recent Investor Day, we are keenly focused on the 5 drivers that build value for XL's shareholders. These are: underwriting excellence, strategic growth, strong enterprise risk management, optimized investing and operating in capital efficiency. We feel good about our progress across these 5 drivers as each has contributed to our results in this quarter. Have you seen the quarter produced $0.75 in operating earnings. And we grew our fully diluted book value per share by 6.3% and generated an annualized operating ROE of 10.3%. ", "Now first, as to our pursuit of underwriting excellence. Our P&C operations produced a combined ratio of 94.9% for the quarter, a solid result for this stage in the market cycle. Our top line growth of 16.9% year-over-year came from the business initiatives in both Insurance and Reinsurance, favorable FX movements and better pricing and account lines, particularly in Property Catastrophe. Market conditions continued their gradual improvement, and we saw pricing in several of our most important lines rise or, at least, bottomed out. RMS 11 has had a positive impact on Florida pricing already, and we also saw increases in several loss-driven markets, notably property, excess casualty and marine lines. Markets with very good recent loss histories like primary U.S. D&O and Reinsurance Aviation were exceptions to these positive trends. ", "We've already been taking advantage of what we've been learning both from our reinvigoration of our existing businesses and our strategic growth initiatives, the second of our value-creating levers. ", "With respect to strategic growth, we continued to add capacity and capability in markets we consider attractive and profitable, especially in lines that complement our existing strengths like construction and surety, and we expanded product offerings in environmental and excess in surplus. ", "A key part of our growth strategy is our focus on attracting and enabling the best talent in the industry. And we continue to add top teams and leaders in the second quarter to our already fine crew. And particularly, we are very pleased that Pete Parrino will be joining XL as our new CFO. Pete has a wealth of finance accounting and strategic leadership experience. He knows the insurance industry, and he knows XL. We look forward to him joining us full time at the end of August, so you can expect him to participate in our next earnings call. ", "We also recently announced that Paolo Ribotta will become the Head of our Global Distribution. This new position should build on the success we're already seeing from increased cross-selling among our businesses and will play a key role as we expand to new markets and geographies. ", "With these 2 levers in motion, underwriting excellence and strategic growth, our strategy relies on the third value creating lever, a strong ERM foundation. This was again demonstrated by our Cat performance in the second quarter. Industry's observers have reported that the 2011 tornado season, taken as a single event, would be among the top 10 costliest events in global insurance history. Now we measure our loss performance in several ways. But one significant metric is losses as a percentage of shareholders equity. Using this metric, we have performed exceptionally well on both an absolute and relative basis. But second quarter Cat losses representing 0.7% of March 31 shareholders' equity and year-to-date Cat losses were a very manageable 4.5% of year end shareholders' equity. ", "Our own implementation of RMS version 11 is complete, and we believe we have sufficient headrooms within our limited structure to take advantage of market opportunities. A key reason that we have this capacity is that we have already anticipated some of the model changes, and we're already applying additional loads to the version 10 methodology, where we felt it was warranted, particularly around the issue of storm surge. ", "Effective reserving is another key to our prudence. We have performed our comprehensive semi-annual actuarial reviews on XL's P&C risk portfolio in the second quarter. This review resulted in prior year releases of $128 million, split evenly between Insurance and Reinsurance. ", "Favorable insurance development was largely in professional lines, while favorable Reinsurance development was most significant in North American Property & Casualty lines. ", "Turning to the fourth lever, optimized investing. We took advantage of higher rates early in the quarter to deploy funds, particularly into agency RMBS and corporates, achieving a P&C new money yield of 3.4%. There was no change to duration in the P&C portfolio at 2.8 years. The increase in P&C net book yield this quarter, compared to the first quarter of 2011, was due to a couple of nonrecurring items. The underlying yield was more in line with the first quarter's net book yield of around 3%. ", "We ended the second quarter with a favorable mark-to-market of $180 million, largely driven by the fall in U.S. interest rates. ", "In terms of the fifth lever, operating and capital efficiency. Our operating expense run rate was in line with the last 2 quarters. The increase on a year-over-year basis largely supported the strategic initiatives we discussed in our quarter one call and throughout our Investor Day. These plans include important improvements to increase the scalability and insightfulness of our underwriting platform. ", "With respect to capital management, we restarted our share buyback program in mid-June, buying back 4.3 million shares for $92 million in the second quarter, and another 7.3 million shares for $158 million, so far, in the third quarter. Since August 2010, we have bought back a total of 45 million shares for $935 million, which has increased our book value per share by approximately $1. ", "We are also acting on our intention to reduce financial leverage. We announced our tender for the remaining Series C preference shares and the remarketing and intended buying in of the senior notes associated with our equity security units. ", "All in all, we are pleased with our progress. Our underwriting capabilities are continuously improving. Our risk management continues strong. Our reserving prudence was demonstrated once again, and we maintained our discipline in managing our debt and equity capital. ", "We know how important all these elements are to delivering the returns shareholders expect from XL, and we are committed to generating such solid returns. ", "Now I'll turn it over to our Global Chief Actuary, Susan Cross, for some comments on our reserve review process. Susan?", "Susan Cross", "Thanks, Mike. During the second quarter, we complete detailed reviews covering virtually all of our reserves across our P&C business lines. This is consistent with our normal semi-annual process, and there were no material changes in approach or methodology. As Mike mentioned, these reviews resulted in favorable prior year development of $128 million, split evenly between the Insurance and Reinsurance segments. ", "The insurance releases of $64 million are primarily attributable to professional lines in the 2006 and prior years. Primary casualty, marine and aerospace also contributed favorably. The favorable development was partially offset by strengthening related to a discontinued surety program and excess in surplus business, as well as strengthening in excess casualty. On a year-to-date basis, the favorable development of $70 million for Insurance is in line with the releases of $66 million for the first half of 2010. The Reinsurance releases of $64 million dollars are comprised of $25 million for property and other short-tail lines; $25 million for Casualty lines, including Professional, primarily in years 2004 and prior; and $40 million related to whole accounts release written on Lloyd's Syndicate. ", "The total favorable prior development of $64 million is $15 million more than the prior year quarter, largely driven by the releases on the whole account treaties. In the past, we have generally recorded the Reinsurance to close on this business, which has generated favorable prior year development in the third quarter. This year, we have received sufficient information to allow us to reflect at least a portion of the Reinsurance to close in the second quarter. So this reflects a timing difference between the second and third quarters. ", "Overall, we continue to see favorable actual loss emergence relative to expected levels across most areas of our business. Loss cost trends continue to be moderate, with no discernible changes in those trends thus far in 2011. That said, it's important to keep in mind that it can be difficult to discern such changes for many of our product lines due to their low frequency, high severity characteristics. As such, although loss trends have been moderate in recent years, we continue to factor in long term views of loss trend into both our pricing and reserving as we consider this a more prudent approach. ", "And now to Dave to discuss Insurance segment results.", "David Radulski", "Thank you, Susan. Insurance results for the second quarter were on track despite the U.S. -- significant U.S. storm activity Mike mentioned. The segments combined ratio for the quarter of 97.9% compared to 97.6% during the same quarter last year. Losses in our offshore energy and satellite books were more than offset by prior year reserve releases of $64 million, primarily from our U.S. D&O business. ", "Insurance gross premiums written in Q2 rose by $204 million, or nearly 19% from previous year. While this growth benefited from some one-off gain, premiums were materially stronger as a result of targeted growth initiatives. Several expiring long-term agreements, which were not reflected in last year's premiums, were re-underwritten and renewed as annual policies for a total of $38 million. And favorable true-ups of various premium accruals and other adjustments accounted for $32 million. ", "Adjusting for these factors, the real growth for the quarter was 8% and benefited from the continued build-out of targeted initiatives we discussed at Investor Day. This included North America and international construction, North America surety, U.S. general aviation and international upper-middle markets. For example, in Q2 this year, we wrote $12 million in North American construction business, compared to 0 in 2010. And we grew out international upper-middle market book from $17 million in the second quarter a year ago to $31 million in Q2 2011. ", "Foreign exchange adjustments made up the balance of the growth. Net premiums earned were up 4.5% or $39 million largely reflecting the earn through of higher gross premiums written. Our Q2 loss ratio of 67% was actually 1.2 points better than last year. But when you adjust for both Cat and prior year development, our underlying loss ratio rose 2.4 points due to the offshore energy and satellite losses mentioned earlier. We expect and plan for significant losses in these lines, though in light of the second quarter activity, we were acting on the side of prudence and have not fully absorbed them in our IBNR. ", "On a similar topic, after reporting large property losses during the past 3 quarters, I did want to mention that despite the Q2 storm activity in the U.S., our combined property book, International, North America and Bermuda, performed at historical levels with a loss ratio including Cats in a mid-40s. Acquisition expenses of 12.5% were 1.9 points above prior year as Q2 2010 included favorable one-off for premium taxes and guaranteed fund assessments. Excluding these adjustments, the unfavorable variance of 0.4 points is made up of plan changes and mix of business and a reinstatement premium related to last year's Gulf disaster. Generally speaking, a good financial results for this stage in the cycle. ", "Now the market conditions. The favorable pricing trend we began to see with our April 1 renewals continue to the second quarter. While average pricing across all lines had been declining in the 1% to 2% range for the prior 12 months, for Q2, it appears to have stabilized. As Mike mentioned, U.S. D&O was an exception, where prices continued to decline in the low-single digits, given the industry profitability levels. And we have, accordingly, reduced our exposures written in this line. ", "Excluding U.S. D&O, we have seen pricing strengthened by just under 2%. It's largely that property, Excess Casualty and Marine lines driving this improvement, although we are taking actions to push rate in other lines as well. We are guardedly optimistic by the rate strengthening seen in Q2 results. So while we expect to see continued opportunities for selective profitable growth, we remain diligent in our underwriting activities as we see how this market plays out over the next several quarters. ", "And now to Jamie to discuss Reinsurance.", "James Veghte", "Thanks, Dave, and good evening. The Reinsurance segment had a solid quarter of underwriting results with a combined ratio of 87.9%. These results were impacted by prior year reserve releases of $63.9 million, and Cat losses in the quarter of $57.4 million. Excluding the impact of these items, our combined ratio was 90%. This compares favorably to the combined of 92.7% in the second quarter of 2010, also excluding Cats and prior year development. ", "The prior year releases we took in the quarter were largely from our U.S. business unit. And as Susan mentioned, we remained cautious about long-tail reserve releases generally and very diligent regarding recent underwriting years in these lines. ", "With respect to top line, gross premiums written in the quarter were $472 million, up 12% from the second quarter of last year. This increase was virtually entirely driven by XL Re Bermuda and Europe. In Bermuda, we enjoyed a nice improvement in pricing and utilized additional capacity in the North American Cat renewals. In Europe, we wrote one new professional indemnity treaty for $20 million of annual premium, and also had the benefit of increased premium sessions on U.K. motor treaties that had been booked at low-written premium levels. ", "As we've often said, top line variations and a treaty portfolio can often cause anomalies in year-on-year premium levels that do not reflect larger market trends. That is, this growth does not signal either broad market turn or weakening underwriting standards. We've simply found some selective opportunities to write business in key markets. ", "Turning to market conditions, we were broadly pleased with mid-year renewals. We were in a great position to take advantage of improved pricing in the U.S. Cat market, selectively write new business and expand our lines on programs we liked. On Florida-concentrated business, pricing was up 7.5% to 12.5%, and on other U.S. business, an improved 5% to 7.5% on a risk-adjusted basis. ", "The renewal process in the Cat market was a bit of a game of chicken, with some clients instructing their brokers to place as much as they could at prices below the levels quoted by the recognized lead markets. In these cases, programs struggle to achieve full placement, and we had the benefit of writing shortfall covers in a number of instances where this took place. Those that purchased at market-leading consensus pricing found abundant capacity to place their programs. ", "In the International market, loss impacted property programs have seen price increases of 5% to 10%. Loss-free programs were generally flat to down slightly. In specialty lines, aviation was down 5% given favorable loss experience and loss-driven markets such as marine energy, the retro market and Asia Pacific Cat renewal saw a positive movement. ", "On the long-tail side, the environment remains competitive across most sectors of the market. Other than limited pockets, we see continued pressure on pricing. Broadly, the Reinsurance segment now prefers professional lines over standard lines and prefer the write excess of loss over quota share. We do see occasion opportunities to write business like we did in London this quarter. But overall, the market remains very competitive, and our underwriting posture highly defensive. ", "With that I'll turn things back to David for Q&A.", "David Radulski", "Shirley, can you please open the lines for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Keith Walsh with Citi.", "Keith Walsh - Citigroup Inc", "Anyway, just first question on net written premium, looking at primary property and reinsurance property Cat seemed very, very strong growth there. And by my math gone from about 26% to 29% of total NWP. Is there a limit or a target on how large a percent of the total book you want this to account for?", "James Veghte", "Keith, it's Jamie. On the Reinsurance side, we've spoken about this before. As the long-tail markets have weakened, we have increased the percentage of our writings in property, particularly Cat which has gone from about 10% of our portfolio in 2005, to almost 20% today. I don't think we ever have any absolute target percentage split. We tend to allocate our capital where we think we can generate the best returns.", "David Duclos", "Keith, this is Dave. I'll just add that in addition to the capital utilization comment that Jamie just made, the production that you saw on the second quarter for Insurance property is reflective of actually strengthening of the team. We've got a new leader, Joe Tocco, who's working with the existing team. And frankly, we're getting more shots at good opportunities and pricing the business as we were earlier in 2011 and also 2010. So we feel really good about that being a sign of us being a bigger factor in the property market in North America.", "Keith Walsh - Citigroup Inc", "Great. And then a follow-up around expenses. Two-part question. You mentioned in the press release, operating expenses elevated and the build-out of the office of strategic growth and other initiatives. Maybe, how meaningful is this to the quarterly run rate, if you could put some numbers around that? And then I've got a follow-up to that.", "Michael McGavick", "Yes, this is Mike. As we commented on the Investor Day up in New York, we'd expect this to be a continuing -- we expect this to be a continuing additional cost which really began to build in, in earnest in the fourth quarter last year and has continued at about the same rate at this stage. I would expect that we will continue to see it at this level for the foreseeable future. It could go up or down depending on particular activities that are going on at any given time. But we've expected this really to be a continuing activity, because we think that investing in new technology and approving your platform is simply a constant need of a company that wants to rely this heavily on technology to improve its underwriting basis. The actual run rate increase in the quarter was about $20 million on a run rate basis over a year ago. And I think that's probably a good proxy to use at this stage.", "Keith Walsh - Citigroup Inc", "And then the other piece on the expenses is increased acquisition costs. So what does this mean exactly? Where are these broker characters out there? What are they doing to you guys? They're taking a bigger cut of the pie, it sounds like. If you could just...", "Michael McGavick", "Actually, Keith, it's not what it seems. Jamie?", "James Veghte", "Certainly, part of it comes out of our portfolio, Keith. And it is an indirect result or a direct result of the prior year reserve releases. So if we release reserves on a casualty quota share, for example, very often there's a profit commission associated with that treaty. And we have to increase the accrual on the profit commission that drives the acquisition ratio up.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "I realized the midyear reserve review came in the second quarter, and that resulted in a bit more reserve releases certainly than we were modeling. What's the sustainability of that trend?", "Susan Cross", "Jay, as I mentioned, we continue to see favorable actual loss emergence relative to our expected levels. And loss cost trends continue to be moderate. So we don't have any reason to believe that's not going to continue. We continue to apply the same prudent reserving approach. So I'm not going to forecast for you, but I don't see any reason to expect it not to continue.", "Michael McGavick", "Jay, this is Mike. I would also note that a couple of the independent analysts that a look at our reserve loss triangles released back a few months ago, actually, judged reserves to have come out a bit stronger, which is not what we've been seeing generally across the market. So that gives us even more comfort with the quality of the processes we use.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "Okay, on separate issues, deployment of excess capital. Mike, when we had you on the call 3 months ago, you seemed to pull back a bit in terms of the desire to buyback stock and even during Investor Day, but it seems to have shifted gears a bit. Can you tell us what changed in terms of your decision to go back into share buybacks?", "Michael McGavick", "We have never changed our philosophy. We do believe that -- I don't want to bore you with the 3-part decision-making process again, we first make sure that we have excess capital to a buffer to our rating agency required capital. We then -- if we have excess capital from that buffer, we then consider ways in which we could improve the value of the firm for our shareholders by investing in the firm or through acquisitions or other activities such as that. And if when those things are complete, we don't think we can add value in that way, but we believe that it's the shareholders' money we should find the most efficient practical means returning it to them. That 3-part test has been, I think, quite effective over the years I've been in these chairs. And I can tell you that as we watch the events in the first quarter unfold, we thought it was most prudent to take a pause, because we considered that there could be some very unusual market dynamics that would emerge. And actually, I think we're seeing around us some unusual activity in the end markets. Having said all, including both a much -- an improved pricing environment, particularly in property casualty -- property catastrophe, particularly we're seeing, of course, the implications of RMS model 11. And of course, you are seeing sort of stepped up, both rumored and real M&A activity. So there's a lot going on right now. We thought it was right to take a pause. We went through our 3-part analysis. And our conclusion was, in the end, that we should be returning capital to share repurchase at this time, and that's the program that I've updated you about. I would note that we have another 440 million or so of authorization remaining on our existing $1 billion authorization.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "What's the timeframe to complete that?", "Michael McGavick", "As you know, we have never forecast our decisions around amounts or specific activities, because to do so would be to the detriment of the effectiveness of the program.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi. [Goldman Sachs]", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Just a question on loss ratios year-over-year. So could you kind of tell us, both in Insurance and Reinsurance, if you adjust for those items that you talked about, what does the year-over-year look like?", "David Duclos", "Let me start, this is David, with Insurance. And those large losses I alluded to in the satellite and marine areas account for over 5 points of a loss ratio on an accident year basis. So when you normalize those, i.e., you just take the losses that would've been contemplated within our large loss load, that actually represents the entire negative variance on an accident year basis. Now I have to tell you, it's tiring to talk about lumpy losses impact quarter-to-quarter. But I do want to say, with both the marine and aviation satellite business, these are profitable businesses for us. But the good news is, is that on an accident year basis, we would have a slight improvement year-to-year if it wasn't for the anomaly around the large losses associated with those 2 businesses.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And then on the Reinsurance side?", "James Veghte", "Yes. On the Reinsurance side, year-on-year, we had a 2.7 point improvement in the combined ratio if you strip out Cat losses and prior year reserve releases. That delta is entirely driven by the Deepwater loss in the second quarter of last year, which was about 3, 2.7 loss ratio points.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Great. Just a quick follow-up then. If you're seeing -- you say you're seeing better pricing in property Cat. I noticed non-Cat property, mostly on the primary side, premiums were up higher as well there. How should we expect to see that flow through? I realized it's on a written basis, so it's going to earn through. Like, how should we think about that flowing through the income statement in the next couple of quarters as you earn those dollars through?", "James Veghte", "It's hardly precise. But I think broadly, you should assume that the expected margins in the Cat business would be significantly higher than you get in the property non-Cat business.", "David Duclos", "Yes. And from an assurance standpoint, Mike, our -- and a lot of this growth in the second quarter came from North America property, where for the past several years we've been running combines in the low 80s. So it would have a favorable impact in terms of earnings.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jay Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I guess on the Reinsurance side, did any of the growth -- you mentioned growth in Florida in the property Cat side. Did any of that of that come from simply moving down to lower layers and thus having a much bigger rate online? Or were you pretty much even where you were last year relative to the layers that you participated on?", "James Veghte", "A bit of both, Jay. We did write down a little bit lower below the Cat fund, which we historically haven't written a lot of. And in addition, we just increased our limits overall. As Mike mentioned, we were in a very good position relative to our published risk appetite going into the renewal season. We've been holding out power [ph] there, and we saw some great opportunities across the market. So we increased our overall aggregate quite materially.", "Jay Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Got it. And then, I guess, a numbers question. The conversion of the ESUs, I guess, occurs in mid-August. Could you just -- I think I have it right in my model, but can you just remind us how many shares will be added to the share count?", "Michael McGavick", "And I thought there might be some question on ESU, so we brought along our Global Treasurer, Simon?", "Simon Rich", "As you know, the exact number of shares will depend upon the average share price for the period running up to that date. But if it's where the share price is today, we'd expect 30.45 million new shares to be issued on August 15.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matthew Heimermann with JPMC.", "Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Mike or Jamie or Dave or everyone, I guess, just on -- you qualitatively talked about in your opening comments that the model changes were relatively modest. I was curious if you could just put some numbers around what relatively modest is? And then I've got a follow-up.", "Michael McGavick", "This is Mike. I presume you're talking about the RMS model 11 impacts? Yes, Jamie?", "James Veghte", "Well, I think we had anticipated and built in some loadings in the old model particularly for storm surge. We now believe, based on the changes in the new model, that we can reduce our own sort of subjected loads on that. So we're not saying that the impact, overall, in the model change was not material. Certainly, it was. But it may have impacted us less than some others because of some steps we took in adjusting the old version ourselves.", "Michael McGavick", "Yes. And, Matthew, from Insurance standpoint, it'd be the same explanation. We certainly try to load up some of the areas that we knew were deficient with version 10. And I'd also say that from an insurance standpoint, we were quite below our limit. So we've got some room to maneuver.", "Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I guess I was looking for -- that all makes sense. I guess I was looking for maybe if you could quantify what the change would be because I suspect when you next update your PML disclosure, it's likely going to be up, but some of that's probably going to  be the growth you saw in the quarter. So I just was hoping you could give that to us so we could separate one from the other.", "David Duclos", "We haven't finalized all the July 1 renewals. But as you recall, at the end of the first quarter, we reported that our Tier 1 1% OEP was at about 10% of our shareholders equity with our risk appetite of 15%. We believe we'll still have material room above our -- below our risk appetite.", "Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay, so no answer. I'll move on. Just with respect to the Japan renewals, did you have any delay of premium into the third quarter or did all the contracts you we're on get booked in 2Q?", "David Duclos", "We, I believe, had a couple of Cat programs renewed at July 1, so it'll be a Q3 event.", "Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Is that tens of millions? I mean just order of magnitude, is that something that we should think about consciously building in, or is it less material than that?", "David Duclos", "It's less material than that, but I'm not good to be precise about anything relative to the third quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.", "Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG", "This is a question for Jamie. You made a comment about property Cat going from 10% of the portfolio to 20% today. A lot of that shrinkage of the portfolio was following Katrina and had some capital issues associated. I wonder, in terms of thinking about that time line, how much of the size of the property Cat portfolio today is due to your capital adequacy? How much is it due to increasing based on where rates were? Arguably, rates have been attractive almost every year since 2005, so I'm just trying to understand how you're allocating capital to the property Cat model?", "James Veghte", "I think it's as much a reflection of the reduction in our appetite for Casualty business than any of the components of what you've just describe. I think, basically, what we're saying is, we are not at all reluctant to reduce our Casualty writings, and we don't think that the returns are attractive. And Cat, even if we do nothing, is going to become a bigger percentage. So the precise break between rate and aggregate, I don't have with me. But it's as much as a reduction in Casualty as it is in writing additional Cat.", "Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG", "And by portfolio, you're meaning premium volume?", "James Veghte", "Correct.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank", "Most of it asked, but one quick one here. Just looking at the investment affiliate number really, really high this quarter. Anything unusual going on in that number this quarter?", "Michael McGavick", "No. We had at least one of our gang out there really had a terrific quarter. That's essentially the difference. That's always moves around a bit, but we're very pleased to see this kind of performance.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank", "So that number doesn't -- I thought that number kind of tracked to your alternative funds and that's why it just looked kind of unusual how large it was.", "Sarah Street", "Hi, Brian, it's Sarah.  One of our managers starst to hit the high watermark, so the leverage that you get on that in terms of starting towards [ph] performance fees can drive a significant [indiscernible] like that.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ian Gutterman, Adage Capital.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.", "I just want to start with a couple numbers question. Can you tell me what the share count was for earnings -- kind of the number in the press release didn't seem right to me.", "Michael McGavick", "Yes, the number in the press release is right. But it's as if converted, so that's the big difference.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.", "What is it the way you normally show, because I think last quarter it was like $311 million, and you're showing me $342 million in this press release?", "Michael McGavick", "That's the $30 million on the conversion, I believe, being added in, so you would just back that out. The number that Simon gave you earlier.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.", "Got it, okay. Second numbers question, Mike, when you're talking about expenses earlier, I want to make sure we're talking about the same thing. Corporate expenses, your corporate expense line, is that where the increase happened because for all of 2010, that was about $90 million, the corporate expense is $75 million already in the first half. Or were you talking about inside the P&C operations earlier?", "Michael McGavick", "These strategic expenditures, we're keeping at the top of the house, that's why it's in corporate expense line.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.", "Got it, okay. And similarly, the investment income improvement, the sequential improvement, can you talk a little bit more about what drove that? Was there anything onetime? Or is it a good run rate?", "Sarah Street", "No -- yes. This is Sarah again. Mike did mention in his prepared remarks that actually there were a couple of nonrecurring items in there. On the positive side, association [indiscernible] sort of some noise around in expense allocation against net investment income. And then, a tips [ph] adjustment on our investment portfolio on the tips [ph] side, that came through. So in fact, the run rate or the underlying yield is nearer 3% level on a go-forward basis.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.", "And were those one-timers more weighted towards the P&C portfolio or the Life portfolio or a little bit of both?", "Sarah Street", "Mainly P&C.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.", "So is sort of the run rate better than Q1? About the same as Q1? I mean, it that a better way to think about it?", "Sarah Street", "It's about 3 basis points higher on yield.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.", "And do we still that -- given where reinvestment rates are versus maturities, should that be reasonably stable now or do we still have some downside to that?", "Sarah Street", "No. We still have some downside because, obviously, we have bonds that we bought 5 or 6 years ago that are maturing. I reckon based off some analysis that we've done, if rates don't -- if they stay at this current level, it could be about sort of 18 months to 2 years before it completely stabilizes.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.", "Got it. Okay, great. And then, Mike, just my last question, a follow-up, I guess, with Jay's question on the repurchase. I understand how you look at it, and I'm not trying to re-ask that. I guess, I'm just confused on what changed between Investor Day on June 7 and mid-June during the buyback where on Investor Day, it seemed like you weren't ready to repurchase yet.", "Michael McGavick", "Again, we make those judgments really independent of those events. We do it by our own analysis of where we think we are. We had completed our reviews and as soon as we completed that work, we made a decision. And in this case, as you saw, as we've now announced, started repurchasing.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.", "So it was just coincidence on the timing. I guess, I'm surprised you didn't tell us at Investor Day that you might be resuming in the very near future.", "Michael McGavick", "Yes, it really was quite coincidental. We have set Investor Day dates some significant time before, and the processes we were using to evaluate our alternative opportunities just took as long as they took, so that was just a coincidence in the timing.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Arun Kumar with JPMC .", "Arun Kumar - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "This a question on the fixed income side. Given the degree of comfort that you have with your capital position as evidenced via buyback and other items, you do have a contingent capital, now called Stoneheath, which is callable in 2011, I think, in October. I think this question came up in the last call as well from someone else. But could you give us the intentions towards that security. Clearly, a bunch of different perils [ph] that are covered by that. But given your excess capital, your earnings during the first 6 months of this year, what are the intentions towards either keeping that outstanding or converting into preferred of the holding company or some other outcome?", "Michael McGavick", "Yes. We have extended the Reinsurance claim until September 30, 2011. We're still looking at our options with respect to this structure, and don't have an announcement to make now. To try and understand the range of options, I would just refer you back to the original transaction documents.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Just a quick follow-up on the debt side. You have some debt coming due early next year. I thought that you'd mentioned that you were either participating this current year as related offering or that one. I'm just wondering, do you have any thoughts about how about that offering next year?", "Michael McGavick", "I would just give you a general answer on this. Our general intention, as we discussed at Investor Day, is to bring down our absolute leverage ratio and, of course, also, as market conditions allow, to lower our cost of leverage. And we have considered and continued to think through various actions that will help with that. That's why we took the action on this Series Cs that we did during the quarter. That's the context of which we're evaluating the Stoneheath instrument, and we're well aware of that maturity and its particular costs, and how it might fit into that general theme. But we continue to consider the best way to get to the right level of leverage over time if the market would allow a lower cost.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And so that would still be an option currently if you chose to repurchase that as well? Or to restart that?", "Michael McGavick", "Sure, sure.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And I'm showing no further questions. I'll turn the call back over to the speakers for closing comments.", "Michael McGavick", "This is Mike. I just want to thank everybody for being with us this evening. I know it's a busy season, and been a long earnings season. We're very pleased with this quarter. We're pleased with the signs of our strategy coming into place, and we're working hard to advance it further. Thanks again for the time, and I'm sure David and the crew will be available for your further questions.", "Operator", "That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to XL Group plc Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "David R. Radulski", "Thank you, Shirley, and welcome to XL group's fourth quarter 2011 earnings conference call. This call is being simultaneously webcast on XL's website at www.xlgroup.com. We posted to our website several documents, including our quarterly financial supplement. On our call today, Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, will offer opening remarks. Peter Porrino, XL's Chief Financial Officer, will review our financial results; followed by Greg Hendrick, our Chief Executive of Insurance Operations; and Jamie Veghte, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations, who will review their segment results and market conditions. Then we'll open it up for questions. ", "Also in attendance and available for questions are Susan Cross, our Global Chief Actuary; Sarah Street, our Chief Investment Officer; and Stephen Robb, our Controller.", "Before they begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that certain of the matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations.  Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, and therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them.", "Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other documents on file with the SEC, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of which they are made, and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise. With that, I'd turn it over to Mike McGavick.", "Michael S. McGavick", "Thanks, David. As you have seen by reading our release, the fourth quarter of 2011 was highly unusual, and that understanding it requires some explanation, which we will attempt to do thoroughly tonight. At the same time, once we clarify the unusual items, I think you will come to the same  3 conclusions that we do. First, that XL has become an excellent manager of catastrophe risk across the firm. Second, that while there are large blocks of excellent underwriting at XL, we remain plagued by lost activity in a handful of insurance lines that undermine our results. And third and most important, that we have the proper focus on improving or eliminating these sources of poorer results. ", "Now for clarity's sake, this is how the call will go tonight. First, I will walk through the unusual items for the quarter at a high level. Second, I will similarly walk through our underwriting results highlighting the evidence of the 3 points I just made. Then I'm going to turn the call over to our CFO, Pete Porrino, who will walk through these unusual items in deeper detail, as well as updating you on other critical aspects such as investments. After Pete, our newly appointed CEO of Insurance, Greg Hendrick, will provide even more detail on the breadth of correction underwriting actions underway, and give some examples of the early results that would not  yet appear in the financials, but will give you a sense of why we have such confidence. Finally, we will conclude with a very positive report by Jamie Veghte on our Reinsurance operations. Both Jamie and Greg will also give their perspectives on the improving rate environment. Then we will take your questions. ", "So let me begin with some of the unusual items that drove the quarter's results. First, I want to give you the thinking behind the largest item for the financial note, the goodwill charge. Next I want to give you some perspective on expense levels, as you will notice, that expenses ran higher in the fourth quarter. Finally, I need to provide you with some perspective on tax in the quarter and for the year, as without understanding this nuance, one could wrongly conclude that our underwriting was worse that it in fact is. ", "First, about the goodwill charge. As you well know, the P&C insurance sector is continuing to trade at low valuations, and XL is traded at an even greater discount. When these conditions persist long enough, we must closely examine the goodwill we carry, in relation to the purchase of these operations. In our third quarter 10-Q, we described that this examination was intensified. When the fourth quarter showed higher levels of non-cat loss activity, as had the third quarter. We felt that our assessment of how the market would value these operations had to reflect these recent poor results, even if we remain bullish about our potential over time. ", "Pete will give you the greater detail, but this is the basic thinking behind our goodwill write-down of $429 million.  Note that this has no impact on our calculations related to excess capital. Second as to operating expenses. ", "Back in June, we said that we thought the fourth quarter of 2010, would have been a good proxy for the 2011 run rate. And so it proved to be. Our 2011 full-year expenses were, in fact, roughly 4x the expense load in the fourth quarter of 2010. But what does this say about 2012? While we generally stay out of the business of giving guidance, for 2012, we expect to come in at the right around about 100 more  --  $100 million more in expenditure, than our actual full year 2011 level. But we need to emphasize that going forward, there will likely continue to be meaningful volatility from quarter-to-quarter. Technology spending, for example, can be quite lumpy. And new hires can be very hard to predict in terms of quarterly timing. And it is in those less predictable areas, we are exactly where we are making investments. Investing teams who can grow the business in lines where we find current and future returns appealing, upgrading talent where we have found it to be deficient, and building pricing and product modeling and the technology to deliver it while lowering costs. ", "And so on to the third item. Tax. Now this item would not be obvious just from reading the materials you have in front of you. At XL, we typically have an effective global operating tax rate in the mid-teens. And this was true through the first few quarters of 2011. But in the fourth quarter, an unfortunate phenomena took place. Pete will get more granular about this, but it has a simple idea behind it. The heavy losses we experienced, such as the Thailand floods, ultimately were written in low tax jurisdictions. While our positive earnings, such as the reserve releases in our London markets operation, came in a high tax jurisdiction. As a result, the effective tax rates for the year, instead of being in the mid-teens, was in the mid-30s. And in the fourth quarter, this tax item added fully $59 million to our operating loss. This rare phenomenon of tax adding insult to injury has happened at XL before, in cases of high volatility, low earnings quarters like we just experienced. In general, however, and over time, our tax strategies have proven to be very effective. And while we will always work to make sure our global structure is tax efficient, there are no obvious changes suggested by our studies of this fluke pattern. I should add that the move of the holding company last year to Ireland, has nothing to do with this result. ", "With those 3 unusual items discussed, this brings us to Underwriting. The essence of what we think our business is all about. Again here, there are 3 ideas, as I enumerated at the start of the call. First, strong relative performance in the face of incredibly high cat losses around the globe, second, mainly strong underwriting performance in Insurance, undercut by pockets of poor performance; and third, intense corrective actions, well underway in those businesses requiring improvement. ", "So first, with respect to cat losses. In one of the worst years on record for catastrophe losses, including the fourth quarter's devastating Thailand floods, XL's cat loss profile relative to our peers, once again demonstrated the effectiveness of our risk management discipline. Remember that we would expect to be infected in both our Reinsurance and Insurance operations, given our global footprint in each. That said, our total losses across both businesses of $761 million, compares favorably to the global carriers we compete with, especially, we considered as a portion of our shareholders equity. As analysts have independently noted, as compared to 19 other major insurers and reinsurers with whom we compete, our loss as a percentage of shareholders equity was in the best quintile of performance. And looked at another way, while market share is hard to get at, and while our market share varies around the world, given our view of pricing adequacy and our drive to put our capital to work where returns are best, we believe that yet in nearly every case, and certainly overall, our loss compared favorably to our market share. This is an impressive result, and a real improvement, given as history in the first part of the 2000s. ", "As for the second Underwriting point, we note the challenge to businesses at XL represent only about 20% of the 2011 global teams seen net premiums written. Meaning the lion share of our premium comes from key businesses that continue to demonstrate their excellence, covering a wide range of parallels on a global basis. For example, our excellence in Reinsurance method, despite the high level of cash, we showed an Underwriting profit for the year. Professional lines, broadly speaking continued to generate tremendous results, despite downward rate pressures. ", "Our Specialty businesses, mainly known by our businesses at Lloyd's, also had excellent performance. And we remain very pleased with our performance in global casualty, over time. In fact, out of our 25 businesses in Insurance, it is precisely 7 that are challenged. To put it in perspective, without these businesses, our x cat, x PYD combined ratio, would be below 95%. ", "As I said, I will leave it to Greg to provide greater detail on our various Underwriting actions. But I want to emphasize the role of leadership and talent. Talent is at the core of the completion in the complex risk Underwriting businesses, of which XL is comprised. And while there's a lot of excitement and commentary about our entry into a few new lines of similar business, the far bigger story is the broader upgrade of talent at XL. Of the 96 underwriters we hired at XL in 2011, only 18 were tied to the noted new activities. The balance was hired to add to or to upgrade the Underwriting talent in existing lines of business. In fact, all 7 of these challenges businesses, not only went through an in-depth review of all aspects of their operation in 2011, but we changed the leadership and the top underwriters in 5 of the 7 businesses. The new leadership and the action of all these businesses are undertaking under the new plans, are monitored intensely at all levels of XL. ", "Now, with all of that said, you will logically ask, as you have in the past, when can we expect to see the benefits of these actions? Well, like you, we think we're experts at these lines of business, and we know that it takes real-time for the results to show up on the bottom line. And the speed of impact depends on the lost profiles of the businesses being acted upon. This is especially true at a firm like ours with a strong and continuing track record of prudent reserving. But I can say this, the actions are happening at the urgent pace we have set out for it, the precursor indicators of progress are also showing up as expected, and we expect these actions will show up to an increasing degree on the bottom line, throughout 2012. ", "So before turning it over to Pete, I would say that in some, while we are frustrated, as we are sure investors are, with the time it takes for an Insurance book to respond to medicine, we are unwavering in our faith that the right actions have been and are being taken, and we are intensely resolved to make all of XL, and not just most of it, match our historical underwriting prowess. Pete?", "Peter R. Porrino", "Thanks, Mike, and good evening. I'll be covering 3 items in more detail. First, I'll discuss the quarterly year's results, including discussions on goodwill and taxes. Second, I'll provide you with an update on our investment activity, including our exposure to Continental Europe, and third, I will address on capital market activities. ", "The fourth quarter and full year 2011 results were significantly impacted by severe natural catastrophes, resulting in an operating net loss for the quarter of $80 million compared to operating income of $242 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. For the full year, we reported an operating profit of $89 million compared to $810 million in 2010. Cat losses, net of Reinsurance and reinstatement premiums in the fourth quarter were $195 million, which is at the midpoint of our preliminary cat loss estimate range, included in our January '11 press release. And that compares to $30 million in the prior year. For the full year, cat losses were $761 million compared to $294 million in 2010. ", "Our net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders was $516 million for the fourth quarter, and $475 million for the full year. The net losses were driven by a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $429 million. Now this impairment of goodwill represents all of the goodwill included in our Insurance segment. This was due to a combination of persistent low market valuations for XL and in the Insurance industry generally, and the continuing underperformance in that segment. This underperformance impacts the assumptions used in goodwill valuation tests, such as market multiples and select discount rate and related risk premium, a third-party might demand. Consistent with Mike's comments, we did not fundamentally change the assumptions about the future profitability of this business. ", "Turning to our summary financial results on Slide 3, you'll see that the P&C gross premiums written were down 3.5% versus the fourth quarter of 2010, with a 4.4% decrease, and 7.9% increase in the Insurance and Reinsurance segments, respectively. The Insurance segment decrease was driven by a prior year quarter multiyear Insurance agreement, excluding this agreement, there was a 5% increase in 2010. Greg and Jamie will highlight the sources of growth in their comments. Our P&C combined ratio for the quarter was 108.2% or 16 points -- 16.8 points higher than the same quarter last year. As detailed on Slide 4, cat losses in the quarter accounted for 14.2 lost ratio points, 11.8 points higher than the same quarter last year. ", "Prior year development in the quarter was a favorable $68 million or 4.9 loss ratio points. This reflects favorable development of $28 million and $40 million in the Insurance and Reinsurance segments respectively, from our fourth quarter detailed ground-up reserve review. Positive movements came from Specialty and Professional  Insurance lines, as well as longer tail U.S. and European Reinsurance lines. Although these releases are down from the prior year quarter, our actual gross is expected loss experience continues to trend favorably x PYD and cat or combined ratio increased by 0.5 points. ", "In the quarter and for the full year, our operating tax expense was clearly out of line with operating income. In the quarter, we added $21 million pretax operating loss, and $59 of tax expense. As Mike stated, our losses ended up largely in low tax jurisdictions, while our income was seen in the higher tax jurisdictions. The distribution of cat losses was a function  both of where the policies were written, and also our internal Reinsurance arrangements, including certain stop-loss agreements. In addition, positive prior-year reserve releases, which are net above positive and negative results for different lines of business, were most significant in our legal entity with the highest overall tax rate. ", "Other items contributed, such as the tax treatment of unrealized investment gains in certain jurisdictions, but generally, the result reflects the unusual distribution of profits and losses around our global organization this quarter.  At $192 million, net investment income under P&C portfolio in the fourth quarter was 9% below the prior year, due primarily, to new money rates and cash outflows from the investment portfolio. The average new money rate on our P&C portfolio in the quarter was 2.5%. The P&C gross book yield at the end of the quarter was 3.2%. From the P&C duration remains unchanged at 2.8 years. ", "Our net loss from investment affiliate was $24 million, down $70 million from the prior year. Now it's important to remember that we record our affiliate earnings on a lag of between 1 and 3 months. As we discussed in our third quarter call, our private equity and investment management business portfolios state difficult Q3 market conditions. Realized losses were $50 million compared to $104 million in the prior year quarter. Of this total $29 million related to OTTI charges, which were primarily due to foreign exchange items and from non-agency RMBS assets. The total mark-to-market was $130 million positive, with the impact of lower rates being somewhat offset by widening credit spreads, primarily on European investment grade corporate credit. ", "While we've mentioned our reductions to European investments on previous calls, we think it is worth repeating, given the continued turmoil in Europe. Our peripheral government exposure is immaterial at $27 million. In addition to avoiding direct peripheral sovereign risk, we have also eliminated all peripheral hybrid financial exposure. Within core Europe, we have been concerned about the indirect effects of the European crisis on the banking system, particularly on the risks exposed to hybrid securities, given the amount of recapitalization required of certain of these banks. ", "Over the past several years, we have successfully reduced exposure, to a point where it is very manageable. Our Continental European hybrid exposure was $102 million at year end, with only $73 million to banks, largely national champions in Northern Europe. Even including subordinated bank debt, the exposure's only $133 million. In fact, including senior debt and other financials, our total Continental Europe financials holdings are $870 million, which is down $350 million from December 31, 2010. Just as importantly, these bonds have an unrealized loss of just $28 million. At less than 3% of our 15 comp portfolio, we have significantly reduced our investment risk to a Eurozone meltdown. ", "Now to our capital management. We purchased and canceled $4.9 million ordinary shares, at an average cost of $20.21 for $100 million in the fourth quarter, and $31.7 million ordinary shares at an average price of $21.03, for a total of $665 million in 2011. This leaves $190.5 million available for purchase under our $1 billion share buyback program. In October, we announced the termination of the Stoneheath 3 facility, and the resulting issuance of $350 million of series D preference ordinary shares, at 312 basis points over LIBOR, a very attractive rate in today's market. ", "And in 2012, we repaid, at maturity, the $600 million, 6.5% guaranteed senior notes. All of our actions were designed to maintain a capital structure that balances the ability to build shareholder value, whether it's redeploying more resources behind a considerable underwriting talent we've been building, or taking advantage of attractive share repurchase opportunities or other means of returning shareholder capital. ", "Since August 2010, XL has repurchased 57.3 million shares, or approximately 17% of the outstanding shares at that time. We reconsidered the amount we repurchased in Q4 2011, as more indicative going forward than the earlier part of the year. Of course, this will be tampered by significant catastrophe -- large loss activity, or a specific opportunity to put our capital to work. ", "Now before I hand it over to Greg, I'll make some comments on the Costa Concordia  situation. We expressed our sympathy to the loved ones of those who lost their lives in this tragic accident. The loss is in early stages and investigations continue, particularly as to the ultimate size of the loss. XL has exposure in both the Insurance and Reinsurance segments. Our exposure is significantly reinsured, which we expect will contain our net loss. Based on our exposure for Insurance and Reinsurance, net of Reinsurance protections and inwards and outwards reinstatement premiums, we estimate our losses in this $40 million to $50 million range. Greg?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Thanks, Pete. I'll focus on 3 topics tonight. First, our results for the segment; second, some of the actions we are taking to improve these results; and third, a brief comment on the current rate trends. ", "First, the results. As Pete mentioned, we normalized for one-off multiyear deal written in Q4 2010, Insurance gross premiums written grew by 5% in the quarter. ", "The majority of this growth is due to a new premium from targeted initiatives. In particular, our North American construction programs in international professional businesses, each had a significant new premium. Net premiums earned were up $59 million or 6.6% reflecting the year-end grew of higher gross premiums written. The Insurance segments combined ratio for the quarter of 116.2% was 15.2 points higher, versus the same quarter last year. Current year debt loss is accounted for $133 million or 12.2 points of the increase. While Thailand  floods accounted for $102 million, we also had $26 million development  in the quarter from events occurring in the first 3 quarters of 2011. ", "Lower prior year of favorable development accounted for 4.5 points of the increase, as we released $28 million in Q4, compared to $66 million in Q4 last year. While the reserve releases in many lines were offset by strengthened reserves in E&S risk management and 2 of our professional businesses. An increase in the expected account were 1.4 points of the increase -- attributable to primarily the foreign exchange rates, and higher compensation cost, as we continue to add underwriters, and make changes in business leadership. ", "The deterioration that I've mentioned was slightly offset by lower current accident year loss experience, which contributed 3.8 points of improvement, primarily due to lower large losses compared to the fourth quarter last year. However, the current accident  loss ratio of nearly 72%, adjusted for prior year development in cats, is unacceptably high.  Let me be clear, we view this segment result as a whole, unacceptable. There are numerous bright spots, and there are business that is challenge. So I want to walk you through some of the actions we are taking to improve results. ", "First, it's important to step back to what we told you at our Investor Day, that we have changed the way we think about managing XL. We used to be a handful of global product lines for sign of goals. We now consider each business a core unit of accountability, but with aligned goals and strategies. This is the portfolio of business that I know well. ", "In past year, we've examined every pocket of performance, both positive and negative, that would have previously stayed hidden. In businesses that we view as challenged, we have added new leadership and experienced team, and we have re-underwritten strategies. Particularly, this has meant empowering these leaders to re-underwrite the sectors of their books that are underperforming. This takes some time, but we feel it will yield the right results. ", "In many other areas, we found opportunities to be even better at the things we're already doing well. So it's some specifics. With new leadership in both the North American and international property businesses, we've reviewed our approach to cat underwriting. While we have outperformed relative to the industry in almost all events, we can still improve our catastrophe performance, and cat is an area I know very well. For example, we've looked closely at our approach to flood underwriting, and decided to  dramatically reduce limited authorities for our property underwriters. In our International business, we restricted cat authority, and we've seen our exposures reduce at a faster rate than our premium base, as the book renews.", "Learning from our improvement in track record in reinsurance, we integrated the latest industry cat models to support pricing and underwriting decisions in this portfolio as well. We also have a new approach for our property Reinsurance treaties, which we knew at May 1. By considering capacity from a variety of capital sources, we will optimize our seat of reinsurance coverage and cost. ", "With new leadership in our risk management business, we're taking action to deemphasize the guaranteed cost workers comps in this portfolio, and it's lagged the rest of the book by 10 loss ratio points. We know there are real opportunities in workers comp, and we've added new volumes in our North American and construction business. With our focus on very large contractors, most of whom, have outstanding risk management practices, we are selectively underwriting a book that should outperform the general workers comp industry. ", "To further enhance our results, we're planning a new underwriting workstation, greatly improving our operational efficiencies, pricing data and analytics. Other challenges, we are confronting by shifting our mix of business, and I'll give you examples from E&S and professional. In our E&S business, again an area where we have added new leadership, we know one of the sectors of underperformance is the New York Contractors General Liability Line, specifically subcontractor risk. ", "We are re-underwriting this book and shifting our exposure to general contractors. We also know our book about partner risk to experience a 20-point higher loss ratio than the rest of our general liability portfolio. We have decided to renew just a handful of our best risks in this class. ", "Since early 2011, 2 of our professional businesses started shifting their portfolios towards smaller customers, and optimizing a geographic mix. We're already seeing signs of improvement, we've reported claim counts down 30% year-over-year. ", "We're made more confident, given our lengthy history in some of these classes, and accumulation of data, which we are minding, to yield a strong competitive advantage. Our strategic analytics team is currently working with our underwriters to take advantage of this opportunity. ", "Another illustration of our re-underwriting is the private D&O portfolio, which peaked at $75 million of premium in 2008. As we experienced the turn of results, we decided to completely revamp the business, and it's now just $10 million of premium in 2011. With new leaders and redefined strategies to improve existing businesses, we're also enhancing our profitability for strategic growth opportunities. ", "In 2011, this meant the addition of Inland Marine, Political Risk and Surety teams, the latter 2 of which, we view as having true global potential. These businesses will add -- will aid our delivery of expansion into areas of opportunities, in particular, our new offices in China and Brazil. ", "Finally, a word on market conditions. We have seen positive rate trends across most of our businesses. We achieved our third consecutive quarter of positive pricing in North America and P&C businesses. Specialty pricing was also positive in the quarter and for the year. And we continue to see material improvement in our U.S. D&O book, as rate decreases continue to slow in Q4, and early 2012 renewals are yielding rate increases. ", "We believe that the positive pricing momentum we see is real and sustainable, and will continue on 2012. While we are taking corrective actions in the quarter of our Insurance businesses, we are very well prepared to take advantage of, and a deep push for, increasing rates in the remaining 3 quarters of our book. ", "And now to Jamie to discuss Reinsurance results.", "James Veghte", "Thanks, Greg, and good evening. I'd like to cover 2 principal issues tonight, a review of our fourth quarter and full year results, and also, some comments on a very successful renewal season, market conditions and how we view our position in an improving environment. This segment has a solid result in the quarter, despite the onslaught of significant industry cat losses we experienced throughout the year. In this instance, Thailand flooding. Our combined ratio was 90.8% for the quarter, and included the benefit of prior year releases of $40 million. This compares to a combined of 69.8% in the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding the benefit of prior-year releases, we had a combined ratio of 100%, which compares to 84.1% in 2010. ", "The performance in the fourth quarter was substantially impacted by catastrophe losses of $62 million, including $56 million from the flooding in Thailand. Excluding the impact of both cat losses and prior year releases, the segment had a combined ratio of 85.6%, which compares to 80.2% in the fourth quarter of 2010. This 5-point delta from last year was driven by a number of issues, including 2 fire losses from our U.S. operations, a deterioration of performance of our U.S. crop portfolio, and a co-mutation in the fourth quarter of 2010 that was nonrecurring. ", "For the full year, XL Re had a combined ratio of 97.8%, which compared to the 80.1% combined in 2010. Our year was heavily impacted by cat losses of $406 million, an increase of just under $250 million from what we experienced in 2010. Excluding the impact of both Cat losses in prior year releases, we had a combined ratio of 85.7%, virtually identical to the 85.9 in 2010. Frankly, we are gratified to produce an Underwriting profit in a year when industry global cat losses were north of $100 billion.  I think this speaks to the experience and discipline of our Underwriting teams, and the prudent reserve position of our business. ", "Turning to top line. Gross written premiums in the quarter were $105 million, which compares to the 97.5 written in the fourth quarter of 2010, an 8% increase. This increase was driven largely by the reinstatement premiums, emanating from the Thailand flood loss. For the full year, gross written premiums were $2.1 billion, a 12.5% increase from 2010. This increase was due to new business and increased share in both XL Re Europe and XL Re America, increased reinstatement premiums, and an increase in our U.S. crop ratings. ", "Turning to market conditions, our year-end renewal went largely as we expected. For U.S. cap business, non-loss impacted programs saw rate increases in the 7.5% to 12.5 range, while loss impacted placements saw increase from 15%, to as much as 40%. Loss impacted international business, paid an increase of 30% to 70%. In the U.K. and Continental Europe, we saw fairly modest single-digit risk adjusted increases, a bit below what we expected going into renewals. ", "Capacity was readily available, although we would say customers that tried to undercut the lead price indication, struggled to get things home. We saw a fair amount of business get repriced and increased during the last couple of days of the season. In addition, both aggregate and worldwide type placements struggled to get done. While there were a couple of headline accounts that bought less capacity than they did in 2010, overall, we saw a fairly healthy demand profile from the market. It's our estimation that north of $1 billion of additional U.S. wind exposed cat cover was bought at year end. Broadly, we were pleased with the renewal of our cat portfolio. ", "Turning to Casualty. The U.S. market was competitive at January 1. Reinsurers were generally quite determined to retain their renewal accounts, and most tried to increase their lines with limited success. There were some increase in ceding [ph] company retention levels, particularly, on business that performed well over time. As Greg mentioned, relative to original pricing, we are beginning to see positive movement in the primary market, with the exception of sectors of the professional lines market. ", "For international casualty, rate levels remained broadly flat, with those seeing some willing to accept increases, often taking additional retention. We do continue to see improvements in the U.K. motor market, particularly on accessible loss pricing. ", "With respect to the Specialty areas of the market. January 1 is a fairly light renewal for aviation, and the marine market had a very late renewal season, with significant improvement in the energy sector, from those programs impacted by Griffin and Deepwater. ", "Overall, we are pleased with our book of business and our market position going into 2012. We've had 6 consecutive years of attractive Underwriting results, a very experienced team, deep relationships across the market, and we are ready to leverage all of these assets into continued success as we go forward. ", "With that, I'll turn it back to David for Q&A.", "David R. Radulski", "Shirley, please open the lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Keith Walsh with Citi.", "Unknown Analyst", "I guess my first question for you, I appreciate the extra detail around the weaker lines of coverage. But just a couple of questions around that, what percent of total premiums do those 7 lines represent? And how much allocated capital is behind that? And what accident years are really showing the weakness? And then I've got one for Peter.", "Michael S. McGavick", "Yes, the capital allocation, we'll have to get back to you  to get precise. I don't have it broken out that way, but it's about 20% of the net written premium, 1/5.", "Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Any years in particular that are showing strain?", "Michael S. McGavick", "It would really depend by line of business. Some of them have deteriorated as rates have come off over time and kind of revealed themselves to be under performers. Others have been -- there might have been a year or an event over the years that has given a rise to this. But generally speaking, these are books of business where we, ourselves, when we started breaking the business into separate business lines, rather than this kind of global view of Casualty and Property, that's when we got intense about these particular businesses, as ones that we had a real opportunity to upgrade the performance.", "Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then for Peter, just on the rate of repurchase, I think you mentioned $100 million a quarter. And I would guess, you guys have significant excess capital writing $5.5 billion of premium on a $10 billion balance sheet. Why not a much higher run rate here?", "Peter R. Porrino", "Well, a couple of things, I'd say. One is, we do see some opportunities in the marketplace, and we were certainly investing, as Mike said, in talent. We do believe that we are at the beginning stages of a hardening market. And we also noticed, I mean, catastrophes this quarter was a difficult quarter for the industry and for us. And so to come out and signal, I would say, increased buyback activity would probably not be correct. And then the other thing is, throughout 20 -- the end of 2010 and 2011, I'd say there was a little bit of a catch up in lack of buybacks in the prior periods. Mike, you have...", "Michael S. McGavick", "No, I just. At the same -- I think your question is a very good one. And the only thing I'd add to what Peter said, is you've heard me walk through the 3-part analysis before, what percentage buffer do we want to hold to our rating agency capital in order to make sure that we do not ever put it at risk to the best of our ability. Second, once we'd determined that, then we understand what this truly excess, and then, we're always judging, where can we put it to work to make the franchise better, and if we can't, how do we get back to shareholders the efficient way. That thought process hasn\u2019t changed in the time I've been here. Right now, you have 2 things kind of going in opposite directions and we're always analyzing across both. One thing, you have an improving rate environment, as Pete mentioned, which can give us some opportunities for profitable growth. You have seen us invest in new teams and some new opportunities because of that. But at the same time, trading where we're trading, it's hard to ignore, the economics of share repurchase. So they kind of move in competition with each other, and we're always analyzing across those 2. So that's why we want to be cautious and at the same time, it's been a volatile time for the industry and I think all of us having seen 2011 in the rearview mirror, we'd like to see that calm down.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "First, a quick numbers question. With the change in debt accounting, coming on January 1, will there be any write down of the book value on that, or impact to earnings in 2012?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Our estimate is that it will be a small number in the 10s of millions of dollars, that will be disclosed in the 10-K.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "In terms of the impact of book value?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Yes.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. Any impact on 2012 earnings?", "Peter R. Porrino", "No, at least nothing at all material.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then more broadly, if I look at the Insurance segment, even excluding net prior year development, cats and reinstatement premiums, the underlying combined ratio, is it 104 of the full year 2011, up from 101 in 2010? And Mike, I know you don\u2019t like giving guidance, but what do you -- what type of improvement you think you can drive through the results in 2012?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Jay, your first part of your question -- your first part of your comment was the governing one. We don't give guidance. We believe the business is too volatile for that, it just has a general observation about the sector. But I've tried to be as clear as I can, and maybe I could step back and make it a little broader to at least, be as helpful as I can be. You know very well, and all the people on this call being Insurance experts, you know, that the reality of any one period's underwritings, are mainly the product of underwritings from a year and more ago, and decreasingly, the product of more recent underwriting activity. So you're always getting a pretty nice lag, just by the nature of the business, from the underwriters action to the result. What we can tell you and what we have told you going back to our investor call, was that because of our new way of looking at it, with  greater insight, greater accountability, we had identified some areas that really needed improvement and we're un-implementing significant change. And you've seen announcement after announcement that really can be tied to that observation. While it's a short-tail line, as soon as you implement a new approach in underwriting, you get the effect, roughly a year after the underwriting action takes place or it can be sooner if you're not underwriting something again, if you're not renewing, you can get an immediate impact, if you're writing your nonrenewal actions. But of course your opportunity for nonrenewal takes place for the following year after you make the decision, because our policies don't all incept, in common at one particular day. We certainly get, in some books, more bang for the buck at the 1-1 renewal point. And at least, some of our actions this past year would have taken place at that time. So you really kind of have to get extremely granular, line by line, action by action and pattern of renewal by pattern of renewal, or pattern of new inception by pattern of new inception, before you can start adding up when exactly an action might take place. And that's why because of the complexity of all that, and bluntly, the fortuity as well, on what we would say is more and more over the course of '12, and certainly, much more impact than we saw in '11, you will see the book remixing to these new underwriting actions, and that should of course, in turn, see the actions take hold in the bottom line. What we do plan to do over the course of the year as we're able to do so, is to give you updates on evidence that we're seeing, that may not be ready to translate into the bottom line. We will not change our very prudent approach to reserving. I know there's a lot of -- kind of commentary that goes on about the industry and the various phases of how people behave during different cycles, during periods of the Underwriting cycle, but in our reserving, we just remain consistent throughout. I would say that actually sets us apart relative to the industry from all the numbers I'm seeing, at least generally. And in fact, I think when you look at the global triangles for this year, for example, you're going to see -- we think, and I think you will judge too, and independently, we're seeing judge that our margins are actually increasing somewhat in terms of reserve redundancy, that is not generally true about the sector. So as I look at it, when you take all of that together, the fact that we're not going to overreact quickly, we're going to want -- we're going have  a 'prove it to us' actuarial attitude, and because these actions took place in different pockets over different time periods over the last year, it will work its way into the book, increasingly through each quarter, you should see more influence from these underwriting actions.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Makes sense. Sorry for follow up, but are you also implying that we should expect to see premium volume in the insurance segment to be lower in 2012 than it is in 2011?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Well, I'm going to ask Greg to jump in here too because Greg is the one, I just want to emphasize the point that was made earlier, that I think is really important for the market to understand. While Greg started his job leading insurance on January 1, Greg led our strategic review in 2010 that led us to the changes we made and how we lead the business, and throughout '11, was leading various of the most urgent of our process for reviewing those lines that we found had challenges, along with Jamie Veghte, and a team of our best underwriters. So Greg's starting point had a big run rate to it and the lot of knowledge added to it. So, yes, where we saw business that was underperforming, you should expect to see that there'll be jamming rate through it, changing underwrite terms and conditions, changing our limit strategy and changing our reinsurance strategy, or in some cases, simply nonrenewal. And those will take place over those impacts will take place over time. In those places, you'll see shrinkage, but we also have pockets, but we assure you, we didn't think we were using all of our capacity. And where we'll see growth. And I'll ask Greg to comment a little bit on some of those lines where we saw opportunities for growth, and some of the lines where we actually jumped into the line because we see the conditions as so enticing. ", "Yes, when I touched on some of them, in my comments. Jerry, but generally, we're looking at -- ones I didn't touch on in particular, our North American property business with Joe Tucker as the new leader, is showing a strong growth of our construction business. I did mention, we also didn't touch upon it, but we're adding new programs as we've re-underwritten, it's one of the areas that we've been focused on, a new leader there as well, and Pete Purpose [ph], and he is quickly refocusing the book and adding new programs, in fact, you will see in the press release, in the last couple of days of our latest program there.", "Unknown Executive", "There is one new line I would add to my comment, one particular book, the international property book, we're in the last chunk of what we had told you in previous calls are the end of LTAs. And so that book will roll off in 2012, and we'll get a good crack at 1 1 13 for that last big chunk of business, so you'll see some activity there. It's important to point out again, that's 25% of the insurance business that we're talking about, and we are doing some strong growth initiatives in the other 75% of the business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan.", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I guess, I wanted to just touch on the incremental $100 million of expenses you're talking about next year. Guess a little surprised by the magnitude of that. But was, rather than talking about what the number is, I was hoping you could help us put in perspective, how you're thinking about the payback on that investment, and what metrics we should be thinking about over what time frame we should be thinking about to kind of judge how well spent that money is?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Yes, we generally don't think of things over much longer than a several year horizon when we do payback analysis, because I just don't trust numbers and get out longer than that. So that's how we think about it, we wouldn't have, none of these investments will be made if we didn't think they would generate an adequate return within 3 years. So that's a general rule of thumb. Now when you're investing in businesses, they can make their returns at different paces over time. For example, some businesses, with relatively low infrastructure cost, let's say Surety, you could -- depending on what happens in the marketplace, you can have that business grow relatively quickly at relatively low cost, and get to payback relatively quickly. On other businesses that are a little more infrastructure intense, say Inland Marine, would come to mind, I would expect the payback on those investments to take longer to realize. But in no case, would we jump into something where we didn't think over 3 years, we'd be getting to a meaningful return on investment. On the technology side and on the Underwriting Analytics side -- Underwriting analytics, I expect to have fairly rapid payoff, if you think about it because when we make an investment in the new model, and that model gets implemented, the only constraint to the speed of the benefit, is the same factors I described a moment ago, when you're dealing with Underwriting decisions. That is how quickly can you get the book through the new decisions that you've made. And then finally on the broader Underwriting and the technology infrastructure paybacks, those are always the hardest to get to, because the reality is, they tend to be softer numbers that really have benefited, may show up in the expense ratio over time. But we do know that even our growth is enabled by these platform investments. So we couldn't be adding some of the premiums as was described when you take out the one special items of note, it was a 5% growth of Insurance in the last year, we couldn't be doing that without some of these technology investments. So while it's a little softer, we would have the same rigor over return periods that we would expect.", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And can you -- well, I guess, as I listened to your answer, kind of the way that it works in my mind is, you've got a certain percentage that's really about investing in people and presence, and that will get paid back, in terms of -- you get production, and ultimately, profits on it. Part of it, on the model side, feels to me like, it's not so much -- it enables you to accomplish a lot of things, but it's more about maybe avoiding losses, then it is necessarily and helping volatility than it is necessarily about an absolute dollar. And the last one, just kind of feels like some business cost  to some extent. So -- but I'm just -- I position it that way, because I'd be curious if you give a sense of whether or not, how much of its people versus the other 2, because I guess, from a people standpoint, would've been unfair to expect that over the next 3 years, you'd recoup that expense, plus some margin on top of it.", "Michael S. McGavick", "All right. First of all, I think the way that you've thought about it is correct. In terms of additional expense, we're talking really about the $100 million in run rate increase, as opposed to the ordinary cost of the business, which we're always trying to grind down. As I think about it, I think the right answer, we'll get you some confirmation, is about 1/3 of this is specifically related to people that we're adding, where you get the return in the profile you described. And about 2/3 of it is related to technology and infrastructure costs, which we would expect to show up in allowing for growth or in some cases, and the reason you were right to split into 3 buckets and not 2, when you get into those analytics, and that's -- we're really investing in what we believe will show up as a lower loss ratio. And for us, I know this will sound trite, but I mean it, for the way, for the businesses we're in, and the way we think about the business, it is the loss ratio stupid. I mean that's how we think about the business, where we make investments, we're trying to drive insight to give us a loss ratio advantage over our competitors, over time.", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "That's helpful. And then just with respect, just following up on the buyback. I mean, it's part of the issue here when we think externally about your capital. Is that some of the new growth initiatives you have are basically in areas where you're not warehousing a lot of capital. So to some extent, until those get high, the capital efficiency is low.", "Michael S. McGavick", "Our smaller lines of business don't line up at the beginning, especially given diversification benefits, consuming that much of our capital model. So I don't think that would be a fair way to think about it. If I was going to speculate that there is any particular miss anywhere in the analytical cycle, between how we think about it and how you all think about it, the only place I would speculate, is that it is the way that we, versus the way which you think about the buffer, to rating agency capital. If I was going to guess, I would think that might be the biggest mismatch. But by either how I've seen you analyze it or how I see us analyze it, we don't dispute that there's excess capital. It's just a matter how we're thinking about acting on that, and our degree of comfort given current market conditions and opportunities. But if I was going to speculate about the difference, that's probably where that difference is, and I think a lot of that, where we might be able to do the difference, could really not only relate to how the market works today, but how the market works in the future. Because we are preparing steadily for the impact on our legal entities, as correlated to solvency to and other future regulatory impositions.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I guess, I'm trying to understand here, you're thinking about investing for growth and we're sitting here in mid-single, at least my estimates, kind of mid-single-digit ROEs next year, talking about spending a little bit more on expense, maybe $100 million for compensation, as opposed to maybe buying back stock. And what that difference means from an ROE and book value perspective, what do you look at to make sure that maybe it's not too early to invest for growth right now? And just one follow-up. Thanks.", "Michael S. McGavick", "I appreciate the question. And I do really appreciate the spirit of the questions, because they relate to the trade-offs that are very difficult trade-offs to judge. So we'd rather salute [ph]to the ground just as you do on our behalf in analyzing us. But again, when we can remix this book of business to more profitable line, we can create returns that are not only more attractive in the short-term, but very much more attractive in the long-term for the franchise. And that is our ultimate mission. Second, as we are able to attract this better talent, it's not the case, and this we talked about last quarter, it's not the case that you just get expense out of that and no other benefit. You can get very quickly to lower loss ratios, which are very attractive for our investors or you can grow in a space of business, where you're already getting attractive returns, and thereby, be affecting the remix of the business towards more profitable activity that shareholders will most appreciate over time. And so, when we think about it, that's why I emphasized the idea that only 18 of the underwriters, 96 of them, only 18 of them were tied to these  new businesses last year. Because the new business thing has the lag effects that we've talked about. But the other ones, are immediately put to work on blocks of business that are already in the house, and if they give us headaches, they give you headaches, and if they give us profitable for growth, they can remix this book faster toward more profit. So I view that as very common-sense activity, because to not do that, is to literally continue to produce these kinds of anemic returns, and then, just be kind of worst off over time. The other point I would make is, we can only be in the market timing game to a point. Because in the end, if you dive in after the turn, and everybody knows the turn, you're not ready and you're not going to be active present in the market to benefit from what comes. We want to be present. We want to be active. We want to have the capital capacity, we want to have the cap capacity, and we want to have the talent to take advantage of what comes next. Because while it isn't a hard market, it is sure changing. And in some lines more than others, and we can take advantage of that phenomena to remix the book of business. So I say all of that, and then I'll still say what you know, when we're trading like this, the economics of share repurchase are compelling, we know that, and we're very aware of that as we make this trade-offs.", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I mean I understand, I guess if you're talking about 80% of your business running at a 95 combined in Insurance, I mean that -- just the delta there is significant to earnings, and you add to -- and then don't add the additional expense from hiring, and now you have more capital to deploy. I just wonder, does it make sense to think about fixing, showing some ROE trajectory, and then growing? And I understand your point about missing a turn, but I just wonder if that -- this puts us in a mezzanine phase for maybe another 12 to 24 months.", "Michael S. McGavick", "Well again, again a thoughtful question. I would emphasize again, that the remixing didn't start today on this call. It started over the course of last year, which is why I believe that the benefits from this remixing will start to take increasing effect on the book through 2012 and beyond. I think that's a very important notion. So if we were at a standing start today, I'm talking about actions, the equation might be different, we're not. And we're very, we remained resolved to see these plans that we put in place come through. So I think that's part of the difference here. The second thing is, you can -- it is always possible to create short-term benefit by discontinuing a challenged activity or just grinding expenses down as low as you can. You could create some short-term lift out of that, but you're not building a business that's going to be great over time. You're just giving a short term kick to it. And that's not just what we're trying to do. We don't think that's what you want us to do either. So it is always a complex equation, but I do think that on balance we have this equation right and have had through the year.", "Peter R. Porrino", "This is Pete Porrino. Keith, just to get back to you on your question about the capital on those 7 businesses. So as Mike said, it's just over 20% of premium. It's quite a bit less than that on capital, it's in the 12% to 14% range.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I forget who mentioned it, but there was some commentary around, there were certain lines in the Insurance business, where you saw some adverse development in the quarter. And I'm wondering if you could talk more about that and why you're comfortable that, that won't continue, that's question number one.", "Michael S. McGavick", "Sure. And we have, as David mentioned, we have Susan Cross, our Chief Reserving Actuary here with us, so she can get very precise about that. Susan?", "Susan L. Cross", "Yes, sure. So within the insurance segment, we did have net favorable prior development of $28 million in the quarter. And that comprised of $38 million favorable in Specialty, $15 million favorable in professional, $23 million unfavorable in Casualty, and $2 million unfavorable in property. So we had very favorable experience across most Specialty lines, and strong favorable in the core professional lines. Areas of strengthening, include the design and select professional books, and that was about $40 million of strengthening. We had strengthening in North Americas E&S, programs and U.S. risk management businesses of about $20 million. And that's related to the guaranteed workers comp and New York contractors, general liability exposures that Greg mentioned in his remarks. And finally, we had strengthening of about $18 million in excess casualty, related to some large energy claims in the 2010 accident year. So overall, we had very favorable in the quarter, and for the full year. Yet, we are strengthening where we need to ensure that strong balance sheet and foundation for the future. I'll also point out that we continue to experience favorable actual loss immergence, relative to effective levels across most of our businesses, especially, in primary casualty, professional and U.S. Casualty Reinsurance. And that gives us confidence in our overall reserve position, yet we're giving this time, to more fully develop before recognizing it, either in our prior-year development, or in our current year loss ratio picks. So that where we had that strengthening, is very specific portfolios, portfolios where we're taking underwriting actions, and we're confident overall.", "Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just quickly. I'm sorry, go ahead.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "I just want to jump in, it's Greg. Sorry, Jay. Let me just -- on 2 of them in particular, let me just follow on what Susan just said. In the design and select, and in particular, the professionals. 2 strong leaders that have been with us for a while, these activities just started either late in '10 or early in '11, design, while we're disappointed with the development, it's still on an on level and adjusted basis, is a profitable book of business for us over the last 10 years. And we're putting some things in place to make sure that continues into the future, we're very convinced with the future of that book.  Select is also refocusing on some smaller customers, and some of the better states, and they're well underway to improve it, and I'll touch on my comments there, where we're seeing already claim counts reducing. So not all this reserved development, if necessary, I mean, these businesses are not going to be future profitable for us in the future, but we are taking it seriously, and making sure we stay vigilant about the performance on each of these books.", "Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And just quickly, and I'll follow up on that. The stabs that you took at both design and select and North American  E&S, when you lasted a deeper dive, I guess this would have been in the second quarter into your reserves, were those running a temperature at that point? Is this something new, were there reserved increases bigger than you've done in the past?", "Susan L. Cross", "In our second quarter review, a couple of these areas, we did have some adverse developments, specifically in the E&S and in the select professional portfolio. So it's not across all the portfolios. So we had seen some signs of it earlier in the year. But I would say this might too, was a little bit more than what we've seen earlier in the year.", "Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then just quick numbers question.", "Michael S. McGavick", "I'm sorry, Jay. I would also add one other thought to that. The emergence of this development wasn't our first clue that these businesses needed attention. When we started -- and this is just such an important plan, I want to emphasize it again. The decision to move away from these very large global lines of business approach where everything got lumped together, really obscured where there were pockets of correctable underperformance. Because you've look at the top level of casualty line and the top-level profit, and you go , all looks okay, and given the time in the cycle, blah blah blah and we just didn't know, we don't want to run the business that way, we want to get very clear level  accountability, at the granular business level. So when we start pulling it apart and analyzing it that way, back in the latter half of '10, after this strategy was devised, that's when we got a focused on these lines of business, because we started looking and finding things that we really didn't like, that didn't meet our kinds of standards of activity. And since then, that's when all of these things really get more intense. So I just -- I just want to make that point, because I think it's important to understand the narrative of why we're feeling frustrated, hasn't shown up yet, but confident that it's there, that's the period of time we've been working on this not just in the last quarter or 2.", "Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it. Thanks for that clarification. And then one just quick numbers question for modeling purposes. The loss from the Concordia sinking, can you give us an estimate of kind of what is reinsurance and what's insurance at this point?", "Peter R. Porrino", "No. There are some confidentiality things that we have with our clients. We don't -- remember, we almost never will  talk about a single and short events, right? So this is very unusual, only doing it because others have done it. But at this point, we would not be comfortable splitting it out between insurance and reinsurance.", "Unknown Executive", "We did pretty clear with the client, the way which we've talked about it. But that's just specific as we can get.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Just a couple of quick questions here. First, Greg, you talked about looking at some changes to your cat reinsurance program. Can you give us some sense of what you're thinking about doing here? Or could we expect more volatility, less volatility going forward?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Sure, Brian. First, let me stress, our core reinsurers have been with us a long time, and will continue to be important parts of our seated plans. But I personally, and XL as a whole, have a lot of comfort with alternative sources of capital. You'll recall, we did Cyrus Re for 3 years, and our Bermuda book and reinsurance is quite active, and trading with alternative partners. We see the recent activity in this area, we see supply from this alternative source of capital exceeding demand, and we think we can see some of our peak exposures more efficiently. And to be direct -- to be in your question, we will not to an increased volatility at all. This is to try and reduce the volatility of our book, net after Reinsurance.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Great. And then, just 2 other quick ones here. The investment affiliates, big loss in the quarter. Was that Select related to performance or was there some type of write off or something that happened? Seemed awfully large at $19.9 million.", "Michael S. McGavick", "So it was not a write-off, we\u2019ve got Sarah here, who can get into more detail. But as we mentioned, Q3, as you know, is a pretty bad equity quarter. And we've got investment managers that go above the high-water market, and they go below the high-water market. When those happen, you can get a fairly large delta, but Sarah can add a lot more.", "Sarah Elizabeth Street", "Yes that's exactly, Pete at the high point. I mean the big number was $20 million from our investment manager affiliates, which effectively, was a reversal. If remember, back in Q2, we have very strong earnings from our investment manager affiliates, and it was because a number of them had gone above the high water marks, so we've got a big pickup. But with a very difficult third quarter, one of them fell back below, and therefore, they had to reverse back or give back basically, the performance fees that they were earning.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Great. And then last question, Pete, I wonder, you gave us the new money, what you've got right now, we know what your book yield is. What's the maturity profile look like kind of over the next 12 months for the investment portfolio?", "Susan L. Cross", "Brian, Pete's pointing to me on that one again. No. I mean in terms -- if we look at the bonds that they're maturing over the next year, along with our estimates of the cash flows that we expect to get back from structured credits, in total, it is about $3.6 billion, and they have an average yield of 3.11%.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Randy Binner from FBR.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "On the $100 million expense increase, I'm just trying to understand where that would come through the model? If you can give out, it will just be helpful for modeling, if you can describe kind of the portion that might go through the corporate and other line versus down in the segments?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Sure, Steve? So why don't you give us a minute to go and collect that.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Yes, okay.", "Michael S. McGavick", "And then we'll get back to you. Do you have another question, we'll probably have the answer to the first one by the time you're done with the second one.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Yes, I mean I just want to add, I mean I had another one, thank you. Just on U.S. D&O, in all the descriptions that have happened so far, it seems like losses have been generally benign still, but I thought I also heard commentary that pricing was getting better. So I just wanted to make sure I understood that better. Especially, I'm thinking of large case, U.S. D&O, or our North American D&O, is that the case that losses are  benign but you actually are seeing higher pricing?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Yes. Absolutely. We're seeing, certainly benign losses around the large events. There is some more noise as I would call it, around smaller claims, particularly, the result mostly just the defense costs. But the line has seen rates come off over the last few years. And we are now seeing the early part of '12 here, the first positive rate movement in that book.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. I mean, just to sound a little bit cynical, so why, with benign loss activity, you'd think people would still be soft on price. So is there a kind of a collective recognition that there might be some losses coming down the pike?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Personally, I don't think so. I think there's a fundamental realization here, that when you look at yields on your investment portfolio of where they are today, and the rate decreases that are piling on the loss cost trends, it have been moving out. When I say small increase, let me be clear, we're still not exceeding loss cost trends, we're not covering that in our rate increases. So I think it's the accumulation of the rate decreases coming through, low investment returns, and a realization that you're not writing this business at a big profit in that kind of economic environment.", "Michael S. McGavick", "This is Mike. I would just add a couple of thoughts. One is, I think as I've observed, the D&O underwriting space overtime, as opposed to general commercial insurance overtime. Maybe it's because they read financial statements all day long, but D&O underwriters tend to be more disciplined. And the down part of their cycles, in my observation of them, tend to get a quicker response. So they've been -- I think, getting into areas they were uncomfortable with, and they're reacting to it, as the market seems to be reacting to that, and I find that very understandable. I think the second thing though, is a  broader comment on where rates are. I wish I think it's worth picking up on this theme. With these investment yields now, continuously locked further in place by the governments around the world, I think underwriters are finally getting it through their heads, that you cannot, cannot keep these rate levels and expect to make much money. I mean, it just -- the paradigm has shifted, and people are slowly, more and more reacting to that. And that's why I think we're seeing this, as I said, it's not a hard market yet, but it's a positive turning market. And people have said, well that will fall back as competition persists, I believe what will happen is people will realize that the baby steps they've taken so far, are insufficient. As against the problem of this historic low, and somewhat locked in for the near-term, yield environment. And I think they're going to have to keep chasing their tail on this until they get it right. We're certainly, going to remain as disciplined as possible as against this yield environment. I also would observe that unlike us, unlike the relative discipline that we have historically and continue  to show on reserves, when I look at the industry, I don't see -- broadly, across the commercial sector, I don't see increasing reserve discipline, not at all. So when you add that in, to this anemic yields, I think you really got to have a newer discipline in underwriting, and I expect that to accelerate as people's results show the effects of this period of time.", "Peter R. Porrino", "Randy, to get back to your first question, I don't want to give -- be overly precise here, because this level will move around a lot, based on allocations throughout the year. But ballpark, while the $30 million will be in the corporate line and $70 million would be in the operating line. I'm sorry, the other way around.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So the 70 corporate, that's a delta increase, 2012 over 2011, and then 30 is kind of spread among the expense rations basically?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Just trying to get confirmation. The corporate line, right, would be the 30.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Sorry, I thought you switched it back.", "Michael S. McGavick", "If I miss-said that, I apologize. But the corporate line would be the 30 and the operating line, meaning the Insurance lines, reinsurance would be the 70.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Vinay Misquith with Evercore Partners.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "The first question is really the 7 underperforming businesses. I believe you mentioned that's about 20% of your business. So is that 20% of your total business, or is it only of the primary Insurance? And you mentioned that the rest of the businesses were running at sub-95% x cat expire. So it's the onset of the total business or just of the primary Insurance business?", "Michael S. McGavick", "The 20% figure is of the total global net written premium for the entire P&C business, for the entire business. So Reinsurance and Insurance combined. It would be roughly a quarter of the Insurance premiums.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Sure, and the 95% of that is only for the insurance, correct?", "Michael S. McGavick", "That's the whole firm.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "That's a whole firm as a whole. And the -- when will the underwriting actions taken to help these businesses? What has started early in 2011, and what's your target as to when they'll get an acceptable normalized combined ratio? And would you say that, that's a sub-100%?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Well, first of all, as a target over time, we do find is just fundamentally unacceptable from any lines of business knowingly over 100. I mean, we have -- that just drives us crazy. Now it will happen from time to time, particularly in casualty driven blocks of business, and some of it can be artificial. I'll give you an example of where it can be artificial. We break up, our reinsurance group by geography. And so for example, with our North American Reinsurance group, we basically take away their opportunities write catastrophe, which we write out of -- largely, out of Bermuda. So that line can look like -- if you looked at it narrowly, you can say, well that's running pretty hot. And in reality, it's running terrific. And if you look at the development overtime, it's running even better. But because we artificially have broken that business up between cat and non-cat, you could fool yourself into thinking it's worse than it is. So that's an example of anomalies that can take place. But generally speaking, we are trying to drive all of our business below 100 combined. And in this rate environment, that's even -- this interest rate environment, that's an even-greater imperative than the normal. So in terms of targets, we certainly don't expect these books of business running over 100 combined. With respect to when they'll take place, I think I have answered that before. And in fact, I noticed a colleague shaking their head at the length of my last answer. So I think getting back, probably get a very strong and negative reaction from the group here. But basically, some of these started in late 2010, some started, and frankly, I can give you the same answer about every quarter up until the last, there's nothing that's new in this quarter. Right now, we're basically, fully locked and loaded on these activities and if anything else pops it's head up, we'll whack that gopher too.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "My second question, I will be quick, is on the prime, Peter favorable development. Your results seem to be actually fairly good. Just curious as to why the level of favorable reserve releases has dropped off in the last couple of quarters? Was it just the year end cleanup? And do you expect a similar level next year?", "Michael S. McGavick", "I'll take it. Prior quarter, right? We've tried to be clear, we probably didn't do a very good job, but in Q3, would be, we delved to our in-debt analysis, right? So all we do is, it's only in neighbors' e-quarter. It's probably the quarter that would have to the less, least amount of movement during the year. So that one is not surprisingly, went to the prior call about some of the things that happened in the prior year, that caused a larger favorable PYD, than what you would have seen this year.", "Susan L. Cross", "And I would just say that individual quarter's results, what comes out of that prior development analysis, reflects the unique circumstances of what emerges in each of those quarters, you can have results that are somewhat higher or level in terms of prior development on a quarterly basis. And specific to the fourth quarter of 2010, we had some significant favorable development in our professional insurance business, including some releases on the 2006 and prior cash losses, most notably the Enron related cases back from 2001. And then I went through what actually occurred in the fourth quarter of 2011, where we had strengthening in certain classes. So the pluses and minuses in the fourth quarter of '11 were less than those of 2010, but I wouldn't read anything into that, in terms of any trends, because as I mentioned, we have had continued favorable A vs E, actual versus expected emergence, specifically in primary casualty, professional, U.S. Casualty Reinsurance, those are our longer tail lines, and were we take longer to reflect that favorable experience over time, in both our prior developments and in our current year loss pics.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike  Zaremski with Credit Suisse.", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Mike, in regards to the writing agency capital buffer, is the buffer currently larger that it would potentially need to be due to XL's historical earnings volatility? So said another way, is there an element of the company's past that's suppressing excess capital, which could dissipate over time?", "Michael S. McGavick", "No.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay. And any color on how to think about potential affiliate investment returns assessed in '12?", "Michael S. McGavick", "This is Sarah. I mean, we still believe that the alternative portfolio can be generating an 8% to 10% return over the fourth cycle. Clearly, last year, it ran at the lower level than that. But we're also optimistic that over the long term, that the 8% to 10% will get generated, and certainly, that put our 3-year and 5-year and 10-year track record show.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Meyer Shields with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "One quick question and one maybe a bigger picture, Mike, you talked about 95% sort of being the dividing line between the troubled lines of business and not. Is the 95% command ratio enough? Is that low enough to generate an appropriate ROE?", "Michael S. McGavick", "It isn't our target. I'm just making the point that there is a really significant delta of performance difference between most of our book and those businesses that require some very intense attention. So that's the -- and the relatively small portion that is that. But no, I wouldn't not tell you that a 95 is our goal. Given the more Specialty nature of our book of business overall, given its complex risk characteristics, I would expect to see this business in -- and let's normalized per cycle conditions, because obviously, you're going to run hotter at the time like this, when this prolonged period of soft pricing. But I would really expect to see this book operating more around the 90 than a 95.", "Peter R. Porrino", "The only thing I would add, Meyer, this is Pete, would be, as you listen to Susan's talk discussion about reserve in Mike's comments as well, we try to be really prudent when we go and set reserves. And when said that our accident near loss ratios, we certainly are expecting that they are not going to trend up anything they would trend the other way.", "Michael S. McGavick", "That's a really good point, it would be, in normal times, kind of expected for us to have our accent here. Be it worse than our target in our calendar year, to be the number that reflected our goals more accurately.", "Unknown Analyst", "And second, recalling the 20% of businesses in these troubled lines, what was the percentage of premiums in 2010 in those 7 lines?", "Michael S. McGavick", "I don't have that on top of my head, but I know for sure, it would be higher.  Those have been reducing.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Josh Stirling, Sanford C. Beinstein.", "Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "This is a great granular focus that you guys are getting us on your efforts in the 7 lines of business. And I was trying to do the math, and I presume, you won't give us the number, but from what it backs into, it sounds like you're sort of clearly well, well above 100 in these lines. And I'm curious, should we view this as sort of XL specific, rate and underwriting issues in these lines of business, or is this more of the generally deteriorating environment that  are going to be industry phenomenon, and then I guess, the related question, assuming it isn't just sort of some additional, sort of catch-up or sort of fixing things, that you guys are doing is,  do you feel like that they're making these changes in line with your competitors, or your sort of ahead or behind the same sort of things you see playing out?", "Michael S. McGavick", "I'm going to start with a couple of general comments. But I want to ask Greg to get into it a bit more. As has been my answer pretty consistently, it really depends on the line of business. I'll give you an example of one where I think XL can really do a much better business, job. And I'm really determined and pleased with what I see so far, is our global property business. I really think there -- some of the issues are XL issues, and we can fix, in fact, you heard Greg mentioned, one area where I think we can do a better job in applying some of the knowledge we had in our reinsurance lines around how to treat flood. So there, I would describe as idiosyncratically disappointed. And that's a pretty sizable block of the premium that we're talking about. In other lines, what you're seeing now is really a reflection of what's going on in the marketplace. So for example, in risk management, where you have guaranteed cost comp, that deterioration has been noted by the market very broadly, and I would say, our actual rate of deterioration is comparable, or maybe not even as bad. It's just not satisfying to us, relative to what we know we can deliver in that business. So there  you really have something that's going on more broadly in the marketplace, and where our actions are, we think potentially, can give us a leading result. I'm going to stop there, because I'm at risk of giving everything I know Greg will talk about, but it really -- it is syncretic, and it would really depend by line. Greg?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Let me speak specifically about when you hit programs. When you get a program wrong, you're going to be  the only one on it,  you're the only issuing character, in almost every case, except for some very large MGAs where they might have multiple characters. So there, we might have gotten 1 or 2 wrong, and so we're going to have to shift our way out, and that's going to be a specific XL issue. I'd just touch it a little bit more on the international property piece. The market is making it difficult for us though. We were able to achieve a 3% rate increase as of January 1, but we still have a lot of competitors that are offering rate decreases. And more troubling, as we've said to you before, we're not doing LTAs anymore, we lost more business because competitors are offering LTAs than we did because we couldn't get to the right rate. So it's always going to be a little bit of everything.", "Unknown Analyst", "That's really helpful. And if I could shift to sort of a more optimistic note, can you just help us think about the relative order of magnitude of the growth that you're likely to see this year? How much of it is likely to be from new -- some from the very sort of new initiatives that you guys are pursuing, new teams, new lines of business, things like that versus merely repricing the book?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Yes, it's hard to break that out specifically, especially on the team side, because that's how opportunistic of great team in a line that we analyzed we're intrigued by, could come at any time in the year, because that one's really impossible to forecast. And as a result, it's hard to break it by percentage, because you don't know when you're going to get those opportunities. In general, I would expect that next year, the story will be more driven by rate. Because I see rate moving broadly, more favorably than I see opportunistic growth. The only caveat to that is a couple of our lines, like let's say, North American property, we've really analyzed that we have some really great results over time and some real opportunity. And just to be clear, when you get deeply into the numbers, sometimes, this is where it can't always pay off to get too deep on XL's number. I'll give an example. You can find losses that will show up on the yellow apparels is in the U.S., if you choose to dig that far. But what you won't know, is that the originating office of that account was European, and it's written on a global program basis. And it's the European underwriting operations on property that we have this really intense opportunity around, not the North American group that has done a really quite good job over time. And where we actually analyze with some additional pockets of growth, are really going to help us remix the books. So I'm sorry to give an answer that's not real specific.   Rate. Generally, will drive more of the story. I think next year, but you could get opportunistic, it depends on what comes available to us.", "Unknown Analyst", "I guess, the one final follow-up I'd ask related to that is, if you just look back at the last quarter, I think you said it was HI after adjusting, I think it was 5% growth rate, if I have that correctly. Do you still have a sense of how much of that is sort of the new initiatives taking off? Or again, sort of just getting more price on your same book?", "Michael S. McGavick", "In the fourth quarter, specifically, across the whole insurance portfolio, that number would've been driven more by some of the new initiatives than the rate. We have pockets of rate, but it wouldn\u2019t, if I had to guess, 20% would be rate and 80% would be new initiatives. That's not a percentage of calculation.", "Michael S. McGavick", "Sorry to have you even more, but you've noticed in this whole call, we're trying to be very granular because we knew there'd be questions, and we really like our story, and we felt it was important to get very granular, so you would understand why we are pleased. The bottom line on that last comment, where we talked about -- so much of our business is in U.S. D& O. So when you have this negative rate trend during the year last year, it was undoing the positive rate we were achieving everywhere else, and the rate, the positive rate improvement that we're starting to see in U.S. D&O, is a  1 1 phenomena, not a fourth quarter phenomena. So you haven't seen that start to change it, and contribute to better rate picture overall. So just a nuance  that I thought I' d make sure you understood.", "Operator", "At this time, I'm showing no further questions.", "Michael S. McGavick", "Well, I just want to close by thanking everyone. We know we stayed over our ordinary time on the call. But then we expected to given the way the quarter played out. We continue to focus on the long-term health of this franchise. We continue to be very disciplined about how we build a very solid book of business. And we believe that this quarter, in a strange way, the quarter actually confirmed the places that we have been putting our energy into as opportunities for improving XL, both in terms of where we're growing, and in terms of where we have these intense, re-underwriting activities taking place. And we are certainly looking forward to quarters in the future, when we can increasingly describe that those events that have taken place, as we have indicated to you tonight, we will. We thank you for the extra time and attention, and look forward to our visits throughout the year next year.", "Operator", "Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "David R. Radulski", "Thank you, Shirley, and welcome to XL Group's first quarter 2012 earnings conference call. This call is being simultaneously webcast on XL's website at www.xlgroup.com. We posted to our website several documents, including our quarterly financial supplement. On our call today, Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, will offer opening remarks. Pete Porrino, XL's Chief Financial Officer, will review our Financial Results; followed by Greg Hendrick, our Chief Executive of Insurance Operations; and Jamie Veghte, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations, will review the segment results and market conditions. Then we'll open up for questions. ", "Also in attendance are Susan Cross, our Global Chief Actuary; Sarah Street, our Chief Investment Officer; and Steve Robb, our Controller.", "Before they begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that certain matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations.  Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, and therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them.", "Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other documents on file with the SEC, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of which they are made, and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise.", "With that, I'd turn it over to Mike McGavick.", "Michael S. McGavick", "Good evening. As you can see from our release, XL's first quarter results were solid across the board. We returned to profitability in the first quarter with fully diluted operating earnings of $0.52 per ordinary share and an operating ROE of 6.9%. Following a difficult 2011, where much of our progress was obscured by the high level of catastrophes and large losses, this is a gratifying announcement to make and further supports our confidence in XL's days and years ahead.", "In my year-end letter to shareholders, I outlined several reasons for our confidence. I'll go through some of these again, updating them with our first quarter results. First, our underwriting is improving. And look, we're not confused, we are not at the level of underwriting results that we are expecting to show in every business, but we are improving. The insurance segment combined ratio improved to 101.2%, obviously higher than it should be, but significantly better than the 121% in the first quarter of last year. And even when one removes the extreme cat events of last year, we saw margin expansion in the insurance results in first quarter last year over this year, and we expect that expansion to accelerate. At the same time, Reinsurance continued their record of achievement. The Reinsurance segment's combined ratio for the quarter was 82.4%, a great performance. Jamie will give further details momentarily. It's a good sign that these improvements were especially noticeable among the 7 challenged businesses and insurance that we've discussed in detail on prior calls. In fact, the combined ratio of these 7 businesses was, in this quarter, 104.3%, getting closer in line with the rest of our insurance book in this first quarter. Again, nowhere near good enough, but as we expected, moving in the right direction.", "Now in the P&C industry, we all know better than to expect an immediate turnaround in underwriting results. But as our actions take hold, improvements will accelerate, we believe. Everyday, these businesses are decreasingly affected by prior decisions and increasingly improving as a result of our corrections. As we've shared with you, some of these 7 businesses are already on their way to reaching appropriate margins. And at the same time, as we have emphasized, we are watching all of our businesses with intense focus, always on the lookout for anything that warrants special attention or greater opportunity to expand our profit. ", "Turning to another source of confidence. Pricing improved in each month of the first quarter. To use the metric that many of our peers report, North American Property & Casualty rate growth was 5% in the first quarter and rate achievement was accelerating throughout the quarter. I'll ask Greg and Jamie to elaborate, but we feel very comfortable that our positive rate change will continue. We are a long way from regaining the ground lost over the past 10 years, but as the momentum moves in the right direction, we believe XL is well positioned to benefit from this rate movement. ", "Another source of our confidence is our focus on smart profitable growth. Our P&C gross premiums written increased over 10% from the first quarter of last year. Insurance segment gross premiums written were up 9.3% as a result of new business initiatives in North American Property & Casualty lines, higher retention levels in our profitable professional lines, and improved pricing. Gross premiums written by our Reinsurance segment grew by 11.8%, primarily in International Casualty. We like what we are seeing, remixing our businesses towards premiums written in the lines we think provide the greatest opportunity for profit. ", "Another source of confidence is our ERM. Our enterprise risk management record continues to show results. While the entire industry did benefit from a relatively quiet cat quarter, where losses were reported, XL again fared in line with our expectations and performed well relative to peers as a percentage of shareholders' equity. Now in the first quarter, this was illustrated by Costa Concordia, an awful human tragedy obviously, and one of the true marine catastrophes that we have experienced. In fact, for the sector, this resulted in a loss approaching $1 billion. Now we're a leader in insurance and reinsurance marine coverages for both haul damage and liability. And for us to have a net loss from this event, currently estimated about $45 million, is a sound underwriting achievement given the catastrophe to the market. In the first quarter, we continue to invest favorable reserve development. And we believe you should find more evidence of our reserving prudence when we relieve our -- when we release our Global Loss Triangles later this week. Recall that the first quarter is an actual versus expected quarter. And as usual, we will again perform a complete review of our reserves in the second and fourth quarter, and look forward to discuss reserving in greater detail with you next quarter. Susan Cross, our Global Chief Actuary, will join us then.", "As we made clear, our operating efficiency remains an area of intense focus. We are committed to ensuring that every dollar we spend improves our ability to expand margins. As people discuss, we are on track with the expense guidance for the year that we provided at the end of last year. But as I've said, we retain our ability to hold back spending of our expected loss ratio, driven margin improvement does not materialize. And we are just as committed to efficiently managing investors' capital. We bought back $100 million worth of XL shares in the first quarter. We've told you that we consider the $400 million in share buybacks for the year that we spoke of in our last call, as less a ceiling than a floor, and we intended to continue buying back shares for as long as the economics remain compelling versus other opportunities.", "One final note on the quarter and I'll turn it over to Pete. At the annual RIMS Conference recently, I bet and I know you all follow, I was especially pleased by how often clients and brokers would take me aside to tell me how impressed they are, both with the talent we've been adding, and our already strong team and their creativity. These brokers of course follow-up by asking us to look at many of the most complex challenges, exactly the kind of position XL strives to be in everyday. We are driven to provide solutions that add value to our clients, while generating return on our capital for shareholders that invest in us. We have a strong edge -- or sense of urgency to succeed at both and we're pleased by the progress this quarter demonstrates.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Pete to discuss the financials in more detail.", "Peter R. Porrino", "Well, thanks, Mike, and good evening. Operating income for the first quarter was $165 million or $0.52 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to an operating loss of $163 million or $0.52 per share in the first quarter of 2011. Our net income attributable to our ordinary shareholders was $177 million or $0.56 per share. The loss in the prior year was driven by cat losses, which net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums totaled $387 million compared to $20 million in the current year quarter.", "Turning to our summary of financial results on Slide 3, you'll see the P&C premium growth that Mike highlighted. Our P&C combined ratio for the quarter was 95.3%, or 13.5 points smaller than the same quarter last year. Our accident year combined ratio was 101.3%, or 30.1 points smaller than the same quarter last year. As I mentioned, cat losses in the prior year quarter was significant and accounted for 30.5 loss ratio points compared to 1.5 points in Q1 2012.", "Prior year development in the quarter was a favorable $80 million or 5.9 loss ratio points, this reflects favorable development of $54 million and $26 million in the Insurance and Reinsurance segments, respectively. Positive movements came from professional and property insurance lines, as well as shorter-tail reinsurance lines. As we pointed out in the past, the first quarter results do not include a full reserve review for the majority of our businesses. In fact, more than 80% of our reserves are not subject to a complete reserve review this quarter, and as a result, we generally react only to actual versus expected results in shorter-tail lines.", "We continue to see positive actual-versus-expected development across most of our businesses. Professional lines releases of $24 million in the quarter arose primarily from a large favorable case settlement on a 10-year old claim. The current and prior year quarters were also impacted by losses from large, nonnatural catastrophe events in both Insurance and Reinsurance. In Q1 2012, this was largely related to Costa Concordia. ", "XL reported a loss net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums of $45 million, of which $24 million was attributable to the Insurance segment and $21 million to the Reinsurance segment. Of the total Costa Concordia impact, a significant amount was in the form of reinstatement premiums and as a result, operating and acquisition expense ratios was somewhat distorted in the quarter. Excluding natural cat and PYD, our Q1 combined ratios were 104.8% for Insurance, 88.7% for Reinsurance and 98 -- 99.8% for all of P&C. Costa Concordia added 2.6, 5.2 and 3.3 points respectively to those ratios. ", "Our combined $282 million of operating expenses for the first quarter was up 8.4% or $22 million year-over-year. The year-over-year increase rose principally from costs supporting our strategic initiatives and higher compensation cost from both growth and headcount associated with new business initiatives and certain severance costs. This increase is consistent with the investments we have been discussing on prior calls and in line with the additional spend level we indicated last quarter. ", "At $190 million, net investment income under P&C portfolio in the first quarter was 6.4% below the prior year, due primarily to lower new money rates and cash outflows from the investment portfolio. The P&C gross book yield at the end of the quarter was 3.2%. We achieved an average new money rate on our P&C portfolio in the quarter of 2.1%. We estimate that approximately $3.2 billion of P&C assets, with an average gross book yield of 3.1%, will mature and pay down over the next 12 months. ", "Our net income from investment affiliates was $30 million, down $2 million from the prior year. The first quarter performance of the equity accounted alternative portfolio was above our return expectations and reflected the positive investment environment that we expected late last year and during much of the first quarter of 2012. ", "Realized gains were $21 million compared to realized losses of $66 million in the prior year quarter. This gain was net of $21 million in OTTI charges, which were primarily taken on non-agency RMBS assets. The total return on the portfolio was 1.5% for the quarter and contributed to book value growth with a positive mark-to-market of $249 million. This was driven by the narrowing of credit spreads which more than absorbed the impact of increasing rates. ", "The P&C duration increased by 0.3 years to 3.1 years, more in line, although still less than the duration of all our liabilities. The life asset duration declined by 0.1 years. Our fixed income holdings in Euro-zone countries is again listed in our financial supplement. We continue to have negligible exposure to the sovereign and financial institution data peripheral countries, and our Continental European bank holdings, including covered bonds, totaled $801 million and remain largely exposed and national champions Northern Europe. The net unrealized gain position on these securities was $4 million at March 31. ", "Now to capital management. Following the February Board of Directors meeting, we announced the authorization of a new $750 million share buyback program, which replaced the approximately $190 million remaining under the previous buyback program. During the quarter, we purchased in capital 4.7 million of ordinary shares at an average cost of $21.14 under the new program for $100 million, leaving 615 million remaining available for purchase under the current program. ", "And as we announced on our year-end call in January, 2012, we repaid at maturity the $600 million, 6.5% guaranteed senior notes. ", "With that, I'll turn it over to Greg to discuss our Insurance segment results.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Thanks, Pete, and good evening. I'm going to cover 4  topics tonight. I'll  provide updates on the insurance segment results for the quarter and on the corrective actions we are taking in our challenged businesses, a review of talent changes and a summary of current market conditions. ", "Turning to results. I share Mike's sentiment that while our overall results are not where they need to be, I am pleased that we made progress this quarter. Insurance gross premiums written grew by $114 million or 9.3% in the quarter, and net premiums earned grew by $58 million or 6.6%. ", "Mike touched on some main areas of confidence and some of the big factors driving this growth. While I would add that we had success in 2 of our targeted growth businesses, international perimeter [ph] market and political risk, and in our marine book, driven by geographic expansion and rate improvement. I'll cover the overall pricing environment in a few moments. ", "The Insurance segment's combined ratio for the quarter was 101.2%, or 19.8 points better than the same quarter last year. Reduced natural catastrophe activity accounted for 13 points of this improvement, as Q1 2011 was adversely impacted by $133 million catastrophic losses compared only to $20 million cat losses this quarter. Prior year reserve releases of $53.9 million compared to $6.6 million last year accounted for another 5 points of improvement. In the current accident year loss ratio, excluding cats of 71.3% also improved by 4.3 points despite absorbing 2.2 points from Costa Concordia. And Q1 2011 was adversely impacted by several large non-cat property losses, whereas there was one large property loss this quarter. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of improved accident quarter loss ratios.", "These improvements are partially offset by a 1.4 point increase in acquisition ratio, partly due to reinstatement premiums related to the Costa Concordia loss, and a 1.2 point increase in the operating expense ratio, mostly due to increased compensation costs related to expansion in many of our businesses, an improved results, but we are still losing money on an underwriting basis which is unacceptable. However, the corrective actions we have discussed will begin to take hold. As you may recall, last quarter we talked about the businesses that we view as challenged. While this is just one quarter of progress, these businesses came into line with the rest of the book. Our combined ratio of the challenged businesses in the quarter was 104.3%, and the remainder we reported 100.2% combined ratio. Recall that last quarter, our challenged businesses combined ratio was 151.9% versus 104.4% for the balance of insurance. If we move the impact of prior development, cats and Costa, the Q1 combined ratio of the challenge businesses drops to 103.3%, while the remainder of the book reported a 101.9% combined ratio. ", "The leaders of these businesses continue to implement re-underwriting strategies to turn their respective books around. I'll now share some examples of the actions underway to how they have translated to progress this quarter. We are improving the management of our cat capacity, ensuring that it is allocated to those accounts where we can get the best returns. Not only have we seen our catastrophe exposures reduced at a faster rate than our premium base in our international property book, we've also freed up capacity on certain accounts on our North American property book, allowing us to increase the size of our portfolio without increasing overall cat exposure. We continue de-emphasizing the guaranteed cost workers comp business in our risk management portfolio, as it is lagged the rest of the book in profitability. Through the first quarter, we have canceled nearly 25% of the renewal business, achieved rate increases of 10% and increased the average deductibles by 11% on the renewed business. ", "In our surplus lines business, we continue re-underwriting the New York contractors' general liability line, where we have either non-renewed accounts or achieved rate increases of over 50% in the first quarter. We shift to the GL portfolio mix away from distressed areas, and we have successfully diversified the book in the other lines, namely real [ph] and property. The challenged businesses continue to be an area of great focus, but it's important to repeat that we moderate all of our businesses very closely.", "Moving on to people. We were again pleased by our ability to add talent throughout this segment. This quarter, we appointed Jason Harris as Chief Executive for International Property and Casualty business group. We also added new talent in our political risk, international construction, and in marine businesses to name a few. As Pete mentioned, we did incur redundancy costs this quarter as we continue to replace underperforming talents. While we added 20 new underwriters in the quarter, the net increase was only 3. ", "And finally, a word on market conditions. The positive pricing momentum which began roughly one year ago is real and we believe sustainable. In fact, in Q1, we saw a positive rating indication in all of our business groups, including professional lines. And as Mike said, this return to gradual sustained rate improvement is something we've all been expecting and we feel we're well positioned to benefit from these market changes. ", "In North America, our P&C portfolio is up 5% year-to-date, led by double-digit rate increases in our property and E&S businesses. While our professional portfolio was just positive, our design business is up 3%. With our specialty portfolio up 1%, the only area of disappointment was in our international book which is almost flat. Despite 2011 loss activity and depressed pricing levels, we are losing business to competitors for double-digit rate reductions. While I'm always disappointed with the customer, many of the underwriting decisions we face in these situations are quite easy. ", "And while on the topic of rates, I want to be clear that we are thoughtful about how we implement rate increases. These are not blanket mandates which inevitably lead to adverse selection. Rather, our teams have segmented their portfolios based on a variety of factors and used a graded approach to rate change. In summary, the hard work of our teams produced progress in the first quarter, but we remain relentless in our pursuit of acceptable margins. ", "And now to Jamie to discuss Reinsurance results.", "James Veghte", "Thanks, Greg, and good evening. The reinsurance segment had a very solid quarter of underwriting results, with a combined ratio of 82.4%. Naturally, we had the benefit of negligible of cat activity compared to $271 million a year ago, principally from the earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand. Our reserve of leases in the quarter were $26.4 million compared to $64.4 million a year ago. The reduction was principally due to deterioration in 2011 cat losses, $10 million from the Thailand flood and $10 million from storm Dagmar in Northern Europe. Notwithstanding this, 85% of our releases came from short-tail property and marine businesses. Excluding the impact of cat losses and prior-year development, our combined ratio was 88.7% versus a combined of 87.7% in the first quarter of 2011. The deterioration from last year resulted from Costa Concordia, which had a net impact of $21 million or 5.5 loss ratio points.", "Turning to top line. Gross written premiums in the quarter were $980 million, an 11.8% increase from the first quarter of 2011. This increase was virtually entirely driven by our European and Asia-Pacific operations. In Europe, we had a significant increase of premium assumed in a U.K. motor proportional treaty, select new casualty opportunities in London, and increased shares on Continental European cat business. In Asia-Pacific, we wrote new business and increased shares on property proportional business as that market responded to the non-cat activity in the region last year.", "In summary, we had an excellent quarter of underwriting results on both an accident and calendar year basis. We found select opportunities to grow our portfolio, and we continue to maintain a very sound reserve position. ", "Turning to market conditions. The headline event at April 1 is the Japanese renewal. You will understand this will be a Q2 event from a top line perspective. Nevertheless, I would like to comment on the renewal, given the significant amount of intention this market has gotten over the last 12 months. As we've said previously, we had to significantly reduced our position in the Japanese market over the course of the last 10 years, as treaty conditions have gotten progressively competitive. While we would have liked to see more fundamental changes in the way the market is structured at this renewal, there was enough improvement that we increased our overall aggregates quite significantly. In fact, we increased them by 53%. These improvements included reductions in proportional ceding commissions of 3% to 4%, event limits on proportional treaties reduced by 30%, original rates increased by 25% to 50%, earthquake excess of loss rates increased from 15% to 50% and wind and flood rates came up 15%. Overall, it's a very solid renewal, although that marks overall rate adequacy still lags well below our U.S. wind portfolio. Our behavior in that market, including a very manageable loss from the earthquake last year, is a clear illustration of our underwriting discipline over the course of the decade of activity in that market. ", "Outside of Japan, I would echo Greg's comments on pricing. We're starting to see positive pricing momentum in sectors of the U.S. casualty market, particularly XL's liability in E&O. Cat exposed short tail lines are showing nice price movement and we would expect our U.S. mid-year wind renewals to have a continued momentum in a positive direction. We have virtually no business activity in Continental Europe at April 1, although we did renew a very large Continental European cat program with a risk adjusted increase of 6%, which we are pleased with. Elsewhere, Latin America remains very competitive and as mentioned, Asia-Pacific is showing an improvement in short tail lines as the market reacts to the national cat activity in the region last year. ", "So overall, we were very pleased with our quarter, both financially and relative to our underwriting activity. As we've said, we are ideally positioned to take advantage with what is clearly an improving environment with our global footprint, deep talent pool and long-term relationships with customers and producers.", "With that, I'll turn it back to Dave for Q&A.", "David R. Radulski", "Shirley, can you please open the lines for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Keith Walsh with Citi.", "Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Mike, first question. You commented about underlying margin expansion is up and should accelerate. Can you talk to this a little bit more? What are you seeing in rate trend by month? And what do you view as your overall underlying loss cost trends?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Yes, I'm going to let Greg comment more on the rate trends by month because he gives you a little more insight there. But my point is that relative to the same quarter a year ago or relative to even the fourth quarter of last year, our combined ratios came down. And that is even more exciting when you get to the loss ratios versus the combined ratios because we did have some expense expansion through both the Costa Concordia and the noise it created as well as a headcount cost associated with growth as well as cost of some redundancies. So when you add all of that together, the fact that the loss ratio is moving the right way is the expansion I'm talking about. And I expect that to accelerate through this year, as I've said, leading to more attractive returns this year, and we think really getting exciting next year on our -- relative to this tough market basis. So we're excited about where the book is going and the kinds of underwriting actions that Greg describes will be critical to getting us on the right path. Now when we get into the kind of mid-single digits rate increases that we're describing in North America, we're beginning to catch up the loss cost trend and make some real margin expansion. That is not the level across the whole book yet, but as I said we expect this to expand and accelerate quarter-by-quarter as our underwriting actions take hold. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Greg to comment a little more on what we're seeing on rate.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Sure. February, March, April -- each one had success of improvements. The figures I gave you in my comment blend over the portfolio to a positive 1%. And as Mike noted, if you blended the trend that we needed across our entire portfolio, it's somewhere between 3% and 5%. But clearly, it's a story amongst very different lines of business. In North America, the rate increases are north of 10% and accelerating on the short-tail line, and that is way in excess of trend. Conversely, while professional is positive just over -- just almost came to 1%, that's probably behind trend a little bit. So in summary, we're doing better each month-by-month, we're gaining ahead on the short-tail lines of trend and we're probably still lagging a little bit on the longer-tail lines.", "Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then Greg, just a follow-up on -- specifically on professional lines. You mentioned you're still probably a little below trend there, but your retention is actually up and you've written more, why not push rate more on that specific line if you could talk to that.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Sure. First of all, it's one of our more profitable books of business and so while we may be lagging trend, we still have very acceptable margins there. And the rate is very spotty. It's not a smooth -- it never is with any market. It's not a smooth 1%, and we're hitting on more of the tougher risks that we like -- than we are in the general spread of business. And so I would say the retention ratio being up is more business, hitting that mark than we did in the past. It's not a very large increase, it's roughly about 1 or 2 points up on the large professional book.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "On the net-to-gross property casualty insurance written premiums, the retention rate went up to around 84.7% in the first quarter of '12 from 81.7% a year ago. I'm just trying to get a sense if that reflects XL more exposure net or if there's something out there.", "Stephen Robb", "I can comment on the Reinsurance side, Jay, that a lot of that delta is because we switched the heart and crop [ph] program from fronting  where we ceded a lot out into the market to assume from the new owner and that dropped the ceded premium quite substantially.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Yes, on the insurance side, there isn't anything specific that comes to mind. You'll know, of course, in some of our bigger risk businesses there's a larger amounts of business that we fund for other carriers or for the captives of our clients. So there could be a little bit of noise in there, but not anything dramatic that I'm aware of driving changes in retentions.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then my next issue is on share buybacks. There was $100 million done in the quarter. There is $650 million left in the authorization. The debt-to-capital is down over 400 basis points just on one quarter when you repaid the maturing debt. So I'm just trying to get a sense of what kind of speed could we see the rest of buyback completed?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Yes, we don't -- as you know, we don't give forecast on the exact levels we'll be purchasing, and that's a source of constant dialogue with our board. But I can tell you, as I've said before, while we emphasize $400 million as something we were fairly certain of in this year, the reality of the way the market is playing out and the confidence we're gaining and seeing our margins expand lead us to be more bullish, as we've said. But in the end, we view the $400 million as more likely to be a floor than a ceiling. And you just have to take at face value and this is the kind of thing where given the effects it has on our subs, we let people know after the fact rather than before the fact what we do.", "James Veghte", "I would just add to that the debt to cap, that is pretty much exactly what we pegged it to be 6 months ago. So that's all according to long-term capital plan we had in place.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then my final one is on the Insurance segment. If you back out the Costa Concordia loss, the accident year x-cat combined ratio, we're still running around 102.5. Mike, to achieve adequate returns, where do you think that needs to be down to?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Look, I believe our accident year combine has got to come in around 90. I think that's just the reality of the back-of-the-envelope math of this low interest rate times. And that is really what we're delivered -- we're driven to deliver as an average across the book, that's how we develop our plans, that's how well we think the hurdle rates are now. You have to get into it business by business to get to an exact target for a particular business. But I think that's where this block ought to be running. This kind of low 90s, high 80s depending on the business. But we got a lot of work to do. But one of the things that is going to be hard as we go through this journey together, a couple of facts: One, it's not just rate change. I mean, as the markets harden, the first place that you usually get the most movement is on terms and conditions as much as it is on rates. Second, we're remixing the block of business towards more profitable activities. And third, we're reevaluating our lines shares and where to play in towers and all kinds of underwriting actions that aren't as obvious, aren't as directly related, but all of which we think have a meaningful impact. And if you take some of these more challenged businesses or some of our business that are more market takers and you make them less a part of the whole, and you take these kinds of less visible actions with real determination, you'll move a block of business like that. So that's not a forever statement to get into the 90s, it's just a lot of hard work.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So I just have a question on the Reinsurance business, you're at an 87.7% underlying -- but what kind of ROE does that translate into? I'm just assuming lower premium surplus there than for insurance, but just trying to get an understanding of kind of how adequate is that when you think about overall returns? And then just one follow-up.", "James Veghte", "It depends on what you use there. But I think if you use any form of economic capital or rating agency capital, it's certainly in the high teens.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then thinking about the bad lines versus the not-so-bad lines, I guess, in insurance. I'm just kind of surprised that the range was so narrow between 103.3 versus 101.1. Is there something -- just trying to understand, what is it that makes -- like is the range within those groups wider than that kind of initial glance would indicate?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Yes. This is Mike. I'll start with a couple of things and I'll turn it over to Greg. First thing, if you look at that block of business, the entire insurance block, you got to divide it in essence into 3 segments: Challenged business which is about 1/4 of it, and then the balance can be -- we talked about this before, at our Investor Day last year. The balance can be kind of divided into half and half. Half of it businesses that we're really pleased with the results of, and that we would like to write more of that or somehow extend the advantage. And then businesses that are solid businesses, but they're at a very low point in their cycle, they are kind of market taking at this stage, we're doing the best we can to manage down their impact on results without our capabilities so that we can take advantage of the market as it returns. So you're going to get this real big spread of results. Remember also the Costa Concordia was in the sort of the good side of the ledger was where Costa happens, not in the 7. So you've got 2 would have narrowed in the spread between the 2. But if you look at the history of performance of the 7 and you look at this quarter, that's a pretty happy number. And one other frustration, I think, we're all going to experience is, when we break this book up into smaller and smaller segments and we talk about on a quarterly basis, we're not going to have -- we're going to have a lot of movements around because we take big limits and there will be pops here and there. The question for me is, over time, are we seeing evidence of our actions taking hold that are -- the overall numbers moving the right way? In this quarter, I'm pleased to say they are.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "And Mike, I'd only add in that business that is performing well. There is new growth initiatives in there, where we're investing in future revenue and income streams. Construction, Surety, Political Risk, just to name 3 of them. So there's a bit of everything in that in the non-challenged part of the portfolio.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. I mean -- so if I'm looking at the insurance -- so the underlying commodities we adjusted Costa is like 102 and change, I think I mentioned that before. And you grew that segment like 14%. I'm just trying to -- is the area where you grew the -- is that area exhibiting current underwriting profitability or are the areas that you see, where you see opportunities maybe not profitable now but you expect that trends will move in your favor as you grow those segments, those businesses out?", "Peter R. Porrino", "Mike, it's Pete. Let's me just start off and then give it back to Greg. What you're looking at is specialty is not -- so those are lines of businesses that we disclosed because that's the way that the market expect us to disclose them. That's not equivalent to our specialty business. So you'll need to -- we would need to draw you a map to try and reconcile those 2. So they are not all that comparable, but Greg you want to...", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Sure. In general, Professional and Specialty where we have increasing retentions are where more the profitable businesses is located. And in our P&C business, where most of the challenged businesses were at lower retention levels than we were before. Those retention levels are following the margin opportunities that we see. Clearly, as you break each one of those down, there are differing levels of activity going on based on each business's -- and indeed within each business, each sub-portfolio's profit margin. So we're getting up to high-level number that are aggregating here. But In general, we're heading more towards the profitable businesses and away from the unprofitable.", "Michael S. McGavick", "And the other thing I would emphasize is some of it -- this is Mike, some of this cost will be affected by building up new activity. We have very acceptable loss ratios in the new business activities as we've discussed businesses like Political Risk and in Marine and such. But of course, there are subscale today and they're adding an expense burden that's affecting us all. But we like our timing of entry, a great deal given where those markets are going and we're liking what that capability does for the rest of our book.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "A couple of quick questions here for you. First, Greg, maybe you could tell a little bit -- a lot of companies have been talking about attritional kind of losses this quarter. Property losses were actually quite low. Did you all experience it all this quarter?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Certainly, in the quarter, there was the absence of large non-cat losses. And also, on pure attritional losses, there was nothing in there that we observed that would make us think that things are better or worse than prior. I didn't -- we didn't see any abnormally low.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Great. And the next one for Jamie. Could you give us a little color on how you think that order is going to turn out and your capacity to write some more business down there?", "James Veghte", "Let me cover the last part first, Brian. As you know, we set our capacity based on shareholders equity as of the end of the third quarter of last year at 15% for our Tier 1 risk which includes U.S. wins. So that will be $1,570,000,000. As of January 1, we were at $1,358,000,000. That's Greg's book and ours combined. So going into the win season, we've got plenty of capacity to compete and we will deploy capacity. We are expecting continued great improvement. I would remind you, though, that, that market got sort of 10% to 12% risk-adjusted improvement a year ago as opposed to those that renewed at January 1, 2011, who basically were flat up slightly, so they paid a pretty good increase last year. I don't know what's going to happen, it's a highly syndicated market. My own view is it will  go up, again, although probably about halfway levels we saw last year, and we will deploy. I can't tell you, though, that what we've seen over the last year is anything that clears the pricing of the major league markets will get done. There is plenty of capacity out there.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then one quick one for Mike. I'm just curious, the technology spend that's going on, that is increasing the expenses this year. I'm wondering if you could drill down a little bit exactly what is that technology that's going through? Is it under investing in technology or is it new stuff that's going through?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Yes, as I talked about back in Investor, let me emphasize a couple of points. I think the firm has chronically under invested in technology. As you know, the firm is basically built over time, much of it through acquisitions and much of the systems infrastructure was acquired in acquisition. And while I think that the people did heroic work keeping those systems functioning and supporting the business, in the end, as we envisioned the business over time, being more successful requires that we get that architecture stabilized and more uniform and more able to allow us to grow and gain operating leverage on adding new premium. So today, if we add a lot of new premium, we don't get much lift on the expense side. That's just ridiculous; we really ought to be seeing a lot of lift from adding premium. And that can only come by making this architecture more scalable. So you see things like really rebuilding the way in which our front-end underwriting tools work, both to make our underwriters more efficient with their time to give them more access to insight, to make better underwriting calls and to begin a flow of work that lowers the net cost of fulfillment for the client. That's one big area of investment, for example, right now. You know that we're investing a lot on the insight side of the equation, we have been for really more than 1.5 years now in terms of modeling, where we think modeling is applicable to the kinds of risk we take on. And again, the systems need to be substantially improved in order to allow that insight to be efficiently fed into the underwriting process. So I'm very confident in the end result of all this work and our ability to then really kind of add a booster to our progress. But as you know, systems work is a big intense effort, and it's not fun to finance, especially at a low point in a cycle. But we think it's the right time to be making the investment.", "Peter R. Porrino", "Brian, this is Pete. The only thing I'd add to put it in context of the increase that I spoke about, the majority of that would have been not in the technology space, it would have been in the compensation and related areas.", "Michael S. McGavick", "The strategic stuff we hold at corporate. That's the point.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Mike, just wanted to clarify, did you mention that the goal was a 90 combined on an accident-year basis?", "Michael S. McGavick", "If all economics stayed the same, our goal would be running around a 90. Now that -- I suppose I should be a little bit cautious. We are very prudent reservers and so sometimes I think the accident year at any particular time might run a bit hotter than the year will actually play out over time. But that's just a consequence to that approach. But I believe this firm needs to run in kind of in the low 90s, high 80s. Yes.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, great. So the mass on that is...", "Michael S. McGavick", "[indiscernible] the economic's change some, you can see a different result.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. So the math on that is more than $1 a share, it seems from current levels, just as -- as you run it through the model, if you achieve those goals. And so on the one hand, it's incredible if you can do it. On the other, I look at 20 years of data for the corporation and it's a level that's only been achieved in a handful of years.", "Michael S. McGavick", "Actually, it was achieved most of our early years and then very infrequently sense. But if you look at the history of large pops that we've managed to produce at XL that we think we've contained through our strategic redesign and our attention to ERM and all the rest, we don\u2019t see any reason that we can't get that kind of stuff the heck out of the way and have our underwriters do their job. But we note that competitors are achieving the profit levels, it's not undoable and it's not out of sequence with our total history; it's just out of sequence with our recent history. But our determination to improve this book is very real.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, and that includes -- I mean, you think the march towards that level is -- obviously began this quarter and just continues in the quarters ahead and years ahead?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Well, actually, as Greg reported, that's the fifth consecutive quarter of improvement on the loss ratio which is what we're focused on. That's the main driver we've got and then as we get these investments done, we'll be able to add in the booster on expense, too, we believe.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, perfect, perfect. And then just jumping to another key lever is the investment yield, again in the commentary, it doesn't sound like that --I mean it's just an unfortunate reality that where yields are, there's no movement or ability to re-risk the book or get higher yields. It sounds like that's going to just continue to be a headwind in the model, the combined ratio is the real kicker, that's where we're going to see the ROE much higher over time.", "Michael S. McGavick", "Yes. This is -- We are underwriting loss ratio focused. I mean that is the driver around here. No question. Now on the investment side, I wouldn't say that there is no ability to, there's just no want or desire to. We like being middle of that pack on the investment side. We've chosen this defensive position. We believe in the current market conditions justify  it and you'll see relatively modest movements in line with how the market conditions involved. We're not going to be heroes there, we intend to be the kinds of underwriters we historically were. And it's not as though there aren't pockets of us that show us what we can do. We have businesses that are operating at this level today. And our Reinsurance business and a number of our Insurance business are achieving these kinds of levels. It's just about making the expectation and reality that the whole firm is doing.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Vinay Misquith with Evercore Partners.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "On the 7 underperforming businesses, just curious as to what the targeted level of combined ratio is, you've done a great job of moving it down to 103.3, but is the high 90s or is it just 100 combined ratio the target? And when do you think that's achievable by?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Well, Vinay, first, we have given explicit forecast on subsets of the business. We've said that over time, we believe will see this year that we'll see margin expansion. Next year, we'll see more exciting results on a relative basis, given where the sectors stand. I stand by that and believe we'll deliver that. A big part of how you get that, Vinay, is getting these businesses to stop beating you in the head. It's impossible to get there when some of these businesses produce such unreliable and often terrible results. And the businesses are working hard at it. How fast -- but what's a rule of thumb? A rule of thumb would be it takes 3 years to turn around a commercial book of business. I mean that's a good rule of thumb to work with. But we didn't start yesterday, we started back at the end of the strategic planning cycle back in '10. Some businesses got more attention quicker, others took longer. We discussed this in detail before how we went through our various review. So they're at an uneven state, each one of them, relative to the speed of turnaround. But I expect this speed of turnaround now to get a little wind behind its sails due to what's going on in rate generally across the market, which is long overdue and well justified by the economics of the business today. So I'm -- I feel encouraged about the work we're doing. I see the steady progress. We have all the short-term metrics you can imagine to make sure everybody's doing what they said they will do. And I feel as good as you can feel when it's moving the right way, but not as fast as you would like. And we'd like it to move it faster and we'll keep working towards that.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Sure, fair enough. Second question was in numbers or question I think in the Costa Concordia loss. Could you please give us a breakdown between the impact on the expenses and the losses of price segments, please?", "Michael S. McGavick", "The billing statement premiums, by and large, it went in 2 different ways for reinsurance and for insurance. Insurance reinstatement premiums ended up costing -- yes, for insurance, $13 million and for reinsurance, it was additional of $5 million. So you can run the math through that.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "So it was a positive $5 million for reinsurance...", "Peter R. Porrino", "And negative $13 million for insurance.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Joshua Shanker with Deutsche Bank.", "Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Two questions. The first one, you made the comment initially that the reserve release related to the quarter were not related to an annual reserve analysis but just quarterly truing up, I suppose. I looked historically, and I don't really see a pattern of the annual reserve study making much of a difference in how you release reserves, can you sort of go into why you made that distinction? What the distinctions are and how you analyze your reserves quarterly versus annually?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Yes, the quarterly, again, is just we take a look at the actual versus expected and where there are and focus on the shorter lines. Where there are unique anomalies, where something is simply manifest and time to react to it we will deal with it uniquely. The reason we emphasize it in this quarter is there was one such unique event which drove a larger than we would usually expect movement out of the professional lines relating to a 10-year-old claim that was resolved during the period, and we felt at that point, we could have waited if you want to follow the model that we use perfectly but we felt that it was simply manifested and should be dealt with. That's why called out the distinction. And again, you're going to get a really good picture and the ability to get all deep in the data when the Global Loss Triangles come out here next week.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "So Josh, just to clarify, it's not annual. It's semiannual where we do the full reserve review.", "Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And the second situation, you mentioned the international casualty growth depending on where that is and what you're looking at the market. This is reinsurance, of course, although we see casualty growth in insurance as well. International casualty markets don't have the same kind of optimistic maybe as U.S. casualty markets. Can we sort of draw some distinctions on where it is exactly that you like the business there compared to what others might be saying about those international casualty markets?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Yes, the growth in our international book has principally been over the last couple years on the U.K. motor market, which is very substantial rate increases,  although we would admit they're slowing down now. Elsewhere, you're correct, it's a fairly competitive market.", "James Veghte", "And I think you also need to be a little bit careful when comparing growth in our reinsurance book from our insurance book, where our transaction count is much lower than Greg's would be on a regular basis. So you could get distorted growth or reduction numbers based on 1 or 2 Underwriting actions.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "On the insurance side, the international casualty growth came in some very targeted activities, typically geographically in Germany. The book renews predominantly at 1 [ph]. So there isn't necessarily any need to project that through the rest of the year. This is a one-one book of business and we were successful in targeting some new customers that we wanted, that we wanted to pick up.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan.", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "A couple of questions. First, I was a little surprised that when you're talking about professional lines, you seem to conclude [ph] to having more business at your hurdles and large account. Can you -- did I hear you right? And I guess any specific industry classes that's happening? I know there's been some capacity withdrawals so I was curious if that's playing a role in that, too.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "It wasn't -- Matthew, it wasn't so much large as difficult, it can come in a variety of sizes. There's nothing that I am aware that would make me think anything industry-specific happening in that book of business. It's more just we've found a few risks that with our somewhat contrarian view, we have thought to hit the hurdles and have written them at a little bit better clip than we did the year before. Again, I want to emphasize this is not a dramatic, large increase but an incrementally increase.", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then Jamie just -- with respect to Japan. I guess not a surprise that, that book isn't as rate adequate as your U.S. book, but just be curious how you think the Japan portfolio compares to Europe now?", "James Veghte", "I would say very close to Europe the way we calculate rate adequacy levels. I won't tell you, I won't go through the entire calculation, but it has moved from sort of a high 70s to the mid 90s, and I would say euro win this probably about the same level and U.S. win the way we calculate it is about 108 to 110.", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just one clarification for Peter. You had mentioned for Costa Concordia, was the only impact on the acquisition and expense ratio is broadly just the reinstatement premium factor, was there some ceding commission going through there as well?", "Peter R. Porrino", "No, the reinstatement premium, that will be both on the driver on the commission and brokerage as well as the operating expense ratios.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Doug Mewhirter with RBC Capital Markets.", "Doug Mewhirter - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Two questions. First, obviously you bought a fair amount of shares back this quarter. I noticed the diluted share count didn't respond as proportionately as I thought. The diluted share count was sequentially -- only went down by about 2 million. Is that a function of the stock going up a little bit and more options in the money, or is there any residual from many of the shares that are converted or anything like that?", "Michael S. McGavick", "I'm going to hand it over to Steve, but it was in the dilution calculation. Do you want to just go through that?", "Stephen Robb", "Yes, it will be options on restricted stocks that have a more diluted effect. I'd have to go back and look at when impact of the conversions of the reinsurance [ph] they were the last -- primarily, the last quarter. So it's mostly just the dilution impact.", "Doug Mewhirter - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. My second question is, I guess, a little bit more conceptual. I know a couple of quarters back, you were commenting on some actuary lines which you thought were actually historically excellent, very profitable lines with 10-year combined ratios of 60s. They were going through periods where the combined ratios run the 90s and the 100s because of a few large losses here and there. And this is Casualty and Property, it's not necessarily -- large property losses could be anything. And it's almost like there is a luck -- a big luck factor involved in any given quarter. How do you think this quarter would be characterized in terms of that factor, where a good line might have had unusual string of losses and a bad -- or a bad line or a challenged line, as you would say, might have had an unusually good string of non-losses, for lack of a better term.", "Michael S. McGavick", "I think that's a very interesting question. Let me give you a little perspective in the line that comes to mind the most, by far the most which is International Property. I think it's true that 3 years ago, in '08 for example, we were talking a lot about large pops, that there was an unusual level of large loss activities. I don't think we were the only ones talking about it. The market was talking about it, too. And I -- and we did talk about how -- if you looked over 10 years, these had been very profitable lines, and we were confident that this was an aberration. But you may remember us being very direct in our disappointment the more we study these lines as the large pops continue. And we felt that the underwriting in this business on deeper examination did not justify the confidence that we have placed in them or the defense that we had made to them 3 years before. And we were pretty candid about that, and I'm trying to continue to be candid about that. Not of our standards. So we really have torn into those books in a very rigorous way using resources from all over the company to try and get at what we think is going on, and how to improve it quickly. And while we'll -- given the kind of large lines, complex risk strategy we have, given the fact that we're not a shop that has large blocks of kind of commodity business around, we will have some more volatility perhaps and others, but I think the level of volatility that XL has been seeing is unreasonable to the size of the blocks of business. And so we have been using a variety of underwriting tactics and other tactics to lessen that volatility. So I just want to give you that thematic comment. With respect to this quarter, I'd say that in general, this was a more favorable quarter, certainly than the kind of stuff that we were going to last year. But every time you say that, you have to say, well, except for Costa Concordia, a true marine catastrophe and happens, marine is a business that were a big and leading player and want to be a leading player in giving results over history. So if I were to characterize the quarter, it was more favorable than what we've been seeing. Certainly less influenced by the kinds of things we were seeing out of International Property. Would I claim that's all because of Underwriting actions at this  stage? No, it's too early for them to all have taken hold. But we would expect over time that it's less and less likely we'll see those kinds of pops because there is less and less opportunity for the kind of practices that were in place before to be influencing the book. So interesting question, and I hope that's responsive.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.", "Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "We appreciate all the color around the underperforming businesses and the initiatives that are going on. The big question I'd ask is big picture, Mike. If the underperforming business is relatively converging with your better business, and I want to recognize it, it's skewed by Contra Costa -- Costa Concordia, pardon me. Just actually, literally, do the math. The question I think is longer term, how much of the improvement you're targeting are you really hoping to get from these underperforming businesses? And how should we think about, I guess, improvements in these businesses versus, say, just broader mix initiatives that you're talking about improving the mix and more property -- or some of these other lines that you're growing? And then just, generally, sort of broad industry pricing and broad repricing at your book. When you think about the weights of those 3 things, how should we be monitoring them> And generally and I wonder if you could give us some targets for us to think about it over the next couple of years.", "Michael S. McGavick", "Yes, I'm going to disappoint you on targets by that level of granularity. I think that gets me too close to the forecasting business, which we try not to be in, except where when we think there's very controllable things we can talk about such as expenses. So as I look up, let me give you a few flavors. First of all, as rate accelerates, it's going to be an obviously bigger part of it, but it changes where you think of your improvement coming from. The fact that we're now seeing positive rate in some of the Casualty business for the first time that we've seen it is one of the biggest positive indicators I can point to. When you have a very large book of already meaningfully profitable business like our professional book and you start to get some positive rate into it as well, that's a  very encouraging fact that prevents the margin there from being hollowed out while you work on the rest and that is a very large portion of our block of business. When you look at the underperforming, which is kind of a quarter of our business, when you start to pull that thing into the 90s, which we are believing we can do at reasonable pace, you then really have taken away one of your biggest deadweights and you turn it into at least at that point, benign. You take those together and you've got about half the book described. You add in specialty businesses, which are performing well by and large. You add in the reinsurance book that continues to provide very good combined. And then you're down to the kind of the portion that is kind of in the market taking phase where we still like the business, and there it's about being very assertive on pricing, doing what we can and not losing our capability for when the turns come. You add all that together and it doesn't -- I think you can see that rate isn't the whole focus. What we can do on those market taking business is every bit as important. Every new dollar of earnings we get there is every bit as important as what's going on in the so-called challenged business. And believe me, somewhere during this year, if things go as I expect, we're going to stop talking about this breakout because it won't be relevant anymore. It will be about how the whole book comes together. But when you have something hurting you as bad as -- what was it, 150 or some ridiculous number on some of these challenged business last year, it really gets your attention, you realize that, that just can't happen, that kind of so-called bad luck is not bad luck, it's not quality underwriting and you've got to get your arms around it. You take out that kind of beating your head on the rock and you can really get this book moving. So there's no -- every dollar of added earnings is valuable no matter where it comes from. And as we get these kind of more aggressive actions completed in these underperforming business, then it's the usual soft market stuff, remix to the more profitable lines, maintain your capability, push rate, explore rate, see what you can do, manage your loss cost as best as you can and you'll come out of it. Sorry that that's not the specific forecast by 3-part division that you want but that's how it's going to happen.", "Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "That's fine. I guess, the final question, that you guys have been in front of some of these issues are certainly related on your own book, but I think it's sort of publicly so. I'm wondering how over the past 6 months sort of -- the tone of this conversation has shifted at conference like RIMS and even in dealing with some of these troubled businesses. We have had to have a lot of tough conversations with these brokers that you have to have big, broad relationships with. Is the market coming to you? And do you think that maybe there is some momentum for taking more pricing in some of the market taking in the price-taking businesses as well?", "Michael S. McGavick", "I really do, I -- the market -- look, this is not a big, radical, sudden hard market. This may be that long-awaited slow appropriate turn that the market has long thought would be great, where we don't just see sudden disruptive events for clients and instead, just a rational conversation towards pricing levels that are acceptable. And as we talk to brokers, their attitude is generally very supportive. I mean, every once in a while on the reinsurance side, we'll see someone put out a study about capacity. But generally, we're on the insurance side, people know that the game has to change. They know that there is a reality to these low-interest rate environments. They know that there is a reality to many companies, I think, increasingly finding their reserves less pull some [ph] and as that plays out, those of us who've been more prudent, those of us who have been more cautious are in a good position. And the brokers understand that. They're seeing more rate-driven behavior, I think by competitors. And as a result, they are, I think, generally very supportive. We've certainly have no big disruptive conversation with them. Occasionally, if you get into some subclass when there is a program involved or something, they'll be a very, very unpleasant conversation. But that's really rare.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Randy Binner with FBR.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "I was hoping to get some color on the PYD that happened in P&C and reinsurance, specifically looking for color on what business lines stood out there and what accident years drove the favorable development?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Well, the -- overwhelmingly, it's the short-tail lines and recent years that we would recognize relatively quickly. So that's the heart of the story. There are couple offsets, as Jamie mentioned in his remarks, about 10 million associated with New Zealand earthquakes where there was some adverse development, some adverse on Dagmar, the Northern European storm. You got offsets, you got short-tail lines, otherwise, being released whether it wasn't -- and then you have the one big one that we're calling out specifically that otherwise wouldn't have been addressed in this quarter it being an A versus E quarter, which was a -- Professional lines loss one client where there was a big settlement and it's from 10 years ago, if I remember the accident. But that's what's driving all this, it's really recent years, short-tail reaction.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Thanks for bringing all that together. And so I guess kind of '03 to '07 liability redundancies, are those pretty much faded at this point or have those have been realized?", "Michael S. McGavick", "I think, next week, you're going to hit the Global Loss Triangle. That's going to be a good place to study that, you want to study carefully because there is always noise of this large event to that large event, you want to get to the underlying trends, so study carefully. But you're going to find, I think, well -- we'll let those speak for themselves and talk about it next quarter because next quarter is when we get the in-depth reviews from the entire book, and that's where we could give you more color on that.", "James Veghte", "I can tell you, Randy, that by class, this quarter, 16.2 part of the 26 was from Property and 7 was from Marine. So very much for short-tail relief [ph].", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Meyer Shields with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Two quick ones. One, is there any reason why the first quarter interest expense shouldn't be a good run rate for the rest of the year?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Well, I'm sorry, could you repeat that?", "Peter R. Porrino", "The answer is no. It should be reasonably the same. I mean, there's a few days of extra interest on the debt that we retired so that, that would be about it.", "Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, Mike. The question was whether the interest rate...", "Michael S. McGavick", "We got it. Pete just listens faster than I do.", "Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Second question just with regard to life re, is there any long-term planning going on right now? It looks like the ROEs on an annual basis are low single digits?", "Peter R. Porrino", "I'm sorry, is there any kind of what plan?", "Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Long-term adjustments?", "Peter R. Porrino", "So we will -- for the life reinsurance book, as we said before, we put it in run off, we would, at the right price -- I mean, we said we would sell that business. The returns -- you have to be a little careful coming up with ROEs. You can describe different levels of capital for that business, right. In fact, if you look at our economic models on the  floor-wide [ph] basis, the returns are actually reasonably strong. The business has been pretty consistent over time. Right, so we're happy to -- we're happy to hold it but we'll be happy to sell it at the right price.", "Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, there is nothing, no updates, I guess, is the right way of asking you.", "Peter R. Porrino", "There is nothing that has happened in that book of business to the last several quarters.", "Michael S. McGavick", "Given that, that block is what has us talking about long-dated European financials, which are, as we mentioned, in the national champions in Northern Europe, but that's the block that's causing us to have that portfolio. You can guess that the likelihood of something stepping up to that, given the uneven news that we continue to experience from Europe is relatively slight.", "Operator", "And our final question is a follow-up question from Michael Nannizzi.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So I guess one question I had is just on the kind of businesses that you've invested in and talent over the last year or so. And kind of what was your baseline expectation for the market overall pricing, those lines of business? And what's your kind of runway as you look out and if conditions change or if they don\u2019t meet your expectations for maybe to reverse course in some areas where maybe you don't see the growth or opportunity that you saw when you made the decision to ramp up?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Good point. First of all, we didn't enter any business where we didn't think there were adequate returns at the point we were entering the business. So none of these were on comp. We thought that there were adequate returns available if we could find the right talent. In terms of loss ratios from Day 1, combined ratios take time because you have to build the book to the size to absorb the cost, so that's all obvious and it will take time. I don't -- I can't give you a precise -- because it will be very different by line of business. I mean Surety can grow very fast for the couple of writings and you could be in great shape then, Surety doesn't cost us very much to begin and I'd really love our guys. I'd be willing to take our time and let the market work out. So it would be a different answer there that it would be on Political Risk where we've made a pretty substantial investment. We like that marketplace right now with all the uncertainty in the world and the quality of our underwriting team. But I do expect them to get going. And they're under pressure and they should be and we're very careful in monitoring very carefully how they're allocating their risk. So you really got to go business by business. I can't give you a real rule of thumb. I think Greg want to add a little color, and I'd like him to.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "The piece on talent, too, is the big component can be also the replacement of leaders that we need to replace to be effective at turning around some of these challenged books of businesses. They can't underestimate the impact of a strong leadership, and Mike and I saw the firsthand of RIMS with a couple of different challenged business where a new leader not only energized the marketplace -- I had people pulling me aside to tell me what a great hire it was, but also how they have observed much better response and actually with the remaining team. The other part of it is there's talent being added in existing lines of business, for instance, North American property where it's a very, very easy metric to watch. How much premium you're getting per underwriter and what kind of returns you gain in the pricing. So not all of this is new business additions.", "Michael S. McGavick", "And then there is probably one last thing to add, is really talented underwriters have a greater utility than just narrow business activity of their own line of business. So we will have cadence where the talent come in, we'll work at the business. We may, in the end, decide that isn't working out like we thought but here is something else you can contribute to this place. And we find that having a community of talent where underwriting talent is what we celebrate, what we try to drive everyday, supported by world-class insurance professionals in every discipline, this is what makes the place fly, and that's why we've had such success as people sense that this is a unique point in XL's history where there is an increasing excitement among that community. And they're being treated in a way that they perhaps haven't experienced in their other places and they just realized they are a part of something special. And we intend to make this a great home for that kind of entrepreneurial, exceptional, complex risk underwriting talent. And we're seeing people -- our doors are knocked on all the time, and we're excited about that.", "Operator", "I'll turn the call back over the speakers for closing remarks.", "Michael S. McGavick", "I don't think I can give a better closer remark than I just did. This was and is becoming again a very special place. We are proud to be a part of it, it's not easy, we've got a long road to hold between where we stand today and our aspirations. But we're driven to bring that to life as quickly as the economics of our business rule out. So thanks for all the time, and we appreciate sharing our story with you.", "Operator", "Thank you, and this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

My name is Shirley, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the XL Group plc Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "David R. Radulski", "", "Thank you, Shirley, and welcome to XL Group's second quarter 2012 earnings conference call. This call is being simultaneously webcast on XL's website at www.xlgroup.com. We've posted to our website several documents, including our quarterly financial supplement.", "On our call today, Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, will offer opening remarks; Pete Porrino, XL's Chief Financial Officer will review our financial results; followed by Greg Hendrick, our Chief Executive of Insurance Operations and Jamie Veghte, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations, who will review their segment results and market conditions. Then we'll open it up for questions. Among those also available for questions are Susan Cross, our Global Chief Actuary; Sarah Street, our Chief Investment Officer and Steve Robb, our Controller.", "Before they begin, I'd like to remind you that certain of the matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates, and expectations. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, and therefore you should not place undue reliance on them.", "Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified on our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date at which they are made and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments, or otherwise.", "With that, I'll turn it over to, Mike McGavick.", "Michael S. McGavick", "Good evening. Tonight, we are pleased to discuss XL's second quarter results. Results with intermediaries have us greatly encouraged, and make no mistake. We are not yet where we want to be across the board, but our actions are taking hold and we are beginning to see emerge the target book we have discussed with you before. So while our work continues in absolute and relative terms this is a very solid quarter.", "To give you a sense of what you can expect from this call. First, I'm going to give you a high-level look at these results, including a brief discussion of our reserve releases, I'll then briefly touch on pricing in the quarter, and then we'll turn to two noteworthy topics; the effect of drought impacting so much of the United States and the developing issues around LIBOR. I'll then turn it over to Pete for a closer discussion of our financial results and to Greg and Jamie to get more granular on our insurance and reinsurance performance.", "Now, first to our overall results. As you saw in our release for the second quarter we reported fully diluted operating earnings of $0.71 per ordinary share and an annualized operating ROE of 9.1%. Again, this is a solid result, especially at this point in the cycle and at this point in XL's improvement. All of this translates to fully diluted tangible book value per ordinary share of $30.65, which is up 3.6% in the second quarter and 8.3% higher than where we began the year. We improved our loss and combined ratios in both insurance and reinsurance and reported a total P&C combined ratio of 90.8% more than four percentage points better than the second quarter last year.", "And most notably, our insurance results continued their recent improvement. The Insurance segment combined ratio ex-cat, ex-PYD improved 98.5%, which is obviously still higher than we would like, but trending in the right direction.", "It is also good to observe that this is the sixth consecutive quarter in which insurance produced a better accident year loss ratio ex-cats. So, as I say, we are delivering on the margin expansion, we expected. Meanwhile, Reinsurance delivered a combined ratio of 72.6%, another really stellar result.", "Turning briefly to pricing; broadly, we continue to see improvement across the vast majority of our lines, especially in insurance and this progress has accelerated through the quarter.", "On reserving, as you'll recall, the second quarter is one in which we regularly perform an in-depth reserve review, and you've already noted in our materials this review again resulted in sizable releases totaling $101 million a positive development in the quarter.", "Now I'll touch on a couple of issues of note. First, with respect to the ongoing drought conditions; as you'll recall our exposure to risks in crop insurance have reduced over recent years, and while we do have some exposure that exposure is manageable and even in extreme conditions for us being unpleasant, but modest earnings event. Jamie will have more detail. Second with respect to LIBOR, I know there are a lot of questions on this topic, particularly as we are [writing] of relevant coverage both in the U.S. and abroad. Unfortunately, the reality is it's just too early to tell how this will play out.", "And finally, I do want to recognize one change in our leadership team that's the addition of Eileen Whelley as our new Chief Human Resources Officer. Eileen has a deep resume, including top HR leadership positions both inside and outside of the Insurance sector and she is already taking a principal role in our ongoing mission to build on what I truly believe is the most talented group of risk professionals in the industry.", "So, as I said at the start, we are encouraged by the results we've reported today. They demonstrate our continued progress and are directly tied to our focus on improving margins, while meeting the needs of our clients.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Pete to discuss the financials in more detail.", "Peter R. Porrino ", "Thanks, Mike and good evening. Operating income for the second quarter was $222 million or $0.71 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to operating income of $243 million or $0.75 a share in the second quarter of 2011.", "Fully diluted tangible book value per share grew $1.07 in the quarter and $2.34 year-to-date. Our P&C combined ratio was 4.1 points better at 90.8% in the same quarter last year. Our accident year ex-cat combined ratio was 93.7% or 5.7 points better than the same quarter last year, due to a reduction in non-cat large loss activity. Our Catastrophe losses decreased by $8 million from the second quarter of 2011 and totaled $61 million in Q2 2012, mostly in the Insurance segment.", "Top line growth was slower in the quarter due to the impact of FX in certain areas of targeted non-renewal. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange the Insurance segment gross premiums written increased by 4.2% and the Reinsurance segment decreased by 3.4%. The same percentages on a net premiums written basis were an 8.1% increase for insurance and a 1.9% decrease for reinsurance. The Insurance segment movement includes a positive shift in business mix towards top performing lines, which Greg will expand on. The reinsurance decrease is due primarily to selective cancellations and the timing of renewals.", "During the second quarter we completed our normal semiannual detailed review covering virtually all of our loss reserves across our Property and Casualty business lines. There were no material changes in approach or methodology. Prior year development in the quarter was a favorable $101 million or 7.2 loss ratio points. This reflects favorable development of $43 million and $58 million in the Insurance and Reinsurance segments respectively. ", "Positive movements came from the Casualty and U.S. Professional Insurance lines, as well as casualty reinsurance lines, partially offset by strengthening mainly in Insurance International Professional, and excess and surplus lines. You will note that our interest expense for deposit liability accretion in the consolidated statements of income in the financial supplement increased by $19 million this quarter. This is due to an annual review of our runoff structured products business, which resulted in higher interest charges due to changes in expected cash flow timing on certain structured workers compensation contracts that are accounted for as deposits.", "The net loss this quarter related to that reserve review was less than $10 million since there was positive reserve development on contracts accounted for as reinsurance. That positive PYD is included in the $58 million, I previously mentioned for the Reinsurance segment.", "Our combined $299 million of operating expenses for the second quarter was up 12.4% or $33 million year-over-year. This is on track with the full-year expectations we communicated earlier in the year. The year-over-year increase arose principally from cross supporting our strategic initiatives and higher compensation costs from both, growth and headcount associated with new business initiatives and certain severance costs. ", "At $188 million net income on the P&C portfolio in the second quarter was 12.2% below the prior year, due primarily to lower new money rates, as well as cash outsourced from the investment portfolio.", "The P&C gross book yield at the end of the quarter was 3.1%. We achieved an average new money rate on our P&C portfolio in the quarter of 2.2%. We expect net investment income will remain under pressure given interest rate levels and our estimate that approximately $3.4 billion of P&C assets with an average gross book yield of 2.8% will mature and paid down over the next 12 months.", "Our net income from investment affiliates was $17 million, down $34 million from the prior year. This is driven by an especially strong prior year quarter from our investment management affiliates compared to solid results this quarter.", "Realized losses on investments were $12 million compared to realized losses of $10 million in the prior year quarter. Our realized losses include $28 million in OTTI charges, which is consistent with the prior year quarter.", "The total return of our entire portfolio was 1.4% for the quarter and contributed to book value growth with the positive mark-to-market of $131 million. This was driven by decreasing rates, particularly in the U.S. which were partially offset by widening credit spreads.", "The P&C fixed income duration decreased by 0.2 years from the end of the first quarter to 2.9 years due to the accumulation of cash and cash equivalents in the portfolio given the heightened risks associated with the continuing turmoil in Europe, at least the end of the first quarter the life portfolio duration increased by 0.1 years to 8.6 years.", "Our fixed income holdings in Eurozone countries are again listed in our financial supplement. We continue to have negligible exposure to sovereigns, and financial institutions in the peripheral countries. Our $400 million exposure to Eurozone banks, including $143 million in covered bonds remains largely to national champions in northern Europe. Through targeted sales and maturities, we reduced our Eurozone holdings by $173 million during the quarter, principally in the financial sector.", "We bought back $125 million of our ordinary shares in the second quarter purchasing and canceling 6.1 million ordinary shares at an average cost of $20.44, leaving $525 million available for purchase under the current program. We continue to balance new business opportunities with the attractive economics associated with share repurchases and we are not looking to add to our surplus capital position.", "I'll now turn it over to Greg to discuss our Insurance segment results.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Thanks, Pete and good evening. Tonight I'll cover the Insurance segment results for the quarter, provide an update on the corrective actions we're taking in our challenged businesses, comment on our recent talent changes and provide a summary of current market conditions.", "Starting with results, I'm happy to share that we made progress again this quarter both on profitable growth and more importantly on continued improvement in accident year combined ratio. And while I'm pleased with our improved performance, we remain focused on operating Insurance segment at a lower combined ratio.", "Insurance segment's combined ratio, excluding cat and prior year development of 98.5% improved by 5 points relative to second quarter of last year, driven primarily by the current year loss ratio. Our combined ratio for the quarter was 99.1% or 1.2 points higher than the same quarter last year, driven by 1.6 point increase in the operating expense ratio. This is largely due to increased compensation costs related to continued upgrades in our talent as well as expansion in a number of our businesses.", "On the loss side, the current accident loss ratio excluding cats was 65.8% improving by 6.8 points year-over-year. As Mike mentioned, this marks the sixth consecutive quarter of improved accident quarter ex-cat results.", "Our reported loss ratio of 66.2% reflected cat activity of 4.9 points as the second quarter of 2012 was impacted by $49 million in cat losses and reinstatement premiums compared to only $13 million in the second quarter of 2011. This was largely driven by a single risk loss in each of the Midwest tornadoes and the China earthquakes. This cat activity is partially offset by prior year reserve releases of $43 million or 4.5 points in the quarter compared to $64 million last year.", "Insurance gross premiums written grew by $114 million or 8.9% in the quarter after normalizing for foreign exchange and the planned non-renewal of one large foreign account. While this growth reflects success in our targeted new businesses, such as political risk and North America construction we also had strong growth in some of our higher-margin businesses including U.S. Professional and Marine & Offshore Energy.", "The second topic is an update on the businesses that we have been referring to as challenged. The combined ratio for the challenged businesses in the quarter was 125.7% and in the remainder of our book we reported a 90.6 combined ratio. Prior year reserve changes namely strengthening in the challenged businesses and releases in the performing businesses explained much of this variance.", "If you look at performance on an accident year basis, excluding cats, the second quarter combined ratio in the challenged business drops to 105.6%, while the remainder of the book reported 96.2% combined ratio. As we indicated earlier in the year, the quarterly improvement of the challenged businesses will have some volatility given the nature of large risk insurance.", "Our shift towards businesses with the higher margin has resulted in the challenged businesses representing a smaller portion of the segment. In fact for the second quarter on a net premium written basis, adjusted for foreign exchange, challenged businesses shrunk by 11%, while performing businesses grew by 15% as compared to this quarter last year. This was not by accident.", "Some of the corrective actions we discussed last quarter. Management of cat capacity, deemphasizing guaranteed cost, workers compensation and re-underwriting our New York contractors\u2019 general liability portfolio are having the intended consequences from a top line perspective. And we expect the benefits from our activities will lead to continued margin expansion with time.", "Clearly, we still have work to do, but with new leaders and disciplines in place for many of these businesses we\u2019re confident that we are implementing the right strategies to turn these books around.", "Moving on to talent, we further enhanced our teams throughout this segment in the quarter. We added to our already strong insurance leadership with the arrival of Jason Harris, Head of International Property and Casualty. We expanded our regional excess casualty team with the addition of new underwriting talent in Dallas, Philadelphia and Kansas City. We recruited a cyber liability team with underwriters in New York, Atlanta and Chicago. We also broadened our E&S capabilities by adding umbrella and excess casualty underwriting expertise. In our distribution network team added new talent to improve our local presence in Mexico and Spain.", "Finally, let's turn to current market conditions. In the second quarter we once again saw positive rate indications in all of our business groups, with an overall segment rate increase of 4%. To put this in a context, we haven\u2019t seen a rate increase of this magnitude since 2003. Further 20 out of 24 businesses in the Insurance segment saw large rate increases in the second quarter when compared to the first quarter of this year. Not only did we see 6% rate increases in our North American P&C portfolio, led by double-digit rate increases in our property and E&S businesses, but our international P&C portfolio was also up nearly 3%.", "In specialty lines, we saw an increase of 5% led by marine and offshore energy, and in our professional book rates were up 2%, including 3% in our U.S. D&O business. As we indicated last quarter, this return to gradual sustained rate improvement is something we've been expecting and we believe it must continue given the industry's insufficient investment returns, particularly in long tail lines of business.", "And while we are pleased with these pricing improvements, we still face a competitive marketplace where underwriting experience and discipline coupled with improved analytics, are critical to selecting the best risks. While rate continues to be a very important factor, expansion of margin is our ultimate measure of success.", "And now to Jamie to discuss Reinsurance results.", "James H. Veghte ", "Thanks, Greg, and good evening. The Reinsurance segment had an excellent quarter of underwriting results with a combined ratio of 72.6%, producing an underwriting profit of $120.9 million. These results were impacted by prior year reserve releases of $58.4 million and cat losses in the quarter of $11.2 million, net of reinstatement premiums. Excluding the impact of these items, our combined ratio was 83.2%, which compares favorably to the combined of 90% in the second quarter of last year on the same basis.", "During this quarter, $46.6 million of prior year releases were released from our U.S. business unit which does a major reserve review in the second and fourth quarters of each year. While $34.9 million of these releases were from casualty lines, we remain very cautious on recent underwriting years and the majority of these releases were from the 2005 underwriting years and prior.", "On a year-to-date basis, this segment has a combined ratio of 77.4%, which compares to the 112% combined last year. Excluding the impact of cat losses and prior year development, the six month combined of 85.9% compares favorably to the 88.9% in 2011.", "With respect to top line, gross premiums written in the quarter were $452.4 million, a 4.2% reduction from the second quarter of 2011. Our year-on-year premium saw reductions in our North American, European and Latin American business units and a significant increase from XL Re Bermuda driven by increases in our Japanese cat portfolio and a changed inception date on one large treaty. The reductions in our other profit centers were driven by selective cancellations, share reductions and some timing differences.", "Turning to market conditions, we were broadly pleased with the mid-year renewals, though the rate of increase on Southeast wind renewals were below our expectations. Our risk-adjusted improvement on this book was 5% below the 8% to 10% we expected and quoted going into the renewal season. There was abundant capacity available in both traditional and non-traditional forms to play substantial programs in the market. ", "Notwithstanding this we would point out that this is a portfolio that had a very healthy increase in the 2011 mid-year renewal and remains the most attractive component of our cat portfolio as measured by rate adequacy in our pricing system. On the long-tail side our position remains highly defensive as we continue to navigate through an improving, but still competitive primary and reinsurance market environment.", "Finally with respect to our crop book you'll recall 2011 was our final year as the fronting carrier for the Heartland Crop program due to the sale of the agency. We continued this year as a quota share reinsurer of the new owner and through the second quarter this year we have booked $11.6 million of net earned premium at a technical combined ratio of 82.7%, which does not include operating expenses. This was driven principally by the solid performance of the winter weak component of the portfolio. Our projected premium for the year is $58 million from this source and we do protect the book with stop-loss reinsurance attaching at a loss ratio of 110%, we buy 40 points to cover with 5% co-participation up the pillar.", "In addition, we write a book of aggregate stop-loss business on this class out of our Bermuda business unit. There our total aggregate limits are $41 million with just over 50% of the book attaching that loss ratios of 130% or higher.", "With that, I'll turn it over to David for Q&A.", "David R. Radulski", "Shirley, please open the lines for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays. You may ask your question.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thanks and good afternoon. Mike before everyone goes out and starts raising their estimates dramatically that insurance combined ratio underlying of 98.5%, I think it was the best in eight quarters. What\u2019s your expectation in terms of being able to repeat that level going forward?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Well. First, Jay thanks for the question. Your perspective is a good one. I think I mentioned on our call last quarter that well I feel that things are going directionally correctly and we\u2019re very pleased with the progress. If I go back kind of in the fourth quarter, I felt that well some of the long-term issues in some of the challenged businesses were coming home to roost, that we were actually a bit on the unlucky side. ", "In the sense that a lot of stuff all happened at once, and I think I would put this quarter in the same context in the reverse. I think this was a favorable quarter. I think, at this point we are well on the way in a lot of the corrective actions we\u2019ve undertaken and we would expect results to be improving and we have said so. Could this one have been a bit luckier just as the fourth quarter of last year was a bit more unlucky?", "Could be, so our attitude is look, as long as we\u2019re continuing to deliver on the activities that we plan, as long as we continue to see the margin improve in the way in which we would expect we will be pleased. And given that we\u2019re in the large loss business we should expect some volatility quarter-to-quarter, but directionally this is consistent with our actions, we would just say that it'll take a bit more time before we say there is less luck and more of our actions really taking hold in the book. Greg, you might want to add something to that, but that\u2019s the basic sense we would have around here we feel good, would we say this is absolute proof? No, we wouldn\u2019t say that yet.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "No, I totally agree Mike.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. And then a separate one on crop, Jaime, for the reinsurance exposure, what's the potential maximum possible loss in the second half of '12 from the crop reinsurance exposure?", "James H. Veghte", "Okay. Thanks Jay. Maybe I'll give you perhaps a bit more information than you just asked, so some of the information others may be wondering about will get answered as well. There are two components to our crop exposure, the first is Heartland, it\u2019s the only proportional contract we write. We write at 30% quota share on that book of business with a 7.5% commission. ", "We expect $57.8 million of premium on a gross basis to be booked during the year. We buy stop-loss cover of 95% of [40x] of 110. So assuming that we totaled the stop-loss cover, the exposure would be the 10% retention, which would be $5.8 million, the 5% co-par up the stop-loss which would be another $1.15 million and the 7.5% commission, which would be 4.3. So that would be $11.25 million of underwriting loss. ", "The book is 50% corn, 18% soy, 20% wheat and 12% cotton and other. The largest states are Minnesota at 21%, which is a very good yield state so far; Texas at 12%, followed by South Dakota at 11%, Nebraska at 11%, Illinois at 8.5%, and Kansas at 8%. The book is split 50-50 between states in the Tier 1 category and Tier 2 and the way the government program works with the 500% gross loss ratio Tier 1 is capped at 194 and Tier 2 at 150. I'd also remind you as I mentioned in my opening remarks 20% of the book is in the winter wheat category which is already done and performed very well. ", "We also overlay both the corn and the soy states against the U.S. state progress report and mapped our portfolio with states that have greater than 50% rating of poor or very poor. And in corn our book is 19% in that category versus what we believe in industry number of 24% and soy is 19% versus 21% for the industry.", "So, bottom line on this book as we think it will be extremely difficult to go through the top of our stop-loss program and therefore the answer to your question is the downside risk is about $11.25 million to $11.5 million depending on when the premium comes out for that part of the portfolio. The stop-loss portfolio out of Bermuda is a little bit more difficult to measure at this point in the growing season. As I mentioned, we have $41 million of total in-force aggregate, ranging in attachment points from just over 100 all the way up to 140, 150 but I picked 130 as sort of key demarcation retention for what I kind of view as maybe the downside in the industry.", "So, about half the book attaches at 130 or above and about half below. We have got no noticeable loss on a provisional basis for many of our customers. We have nine customers in that portfolio and frankly most of them are very reluctant to give us much information at this point. So, we will know a lot more by the end of the third quarter, but if you wanted the total Armageddon downside it would be the in-force aggregate on the stop-loss and the figures I have quoted on Heartland.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "The 41 plus an underwriting loss of '11?", "James H. Veghte ", "Right.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. Thanks. And if I can sneak one more and Mike on the LIBOR exposure, I understand it's early days on D&O, but maybe you can give us a perspective on the mix of business in terms of exposure to large integrated financial companies as a percentage of the book?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Yeah let's have Greg walk through some of the details that we can give, but again I just want to underscore this one is going to take a while to sort out and it's going to be really interesting to see how much if any winds up being covered loss as opposed to a big market mess. Anyway, Greg?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Thanks Mike. Thanks Jay. We know at this juncture the government investigations and resulting litigations involving the finance institutions are ongoing, and in some instances at very early stage. Because it's a developing event, it will take some time for us to come up with any kind of precise loss estimate. ", "However, let me give you a brief macro perspective some general coverage observations and some facts around our professional portfolio. From a macro perspective, the uncertainty begins the lack of clarity around how many of the institutions engaged in the saying of LIBOR, were not following established guidelines. That uncertainty is amplified by the inability at this point in time to establish the specific culpability of a particular insured.", "And further the amount of U.S. securities exposure through U.S. exchange ADRs would also impact any loss potential given they follow the level of class actions outside of North America. If we shift to the general coverage observations standard D&O policies issued to public companies typically exclude coverage for regulatory fines and penalties.", "In addition, entity coverage in a public D&O policy does not protect against antitrust allegations. And finally, Side A coverage response only if a company cannot indemnify an individual director or officer, and looking at our professional insurance portfolio, our mix of business helps us navigate any potential exposure as well. We have a blend of primary and excess as well as the strong geographic distribution.", "As with the case of our entire portfolio, the financial institutions book has a blend of Side A, full coverage D&O and E&O. In fact, over half of our large financial institutions exposure is Side A only, which is a far more limited coverage potential. Specifically, to our international financial institutions business, we reduced our average limit by 20% over the last few years, which will mitigate any potential loss severity. The only thing I can add is, as you would expect Jay, we are monitoring the situation very closely.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thanks. Your next question comes from Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.", "Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JPMorgan", "Hi, thank you. Good evening everybody. First question is just, could you may be quantify just the large, how much of the improvement year-on-year you would attribute to the large loss side and then we can kind of do our own math in terms of the mix shift and kind of reworking the portfolio?", "Michael S. McGavick", "I am going to turn that over to Greg in a moment. But it isn't just large loss that\u2019s improved here. Without question, we are seeing the impact of our re-underwriting and the mix shift as every bit is important as what's going in the large losses. The other thing I would add is our improvement in a large loss performance wouldn\u2019t all be arbitrary. We've been changing the way we\u2019re underwriting, changing the way we\u2019re putting limits into the market and changing the way we\u2019re using reinsurance. So the difference between large loss performance in the quarter or a year ago in this quarter wouldn\u2019t only be fortuity, it would also be actions that we have undertaken.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Yes, there is a lot of moving parts ins and outs, the main drivers last this quarter last year were in our satellite and our marine portfolio, and this year there's one in property and one in upper middle market, but roughly two points of benefit quarter-over-quarter.", "Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay. Thanks for that. It wasn\u2019t implying that there it was just luck, in the question.", "Michael S. McGavick ", "No, no, I was just essentially the fact that I said there is luck in there somehow, or at least we feel that way and we didn\u2019t want to think it was \u2013 that\u2019s all that\u2019s going on here, sorry.", "Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JPMorgan", "That\u2019s fair. I guess just with respect to the life, I mean this is something I think we revisited from time-to-time over the past couple of years, but just with the life reinsurance portfolio, with kind of the financial system or companies within the industry starting to repair their balance sheets little bit. ", "Any new thoughts in terms of kind of end game for that business and I'd just be curious if you could maybe talk a little bit about the equity you've allocated to that, when we think about what the returns how much that might be dampening the returns that are being generated on the P&C side or kind of obfuscating those from coming to the surface?", "Michael S. McGavick ", "Yeah, I'll start, this is Mike and I'll turn it over to Pete. The bottom-line is there are some improvements, as you say there is some rationalization going on among the life players and that really has our attention. We would love to think that as conditions become clear or improve that there would be alternatives to just a slow run up. At the same time, we want to be very thoughtful, economic oriented stewards of your money and this thing has some particular challenges with respect to GAAP and in terms of sort of true economics that we have to pay very close attention to as we consider alternatives. ", "Now, we have always said, hey, if someone has a great idea, we are all ears. We continue to have folks reach out and share their ideas with us, none of those has yet caused us to go forward, but we are going to keep pushing, because we do see it as something that in the end is not a part of our future and the sooner that's true I think the better for all of us. And obviously, the portfolio that is connected with being in this run-up is part of what gives us this very unfortunate and I think to some degree unfair nexus to what's going on over in Europe and the sooner that misimpression is shed the better the firm will be. But to get a little more specific I'll turn it over to Pete.", "Peter R. Porrino ", "Thanks Michael, you have covered the most of it extremely well, you covered all of it very well. But I will try and add just a little bit more there. So, one thing Matt that is difficult to see from what we put on the financial supplement is what's there is a total, is a total amount of capital that's been ascribed to the life book, but we use that capital in our P&C business as well. ", "So, it isn't as simple as just taking the return on the $1.9 billion and saying I can go and if I remove that the impact on the ROE would be easily calculated. So, we've taken a look at it. If you look at a rating agency capital, if you look at an economic capital derivation you'll find that it is materially, materially less than the $1.9 billion. ", "That being said, I mean, I will just echo what Mike said, it is not something that we are looking to keep long-term. We do think right now with all that's going on in Europe it is a difficult transaction to see happen in near term. That being said, we've got our doors opened for as Mike said, interesting conversations.", "Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay. Thanks for that.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Jay Cohen. You may ask your question. And you are from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Yeah. Thank you. Just two maybe smaller number questions. First, I guess it was Pete, you had mentioned that there were some severance expenses in the overheads. Can you quantify that for us?", "Peter R. Porrino", "Sure Jay. It's year-to-date about $5 million.", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Evenly split in the quarters roughly?", "Peter R. Porrino", "Yeah, roughly.", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And on the reinsurance side I believe you mentioned there was one large treaty where there was I guess a timing difference or the inception had changed. And I'm wondering does that impact the comparison in the second half of the year?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Certainly in the Latin America it will Jay because, actually just a couple of accounts change their anniversary date from June 30 to July 1, so they become Q3 events, so that's all about $11 million.", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "So if those are renewed as it would obviously aid the comparison in the third quarter from a top line standpoint?", "Gregory S. Hendrick ", "Correct.", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Great. That\u2019s all I got. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.", "Michael Zaremski \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thanks. As a follow-up to some of the earlier margin questions would you say a majority of the underlying improvement is from business mix changes? I know Mike earlier in the prepared remarks you said that the challenged businesses, I'm not sure if you meant premiums, I'd have to read back through it, but it fell by 12%. Did that accelerate from last quarter or from previous quarters?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Yeah. First of all, I think the basic answer to your question is yes. I would say it's more than half and I would say I expected to decelerate over the course of the last half of the year. And we have talked about this before. The reality is that as you start working your way through the book, it all depends on the timing by business, by line, by account, and when you get your mix on that renewal and get to work it. And obviously those things that you don't like that you get off, you get an immediate reduction in your risk and those things that you feel you can modify to have better terms you get a reduction in your risk going forward from that point. And as the book works its way through, we would expect to be able to confidently say that more of it has to do with our actions than with simple flow of fortuity during the quarter. ", "Again, one of the things I emphasized when we talked about all this at the end of the year and called out ourselves on this idea that we had a handful of challenged businesses was, one, I think unfortunate results of doing that was that people thought maybe we were just getting started on this work when in fact we've been working and focused on these businesses and all of our businesses throughout last year. ", "So some of these we would have already started the process of re-underwriting going back now more than a year others got more attention over the course of the last half year So you kind of almost have to and we do by the way internally, we chart it out by business, by action and by expected benefit of that action over the timeframe of getting to the renewals and having those actions take hold in the market.", "And so every quarter we would expect to be able to more confidently say that a still greater percentage of the result is due to our actions and where we think we've been fortunate, we\u2019ll say so, where we think we have been unfortunate, we\u2019ll say so. That\u2019s the nature of the large risk we take on. ", "I guess I'd only make one other point, by the end of the year I don't expect to be talking anymore about challenged businesses as a separate reporting item. All of our businesses go in and out of favor depending on market conditions that are unique to them and depending on the new issues that may arise in the industry. We view it ourselves as governing these 35 separate businesses and where they'll each stand at any moment, will be something we'll discuss with you as much transparency as we can, but through the end of the year we'll keep you up-to-date on our progress, so that you can track it, after that I think it just all goes back together it's XL and hopefully by then we are all as excited as we are about this quarter.", "Michael Zaremski \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, then one follow-up then on the challenged businesses and hopefully we won't be talking about this going forward, but in the prepared remarks, I thought I had heard the delta, the combined ratio delta between the challenged and the performing businesses being wider versus last quarter, was that correct or maybe the challenged businesses are just smaller, so even today is wider, didn\u2019t have as big of an impact?", "Michael S. McGavick", "It\u2019s true, it\u2019s wider all-in, but that\u2019s because the movement that we saw that was meaningful in the quarter really had to do with prior year development. We had positive prior-year development on our better businesses, but on the challenged businesses we did have some adverse development, so you saw a widening perception of GAAP, but on an accident year basis, they are actually coming together. ", "Michael Zaremski \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. And lastly\u2026", "Michael S. McGavick", "On an accident year, ex-Cat, basis they are coming together.", "Michael Zaremski \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. And lastly, is there anyway for us do you think about alternative investment income in the next quarters, is it too early to tell?", "Michael S. McGavick", "I would say it's too early to tell, but you can look at our information we've disclosed what\u2019s disclosed either on a month or a one-month or a quarter lag, so you can, you know the market better than we do, so you can predict that probably as well as we can if not better.", "Michael Zaremski \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thank you very much, for your answers", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.", "Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Thank you very much. I don\u2019t know want to use the word challenged businesses, so maybe I want to talk about the business that you allowed leave the company. Everyone's talking about prices going up here. What do you think the rate increases could have been on the businesses that you let go off and would those have a better rate increases than the business that you are keeping that you think is a better quality business in general?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Well. I am going to just give a general observation and turn over to Greg. The general observation would be that if we thought we could get rate and if we thought that rate was the cure, we would write the piece of the business. We believe though that there are accounts out there that have been a part of the portfolio that we simply think the best answer is that we part ways. When we see it that way we are going to call that chart and move on and that\u2019s why you see part of the remixing coming from business we are walking away from as opposed to simply care by a rate. Often the way that happens is we'll put the price out there in the market that we think is appropriate to the risk and the market will take the risk at a lesser rate than that and so it goes. I'll turn it over to Greg for specific color.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Yeah, I break it into three parts one would be our international property book where we know for a fact that rate's not there. So we are gaining about, we got about 3% in the quarter the business that we shared was flat to down 10% and so we know that we are not missing out on rate. Shift a little bit to our E&S book where we are getting rate in fact double digit rate. And there I would say we've kept a few pieces of the business, but within that business is a mix of things that rate can cure and things that rate can't cure. So we are keeping the business where we get the rate and shedding it out. There some is just structurally not efficient which rate doesn't really matter and I would say in our US MR business the guaranteed workers' compensation book would be an example there. The only thing that matters there is getting the right level of deductible and the right coverage for us. And so they could put 30% more rate on it, it doesn't matter. It's not going to be a profitable piece of business in our opinion.", "Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Is there any way that you can quantify retention among large accounts in a way that I would understand?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Well, our retention overall, I'll give you the color, our retention overall for this segment is 82%.", "Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "How does that compares with the past?", "Gregory S. Hendrick ", "That's down from the prior year of about 86% in the quarter and most importantly, particularly in our international property book we are down below 60s there. So we would spend all day doing every business, but that's kind of a marker of the spread and the further spread point I gave you is also E&S, which is probably most of you know, we usually run in the 40% or 50% retention ratio if you're running a good book because there is a lot of turnover there. We're down in the high teens on that book. So it's a widespread by business, but we're down and I think that's the right sign, because as you know, when you are getting down on those low 80s you know you're pushing the rate just about the right amount, you're not going too hard, you're not going too soft.", "Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Well. Thank you. That\u2019s all very helpful, great quarter.", "Gregory S. Hendrick ", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question.", "Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Hi, good afternoon. And congratulations on the progress you have been making, no doubt a lot of heavy lifting. I was hoping that we could talk a little bit more about the business you have been growing in and just the two questions are on casualty professional lines. ", "If I am reading this correctly it's something up like 17% year-to-date, and I would love to get a sense of your view of sort of the current profitability and attractiveness of this business given some competitors seem to be taking and also talking about taking prices up dramatically in some segments, including D&O and perhaps some areas of E&O, and some concern about just whether recent vintages have been as profitable as everyone had originally thought?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Thanks Josh. Let me start with the professional piece and the 17%, I believe you're quoting the net number.", "Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Yes.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "So the biggest portion of the book that we have is our U.S. D&O business and while I cited a 2.5% rate increase, we don't follow a practice of underwriting here where there is a blanket rate increase mandated on an entire book of business. So it\u2019s a very lumpy rate increase. There is great risks that are renewing at flat and there is also risk that we are getting a lot more than the 2.5% I said. As we get that rate, we\u2019re hitting our benchmark of where we want to be on that business. So part of it in the professional lines is business on our biggest book coming in at the right profitability level. ", "The other piece of it is we are retaining more of that business now. From April 1, we changed our session on our professional reinsurance to keep more of what we think as a profitable book. So you get the two pieces acting together there on the net premium number.", "Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "That\u2019s great. That\u2019s was going to be one of my other questions. So have you guys made similar changes across a lot of your other businesses, because to drive some of these net to gross differences?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "That\u2019s the main driver of where we\u2019re retaining more in the quarter, that the property reinsurance also renewed and we paid more money, but ceded the same expected margin away, but it isn\u2019t of a dramatic variation like you saw on professional.", "Peter R. Porrino", "But Josh, the one thing I would add to Greg, if there was, I think Greg mentioned one contract that was a large program that was 100% ceded that was, so that also drove our ceded ratio.", "Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "That's great and if I could just ask sort of the color question that comes to mind on other specialty which has a similar maybe net-to-gross issue, but even our earned premiums base is growing relatively materially. I'd love to get some color around sort of the political risk business you are putting on as well as surety and trade credit and if you guys have any sort of European exposures on that liability book we should be thinking about anticipating or you have been frankly underwriting around to avoid? Thank you.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Sure. On the other specialty, the political risk business is the biggest piece, it's not adding, we haven\u2019t written anything with exposure to continental Europe to answer your question directly. It\u2019s more spread around countries that are transitioning, in my language from emerging to merged economies. So it's a very well spread book, it's very early days of course as well, but it\u2019s a very well spread book in terms of exposures. We have also started up the inland marine line of business as well in North America, which I believe falls into the other specialty as well, so those are the two biggest pieces of that bucket.", "Michael S. McGavick", "And again, the one comment that I would make Josh, we made it last quarter as well, those lines do not map to when we talk about our specialty business, for example, they don't necessarily map. That is more of a, I'll call it a U.S. statutory line of business than it is the way we actually run our business.", "Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. Great, thanks for the time.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Bob Glasspiegel with Langen McAlenney. You may ask your question.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "I think this is related to Josh's last question. Good evening everyone. Your press release yesterday Barbara Luck joining you highlighted that you are touting a new risk appetite for large primary casualty accounts. I didn't know whether there was more of a PR press release or a signal to the analyst community that you are in more of a growth mode on large primary casualty. If you are in a growth mode, I'd like to hear that amplified?", "Peter R. Porrino", "Sure. Thanks Bob for the question. We are and this is one caveat I'd give to and I have another strong reason why we need to stop just trying to segment out challenged businesses from perform and just talk about what's going in XL Insurance as a whole. U.S. risk management and primary casualty is one of our challenged businesses, and the challenges come from the prior underwriting activities. ", "We added Ken Riegler and Jay Lefkowitz late last year, Barbara is part of that team, I am a pretty frugal person, I am not fond of paying for people that aren't going to produce on the bottom line so that is a very deliberate growth mode for that business where we are looking to the right kind of risk management in primary casualty business where on the risk management side you get the right kind of structures around captives and self-insured retentions. ", "On the primary casualty there will be a flavor towards kind of the companies that have international exposure where we can add value with our global network so that's a deliberate growth that we will execute on.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Okay, so it is a change in this little segment that you want to be more aggressive?", "Michael S. McGavick ", "This is Mike, Bob. You and I would have talked about these lines of businesses even go back to days at C&A. I think that the risk managed account business is an attractive business and one that fits very naturally with the kinds of clients we take on around the shop. ", "And the fact is that our risk management operation, our U.S. risk management operation had previously I think missed a couple of important themes to the plot; number one, generally speaking stay away from guaranteed cost business it isn't that attractive and I certainly think that would have been something we would have talked about in the past you and I; and second that if you're going to be in the risk managed account business you need a couple things. ", "First, you need a lot of people with proven track records in the space who have both the knowledge and the relationships to execute the business plan and that we have been attracting and we are very pleased to have these folks having joined our team with the kinds of track records that they have. And then second you have to look at your own portfolio and your own unique skill set and say what is that we can do uniquely for clients with these folks on board and there we looked at the kind of innovation and the global footprint that we have and we say there are clients in the house who already like XL where we can make a big difference for now that we have this expertise.", "So, that's where we're headed and that's where it's all done. So, in the narrow context it will be a chain story away from one kind of business toward another and as the netting effect of that goes into the past it will be a growth story overall.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Vinay Misquith with Evercore Partners. You may ask your question.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Hi, good evening. See first question is on the margins in the so-called challenged business. Do you think you are pretty close to reaching your profitability by the year-end or do you think some more actions will be required for next year?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Quite simply, Vinay, the answer to that one, this is Greg. The answer is no, they're not, at 105.6 combined ratio we're not where we need to be. That's not the target combined ratio we have for these businesses. So, there is still actions that we've already taken that need to earn through and some further actions that we have planned to happen in subsequent quarters need to have us and move us, much lower than we are now.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Okay. Fair enough. And just as a follow-up to that seems that the top line growth is slowing and that's a good thing because you are pulling back the amount of underperforming businesses, should we expect that slower top line growth to continue for the next one year as you [reaching] the portfolio to a more profitable business.", "Michael S. McGavick ", "I would say and as part of the commentary from the last question from Bob was there are businesses that are in the challenged category at the moment whereas this U.S. risk management and primary casualty we just discussed were submission flow by the way is much higher than its ever been before and we are winning the accounts as we speak. As you pull down guaranteed comp business you are pulling down high premium items and you are putting on U.S. risk management business where the net premium impact also is going to be lower, but as they are successful they'll move.", "So that I would not project a fixed growth pattern based on what you are seeing. I will end by saying absolutely that right now for us in the insurance segment. If given the trade between top line and profitable margin we are going for profitable margin. Where the market goes I don\u2019t know, that's another component of why I can't give you a direct answer on what we see for the quarters ahead.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Sure. Fair enough. And just on the expense part of that equation since we are seeing the global economy slowing and then the significant portion of your premiums are in Europe. Do you have some levers on the expense side that you can pull to reduce the expense ratio? Thanks.", "Michael S. McGavick", "Yeah, this is Mike. The answer to that is yes, as we've been making these investments which we have been doing for the last couple of years. We've been constantly looking for how the investments allow us to operate in a more efficient way, and we believe as we get into the back half of the year, it's time for the reasons you cite the continued economic uncertainty, what's going on and the difficult challenges our European client space, and just the need to get to the level of returns through expanding margin that we've promised we'll be taking a very hard look in the back half of the year as to what we can do in addition to accelerate the benefits and advantages that are created by these investments, some of which are about inside and we'll be continuing investments.", "Some of which were about enhanced leverage of our platform, and those would be places where we might be able to start capturing some of the advantage, so that will be an intense examination that Pete and others in the firm will be leading in the back half of the year.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners", "That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thanks. First off, Greg, thank you so much for that additional disclosure on a crop, that was a granularity was really helpful, so thanks for that. One question I had is on non-cat property insurance, what sort of rate change are you seeing there right now and just a quick follow-up?", "Michael S. McGavick", "You are looking for that from reinsurance or insurance or both?", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Mostly on the insurance side, because it looked like that\u2019s where premiums fell a bit on a year-over-year basis.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Yeah, you have to split it into two pieces, in North America we were just over 10% ratings.", "Michael S. McGavick", "Positive", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "We just are over 10% rate increase. ", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Right, okay.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "And in the international property piece we are at the 6% rate increase in the quarter, so both, one in North America far exceeding any increase due to trend. And in international, a very positive sign, and this is the first quarter, I'm happy to report that we actually had some very meaningful positive rate in the international book.", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. I guess a question as to, rate was higher, but the premiums you wrote in that business were down and then whereas in a line like professional liability, and I totally understand the comment about a big large mostly ceded contract, but on a net and gross basis it look like professional liability premiums were higher and rates there seem like they were maybe not as good. So, I am just trying to understand we can't see on the insight the decisions that you are making there just trying to understand contextually what's happening in those two areas that's causing that kind of disparity from the outside to be there?", "Peter R. Porrino", "So, if you look at the gross basis on the other property ", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Yeah.", "Peter R. Porrino", "That's almost entirely driven to the dollar most by that one large contract that we referred to before. When you get down to net line it is lower that's related, partly there is a bit of net premium associated with that contract, but also there is as I did refer there is an increased cost to the cat cover and the risk cover that we bought at May 1, as well as some re-instatement in premiums associated with both of the losses in the quarter the Midwest quake and the Italian earthquakes.", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it. So on the PL for professional liability for a second, so where is that business now on sort of underlying combined basis like is it kind of where you wanted to be or are you still a few quarters away from the rate action that will get you there? Thanks for the answers. ", "Peter R. Porrino", "So, the professional book, as you break it apart, particularly for D&O would be in the mid-90 combined, mid low-90s to mid-90 combined ratio. We have other smaller niche books that we've talked about before which fall into these challenged business categories. Our design and select that will be much closer to 100% combined ratio so that's kind of the split of the book by the combined ratios.", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Great, thank you.", "", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Meyer Shields with Stifel Nicolaus. You may ask your question.", "Meyer Shields \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Thanks. Good evening, everyone. Mike, you mentioned when you were talking about capital management, I guess, balancing share repurchases with other opportunities and I was wondering whether you could discuss if the opportunities that are being presented now compared to a year ago are shaping expectations for how the overall insurance market is going to play out for the next couple of years?", "Michael S. McGavick", "That's a really hard question. I have been generally pleased with what we're seeing reported by primary carriers in terms of rate change. So I think there is a positive story continuing there. I have been a little bothered as you heard Jamie say by the fact that the reinsurance marketplace in terms of rate didn't meet our expectations in this most recent period and I'm hopeful that the Reinsurance community will remain disciplined given that our absolute returns remain very difficult given the interest rate environment and that's the piece that yield environment, depressed yield environment remains the most important fact that seems to me it is still be not sufficiently addressed by the insurance and reinsurance marketplace. ", "So that piece will continue to give me pause on performance. At the same time, it is the case that we have pockets of very profitable activity that we would like to grow and we have opportunities to remix our book to a more profitable level that we think are already starting to influence the results. So, for us maintaining some investment in those activities is very intelligent positioning of the firm for what we hope will be an improved market over time, maybe not spectacularly improved but moving forward with I think some appropriate discipline.", "In balance though, we can't get away from the fact the trading where we're trading, buying in our shares is a very positive economic benefit to our shareholders. You saw us increase our repurchase in the quarter beyond what we would have forecasted at the beginning of the year and as a result the net will keep balancing those out. Sorry my voice is starting to go, but we\u2019re pleased with the progress we are marking. We're going to continue to invest in businesses where we see good margin.", "Meyer Shields \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "", "Okay, that was very thorough. Thank you. And one quick numbers question if I can. Did foreign exchange contribute at all to the reserve releases in the quarter?", "Michael S. McGavick", "No.", "Meyer Shields \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Randy Binner with FBR. You may ask your question.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Hi, thank you. I guess just as a follow-up on the buyback question. There was an incremental increase, but it still seems very small relative to our estimate of capital capacity. And so I kind of wanted to get some color on how we might think about that in the back half of the year and in particular if the hurricane season is something that you want to kind of way to see passed before that allocation would get bigger or if we would continue to be kind of this very gradual increase?", "Michael S. McGavick", "This is Mike with my new voice. One of the things that I've noticed in working with Peter since you have to shout to be heard your voice goes a little quicker in the day than it used to. So I am going to turn it over to Pete since I blame him for that fact. The one, what I would tell you is look we said that we viewed the 400, which we had forecast as a four, assuming things went according to plan. We\u2019ve said that as margin expands if we continue to see margin expansion that that would give us additional flexibility and we\u2019ve said that we will continue constantly to evaluate the trade-up to try and make the right decision for our shareholders now and in the future and by that we don\u2019t mean just immediate future but the medium term future as well.", "Peter R. Porrino ", "So Randy, the only thing I would add two things to that, first we do not typically stop buybacks because we are entering winter season. So I would be view as likely to continue and I would also say it is likely to be incremental we don\u2019t see we have, we are working hard to try and be a little bit maybe predictable is not the right word, but just a little bit more even handed and how we go into buybacks and so without getting into too much on specificity I expect that we\u2019ll do something in the third quarter and I would expect that going forward to the rest of the year it would be comparable slight \u2013 possible slight increase but that\u2019s it.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I want to sneak another one in, just because I thought it was interesting, Mike you mentioned that there is, in the life business, one of the previous questions had to do with offloading that run off risk, which is always difficult and you mentioned there is challenges at kind of economics versus accounting and I want to understand your comment better is it a challenge that you might lose the DAC associated with that business or are you saying that you think the economics are better than what you get with accounting. I\u2019d be interested for more color on kind of what that comment meant kind of accounting versus economics and challenge of offloading that risk.", "Peter R. Porrino", "Yeah, Randy, this is Peter, let me try and take that. The issue is not DAC per se. DAC is fine. We haven\u2019t seen any material changes in our expectations of how that book is running off clearly as Mike said it\u2019s a book that does has no future at XL. The question about economics and GAAP has to do what I said little bit early as well with what the economic capital is, right and there literally is $1 billion difference between what some would say economic capital is and what you would see us disclose as our GAAP capital.", "So, when you think about economic returns versus accounting returns you have to take that basically into account, right. There is $1 billion difference. Well, that\u2019s two different things. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever be at a type of place that we\u2019ll make decisions based on accounting results, we\u2019ll make them on economic results, right but the pure fact is it\u2019s a life reinsurance portfolio it\u2019s an annuity reinsurance, it is very different than a primary portfolio, right. There are costs that are different for to buy a reinsurance block in order to buy a primary block. So, again, we are welcome to have conversations with people, but at the same time we do look at the economics of any transaction that we would enter into.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Okay. That\u2019s great. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Our final question comes from Ian Gutterman, Adage Capital. You may ask your question.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital Management, L.P.", "", "Hi, great. Thanks. I just want to clarify one more time what\u2019s going on the accident year and the Insurance businesses because I guess it feels like there are two different things going on where you\u2019ve obviously shown a lot of overall improvement and you said there was some good luck helping out, but when I look at the challenged business at [1056] that actually got worse from last quarter and I would have thought if anything the luck would have helped that businesses given some of the lumpy stuff in there. So, what made that part of the business actually get a little worse sequentially?", "Peter R. Porrino", "Ian, this is Pete, sorry. Just I\u2019ll turn to Greg, but my first comment is when you start looking at a block of business the size of what our challenged businesses are we are going to have noise all over the place, okay. And that really, that has a lot to do with what happened in this quarter versus a prior quarter. Greg?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "", "The accident year loss ratio ex-cat was 69.9 this quarter, up just slightly from 69.2 in Q1 of 2012. So, minor deterioration and none it had any one chunk it\u2019s a lot of little things.", "Peter R. Porrino", "Yeah. There was actually a change in the allocation of expenses as well in Q2 versus Q1 that drove that a little bit. But again, that I think is more because of just the absolute size of what\u2019s in the challenged businesses.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital Management, L.P.", "", "That makes sense and then similar question. The reinsurance improvement obviously you had excellent quarter. Was that, I guess, two things, I know one is the expense ratio came down a lot from sort of a normal Q2 type level was \u2013 and given the investments you are making, I guess, that\u2019s surprising a little bit. Was there something one-time in the expenses or you are doing better than expected and on the loss side was that just very favorable large losses?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "", "Let\u2019s take one at time. On the expense side, Ian, on the operating expenses, our actual expenses went down by about 3.6% principally from compensation and professional fees and our net earned premium went up by 10.8%. So that drove a significant reduction in the operating expense. On the acquisition expense, there was a lot of small things, but the biggest was you are absolutely correct a one-time event, but that was a Q2 2011 event where we paid a very large profit commission to one of our large North American customers.", "On the loss ratio side, about a two point improvement and that\u2019s broken down really between two items, Griffin last year at $6.4 million and a warehouse loss in Latin America again in the second quarter of last year for $2.2 million that equals about a two point improvement in our combined ratio and our loss ratio.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital Management, L.P.", "", "Okay. So that roughly 30% expense ratio for the first half, is that a reasonable run rate?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "", "It\u2019s hard to say, a lot of that will depend on business mix. We have written a lot more cat business, which should reduce the acquisition expense ratio overall. But it\u2019s a very lumpy portfolio, we could write one large deal with a large commission and it would move things slightly. It doesn\u2019t mean there is necessarily a massive change in either our strategy or the market environment.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital Management, L.P.", "", "Got it, got it. Okay. And Peter, I\u2019ll try on one more and if this is a long answer I\u2019ll take it off line, but it\u2019s a short answer, hopefully, you can give it quickly. Can you one more time do the deposit book business caused that $90 million of interest expense, is essential because that was \u2013 that you saw what we would normally call adverse development instances booked as a deposit, it shows up as higher interest expense or are you seeing something else?", "Peter R. Porrino", "So that\u2019s pretty much what we are saying, the loss amount is cat and has been cat and so there is no increase in the total amount of losses that we are going to pay into the contract, but since the ultimate underlying that are going up. We will be paying our share faster than what was assumed previously. So it literally is an acceleration of payment, the amount of payments has not changed.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital Management, L.P.", "", "Okay. So it\u2019s just a discounting issue, a PV issue?", "Peter R. Porrino", "Yes.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital Management, L.P.", "Got it, okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Thank you, and at this time, I\u2019ll turn the call over to the speakers for closing remarks.", "Michael S. McGavick", "This is Mike. I just want to thank everybody for taking the time and the interest especially as the Insurance and Reinsurance sector earnings season winds down. We obviously are feeling very good around here about the progress we are making, this is as I said at the beginning, a solid result whether that \u2013 at on a relative or absolute basis, and well the call has focused on some of the reasons that we \u2013 none of us should get ahead of ourselves as we would not because we believe in the end we can do still better and we are absolutely driven to deliver that result.", "We are pleased with the progress, but we are nowhere near satisfied and we won\u2019t be satisfied both until the results are wonderful and until we can tell you and look you in the eye and say that and the results are exactly what we\u2019d expect given everything we are up to. So we are pleased with the progress and look forward to talking to you next quarter.", "Operator", "", "Thank you and this does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation.

Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Operator", "Good afternoon. My name Shirley, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the XL Group plc Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "David R. Radulski", "Thank you, Shirley, and welcome to XL Group's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being simultaneously webcast in XL's website at www.xlgroup.com, and we posted to our website several documents including our quarterly financial supplement.", "On our call this evening, you will hear from Mike Mcgavick, XL Group's CEO; Jamie Veghte, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance operations; Greg Hendrick, our Chief Executive Insurance operations; and Pete Porrino, XL's Chief Financial Officer.", "Before they begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that certain of the matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations.  Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. And therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them.", "Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other documents on file with the SEC, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.", "Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of which they are made, and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise.", "With that, I turn it over to Mike Mcgavick.", "Michael S. Mcgavick", "Thanks, Dave. Welcome to our third quarter call. Obviously, this call comes in a difficult time. We know a lot about the third quarter, and I've been looking forward to sharing it with you. What we don't know a lot about is the event that occurred just last week with Sandy, which I'm sure is on all of your minds.", "The first thing to say with respect to Sandy is the most important truth about being in the risk business. It is sadly often about human misery. Our thoughts go out to those who are still suffering.", "To respect your obvious curiosity about Sandy, we'll start the call with a brief discussion of what we know. Following this, we'll discuss the third quarter in our usual way, and then we will take your questions.", "With Sandy, we know you are working hard to understand the answers to 3 basic questions: how big is the industry loss; what is the XL loss going to be; and is this a market changing event of some kind. I will comment on how we're thinking of the markets after Sandy, Jamie will give our perspectives on the early industry loss estimates as well as what he can on XL Re. And I'll ask Greg to talk more about what we're seeing in our insurance book from Sandy at this point.", "Of course, the reality is that no one really knows anything with certainty about Sandy from an overall point of view at this stage. I would point out that even the external risks modeling group we work with most closely has not yet posted its own industry estimate.", "In terms of the broader market. I do not think Sandy ends up being a capital event for the industry, at least based on what we are seeing so far. But while Sandy might not change the industry's capital position, I do believe that this may change the industry's perception of risk. When this is all said and done, I don't think any of us are going to feel that people were as well insured as they could have been. I don't think people will feel that the region was as well prepared as it could have been as several leading elected officials have already said. And in the end, I believe the underwriting community will have to we think with care what they should charge for risks in a region with such a complex concentration of values exposed to such storms.", "Now I'll turn it over to Jamie for his comments on Sandy.", "James H. Veghte", "Thanks, Mike. We've had very little specific information from our customer base. Those dialogues are just beginning. We have seen the ranges of industry loss estimates from various sources. And as Mike mentioned, one of the prominent modeling companies has not released an estimate, and it's due out with information for us to work with tomorrow.", "Our instinct is that the industry loss will be at the top end of the published ranges, $20 billion or above. This loss really highlights the concentration of values in the region, a loss of perhaps $20 billion to the industry or above from the storm that was classified as post-tropical cyclone as it came ashore is remarkable.", "We will have exposure from several sources and clearly a $20 billion market loss. It's a significant loss to the reinsurance market broadly. However, we typically do not provide significant capacity on lower layers of New England mutual companies, principally due to our historic concern over winter storm exposure. Our capacity on those accounts would typically be skewed to the middle and upper parts of the program.", "We do write a variety of national accounts. After Katrina, a number of nationwide commercial carriers increased their retention significantly. And given the uncertainty around the impact of flood and BI on commercial carriers, it's too early to predict the precise impact on individual clients. We will also have potential exposure from our North American profit center from both the treaty, which is a non-CAT property treaty book, and some facultative exposures.", "We do buy retrocessional coverage but at a very higher attachment point, and our expectations will be that the retro program will not come into play other than some, perhaps, small proportion of recoveries. So broadly, our gross loss will be our net loss. Greg?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Thanks, Jamie. I'll cover 3 topics around Sandy: our reported notices of loss to date, the reinsurance coverage we have in place and the generic loss example.", "First, after 1:00 this afternoon, we have set up 175 potential claims comprised partly of loss notifications from clients and partly based on reports from brokers and the media as a result of Sandy. This covers a wide range of risks from small claims in our general aviation book to reports from some of our large property clients.", "As perspective, based on prior catastrophes, of these initial loss notifications, roughly 50% in term to claims payable by XL Insurance, as often the losses have not reached deductible, attachment point or self-insured retention of the policy. We are in the very early stages of the claims adjusting process and have adjusters moving to the impacted locations as we speak.", "Next, I'll turn to the reinsurance protection that we have in place for our property exposures. First, we place a property per risk coverage attaches at $25 million and runs to $600 million for our large property exposures. We retain 45% of the first $15 million of limit, which translates into a retention of $32 million per risk, and we have multiple reinstatements for each layer.", "In a per-event basis, we buy U.S. catastrophe program, which attaches at $100 million and exhausts at $450 million. Within the first $100 million of limit, we retain 40%. And as a result on losses of $200 million or greater, we retain $140 million. This cover protects all of our property lines of business and has 2 limits available in any one treaty year, none of which have been used to date.", "We also have in place various reinsurance covers that protect specific portfolios, which could lower our net loss where they to come into play. Let me be clear, at this point it's too early to tell whether any of these reinsurance covers will be impacted by Sandy.", "The difficulty of loss estimation is best brought to light using a specific loss example. As always, our clients' confidentiality is our utmost priority, so I've taken one of our largest loss notifications and made the location and insured information generic. The risk is real estate-driven with a large location in downtown Manhattan and numerous locations in the region. Based on our modeling and post-event processes, we have identified 15 locations in the impacted areas. In total, the insured value for the entire schedule is over $1 billion, and XL's full loss limit is $250 million. As a result of our underwriting approach to flood, we provided $25 million flood supplement and we bought $15 million of facultative reinsurance covering flood and other perils.", "In terms of damage, we do know the lower Manhattan location had substantial water in the basement and the recovery process at that location began on Wednesday of last week. We have adjusters at or on the way to all these locations. But at this point, we do not have a loss estimate. It is worth noting that business interruption and contingent business interruption losses resulting from flood are included within the flood limit and not in addition to this sublimit. In short, even in the worst-case scenario, our loss from this risk as a result of flood cannot exceed $10 million. Mike?", "Michael S. Mcgavick", "Thank you both. With that, we'll turn to our third quarter results. Our third quarter results are solid and in line with what we have been suggesting would happen.", "Our margins expanded, resulting from 3 main drivers. First, and this pleases us most, is the fact that our underwriting operations on an ex-CAT ex-PYD basis provided the real substance of our improvement. With our Insurance segment delivering a 70 -- or excuse me a 94.7 ex-CAT ex-PYD combined ratio, this is directionally consistent with our work and what we're trying to do. We are delighted to see it coming through.", "Second, we have fewer catastrophes in the quarter, which was of course helpful. This has been true at XL as it has been true around the industry, at least until Sandy.", "And third, we have positive PYD. While it's relatively light in this quarter, it was a nice contributor. You'll recall that next quarter is the one in which we take a deep examination of our reserves, and we'll see what that reveals.", "Of course, you'll want to know is this how we'll perform from now on. We'd say there's still work to do. But every day, we are moving further along. More of this positive trend is a result of our actions and less of it is fortuity. Still, we'd say that we are not done with our re-underwriting until we are regularly delivering a combined ratio of around 90%. Reinsurance continues to deliver, with an 86% combined ratio in the third quarter. While this is up from the nearly 79% combined ratio in the third quarter a year ago, only 5.4% of this difference is driven by the $26 million in crop losses, an amount in line with what we forecast to you in our second quarter call, in addition to some modest CAT activities. Crop, as we have previously discussed with you, also explains our lower reinsurance premiums written, reflecting the decision last year by a leading agricultural MGA to be purchased by another reinsurance firm.", "All in, we reported an overall P&C combined ratio of 92.2%. This is 9 points better than our quarter 3 last year.", "We had significant gains in our Investment Portfolio mark-to-market. And as a result, our fully diluted tangible book value per share is now at $32.82. This is up 7% in the quarter and is 16% higher than where we began the year. We think our 7.7% ROE for the year-to-date, given the overall economic environment and the lower turn on interest rates, is solid. Is it where I want -- is it we where we want it to be? No. But again, we're on the right path, and this is directionally consistent with everything we have shared with you.", "So all of these indicators are pleasing us. At the same time, you would guess that -- we would guess that you might be curious about what is going on with the top line. This is a bit more complicated, so let me spend a moment on it, and then Greg and Jamie will expand on this further.", "We did see good growth in the quarter when you take to account 3 factors that offset it. The first has been mentioned before, the crop book that was sold affecting reinsurance premiums written. Second was the impact of the re-underwriting of our European property operations, where we have been willing to shed underpriced business. And third, foreign exchange. Excluding these 3 factors, our overall growth rate was 5%, and we are growing strongly where we are profitable and thus remixing the business toward more profitable lines.", "Turning briefly to pricing. We continue to see improvement across the vast majority of our lines, especially in Insurance. And this progress has accelerated in the quarter. In some lines, we are now seeing the compounding benefits of rate-on-rate year-over-year. So you can see that for the third quarter, XL had a terrific result, we're very pleased and we are driven to continue this kind of progress.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Pete to discuss the financials in more detail.", "Peter R. Porrino", "Thanks, Mike, and good evening. Operating income for the third quarter was $188 million or $0.61 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to operating income of $89 million or $0.28 per share in the third quarter of 2011.", "Our P&C combined ratio was 9.4 points better at 92.2% in the same quarter last year. Our accident year combined ratio was 94.7% or 8.3 points better than the same quarter last year due to a lower level of both CAT activity and non-CAT large losses.", "Prior development in the quarter was a favorable $37 million or 2.5 loss ratio points, with $36 million of this favorable development attributable to the Reinsurance segment.", "As we have outlined on previous earnings calls, Q3 is what we refer to as an actual versus expected quarter for our entire Insurance segment and our U.S. Reinsurance business. The $36 million redundancy in our Reinsurance segment in the quarter related to our non-U.S. Casualty and other shorter-tail Reinsurance businesses where we review reserves quarterly with more comprehensive assumption updates performed annually. We experienced positive movements in our property, marine and aviation lines.", "Our operating expenses for the third quarter were up 23.4% year-over-year, driven by higher compensation costs and, to a lesser extent, certain severance costs and costs supporting our strategic initiatives. The overall operating expense increase is higher than the recent run rate almost exclusively due to the impact of improving financial results on our performance-based compensation plans and our pay-for-performance culture. We think this is exactly the right compensation philosophy to drive XL forward and incentivize and reward our colleagues.", "It's important to note that in the third quarter of 2011, the exact opposite occurred and compensation costs were reduced due to the same performance-based measures. Excluding these variable compensation cost, we expect operating expense levels to be in line with what we have communicated to you since the fourth quarter of 2011 earnings call.", "The total return of our investment portfolio was strong at 2.5% for the quarter. This contributed to book value growth, with a positive mark-to-market of $521 million. This is driven primarily by significant tightening of credit spreads most notably on our structured credit portfolios.", "At $166 million net investment income on the P&C portfolio in the third quarter was 20.9% below the prior year due primarily to lower reinvestment rates. There was also significant decline in P&C net investment income of 11.7% from the second quarter. There were 4 primary drivers of this quarterly decline, 2 that you would expect based upon our published book yields: lower reinvestment rates between maturing bonds and new money rates and also higher cash levels held by us given the heightened tail risks emanating out of Europe over the summer.", "Two other factors impacting this quarter's net investment income were reduced income on our inflation-protected portfolio due to lower inflation in Q2 and accelerated premium amortization on our agency mortgage-backed securities due to lower rates in an environment of ongoing quantitative easing.", "We expect net investment income will remain under pressure given interest rate levels. The P&C gross book yield at the end of the quarter was 3%, down from 3.1% at the end of Q2. The average new money rate on our P&C portfolio was 1.9%. We estimate that approximately $3.8 billion of P&C assets with an average gross book yield of 3.2% will mature and paid down over the next 12 months. We've added further details on this in our financial supplement at the bottom of Schedule 3.", "Our net invest -- our net income from investment affiliates was $9 million, down $15 million from the prior year. This was driven by a weak second quarter from our investment manager affiliates compared to strong results in the prior year quarter, which have benefited from the sale of our -- of one of our manager affiliates.", "As previously discussed, our investment manager affiliate results are reported on a one-quarter lag. The alternative and private investment portfolios had satisfactory results.", "Realized losses on investments were $6 million compared to realized losses of $62 million in the prior-year quarter. The third quarter results included $13 million in OTTI charges compared to $67 million in the prior-year quarter. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was lower than historical levels due to both several discrete items and a re-estimation of our expected full year effective tax rate from 12% to 11%.", "We continue to buy back our ordinary shares, purchasing and canceling 5.3 million ordinary shares at an average cost of $23.44 in the third quarter. For the year-to-date, we have repurchased 16.2 million ordinary shares at an average cost of $21.63, leaving $400 million remaining available for purchase under the current program.", "I'll now turn it over to Greg to discuss our Insurance segment results.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Thanks, Pete. Tonight I'll cover the Insurance segment results for the quarter, the performance of certain businesses, recent talent changes and current market conditions.", "Beginning with the results, I'm pleased to report that we continue to make measurable improvements, as our combined ratio for the quarter is 95.3% or 17 points lower than the same quarter last year. To put this into perspective, this is our best performance since the fourth quarter of 2008.", "On the loss side, our reported loss ratio of 63.3%  was 19.2 points better than last year. Limited CAT activity accounts for 7.2 points of this improvement as we incurred $10 million in CAT losses during the quarter, largely from hurricane Isaac, compared to nearly $70 million in the third quarter of 2011.", "Prior-year development accounts for 2.4 points of improvement as there was some strengthening in the third quarter of 2011 as opposed to a small release this quarter.", "But most importantly, our current accident quarter loss ratio excluding CATs were 62.6%, improving by 9.6 points year-over-year. While much of this improvement is driven by very strong results in our North American and international property books, we continue to see measurable progress in many of our businesses. In fact, our accident core loss ratio, excluding large account property business, improved by 2.5 points year-over-year.", "Given the inherent volatility in quarter results, it's important to note that our current accident year ex-CAT loss ratio stands at 66.5% through 3 quarters, an almost 7-point improvement over last year.", "Insurance gross premiums written grew by $28 million or 2.5% in the quarter after normalizing for foreign exchange. This growth reflects continued success in our targeted new businesses such as Political Risk, North American Construction and E&S, as well as increase in opportunities in our core Hartford professional portfolio.", "I'll say in this growth is our measured underlying discipline where we're reducing writings in those businesses with unacceptable margins such as guaranteed cost workers' compensation, international property and selected programs.", "This leads into an update on the 7 businesses we have previously referred to as challenged. The combined ratio for the challenged portfolio in the quarter was 90.1%, benefiting from strong results in our international property book. Excluding international property, the combined ratio of the remaining challenged businesses was 103.3% on a calendar and accident year basis, which is an improvement of what we reported in the first and second quarters of this year.", "This improvement reflects our continued execution of corrective underwriting actions, many of which we have discussed in previous quarters, as well as improved pricing of more than 5% this quarter. Both the challenge and the performing portfolios had improved accident quarter loss ratios relative to the second quarter of this year, as well as the third quarter of 2011.", "It's important to note that while we continue to improve or surgically remove poor performing sublines, we are strategically growing other components of the challenged businesses such as property, railroad and umbrella lines in our E&S book, large risk management business in our North American primary casualty book, as well as new programs in our select professional portfolio.", "As noted last quarter, to be in line with how we manage our businesses, we're going to shift our future discussions away from the collection of businesses we identified as challenged at the beginning of the year and going forward will focus on any sub-portfolio in any business that needs corrective action.", "In particular, we've decided to close our upper middle-market business in North America. We have retained the portfolio of environmental-related property and casualty business, as well as a few accounts that will transition to a risk management policy. We will continue to write upper middle-market accounts in many of our businesses. But in particular, any clients that have growing international operations as our global network allows us to deliver a unique offering to the market.", "Moving on to talent. We continued to enhance our teams throughout the segment. We added Chris Dougherty as CFO and David Vavrasek as Head of HR to our already strong Insurance leadership.", "We appointed Ian Brandt [ph] as Chief Underwriting Officer of our IPC Property business, and he joined us in just 2 weeks. We added Alfred Bergbauer and Barbara Luck to our North America Primary Casualty management team. We also added underwriting talent to our marine team in Chicago, our international casualty team throughout Europe and the U.K. and we opened a new international upper middle-market underwriting office in Leon, France.", "Finally, let's turn to current market conditions. In the third quarter, we saw a repeat of the second quarter, with positive rate indications in most of our businesses and overall segment rate increase of just over 3%. North American Property & Casualty continues to show the most strength, with rate increase by almost 8% led by double-digit rate increases in our Excess Casualty and E&S businesses. Our overall professional portfolio also had another solid quarter, with increases of nearly 3%.", "In the quarter, 20 out of our 24 businesses generated rate increases, and the only disappointment was a 2% rate decrease in our international casualty portfolio. We remain convinced that positive rates is needed broadly, and in particular our long-tail lines of business, given persistently low investment returns.", "In summary, I am proud of what our Insurance team has accomplished through 3 quarters. While a degree of fortuity helped, particularly in our short-tail portfolio, the hard work of the last year has already showed through in our improved results. However, we are still short of our ultimate goal and I can assure you that XL will continue to focus on underwriting diligence as expansion of margin continues to be our utmost priority.", "And now to Jamie to discuss Reinsurance results.", "James H. Veghte", "Thanks, Greg. XL Re had a very good quarter with a combined ratio of 86%, producing an underwriting profit of $67 million. This compares to a combined of 78.8% in the third quarter of 2011. Our result was positively impacted by $35.7 million of prior-year reserve releases, which compares to $39.8 million a year ago.", "Excluding the impact of both prior-year reserve releases and CAT losses, the segment had a combined ratio of 88%, which compares to the 80% achieved in the third quarter of 2011.", "The quarter was also impacted by $26 million from the drought conditions impacting our U.S. crop portfolio. As we mentioned in our last earnings call, the 2 sources of exposure to the drought are from our U.S. and Bermuda profit centers. The loss in the quarter breaks down to $20 million of reserves for the Bermuda stop loss book and $6.1 million from our U.S.-based proportional book, specifically the Heartland Crop account.", "In both cases, we've reserved the book at levels above the range as suggested by the impacted clients. We are confident that the potential for significant deterioration in the fourth quarter is unlikely.", "Turning to top line. Gross written premiums in the quarter were $417 million, which compares to $619 million in the third quarter of last year. As we have advised, the Heartland program converted from a primary facility with significant reinsurance ceded to a reinsurance assumed treaty this year. So year-on-year gross written premium comparisons are misleading in this case.", "If you use the net premium written from Heartland in 2011 to do a like-for-like comparison, our gross written premium last year would have been $436 million, so we reduced by 4% in the quarter year on year. This 4% drop was due to selected cancellations in the U.S. and Latin American portfolios. On a year-to-date basis, again adjusting Heartland in 2011 to the same treatment we currently have, our gross written premium would have moved from $1.73 billion to $1.85 billion this year, an increase of 6.9%.", "Turning to market conditions. We spoke of our midyear renewals on last quarter's call and I would again describe them as satisfactory although, candidly, we did not get the level of risk adjusted improvement in the U.S. CAT book that we quoted and expected.", "We've attended a number of industry conferences over the last 2 months, and the expectation until last week was for a reasonably smooth renewal season in the property CAT space, with the benign hurricane season potentially having some downward pressure on U.S. pricing.", "With the impact of Sandy, there's now some question as to how the rest of the year will develop. If as we expect the upper end of the industry loss estimates becomes reality, I would have to expect year-end pricing to be impacted.", "One of the characteristics of the CAT market is it responds very quickly to major market events. While there is abundant capacity available, the typical placement process on large accounts requires a clearing process on the pricing for market leaders to unlock this capacity fully. This is a heavily syndicated market and no one can forecast with precision what will take place at year end, but I suspect assumptions about year-end pricing have been adjusted over the course of the last week. Ours certainly has.", "On the long-tail side, I would reiterate Greg's comments. While we see general improvement in the pricing environment based on our audit work and negotiations with clients, there remains plenty of room for additional progress before we would declare the market as rate-adequate based on in-current investment yields. In addition, we continue to see customers absorb additional retention, both vertically, through co-participation or in cases entire treaties dropped. During this particular quarter, our U.S. Casualty team lost an $11 million premium account due to the ceding company absorbing the entire treaty at renewal.", "Overall, we are very pleased to produce an excellent underwriting result, and we look forward to an action active renewal season.", "With that, I'll turn it back to David for Q&A.", "David R. Radulski", "Shirley, please open the lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jay Cohen with BofA Merrill Lynch.", "Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just a couple of questions. One thing, just to confirm, the -- on the Reinsurance side, the CAT losses, those are separate from the crop losses?", "James H. Veghte", "Correct.", "Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, great. Second, these are relatively short. The second question, the premiums in the business that you dropped, the upper to middle-market business on the Insurance side, what kind of premiums are we talking about there? Should we be adjusting our models for that?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "It's Greg Hendrick. All in, when you keep the business that we wanted to keep, the environmental and the risk management components too, is about $50 million of premium. I don't think -- we will -- we are growing in other areas, I don't think that's a major number, but that's what the previous portfolio of pure middle-market North America business was.", "Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "That's great. And then just last question. PC investment income. You'd obviously talked about some of those issues that impacted this quarter was a big drop off from the last quarter. I was just wondering if you could talk about what an ongoing number looks like? How much of what you saw this quarter was unique to this quarter and would not be ongoing?", "Peter R. Porrino", "Sure, Jay. It\u2019s Pete. So let me break it into the 4 components that I spoke about. The drop in yields, I mean, that's going to continue to recur. That was about 1/3 of the decrease. The adjustment on the fixed securities would have been another 1/3. In essence, the inflation underlying that tips [ph] went from 1% in the prior quarter to just under 0 on average in the second quarter. So that was also about 1/3. The agency amortization would have been a little bit less than a 1/3. Again, it's -- I mean, I certainly can't predict what's going to happen, but it doesn't feel like they're going to -- rates are going to continue to drop enough to continue to change the amortization of those. And the last piece, which is the smallest one, was the cash and that cash is already being put back to work in the investment portfolio.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Vinay Misquith with Evercore.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "So just to clarify on the net investment income once again. Would this quarter's number be the run rate for the future? Or are you seeing that there was some onetime items in that?", "Peter R. Porrino", "So I would say it's not a run rate, the one caveat that I would give you is that there will be pressure on investment income just because of reduced yields, right. And so the number is going down quarter-to-quarter, but 3 out of the 4, I would say, were not run rate items. So I would expect it not to be -- it would not to be a run rate just make sure you think about the drop in yields and how that's going to flow through.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Sure. So you're saying that the base number is slightly higher. But from that level, we'll have a lower investment income going forward? I mean, is that the way to think about it?", "Peter R. Porrino", "It would be higher than the $166 million certainly, right? But at the same time, there will be continued pressure on the net investment income.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Good, that's helpful. The second question is for Hurricane Sandy, and thanks for giving some detail on the Reinsurance program. But trying to wrap my head around on the primary Insurance operations last year for Hurricane Irene, you had about a $200 million gross loss, about $100 million net loss. Just want to get a sense for -- where things are right now the industry loss estimate is about $20 billion for Sandy. It was about $4.3 billion for Irene. Simplistically, just multiplying it by 4 seems too simple. Can you help us understand how we should think of scaling it?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "This is Greg Hendrick. First of all, Vinay, you can't scale it. Every event is a unique event, the pattern of the storm, where the exposures are, where the water piles up, in this particular case, unfortunately for so many people. But let me give you a little bit of color, so hope I can explain why I think these are totally unrelated. First, the $200 million and $100 million was from Irene and Lee combined, both. There was -- there were a bit losses that triggered out of Lee that because of all the saturation from Irene produced flooding. Second, it was dominated by 2 large corporate insurance where we were the lead carrier. In other words, we issued 100% of the policy in the United States. We booked as gross the 100% loss from those locations and then cede off to the captive or the coinsurers a portion of that loss. As of this point in time, there aren't any notifications that look anything like what we had on those 2 losses in Irene and Lee. Clearly very early days, that's not a promise or commitment. It's just what the facts are as I have them at the moment. So those are couple of reasons why you really can't draw parallels from one to the other.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill.", "J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "I actually was hoping we could step back from hurricane Sandy and just kind of get some big picture comments thinking about the quarter. 7% ROE probably not where you want to be, but the combined ratio is actually, kind of where you are, is not bad at all. So can we talk about steps, longer term, to get you to a cost of capital?", "Michael S. Mcgavick", "Yes, this is Mike. Clearly, as I said in my comments, 7.7% ROE is not where we want to be. We do think that the -- that it's critical to continue to expand our margins so that we can get back to double-digit ROEs. And that's very much the drive we are on. We have said that we thought we could drive meaningful margin expansion in this quarter and that we thought we could get through more acceptable returns on an absolute and relative basis in the next year. To me, this quarter is a very much in line with that thinking. We've shown a continued willingness to buy a bit more back in on the capital side than we had forecasted at the beginning of the year, which is in line with the stronger earnings we've been able to deliver. We have been able to continue to drive down the combined ratio, particularly in our Insurance operation, where it was not where we wanted, and we very much like the trend there as well especially when combined with what we're seeing in rate across the book. So taken as a whole, these are exactly the actions that we expected to be able to get us back to the levels you described. And there's nothing that I would change in what we're doing to deliver that result. We just have to keep at it with real rigor and real discipline. And then as we work our way back through the book and get the chance at the rate that we've been describing we're getting, the math starts to continue to change in the direction we all desire. So we're very pleased.", "Peter R. Porrino", "Paul, it's Pete. I'd only add that as these marks continue to -- bad choice of words, but pile up, it's just hitting us and everyone else in the industry. It is going to get tougher and tougher to achieve the corporate ROEs that we've talked about because those were all been sort of ex-AOCI [ph] and the numbers that we're publishing included.", "J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Fair enough. But is this -- could you talk about maybe just as we think about getting to cost of capital, is rate or how much is it rightsizing the business relative to the capital?", "Michael S. Mcgavick", "I'm going to give you a couple of general comments and then I'll call any of my colleagues to add. The most important thing from our point of view, the thing that we have to make our true north star is our underwriting results. We are driven at this company operating somewhere around 90% as a combined ratio. We believe that is achievable. We believe that we're working on exactly the right things to deliver that. Once you get there, it's possible, I suppose, that the continued diminishment of investment yield, it's slow erosion, combined with if it were to continue, continued adding of capital due to marks, you could get to an equation that doesn't get you there, but I'd be a bit surprised by that. In the end, with the marks having reversed themselves so severely, it seems to me that that's going to be pretty fluid. You still have Europe pouncing around out there. And somewhere out there, who knows where or with what impetus, you're going to have some kind of normalization around interest rates. So we have to plan our life around what we can control. And our best things to control are continuing, as we have said, to not add to capital, it's not our intention over time. And then, at the same time, experience profitable growth at the kinds of levels which we have described here. And at the same time, get ourselves to kind of a nice combine. I think that equation is a very healthy equation over time. And that's what we continue to do bit by bit. But I don't think where we are calls for any change. It calls for continuing to do what we know we're doing.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse.", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "In regards to the LIBOR issue, we know that at least one reinsurer put up IBNR reserves due to casualty class reinsurance policies. Do you have an updated view on potential LIBOR claims? And related, have reserves been increased in international lines which are exposed to LIBOR? And I have one follow-up.", "Michael S. Mcgavick", "Yes, Mike, I'll comment. Generally, you've seen some information in the marketplace about programs in recent calls, I know. Just to be clear, we are not participants in those types of programs. Obviously, we write and write a good book direct D&O exposure. And I'm going to turn it over to Greg to comment on our particular book and what -- frankly, we're not seeing it.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Yes, I'll be brief. Mike, as I said last quarter, there's so many variables that play here. We are just -- we're not able to give an estimate of losses. But what loss there is to be covered is very uncertain, as well as how the coverages might apply. We are in the process through the fourth quarter reserve review that we are going down and diving into each insured, the potential exposure and our coverage around it. And we'll work through the process as we go through the fourth quarter. Of course I would not hold that out. There was a promise that we will have it solved in the fourth quarter completely, but that is a process we're going through at the moment. There's unfortunately no update at this time other than we're not able to put out certain number around it.", "Michael S. Mcgavick", "I would just add that from the time of the financial crisis in 2008 because of the unusual circumstances in line with what we have learned over the years, going back to Sarb-Ox and so on, we have maintained the clash load. We maintained it through Madoff. We've maintained -- and then it seems like every couple of years the industry seems to give us something else to maintain it for. That clash load currently is around 20 points on the loss ratios in that segment of our business. And whether LIBOR will in fact take a bite out of that, it's hard at this stage to tell. It's just -- when you're looking at it risk by risk rather than as a clash event, it is very hard to know how this will play out.", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. And lastly for Pete, the tax rate looked low this quarter, what drove that? And should we -- what should we think about for 4Q if Sandy losses come through?", "Peter R. Porrino", "So as I said in the call, there were -- it was a series of discrete items and then it take down from 12% to 11% for the annualized -- for the expectation for the annual, right. So that would be the number that we would say we would have expected for the fourth quarter. It would have been the 11% rather than the 12%. And the other difference would have been discrete items. We settled an open exam favorably and a couple of other smaller items. The complication here, of course, is the way -- is the right question on Sandy, right, and what does this mean. It all has to do with what legal entities the business resides in. So to the extent that the losses would be predominantly in Bermuda, that would take our effective tax rate up for the quarter, right, because we'd have losses without any tax benefit. To the extent that they're in taxable jurisdictions, it would have less of that negative impact. So I can't -- since we don't know what the Sandy losses are, we surely don't know what they are by legal entities. So it's too soon to tell. My expectation all in is that it will drive our effective tax rate up. But to how much, that I can't say.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So this point, given the uncertainty around Sandy, I mean, how are you thinking about buybacks for the fourth quarter and kind of capital deployment in that sense? And I imagine it's sort of a wait-and-see or does this kind of your capital deployment program sort of supersede that? And there's just one follow-up.", "Peter R. Porrino", "So this is Pete, Mike. So if you go back and look, certainly over the last year or so, you have seen that it is -- we have tried to be consistent with our buyback program. We are very, very comfortable with our capital levels. So we have bought back in quarters when other companies don't, right, when suppose they win quarters. And we've also bought back -- if you look at last year, we bought back $670 million of stock, and that we had significant catastrophe losses impacting our results. So we don't see any -- as of now we don't see this as a stop buybacks.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. That's really helpful. And then I have one question. I mean, in terms of -- I mean, there's obviously another storm potentially coming, who knows what sort of impact it will have, but I have one question about business interruption. If you have a business interruption event from the last storm. And then before that's cleared, you have another event, how do you account for or how does the industry account for the time if the second event delays the interruption period?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Mike, it's Greg Hendrick. Certainly the answer is going to depend on policy by policy, what the form says. We have some policies written under our own form. We have some business written on broker manuscript forms, and we have some of our smaller businesses in E&S and programs where each policy is slightly different. In general, the history has been that when you're not able to differentiate between the damage that was caused and it's exacerbating existing damage, that will be picked up as part of the original loss event. But it will be a case-by-case, and we saw it in 2004 in Florida with all the intersecting storms. It became more and more difficult to determine what loss went to what storm. You did the best you can and get the adjusters out there as fast as you can, to set the baseline. But by and large, it goes back to the original event if it extends the waiting period.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got you. And then just one last one maybe for Mike on -- you mentioned the 90% combined ratio goal and you talked about a double-digit ROE. I just kind of looking at the numbers, I find it hard to get to a double-digit ROE with a 90% combined overall. And then maybe I'm just doing something wrong, but is it -- if it's not yield, because the investment income is kind of what it is, is it operating leverage or some other -- is there another lever that allows those 2 kind of data points to meet?", "Michael S. Mcgavick", "I already answered it. It is operating leverage.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ryan Burns with Lane McLaney [ph].", "Unknown Analyst", "Quickly on your accident year loss ratio, excluding CATs, in the Insurance segment, where there any takedowns from first half of 2012 reserves?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Yes, there was. We had booked, based on what we had seen at the end of the fourth quarter of 2011, particularly on our short-tail lines, what we thought was an appropriate loss ratio on the Property business roughly speaking was about 3 points in the quarter for Q1 and Q2.", "Unknown Analyst", "For Q1 and Q2. Okay, got you. And then, I guess quickly, I guess holistically, obviously, with rate increases and lower loss cost inflation, as well as I guess re-underwriting the books, is there a targeted on accident year loss ratio? Or where is your target, or I guess where's the ultimate goal? Where can you guys drive this do you think?", "Michael S. Mcgavick", "Well, on a combined overall, we're seeking to push down to 90. When we budget around here, we don't count in PYD. The losses in the past we have reserved to what we think is appropriate, and then it develops as it develops. So when we set our budgets, we have in mind an accident year 90 is the target that we're driving towards.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ian Gutterman with Adage Capital.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.", "Pete, can I get one more clarification on the rest of income, I'm still a little confused. The inflation impact in MBS, are you -- it seems you're saying those were sort of catch-ups and that's why they're not run rate going forward? I mean, I would think of inflation is lower going forward too.", "Peter R. Porrino", "No. So separate -- I'll have Sarah chime in here, but separate the tips adjustment from the agency-backed ones. So the tips adjustment is whatever the inflation rate was in the prior quarter, rolls through that income. So if inflation is 1%, right, you get a certain amount of return, and at 0% you get another amount of return. For us, that delta was about $8 million in the current quarter.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.", "And why wouldn't it be $8 million again next quarter if inflation stays low? Inflation is not rebounding.", "Peter R. Porrino", "Well, because -- so quarter-to-quarter we've already recognized the fact that it was at 0. So if it's at 0 again next quarter, the quarter-to-quarter delta would be 0 because it depends.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.", "Got it. So there's a catch-up then. Okay, got it. And the MBS is similar, it's a onetime adjustment. If it stays where it is, it's not going to cause an incremental?", "Peter R. Porrino", "If it stays where it is, it would not cause an incremental.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.", "Perfect, okay. And then Jamie, on the $20 billion or more estimate on Sandy, do have any thoughts on personal versus commercial break down of that?", "James H. Veghte", "Yes. I mean, you've seen a lot of commentary out there that's suggesting it's sort of 60-40, personal and commercial. My own view is that in the end it's going to grow to be more of commercial lines loss than personal. So again, my opinion only flip it, say 60-40 commercial to personal.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.", "Interesting. And then on pricing impact. Obviously, I can understand why you would drive pricing in the Northeast and on national accounts or Northeast-heavy. Do you think it's going to have much of an impact on sort of regional Florida-only, Gulf-only type capacity as well?", "James H. Veghte", "Who knows, Ian? All I can say is that, as I said before, there was a lot of discussion earlier in the fall in the convention circuit about downward pressure on U.S. rates. And again, as I said, it's a heavily syndicated market. A couple of bad actors can't keep rates down. I just simply think that people are going to reevaluate where their pricing will be now that we've had this episode. And I'm not sure I can forecast what it's going to do region by region. Just suffice it to say that the atmosphere has changed over the last week.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.", "Got it. And Greg, would you mind answering a question from an insurance perspective? The Fortune 100-type property accounts, I assume, will get pricing. Anything beyond that you're think about at this point?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Well, I think Mike touched on it. Anything with a great deal of uncertainty on the tail will have to be reexamined and looked at and gives you more confidence to your underwriters to go out and seek those rate increases that we need to get. We've had a lot of momentum in our E&S line of business. We expect that to continue now, but it will be a case-by-case. What is of interest to me, Ian, is the read through the -- through to long-tail lines, to everybody starts to wake up that we've been in this low investment return period that we're pricing the risk probably below where we need to be at, and then we get a little more oomph behind that momentum as well. But time will tell.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Matthew Heimermann with JPMC.", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Jamie, first question for you, just a comment you made on retention. I mean, if you're not the only company to mention that retention trend, to some extent it feels like it's been ongoing for the last several years or just maybe not gotten as many headlines on the casualty side as perhaps on the property side where people were doing it more to mitigate spend and balance out rate increases when they were thinking about purchasing. So I guess with companies having -- being more comfortable writing that business and prices going up, is this a trend you expect to continue to see on the reinsurance side? And if so, should we think about there's something that's coming disproportionately from kind of the large nationwide-type writer? Or is this something you worry about spilling in maybe into some of the smaller regional companies who we might normally think about as more consistent in their buying?", "James H. Veghte", "I worry less so about those companies, Matthew. They tend to be more conservative in their balance sheet management. But clearly, with larger companies, the retention trend has been there for 5 years or so. And frankly, if you look at loss cost and so forth that hasn't been an irrational decision. I do think we'll have opportunities to write business going forward. There is always new opportunities, companies going into new lines of business trying to buy reinsurance as they ramp up. But I don't view large account, casualty reinsurance, as something that may necessarily bounce back as hard as it has in other past hardening markets.", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then when we think about your book at like what percentage of the book is kind of safe versus -- and in plays, so a little bit too dramatic of a word. But is probably -- what part of your book is immune versus to be determined as your going out.", "James H. Veghte", "Well, let's talk about what happened to our casualty book overall over the last 5 years, and it's for a variety of reasons. And I would say retention is probably been not the biggest one, frankly. The largest recently has gotten smaller, it's because we just don't like the return profile of the portfolio. So we are down, really, particularly in the U.S., to those companies that we believe in the long run have a good earnings potential based on their underwriting expertise and so forth. I don't view those accounts as necessarily more at risk by increased retention. It's not the very, very, very largest national writers. It's a variety of companies. But we produce the portfolio more around return profiles than retention, although retention has been an issue.", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Yes. And I guess part of my rational for asking this was just I want to get a sense, right. We've seen some business remixing over the last couple of years, which had a net favorable impact on loss ratio and also risk-adjusted return, we would argue. So I guess is that potentially -- is that trend, which I had kind of thought about being potentially played out, is there potentially more room to go there?", "James H. Veghte", "I'm not sure. We're going to have to see how the market evolve. We love the Casualty business. It's just been -- based on our -- the way we price the business, which is a very realistic view of primary rates coupled with duration matching, the liability profile of that book against investment profile, it's just hasn't been as attractive as the short-tail lines business over the last 4, 5 years. It's not to say it can't come back. If we go back -- again, we've said this before, there's a big difference from the way we view rate adequacy on a CAT book and the way we view it on the Casualty book. And the Casualty market, we're attached to the hip to the primary market because we are writing quote sharing insurance working, et cetera. I don't necessarily -- again, I don't necessarily think we're predisposed to go one way or another. We remix the business based -- the book of business, based on what we see out there. It's just so happened over the last 5 years, shortening the tail of the book has been the only rational way forward as we've seen it.", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "That's fair. And then just on the -- I guess for Greg, just on the short-tail book impact on the first half loss re-estimation, I wasn't quite sure since you've said short-tail specific, how I should translate that just into the quarter, if you could bottom line that. And then would that be all the favorable year-over-year impact you talked about in the short tail? Or was there any other kind of frequency benefit as well?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Sure. The impact in the quarter from Q1 and Q2 is about 3 points. So we had 3 points better performance based on the reserve that we have put up for Q1 and Q2 on the short-tail lines. There isn't anything else that comes to mind that would have impacted the loss ratio significantly.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.", "Okay. So in the press release, when you talk about improved large loss activity year-over-year, that's -- I should think about that tying directly to 300.", "Michael S. Mcgavick", "300?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "To 3 points.", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "To the 300 basis point improvement, yes.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Yes, sorry. Yes, 300 basis points, yes.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.", "Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "So listen, I'd love to just get a sense. When you think about suggesting that your intuition has the modeled estimates rising to $20 billion or so level in the industry, sort of playing out at that level, is there anything in your data that's driving that? Or is this just sort of your intuition having sort of seen this story before in thinking about the various biases of the models with respect to [indiscernible]", "James H. Veghte", "Josh, it's largely intuition. But based on what we've [indiscernible]", "Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Then the final question, I think this is probably for Greg. A very helpful example of a typical policy. I was just trying to make sure I understood. So you suggested, I think, that the gross sublimit was $25 million for a $1 billion schedule of insured value? Is that per-facility charge? Or is that for the entire customer and all the potential flood exposures, only $25 million?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Josh, it was $250 million gross sublimit for all risks. It's $25 million flood for all locations sublimit.", "Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. So hypothetically...", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "And then we further bought that down with facultative reinsurance of $15 million down to $10 million.", "Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "I see. So as a practical matter, when a policy like that, assuming it's not all non-wage and you'd be thinking of that the $10 million -- for net to you guys, $10 million of exposure, but you might see an industry loss associated with something like hypothetically a $25 million in each of the facilities assuming they all weren't in the same place is the right way to think about how that might that stack up?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "$25 million across all the locations, not each and every.", "Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "So I'm sorry to be slow here, but so you're saying that even with all $1 billion of exposure, there would only be sort of 2.5% of the total amount would be available for flood even if multiple exposures were impacted -- or multiple locations?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Correct. And Josh, sorry to interrupt, let me -- I just want to make sure I'm clear. This is an example from the largest loss notification that we have so far. So it is not meant to be typical of the risks that we have reported as part of the $175 million, right? This is the largest of the bunch. So don't read across $10 million each and every loss notification.", "Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Well, actually I was impressed it was so small.", "Michael S. Mcgavick", "I think you\u2019re listening [ph] now, Josh.", "Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Yes, is that the net -- is this what's driving -- is this driving your thought that people are going to come out of this and feel like they've been underinsured and even large commercial accounts that probably thought they were on top of these issues?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "This is certainly a case for the large commercial business. The personal lines, which of course is the more tragic of the story because it affects so many more people, is a combination of what's going to be covered by the flood program, what's going to be covered by private carriers. And when that's all added up, how much of the loss will actually be reimbursed by some form of insurance.", "Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Right. And just for clarity, this would cover business interruption and similar purchases, CBI, where you sell that as well?", "Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "As a result of -- of losses resulting from flood, yes.", "Operator", "And at this time, I'll turn the call back over to speakers for closing remarks.", "Michael S. Mcgavick", "Well, it's a feeling I've had many times in our industry, and I know those of us at this table are feeling it now. It's a strange set of emotions, on one hand we were looking very much forward to reporting this quarter to you because it is -- it speaks, I think, well to the progress that the firm is making and the trajectory that we're on. At the same time we have this new event, and that event has a number of really terrible elements that we're watching around the region and even some in this room are experiencing, so it's a difficult effect. But at the same time, we just want to give you our views because as clearly as we could. We appreciate that you've been patient with us with respect to Sandy. I've just -- it isn't that much that one can know at this stage. And we can promise that we will be back to you as soon as we feel confident we have our arms around it with as much clarity as we can give.", "So thank you very much for your time tonight, and we look forward to paths crossing soon.", "Operator", "Thank you.

My name is Shirley, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the XL Group plc Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "David R. Radulski", "Thank you, Shirley, and welcome to XL Group's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being simultaneously webcast in XL's website at www.xlgroup.com. And we posted to our website several documents, including our quarterly financial supplement. On our call this evening, you'll hear from Mike Mcgavick, XL Group's CEO, will offer our opening remarks. Pete Porrino, XL's Chief Financial Officer, will review our financial results; followed by Greg Hendrick, our Chief Executive Insurance Operations; and Jamie Veghte, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations who will review their segment results and market conditions, and we'll open it up to questions. Among those also available for questions are Susan Cross, our Global Chief Actuary; Sarah Street, our Chief Investment Officer; and Stephen Robb, our Controller.", "Before they begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that certain of the matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations.  Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. And therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them. Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date in which they are made, and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise.", "With that, I turn it over to Mike Mcgavick.", "Michael S. Mcgavick", "Good evening. We're pleased to report that 2012 was a year of progress across XL and our fourth quarter continued that momentum. A year ago, we committed to expand margins and we were able to do so due to a combination of price increases, greater underwriting vigor and being more disciplined about our spending, while also benefiting from a benign year as with respect to non-CAT large losses.", "We also said we would buy back shares. We estimated that we would buy back about $400 million worth and maybe more if the year progressed better than we expected. In the end, we bought back about $500 million in shares that we associate with our 2012 performance, $402 million during the year itself and another $98 million in January, a delay made necessary by the uncertainty around the losses caused by Superstorm Sandy.", "And in connection with buying back our shares, I would observe that this level could go higher in 2013 if the year plays out as we expect. It is not our goal to expand our capital buffer but rather to keep it level. As we enter 2013, we intend to keep grinding away at what we must do to keep our progress going. As mentioned, we know from what we've heard so far in the earnings season, it is clear that 2012 was, in many ways, a light large loss year for the industry. These kinds of years come and go. What we feel best about is that with the tighter management processes we had been driving home these past several years, if 2013 were to be to an above-average year for large losses for the industry, we will perform much better than we have in the past.", "So let me share some other results from the fourth quarter. Of course, the most notable event was Sandy, one of the top 3 insured storm losses in history and devastating to many on the East Coast. XL's current loss estimate of $355 million is in line with what we provided in our December release and we think is a continuing example of solid risk management and underwriting.", "Greg and Jamie will provide more detail in a moment. But looking beyond Sandy, it is pleasing to us that our underwriting operations on an ex-CAT, ex-PYD basis continued to trend in the right direction.", "Our Insurance segment delivered a 96.5 ex-CAT, ex-PYD combined ratio for the quarter. This segment was about breakeven for the year on the same basis, even after the very challenging quarter one results. But as we told you before, we won't be satisfied with our underwriting in this segment until we are regularly delivering a combined ratio of around 90%. The trend is in the right direction and we are pleased with the momentum.", "Reinsurance, even after taking the brunt of our Sandy losses, had a combined ratio of 104.4% for the quarter and 96.9% for the full year on an all-in basis. We are very pleased by these underwriting results.", "Turning to reserves. As you know, every second and fourth quarter, we make a deep examination -- someone just said I got the number wrong, 86.9% was the full year combined on Reinsurance. Thank you. We are very pleased, as I said, by those results. Turning to reserves, as you know, every second and fourth quarter, we make a deep examination of all of our reserves. And for the fourth quarter of 2012, this resulted in $98 million in releases.", "As for our booked value, our fully diluted tangible booked value per share was $33.35 at year end. This was up 1.6% in the quarter and 18% higher than where we began 2012. The 2 largest contributors to this growth were gains in our investment portfolio, mark-to-market and net income.", "A couple of last areas of comment. First, with respect to ROEs, and second with respect to pricing. As for ROEs, I would say our all-in 6.2% operating ROE for 2012 was not where we want it to be. But it is certainly an indicator of improvement, built upon an increasingly solid foundation. To be clear, driving a better ROE is best achieved by expanding our core operating margins. No other action makes a comparable difference. This grinding work will not stop. And as we get our operating earnings moving in the right direction, the goalpost we will focus on more and more is the ROE we produce. We really need to get back to double digits. And we are very driven to do so, even in this low interest rate environment, should it persist. In this connection, there is one thing you should know, and that is we are focused on getting to double-digit ROEs on an x AOCI basis, given that mark-to-market fluctuations, currently positive about $1.3 billion in our fixed income portfolio, could obviously turn the other way. As a result, we won't focus on these fluctuations and we'll focus on x AOCI ROEs in our drive toward double-digit performance.", "Second, on the pricing environment. This is the first quarter in which I feel that those of us who operate insurance businesses on the whole are finally getting it. You can see that rate is starting to grow year-on-year. We have been expecting this, because in these interest rate environments, the rate levels that are being priced into these risks have not made sense. So it is really good to be hearing the kinds of commentary I've heard across the market about rate and about underwriting discipline overall, particularly on the primary side. This makes sense to us, as we have been in a long time willing to walk away from business that was not adequately priced and have been pushing rate across our lines of business. But let's be clear, rate levels are not yet where they should be and we will not change our approach. But I do feel strongly there's now a bit more tailwind to our efforts than there has been in the past.", "2012 was a solid year of continued progress. We certainly are not done making this a better company. It is not yet the XL we dream of, but I can confidently say we are prouder of the company every day.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Pete.", "Peter R. Porrino", "Thanks, Mike, and good evening. As Mike mentioned, our fourth quarter results were significantly impacted by Sandy. Catastrophe losses net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums in the fourth quarter were $352 million, which is composed of Sandy and some modest positive reserve developments from other 2012 catastrophes.", "Our CAT losses in the fourth quarter of 2011 were $195 million. For the full year, our CAT losses were $464 million compared to $761 million in 2011.", "Despite Sandy's impact, we generated fourth quarter operating income of $39 million or $0.13 per share compared to an operating loss of $80 million or $0.25 per share last year. For the full year, we reported operating profit of $614 million or $1.98 per share compared to $89 million or $0.28 per share in 2011.", "Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders was $81 million for the fourth quarter and $651 million for the full year.", "Our accident year, ex-CAT, Property & Casualty  combined ratio improved by 9.8 percentage points in the quarter and 4.8 points for the full year, a nice illustration of Mike's earlier comments regarding XL's margin improvement.", "Prior year reserve development in the quarter was a favorable $98 million or 6.4 loss ratio points and is up from $68 million in the prior year quarter. This reflects favorable development of $43 million and $55 million in the Insurance and Reinsurance segments, respectively, resulting from our fourth quarter detailed ground-up reserve review.", "For Insurance, positive movements came from Professional, Specialty businesses, partially offset by reserve strengthening in our Excess & Surplus lines business.", "In the Reinsurance segment, the favorable movements were predominant from our short-tail lines with contributions from our U.S. Casualty book.", "Our operating expenses for the fourth quarter were down 7.2% versus the prior year quarter and down 6.2% compared to the third quarter of 2012. The decrease from last year was largely due to the timing of costs associated with our strategic initiatives. The decrease from Q3 2012 was due to changes in variable compensation due to Sandy.", "Our Investment Portfolio delivered total returns of 1% in the quarter and 6.7% for the year. A positive mark-to-market of $72 million for the quarter was driven by tightening credit spreads, partially offset by a marginal increase in interest rates. We had a positive mark-to-market of $987 million for the year.", "Our P&C fixed income duration increased by 0.3 years to 3.1 years since the end of the third quarter due to lower cash holdings and an extension in our agency mortgage-backed portfolio due to a slowing in prepayment projections. However, we continue to manage the P&C portfolio approximately a year short of the corresponding liabilities it supports.", "The life fixed income portfolio duration marginally increased by 0.1 years to 8.8 years. At $169 million net investment income on the P&C portfolio in the quarter was 12% below last year due primarily to lower reinvestment rates.", "The $3 million increase in our P&C net investment income from Q3 2012 was primarily due to a small positive adjustment on our inflation protected portfolios this quarter versus a negative adjustment last quarter.", "We expect net investment income will remain under pressure, given the low interest rates. The P&C gross book yield at the end of December was 2.9%. We estimate that approximately $3.5 billion of P&C assets with an average gross book yield of 3.1% will mature and pay down over the next 12 months compared to average new money rate in Q4 on our P&C portfolio of 1.9%.", "Our net income from Investment affiliates was $32 million compared to a loss of $24 million last year. We experienced more constructive markets this quarter compared to challenging markets in 2011.", "Net realized gains on investments in the quarter were $11 million. And net realized gains for the full year were $14 million compared to net realized losses of $188 million in 2011.", "Last quarter, I discussed nonrecurring beneficial tax items that had impacted operating income. This quarter, there was a $24.5 million tax benefit arising from the release of valuation allowances held against capital loss carryforwards that we utilized in the quarter. This had no impact on operating income. Our full year tax rate on operating income, excluding nonrecurring items, was approximately 11.5%.", "We continue to act on the compelling economics of buying back our ordinary shares. As Mike discussed, during the fourth quarter, we bought back 2.1 million ordinary shares at an average price of $24.78. For all of 2012, we bought back 18.3 million ordinary shares at an average price of $21.99. And in January 2013, following our Sandy loss estimate release, we bought back an additional 3.8 million shares at an average cost of $25.94. This leaves $250 million available -- remaining available for buybacks under the current program.", "And finally, for those of you who might have missed it back in December, S&P revised their outlook from stable to positive.", "I'll now turn it over to Greg to discuss our Insurance segment results.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Thanks, Pete, and good evening. So I'll cover the results for this segment, discuss Superstorm Sandy and finish remarks on recent market conditions.", "Beginning with the results, Insurance segment combined ratio for the quarter was 106.6%, reflecting the adverse impact of Sandy, which contributed 14 points to the loss ratio, $138.7 million in losses, $11.8 million in reinstatement premiums.", "Our underwriting loss is always disappointing. This is a 9.6 point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2011, which was also impacted by CAT losses, namely the Thailand floods and development from prior quarter CATs.", "On an accident year basis, excluding CATs, the combined ratio for the quarter was 96.5% or 8.6 points better than the prior year quarter. Once again, our current accident quarter loss ratio is contributing to most of this improvement. For the fourth quarter, the accident loss ratio, ex-CAT, was 66.8% or 5.1 points better than prior year quarter, driven by favorable loss experienced in our international and North American property books as well as a lower current accident year loss ratios in the aerospace and international primary Casualty.", "The expense ratio in the quarter improved by 3.3 points, 2.4 points driven by flat operating expenses relative to growing net earned premiums and 0.9 points of improvement in the acquisition ratio.", "Given the variability of quarterly results, the best indicator of our improvement in 2012 is the reduction in our accident year ex-CAT loss ratio. For the full year of 2012, we experienced a 66.6% loss ratio, which is a 6.4% improvement over last year and this is our best full year performance since 2007.", "Insurance gross premiums written grew by $161 million or 13.9% in the quarter and $468 million or 9.7% for the full year when normalized for foreign exchange and long-term agreements. Both the quarter and full year growth is attributable to the numerous additive and corrective plans we had put in place over the last 12 to 18 months. We are realizing planned growth in many of our new businesses, in particular, North American construction, E&S and Political Risk.", "In addition, new leadership has helped reinvigorate a number of our existing businesses. For example, our North American U.S. risk management team continues to build momentum in the marketplace and underwrote a unique nonrecurring policy of $17 million of gross written premium, contributing to the high growth rate in the quarter.", "Also contributing was material rate increases in most of our North American Property & Casualty  lines as well as our U.S. professional book.", "In the U.S. professional portfolio, we experienced growth from both increased rates as well as an increase in number of accounts that reached our pricing hurdles.", "Turning to Sandy. The adjustment process continues to progress smoothly, and I am pleased with our claims and underwriting performance to date. As of the beginning of the week, we have received 641 loss notices and new claims have all but stopped. We have closed 84 claims with the resulting paid loss of just under $20 million. To date, we have only a few notices that are in dispute and just one has resulted in litigation.", "Our gross loss estimate is $207 million and is split 80% property and 20% marine and fine art. The largest individual risk loss net of faculty of Reinsurance is $10 million, and this is indicative of an event with a relatively large number of small losses.", "We have attached to our Property Catastrophe and Marine Reinsurance covers, so any adverse development would largely be absorbed in these Reinsurance protections. Our policy holdings are holding up well, and in particular, a strong underwriting of flood and contingent business interruption has served to keep our losses contained.", "Finally, turning to recent market conditions. The fourth quarter was very much a continuation of what we saw in the second and third quarters, with positive rate indications in nearly all our businesses and an overall segment rate increase of just over 3%. Roughly half of the fourth quarter premium experienced rate increases this quarter and in the fourth quarter of 2011.", "North America Property & Casualty continues to show the most strength, where rates increased by 5%. Our global Professional portfolio had another solid quarter with increases of over 3%, led by our U.S. Professional portfolio with a nearly 6% increase and a strong December of just under 9%.", "International Professionals, 1 of only 2 businesses to experience downward rate pressure. As a result, our solicitor's gross premiums written were reduced by $28 million in response to aggressive competition, some of it from unrated carriers.  Our Specialty business were virtually flat, driven by a competitive aviation renewal.", "And our International Property & Casualty book had the strongest quarter in years, albeit on low volume with rate increases exceeding 4%. Additionally, an early analysis of our international January 1 renewals, which represent nearly 1/3 of the portfolio, shows rate and property up 3% compared to up 1% in 2012, and casualty up by 2% compared to down 2% last year.", "While we are in a much better position for a pricing perspective heading into 2013 than we were a year ago, we remain convinced that further rate is needed broadly and in particular on long tail lines of business, given persistently low investment returns.", "We have sacrificed top line in a number of areas where returns are not in an acceptable level and showed no signs of improving. We will maintain this discipline in 2013.", "In summary, I think 2012 was a decent year for the Insurance segment, reflecting a great deal of hard work. But more importantly, I think it sets the stage for further improvement in 2013. And so far, from what we've seen in the last quarter and the early weeks of this year, we believe we can make further progress towards our ultimate goal of combined ratio of 90% or better, as underwriting diligence and expansion of margin continues to be our utmost priority.", "And now to Jamie to discuss our Insurance results.", "James H. Veghte", "Thanks, Greg, and good evening. I'd like to cover 2 principal issues tonight, a review of our fourth quarter and full year results, and also some comments on our recent renewal season and market conditions.", "The Reinsurance segment underwriting result was obviously heavily impacted by Sandy and produced a combined ratio of 104.4% and an underwriting loss of $22 million in the quarter.", "CAT losses in the quarter, net of reinstatement premium, were $204 million with Sandy representing the vast majority of this amount. In addition, we had the benefit of $55 million of prior year releases in the quarter. Excluding both CAT losses and prior year releases, the segment had a very solid combined of 72.9%. This compares favorably to the 85.6% for the fourth quarter of 2011. Six points of this improvement relates to the property CAT book, which includes the benefits of a lower level of development on smaller current-year CAT events compared to 2011. We also had a 4.7% improvement in operating expenses, driven by reduced year end compensation accruals and an improvement of 2.5 points resulting from changes in business mix.", "We remain very prudent around reserve releases on long tail lines, particularly for recent underwriting years. For the full year, this segment had a combined ratio of 86.9%, which compares to the 97.8% combined in 2011. This was impacted by catastrophe losses of $241 million and prior year reserve releases of $176 million compared to 2011, where CAT losses were $406 million and reserve releases $208 million. Excluding the impact of both CAT losses and prior year releases, we had a combined ratio of 83.1% compared to 85.7% in 2011.", "Overall, we had a very solid year of underwriting results. We remain convinced that Sandy will be materially north of $20 billion to the industry and our own loss was within expectations, given the size of the industry loss.", "Turning to top line. Gross written premiums in the quarter were $158 million, which compares to the $105 million written in the fourth quarter of 2011. This increase was driven principally by reinstatement premiums as a result of Sandy and new business opportunities at XL Re America.", "We reentered the crop business on a primary basis. On a year-to-date basis, our gross written premiums were $2 billion, down 3% from 2011. You will recall that our gross written premiums were down significantly in earlier quarters this year as a result of the conversion of the Heartland Crop program from a primary program to Reinsurance assumed program in 2012. A more appropriate year-on-year comparison therefore would be on a net written basis, where we grew 9% to $1.88 billion for the year.", "Turning to market conditions. Our year end renewal went largely as expected, although we did see some unexpected pockets of competitions in areas of the market and we reduced our position or retired from several large placements.", "For U.S. CAT business, loss impacted programs saw rate increases in the 10% to 15% range, while loss-free programs were either flat or in some cases down, particularly for non-win driven programs.", "Demand for capacity was broadly flat. There was more momentum for aggregate-type structures, and 2 large U.S. programs moved that format.", "In the U.K., prices were down 5% on a risk-adjusted basis. And in Continental Europe, the reductions were 3% to 5%, with the exception of Italy, where we saw a double-digit increase as a result of the earthquakes last May. Again, for very large programs, there was plenty of capacity available once the pricing cleared the main lead markets.", "On Specialty lines, the Marine market saw a very robust renewal as Sandy was the latest of the series of significant losses into that market. All indications suggests the Marine component of Sandy was as much as $2.5 billion to $3 billion, and the market reacted accordingly with significant price increases and coverage changes.", "On the aviation side, the general airline book showed price reductions of 5% based on continued good experience, while the general aviation account was reasonably stable.", "Turning to Casualty. Both the U.S. and international markets remain competitive. Reinsurers were again quite determined to retain their renewal accounts and most tried to increase their lines with limited success. There was some increase in seeding company retention levels, a pattern we have seen repeatedly for a number of years. We do take comfort from the continuing improvement in the pricing environment on the primary side and we do find opportunities to write selected business. But broadly, our posture in these markets remains highly defensive.", "Finally, I'd like to highlight one operational note. During the quarter, we added Craig Wenzel, most recently from a leading investment bank, as Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. The convergent space and utilization of third-party capital in our underwriting activities is not new to XL. However, we see this trend becoming an ever increasing part of the capital landscape of the industry, and we are delighted to add Craig to lead our efforts in sourcing and structuring alternative capital to support our underwriting teams.", "With that, I'll turn it back to David for Q&A.", "David R. Radulski", "Shirley, can you please open the lines for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Mike, on the share buyback potential, I believe you mentioned more than $400 million is likely in 2013. Given your return on equity goals, where do you feel the capital base needs to be sized to? And how can the buyback get you there?", "Michael S. Mcgavick", "Yes, let me make, Jay, the first one. The first thing I would emphasize is that the capital leverage by virtue of buybacks is not the most powerful lever we have on producing acceptable ROEs. By far, the most powerful lever we have is on expanding our operating margins and we are moving nicely towards that objective. That's going to be our core focus.  That said, as I emphasized, it is not our goal to expand our capital buffer at this time. We'd like to keep it level. And if we are successful through the year in expanding our margins, to keep it level obviously, that would imply that we would need to buy back at a higher level than the $400 million we committed to early last year. I'm not ready to put a number around that. I think it's premature as we have a number of our capital management policies still to consider with the board. But just the logic of keeping it level would suggest that we would be looking to do more over the course of this year if it plays out as we expect. But our focus in driving the better ROE comes from expanded operating margins. That's what we're working toward, and we believe we can continue to deliver that in 2013.", "Peter R. Porrino", "Jay, this is Pete. Just one point of clarification on the way you asked the question. We view our buybacks in '12 as $500 million, right, because of timing difference from Sandy. And I think Mike's comment that he made in his prepared remarks was that was where we were starting from.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "That's an important clarification. Okay. And then on the Insurance segment, if we look at the ex-CAT, ex-prior development baseline, it went from 94.7% in 3Q, this is with the Insurance segment, to 96.3% in 4Q. Previously, it had been improving every quarter on a linked-quarter basis and this ticked up a bit. It'll be helpful to understand, does this reflect some onetime items or some noise, or should we expect that to continue to head back down in subsequent quarters?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Jay, it's Greg. I'd say one note at the high level is that given the nature of the business we're in, upper middle market and large corporate space, the quarter is always going to have some variability to it. So what I'd like you to do is focus on the accident year ex-CAT loss ratio, which is the real -- I think the real interesting piece. If you look at that, for the full year, our accident loss ratio ex-CAT was 66.6% and 6.5 points better than prior year. And I'd put that improvement into 4 categories. First, our traditional short-tail property lines performed better than prior year and account for about 2% of the full year improvement. So this is the result of a lot of hard work in re-underwriting the portfolio, particularly around driving rate, where we've had the highest rate increase in our North American property book, in terms of conditions as well. The second piece is around large property losses which account for roughly 3% of the improvement. And there, we used $10 million of the threshold for large losses. And in accident year 2011 we got $157 million of those large losses versus just $11 million in 2012.", "Now this is a scenario where it's hard to attribute precisely between fortuity and scale. We are de-risking the international property portfolio, but it's really impossible to tell you precisely how much we have done that on scale and fortuity. The last 2 drivers are rate exceeding trend on the entire portfolio, and that's about 0.5 point, and change in business mix drive the other point. So year -- our full year over a full year, I had to attribute at least half better improvement to our underwriting actions. I know this is a subjective exercise. You can't put a pinpoint on it. So I just say any quarter-to-quarter there's going to be noise in it, but let's really focus on that full year to full year result because that's a little more of time particularly because we can't have lumpy books of business and activity in a particular quarter.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "That's helpful. And just to clarify, that 90% combined ratio target in the Insurance segment, that's on a calendar year including CATs and any prior-year development?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "It wouldn't include prior-year development.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse.", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "My first question, the expense ratio appears to have benefited from operating leverage. Is that a trend you believe will continue in 2013? I guess that's kind of a backdoor way of asking about the growth outlook as well.", "Michael S. Mcgavick", "Yes. So I would tell you that toward the end of the year and particularly in the fourth quarter, we did begin to see some lift from the relationship between expenses and top line for the first time. And that is because some of the investments that we've been making so heavily over the last couple of years are beginning to pay off. We expect that to be a more pronounced feature of how 2013 plays off. So I think you are seeing the initial signs of that. But as we think about expenses relative to growth next year, we think that should be a trend that does continue.", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I guess, in regards to the growth this quarter, I think higher retentions were cited in the press release. What type of a component was -- did that play in the growth?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "For the year -- sorry, this is Greg. In Insurance segment, for the year, I'd break it roughly down new business both within existing businesses and in what I would call new operations, like construction and E&S, was about half the driver. Rate increases were about 1/4 of the driver. And that increased retentions, a larger base of renewal -- retention are actually mix, depending upon which segments you're in, but over the whole book we are up a little bit. It was about 12% of that rest of that change. And the rest is a lot of other noise  that -- lots of them are small items.", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And just lastly, in regards -- there's lot of different names for this type of business, that convergence, I guess, initiative or -- do you expect to have that up and running by midyear? And any other kind of details around what the plans are for that segment with the new hire, Craig Wenzel?", "James H. Veghte", "I'm not sure how you define up and running by midyear. Craig has already joined us...", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I guess the announcement of side cars or whatever you guys are looking to do.", "James H. Veghte", "Well, we're not certain. And frankly, when we hire new underwriting teams, we don't push them to put business on the books because they've joined us. We've hired Craig because he's an expert in this area. And one of the things we want him to spend a lot of time on in the first 3 to 6 months of his tenure is to figure out where we fit into this environment and what the best products would be for us to go out in the market around it. So even if we don't have a structure in place by the end of the year, we won't consider this a failure. This is something that we are planning for in the long term. We think it's part of the capital landscape of this industry for a long time. And we will put structures in place when they are appropriately sized. And Craig, he got to spend a lot of time trying to figure out what the best way forward for us would be. So we don't have any current target date to put any structures in place.", "Michael S. Mcgavick", "The only thing I'd add into Jamie's exactly correct answer is that they can be -- they can come in to market pretty quickly. And it's not like we haven't been looking at these kinds of deals over the last several years, it's just that we've finally decided that we really did need to get into the space and wanted someone who is a market leader and thinking about it on our team as we did. So it could be that we don't do any next year. It could also be -- it could happen relatively quickly. It depends on how we feel about the specific opportunities that are advanced. And I really love the emphasis, we feel no -- under no pressure. We will do the right thing as they come along.", "James H. Veghte", "I do -- I'd add one thing, too. I do think we're ideal candidates to attract interested members of the investment community into the space. We've been in the property CAT business for 20 years now based on our origins with Mid Ocean Re. Our loss ratio is in the mid-40s. And I think there would be very, very few companies that could match that sort of track record.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just wanted to understand how are you thinking about CATs within your guidance of -- or within your target of the 90% accident year?", "Michael S. Mcgavick", "While we don't discuss it in precision publicly, we of course have an average CAT load that we developed based on the models and our recent experience. And that CAT load is built into the budget, and it's part of how we would expect -- when we say getting to a 90% combined, we think of that with the average CAT load as the core plug for what will happen in the year.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, good. That's how we actually model it. So 3-year, 5-year, 10-year average CAT load is between 7.5 to 10 points. So I mean, I guess I'll just -- my math would then mean that you're aiming accident year ex-CAT for the low 80s? Have to be, right?", "Michael S. Mcgavick", "Well, look, we write large accounts, large limit complex business. So you would expect that we would have the lumpiness that Greg expressed and that we would have meaningful CAT loads as a part of it. That's one of the reasons when we're talking about reinsurance, for example, we don't focus on ex-CAT numbers because we're in the business. And for large parts of our industrial business, that same is true. So yes, we would have meaningful CAT load in there, but we haven't chosen historically to get into the details of the CAT loads we view as competitive.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Got it. Okay, great. And the somewhat along the same lines, if you take today's -- or if you take the 2012 accident year, you're over 1,000 basis points away from the target. It seems that 100 basis points improvement is about $0.19 a share. So you just did $2 in earnings, $2 plus on the year. If you do another 1,000 basis points, that's another $2. That's $4 in earnings. Are you aiming better? Are you aiming for better than a 10 ROE? Or how do we think about it?", "Michael S. Mcgavick", "Well, I guess I look at it as steps along the journey. The reality is with the interest rates being where they are, those double-digit hurdle rates that used to look sort of like the least you would expect are getting very difficult to produce. So as I look at it in the near term, our fundamental objective is to get back to double digits. And once we're there, we'll see how far we can push it. But when you get to the kind of 90% combined, if you can run the 90% combined as we believe we can in our insurance operations, if Jamie and his team keep the kind of performance levels we've seen over the last several years on a blended basis, you get to the right kinds of returns. And remember that some of the capital that is now used surplus starts to get -- put to work through our growth over that same period. So you have to be able to kind of triangulate the growth, the declining combined ratios, stability in our expenses. When you get all those pieces in line is when it will produce the right kinds of ROEs.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then last one just on the same thing. It's just this trajectory, and we can see it coming through the numbers, I mean, it's happening. What is sort of the gating mechanism on speed at which you can achieve these targeted returns? I mean, I know you've broken out granularity in the business and stuff. So what's keeping it from happening, say, in 1 year's time versus 3 years' time aside from the weather being a bit of a wildcard?", "Michael S. Mcgavick", "I'll give you -- well, as long as we feel confident in our modeling around CAT loads over time, I feel very comfortable with ignoring the weather, if you will. Obviously, any insurer has to be thinking very seriously about the frequency of large events right now, and we are too. The good news is that most of the modeling organizations and certainly the additional work we do beyond what the modelers give us includes a real respect for recency. And I think that's the appropriate way to take into account what we're seeing. But as I think about the speed of improvement, we've seen over -- on a year-on-year basis, when you strip away all the noise, and I really like Greg's answer with regard to 1 quarter versus another. I don't look at it 1 quarter versus another. We love it when it keeps coming down. We don't expect it to come down every quarter. But if you put a ruler on over any 4-year period -- or any 4-quarter period, we expect to see real improvement. I personally have a view that it should accelerate. Why? Because we've been getting rate on rate. And that's the first time we've been able to say that in a long time. When you start seeing rate on rate year-over-year, you're going to get some improvement, especially as in many lines, we are certainly exceeding loss cost trends at this stage. That's very positive. The second thing is if you go back through the period in which we've had this more rigorous mentality around our underwriting operations, our fresh leadership in place, many of them are getting their second crack at their books of business on this renewal stretch. So you're going to get there first wave of impact because day by day last year we were improving the books through underwriting actions. That starts to compound itself. So these things should accelerate. I haven't established publicly, nor will I, any particular \"on this date, we will hit 90%\". But clearly, the trend is very positive and we believe momentum should accelerate if we remain focused, disciplined and grind it out.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Yes, let me just add that this is really a question for me around rate adequacy. And Greg, you started kind of with that high-level look down. We do a top-down look at rate adequacy. When we run it through economic capital models and translate that back into a combined ratio, targets we get into that same 10% to 12% range -- 10% to 12% improvement range that you started with. We also measure it, although it's a building skill for us, we measure it from the bottom up as well in a number of our businesses. And a lot of that technology spend that we've talked about over the last 2 years is going towards making us better at building it from the bottom up, so account by account. But even that way coming up, it gets us into that same range of kind of 10% to 12%. How do we get there? How do we get to adequacy? It is a grind. It's not a fun word, but it is a grind. I believe that where the market pricing is going, we will get there in a couple of years in of itself, but we're not going to sit by here and contingently watch that happen. We're going to grind it and mix within businesses. So within a particular business where they're doing an exceptional return overall, winnowing out some of the parts of it that aren't performing well. And then we're mixing our business in total towards more profitable segments of the portfolio. So it's not just rate, it's rate and it's mix in both directions.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Vinay Misquith with Evercore Partners.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "The first question is on growth. That was pretty significant in the primary insurance operations this quarter. Did your new operations have some traction? And should we expect some sort of similar level of growth in the near future? Or were these some onetime items this quarter?", "Michael S. Mcgavick", "This is Mike. I'm going to turn it over to Greg. But to be clear, as he described in his introductory remarks, there were some pretty remarkable onetime experiences in this particular quarter like the one in risk management, the kind of one-off short-term contract that affected these numbers. But in general, should we expect to be growing and should those new operations be contributing? Yes. I don't think that will be the big defining moment. I think the rate beginning to accumulate, combined with some of our existing operations that have also been able to source some more attractively priced risk, I think that will be the main driver.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Vinay, at the risk of being redundant, always pointing you towards the full year rather than the individual quarter. Particularly though, to give you a little bit of color in the quarter, the normalized growth was just over 12%. About 1/3 -- almost 40% of that was in new businesses coming online. We talked about, I talked about construction, E&S, political risk. About 1/4 of it was in rate increases. And then there are just -- it's just the nature of the business we are in. They are quite often large transactions that can be lumpy, and so there are a whole number of moving parts that would take way too long to go into what makes up the rest of that particular movement in the quarter.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Sure, that's very helpful. The second is a numbers question. Within the Reinsurance segment, the operating expense ratio was really low. Should we be using the prior quarter's number as more as a baseline versus the current quarter?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "There was a significant reduction this quarter principally around compensation, accruals, both in the annual cash plan and reductions versus 2011, in particular because some long-term incentives paid last year and didn't pay this year. As to whether we would use it as a normal run rate would really depend on where the bonus pools come out each year.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Right. So normally you would expect it to be higher than 10?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Slightly, yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.", "Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "In terms of the last years of re-underwriting your commercial property book, do you have the right exposures you wanted to be in New York City commercial property now that Sandy happened? What are sort of the postmortems on this loss and your exposures?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "So Josh, I mean, one high-level comment is always to be very careful both from a positive or negative standpoint to overreact to one event, right? It's -- you're looking at 1 point on a -- when you look at the CAT model in particular, you've got 1 point on a curve of 100,000 events. So you don't want to overreact one way or another. We are able to track our flood aggregates quite tightly. We have made a big push on that. So from the dimension of Sandy and flood in our exposure in New York City, I'm quite comfortable with those. In terms of the overall book, I don't -- we monitor across, not just nat cat but also across terrorism, earthquake -- I'm sorry, not just winds and flood but earthquake, terrorism. And all those things are well within our risk tolerances. So I think the mix of business we have there is strong, and I think the exposure levels we have are appropriate.", "Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Let me try and ask this another way, which sounds completely different but really about the same thing. To what extent do you think that Hurricane Sandy will post rate increases to New York City commercial property and other lines of business as this storm is a storm with a payback?", "Michael S. Mcgavick", "So that's a different question. And there, I do think that Sandy was a very meaningful wake up call to exposures that are concentrated in these intensely urbanized areas. I thought our book performed -- first of all, it performed as we expected under such an event and performed well. And I think our underwriting teams had done a good job of thinking about our exposures, particularly in the flood and business continuation spaces, as Greg mentioned earlier. But I do think that there's going to be a number of rethought approaches to underwriting in the area. And I think we and our competitors are going to sort that out. Whether that will lead to wholesale price changes, I'm not so sure. I certainly think that it will lead to some reaction in the marketplace, and we're seeing that. I also think, to be clear, there are few lines of business that really made Sandy stand out, and I think you'll see very strong reactions to those. And I wouldn't be surprised, as the mayor and the governor have indicated, to see structural responses in the region that will also affect how one will approach rate over time. So to break that down a little bit, lines like fine art space [ph], those are going to get significant changes. And I bet there's differences in business practices that emerge as a result of the losses we saw. When you see the marine space, I imagine there will be differences in business practices and in structures than when those things are rebuilt than we saw before. So whether it leads to wholesale price changes, I don't think is exactly the right question. It will be what will be the changes in risk and how will we price those going forward. And I think that will require a lot of thought because it's going to -- it's not going to be a static game. It's going to be a moving game.", "Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Well, it's been 3 months now I realized, probably right off Sandy there were no increases in terms of -- have these started to flow through? I mean, I don't know much about the artwork insurance market, but have you been able to reprice? Is this business going elsewhere if it's not meeting the price? What's been happening in the past 2 months?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "So Josh, yes, in the property insurance market, this has definitely put a -- and particularly in the Northeast, put a floor under the pricing environment. It varies greatly by risk to risk and whether you're loss effective or not. In general, watching the market on property drive lower sublimits for flood, higher deductibles for flooding and some movement of coastal wind deductible. But this is in the large property space, right? These are large upper middle market or large corporate customers. Particularly, your question to fine art, a little early and not enough data points to make a strong standard point, but certainly anecdotally, from my conversation with the team, yes, we're getting rate. I think our team performed exceptionally well in Sandy, but we are getting rate there. I wouldn't want to put a lot of figures around it, but right now we're seeing more rate.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "A couple questions. The first is I guess a year ago, you talked about an expense load that would impact your 2012 year. I'm wondering if you could talk about the -- are we talking about the investments really you are making. I'm wondering if you could talk about the level of those investments in '13 versus '12, if it would make it even more challenging or will it lighten up a little bit?", "Michael S. Mcgavick", "In fact, I almost did a run-on sentence in the prior question because this is the other piece you need to look to when you get to the ROEs we're talking about. It's not just what we can do on the underwriting side, but how the expenses now give us some operating leverage instead of being kind of a hill to climb every year. So I'll let Pete get into specifics but the short answer to your question, Jay, is the burden comes down because a bulk of this expansion has been made.", "Peter R. Porrino", "Yes, so Jay, what I'd say is we're not -- we're clearly not done in that space, but we do see a leveling off. And as I think about expenses for the next year, I see, I would call it normal expense growth that you would see, plus a little bit for some of the new business initiatives that Greg and Jamie have in mind. If I sort of look at in the big picture, I would see it in the low to mid-single-digit range, which certainly was less than what we told you we would do last year and what we actually did last year.", "Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "That's really helpful. The other question is on the Life Re business. You've seen a number of transactions or certain companies have been able to greatly reduce or eliminate their exposure to run off businesses, Sun Life, Cigna. And the environment just seems to be getting better for those types of transactions. Is that something you could possibly do for your Life Re business?", "Michael S. Mcgavick", "Should I give you my phone number now? I mean, we have been actively open to proposals that could yield such an outcome for us. However, nothing has come forward that makes any sense. The book is performing as expected. And if it's a run off, it's a run off. So we'll just have to see what comes. But make no mistake, all on the call and any beyond, if you have a brilliant idea for that block of business and can do something more attractive than we can run it off, we're all ears.", "Peter R. Porrino", "Jay, this is Pete. Just a little amplification. I agree completely obviously with Mike. The other thing I would add is we do have conversations here from time to time. I would make 2 comments with a comparison. One, life reinsurance has got different set of obstacles to it than primary life business does. And the second one is our book, as you know, is based in Europe and that also has a complication to it.", "Michael S. Mcgavick", "So you can see how this works. I encourage all callers and then Pete says don't bother.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Greg and Mike, I'm just curious here. Greg, you mentioned that casualty pricing is up about 2%. And if I think about what the decline in interest rates have been over the last couple of years, I'm kind of struggling to understand why is casualty all of a sudden attractive? And why all the growth all of a sudden?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Well, Brian, so let me -- so the 2% was around international book, which I know it's sad somewhat to cheer plus 2%, but we've arrested a number of years of declining rates. I think if you're looking at the financial supplement, I'll let Pete and Steve add in here, part of the growth there is coming from lines of business in the casualty other for the year. I think it's about $200 million. The 3 biggest movers in there are the U.S. risk management business, which -- okay, it's casualty, but given the structured nature of that, I don't view it in the same way as being as hugely investment sensitive -- interest-rate sensitive as some of the excess casualty or the large limit casualty.  International upper middle market, which has a component of casualty and property to it, and our construction business, which has some workers' comp, some g/l, but also some professional and property. And this is just a consistent thing. We've mapped those businesses by casualty class for a number of years based on the fact that when we started out with those, they were predominantly casualty. But that -- those 3 alone explain about 80% of that growth year-over-year. And, Steven, you want to add to that?", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And then I wonder if you could kind of talk a little bit about you're seeing with respect to loss trend? Anything unusual going on?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Nothing unusual. For the full year of 2012, our 3% rate change maps to a blended overall loss trend of 1.8%. So not a large victory but a victory nonetheless. Generally speaking, short tail lines are ahead of trend, and long tail lines are trailing. And on a geographic basis, the U.S. book is getting rate ahead of trends, and the international book is lagging. You can -- always happy, and you'll take it when you're beating trend, but clearly that differential needs to keep growing.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Meyer Shields with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "We haven't talked at all about the lines of business that were considered challenging at the beginning of this year or described that way. Is it safe to infer that they're basically in line with the balance of the book now?", "Michael S. Mcgavick", "Yes, entirely. We don't think about them anymore. What we think about is that every part of our book has to perform well. And anywhere we're not getting the performance we need, we're going to put a lot of love and care and attention on it. And so we don't break it out internally anymore. It doesn't have any meaning. It's just kind of a thing of the past. But we do -- we can give you some numbers if you'd like, but I don't think it adds any insight to how we're performing.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Yes, at the risk of open-door, but the business formerly in the challenged category, performed at an -- in the quarter ex-CAT loss ratio 96.6 -- combined, I'm sorry. Combined, 96.6 compared to 112.4 Q4 '11, and 96.5 for the remainder of the portfolio. For the full year, which I have always said is the more important one, the ex-CAT -- the accident ex-CAT combined ratio was 99.3 compared to 113 last year and 98.3 for the performing portfolios. So 5 of the 6 businesses experienced the fourth quarter accident ex-CAT improvements. And that's it, we're done breaking them out.", "Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I don't remember if it was Peter or Greg that talked about adverse development on excess and surplus lines. I was hoping to get a little more detail on that.", "Peter R. Porrino", "Sure. Greg, do you want me to...", "Michael S. Mcgavick", "We have our Chief Reserving Actuary here, too, Susan Cross. She is the best to answer that question. Sue?", "Susan L. Cross", "Right. So the development that we experienced from the quarter on the excess and surplus line portfolio was $50 million. And that is concentrated in 2 specific portfolios, an apartment book and New York contractors. And that we've experienced more notices and a longer period of reporting than what we had previously assumed.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Let me add, you also heard me talk about growth in E&S, which I know it sounds somewhat contradictory, if you look at the $50 million. It is a completely different book. I think we've talked about this before that it's a brand-new management team. We have added expertise in railroad. We've added expertise in properties, something we didn't have before. We've completely re-underwritten to almost the point of extinction the 2 books that Susan mentioned. We've added auto capability and excess -- and umbrella capabilities as well. So that's a whole different book of business going forward, just to be clear why I note the growth in it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Jamie, would it be possible just to understand how much of the low frequency of large losses impact the loss ratio in the Reinsurance segment in 4Q? And just one follow-up.", "James H. Veghte", "The delta from Q4 '12 to '11, roughly 13.5 point improvement, 6 if it was from the CAT. And the reason is that we assess our IBNR requirements for the benefit of the information on actual CAT activity through the year. During 2012, the level of smaller CAT events has been significantly lower than past years and lower than 2011, in particular. So we reduced the loss ratio for this business during the fourth quarter, even though it really was attributable to activity during the course of the year. In effect, it's a true-up based on the sort of that target pick relative to the actual.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So better to think about the full year kind of number as ...", "James H. Veghte", "Exactly. The New York CAT-loss ratio this year was 35%, last year was 71.6%.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then, Pete, one question I was wondering. From what we've seen so far this quarter, we've seen AOCI marks have been mostly negative. So I was a bit surprised that you're bookmarked up in the quarter, and I realized it's hard to kind of speculate why yours zigged when everybody else zagged. Is there any granularity you can give us on why that -- what might have contributed to somewhat of an unexpected outcome?", "James H. Veghte", "Sure. I think our portfolio probably is a little bit different because of the European Life book that we have. I would say that probably contributed the vast majority of that surprise to you.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I see. And then you said or could you give us an idea of how much capital is supporting that Life Re business?", "James H. Veghte", "It's in the Fin Supp. We disclosed both the GAAP capital. And since last quarter, we also disclosed in essence to get into the statute -- the regulatory capital as well.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Last one, real quick. Satellite loss in the quarter, is there any -- do you know if we have exposure there or if you have exposure there?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Mike, we don't talk about individual losses. We do -- we are an active participant in the satellite market on the insurance side. We have roughly on average of 3% to 5% market share of a given launch. But we then buy reinsurance, protected it for about 50%. So that gives you hopefully enough color to put a box around it.", "James H. Veghte", "Mike, so you don't have to look it up. It's in the Fin Supp Page 22. It's about $2.2 billion of GAAP, net assets, and the regulatory would be about $1 billion.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill.", "J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Why do you think that the rate outside the U.S. has been so different than in the U.S.?", "Michael S. Mcgavick", "I think -- this is Mike. I think there are couple of factors that affect us internationally, and particularly in Europe. Number one is culturally, the insurance buying process there has a larger expectation of continuity than we would see in the U.S. market, where there is much more responsiveness to fundamental economics. So there's just a cultural difference that I think makes achieving rate a more difficult task in the European market. I think the second thing you have to look to, and this is an area where there's opportunity for us, is that Europe is under tremendous pressure. So if you're a risk manager in Europe, you are working like the devil to try and lower your cost of your operations to your company because the economy there is providing such a bleak and difficult outlook to you. And this means that's what's really important for us is to work with those risk managers. And we're often the lead on these programs. So we're in the position best able to work with them. Not so much to gain rate but gain rate per risk. So try to restructure programs so that they can actually lower their cost, which may yield the result for us that looks like decline in premium, but may actually be better structured in our own eyes in terms of the rates per risk that we're taking on.", "But the 2 characteristics that I would cite are the pressures they're under economically over there, combined with the kind of the continuity culture that drives the renewal process.", "With that, I'm going to turn over to Greg for a more specific answer.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "I'd only add one thing to Mike's answers, which is quite often again, we're in the large corporate, upper middle market space. Most of the business is quite often what is referred to as trophy accounts. So in the market, they are big-name clients that everyone's -- that carry large premiums relative to whatever else is bought and sold in the marketplace and the competing insurers want to have on their roster of insureds. So that's another dynamic where you have a fewer number of insurers to draw from. And the large ones where we are particularly specialists in get quite competitive with the local carriers.", "Michael S. Mcgavick", "That's one of the reasons we called out the progress we're making in terms of early indicators on rate this year. It's a small sample size relative to the book because we're really pressing our folks. And we feel they've done a -- given those difficulties that we've described, we feel they're doing a really nice job, and we're standing behind them 100%.", "J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Unrelated question. There's been a lot of talk that the securities market is sort of absolutely here to stay in the property CAT business, [indiscernible] financial issues the CAT bought. Do you think that this is -- I guess what's your opinion on whether or not this is a sign that profitability is somewhat capped in that business now?", "James H. Veghte", "I don't know whether it would be capped. I certainly think like any business, the law of supply and demand are going to have an impact on things. And there is a tremendous amount of capacity available on that market, both traditional and nontraditional. So I think by definition, there's liable to be some impact on rate levels. But I do believe that third-party capital is going to be a component of this business for quite a long time. The level at which it participates in the market will depend probably on interest rate levels and other opportunities that these sources of capital have invested.", "J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Do you see this as kind of a fundamental change in the market or not?", "James H. Veghte", "I beg your pardon?", "J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Do you see this as sort of competition just from another source as opposed to a real change in how the market dynamic is working?", "James H. Veghte", "Yes, I mean, we think it represents about 15% of the market now. That's probably going to ebb and flow over time. I think the days of automatic startup pure equity-related entities after major losses may be different. Next time you might see ramping up of third-party capital that can participate directly into the market rather than that. But it is liable to go up and down over time, depending on the broader investment environment.", "Michael S. Mcgavick", "This is Mike. I'd add a couple of other thoughts. I certainly think that where you suddenly, to get into a harder market, it would take the top off of that move because you'd have people -- in current conditions, you'd have people flooding in. But you have to remember, part of this is the tremendous pressure these managers are under to find new sources of opportunity. The rest of the investment world just looks so bleak. So that's one piece that we don't know how long that piece lasts.", "And another piece that we think about around here is, it's one thing to have it happen in times like these. But if you ever got into a big set of losses, I'd be curious to see how many folks are really in for it 100% of the time when big losses are over and over. So as long as it kind of bounces along like it is, I think what Jamie said holds true. But there's a lot of volatility that could come into that market, and we'll see how it performs after that. That's why I think the fundamental traditional reinsurance market is going to continue to have its place. It's just going to have this additional activity that will be a part of the market episodically, and that's fine, and we intend to participate.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ian Gutterman with Adage Capital.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.", "Just hoping to clarify some of the -- a couple of earlier things I'm still a little confused on. So on the expenses, Pete, I just was looking at the overall full year P&C expense ratio. And in 2010, it was 31. In 2011 it was 31. In 2012 it was supposed to go up and it was still 31. So I guess my question is, is 31 just the right rate? Or was this year's 31 under what you would've planned, and this is going to be higher than that going forward?", "Peter R. Porrino", "So I would say, 31 is what we planned for this year. I'd say the expectation is, as Mike and Greg talked about, is that it is going to go down. It's going to go down because of the operating leverage that we are putting in place at the company. Our rate of -- obviously our rate of expenses are going to grow I think pretty significantly, less than our business is going to grow down the road. You will see that accelerate with time.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.", "Got it, great. And then on the capital buffer question, maybe I'm oversimplifying it, but the simplest way to look at capital buffer being steady is to say you'll buy back earnings minus dividend?", "Michael S. Mcgavick", "We'd never put it in exactly those terms, but that is -- that would be the simplest idea. However, you have to remember growth. As we grow, some of the capital is consumed by that growth.", "Peter R. Porrino", "I think we've said -- Ian, this is Pete. I think in the past we've said that it depends on your mix of business. But certainly you can easily get to where 40% of your growth in business as a capital charge.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.", "Got it. And then just my last one, Peter, the affiliate income this quarter is about $31 million. I'm just curious, do you consider that a normal quarter, a really strong quarter? I'm just trying to get some sort of sense of where run rate is for those businesses?", "Peter R. Porrino", "We would put that slightly above our expected run rate.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Josh Stirling from Sanford Bernstein.", "Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "So we talked about -- I think, Greg, you mentioned growth in U.S. casualty is from the risk management, upper middle market in construction. I was curious, is this for you guys more of a cyclical story, so competitors raising pricing and pulling back and creating these opportunities, or are these some of the strategic growth initiatives from a couple of years ago? And if that's the case, are these businesses for you guys structurally attractive? Sort of remind us sort of how do you think about them?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "These are certainly strategically important businesses to us. And the one you picked, U.S., the U.S. risk management for the primary casualty business. I mean, this is a great product to cross sell from our existing customer base and also to attract new customers, and then we can then cross sell remaining products to them. Construction, E&S, primary casualty, political risk, inland marine, those are all businesses we've talked about in the last 2 years. They're all very well-planned out and really very strategic for us. I do think like any other underwriter, I'm always fond of a market dislocation. I wouldn't call the U.S. risk management space that you particularly observed completely dislocated, but there certainly is some movement around in that area. We're looking at it closely. We won't do anything rash. Where we have an opportunity, we'll take advantage of it. It does put a little bit of lumpiness into the premium figures because they can be large gross and premium transactions. So I'm optimistic, but I wouldn't want to convey it to you as a raging dislocation.", "Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay, that's an interesting color. Jamie, I was waiting for the follow-up. One final question -- maybe there'll be others, but on convergence, you mentioned the point that there were 2 large programs places aggregates[indiscernible]. From a distance, that feels like a big move by the seeding carriers to try to put traditional reinsurers at a bit more level playing field with collateralized players. Is that one of the primary drivers of this, or am I just imagining sort of too much[indiscernible]?", "Peter R. Porrino", "No, I don't really think so. I think there has been such a frequency of CAT events over the last couple of years that they're trying to protect themselves against that, rather than play one part of the market against another.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "And, Josh, I'd just add, this is Greg. I'd just -- from XL insurance perspective, we're going to be looking at that same trade-off of currents and aggregate for ourselves to -- for our own protection. I think it's just a good risk management principle to follow, to consider the kind of coverage.", "Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Right, and obviously you are not just a reinsurer.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Randy Binner with FBR.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Most of it, asked and answered, but one thing is the question on D&O. I feel like a year ago, there was maybe more chatter about kind of more claim activity as a follow-through from the financial crisis. And I suppose there has been this LIBOR issue, but I'm not hearing that from this conversation or in the financials. And it sounds like you're growing on the other side of the equation. So is there still claim activity that come from the financial crisis? Or are you not seeing it, it is hitting others? Or how is that body of risk developing?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "So there's a number of pieces in there, and I'll give you a high level, and then let Susan, who oversees the reserving if she wants to add anything in particular. Let me start with LIBOR, which I heard you mention in there. LIBOR continues to be an emerging topic. I know it for myself and probably for you as you asked the question, it's unsatisfying to say 9 months after we start talking about it that the original news coverage arose that it's an emerging topic, but that is the reality of it. We don't know how many institutions didn't follow the guidelines. We don't know the exact culpability of the particular insurers. And we don't have a full feel yet for how it's going to break between what's exposed to U.S. versus international legal standards. As a reminder, the standard D&O coverage for public companies excludes regulatory fines and penalties, Side A responds only if a company cannot indemnify any individual director or officer. And we have a good strong spread of business between Side A, D&O and E&O for financial institutions. We believe that any LIBOR exposure would be covered within our current reserving levels. If you're wanting me to step back now and say some of the other older events, let me turn it over to Susan because she spent more time in that area thinking about those reserves.", "Susan L. Cross", "Sure. Randy, I would just say that the reserves that we have established for the subprime and credit crisis events really are holding up very well. And some of the older claims are reaching that level of maturity that actually in Q4, for the first time, we actually released a portion of reserves from the 2007 year related to the subprime event. So we're very comfortable with the reserves that we have established. Those claims are developing kind of much to be expected, if not more favorably. And we did take some action in Q4 in that regard.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "And I think I've heard in there as well around where we see the market. And certainly we're observing, on the whole, that there is a reduction in class action activity. But there is an increase in some of the M&A-related, what I would call, legal expense, which really is really hitting primarily layers. So when we talk about rate increases, we're seeing that 9% we had in December in the U.S. professional, it's a very different number for -- much higher for the primary book of business and a lot lower for the excess book of business. So you're seeing the reality of the shift at least in the last few years from less big cases -- less big numbers to kind of smaller claims or eating away at the lower primary layers.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "If I was going to kind of bottom line it, at least for XL, because I know you can't speak to how other firms are managing claims and setting reserves, it sounds like you are slowly kind of chewing through the exposure from the financial crisis, just working its way into the numbers. It seems like we're going to hear a lot more about it if I thought back 1 year or 2, and it's kind of disappearing in. And so is that a fair statement for XL?", "Michael S. Mcgavick", "Yes. I think it's the right way to think about it. But remember, this is just a very slow developing set of claims and activities. And so it'll, as you said, bleed in over a long period of time. But our view of it is that the environment for professional is actually getting better, both in terms of what's going on in the claims side and in terms of what's going on in rate. And that gives us a lot of good feeling about the future for this line of business.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Ryan Byrnes from Langen McAlenney.", "Ryan J. Byrnes - Langen McAlenney", "I just have one last one left over. In the property-casualty net investment income, I think last quarter it was a little lower than expected. I think there were some onetime items due to some tips in RMBS. But it was -- in the fourth quarter, it was I guess equally as maybe a little bit lower than expected. I just wanted to see if there were any onetime items in there.", "Peter R. Porrino", "I'm sorry, the fourth quarter -- so this fourth quarter of 2012?", "Ryan J. Byrnes - Langen McAlenney", "Yes, versus third quarter of '12 in a net investment income.", "Peter R. Porrino", "Yes, so that one I would say the fourth quarter '12 we would say is more indicative of a go-forward run rate than the third quarter was. There were some -- we talked about it on the call, some reasonably large adjustments negative for some -- for our tip securities. This quarter, they were a very small positive. This quarter, they were a very small positive, right? And so if you're thinking about going forward, I think Q4 is a better starting point, of course, taking into account what we've disclosed as the $3.5 billion leaving the portfolio and being reinvested in that a much lower yield.", "Operator", "At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the speakers.", "Peter R. Porrino", "This is Pete. Just one clarification for an earlier question that came up on our insurance combined ratio targets. One thing, I -- just one clarification that might have been obvious to everybody but me. But when we talked about that 90%, we're talking about that as fully developed. So it doesn't include PYD for past accident years, okay? But if we do what we believe we do, which is be very prudent in the way that we set our reserves, okay, you need to let that develop out to open it.", "Michael S. Mcgavick", "So with that -- this is Mike. I just want to thank everybody again for taking the time on this call. I know it's getting late in the evening here in the New York area. But I just want to observe that this was a very positive year for XL. It's a real turning of the corner for us, operating this book of business. We feel very good about the insight we've gained, momentum we've gained, but we're very humbled. We know this is a very hard business. There's a lot of small things done every day by 4,000 people around the world that produced this improvement, and that can produce the future improvements that we expect. And while we're not yet the XL we dreamed of, we can see where it is, and we feel very excited to get there. And we'll work with the kind of urgency you have a right to expect in the coming year.", "Thank you very much for your time.", "Operator", "Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference.

As you would have seen in our prerelease, XL's results for the second quarter, like those of many of our peers, were significantly impacted by natural catastrophes. This comes after our sector had enjoyed the benefits of relatively low CAT losses in the first quarter, yet we feel the same about each the first and the second quarter. Setting aside the level of CAT losses, we have maintained our focus on strengthening the quality of our underwriting businesses and enhancing our already strong leadership and we are excited with our progress as it is demonstrated when one looks at the first half of 2013 in its entirety.", "Year-to-date, our all-in combined ratio was 90.8% versus 93% for the first half of 2012. Our combined ratio for the second quarter was 93.8%. Ex-CAT, this was a 92.7%. Again, an improvement over the 93.7% ex-CAT combined ratio for the second quarter a year ago. As regards the second quarter, it includes 3 positive results, one that moves sideways and one that was, at least on the surface, negative.", "On the positive side, first is the fact that we had strong contributions from favorable prior year development of $119 million, a nice affirmation of the strength and prudence of our reserving process. Second, our income from investment affiliates was $74 million in the quarter versus just $17 million in the same quarter a year ago. And third, the pricing trends and insurance continue to be positive and we have seen positive rate in 19 of 22 of our insurance businesses. Those are the 3 things that went well.", "As for a result that was more sideways, that would be this quarter's action ex-CAT combined ratio insurance. While it improved by 1.5 points versus the second quarter last year, it did not stay at the very healthy levels of the first quarter. We are unconcerned. As we near the goal of running a 90% combined, we would expect it to not always be improving but to bounce around some, and this was such a quarter. At the same time, we were able to grow insurance premiums written in the first half of the year by 12.2%, even as we chose to write 3.8% less premium in reinsurance, and the underlying trends in our books leave us convinced that we will continue to see the improvements towards our goals.", "Rising interest rates, on the surface, provided our negative result. In the second quarter, they had a predictably significant impact on our mark-to-market losses, and our book value per share on a fully diluted basis decreased $1.59 in the quarter and $0.86 for the year-to-date. We have long been in a defensive position with regard to interest rates, and while timing and the degree of movement cannot be predicted, we have been expecting an upward move. And everyone on this call knows there are also some very positive benefits to rising interest rates, that is why I call this only a negative on the surface.", "This interest rate volatility is why we regularly refer to our operating ROE excluding unrealized gains and losses. On that basis, our operating ROE was an annualized 9.7% in the second quarter and an 11% for the year-to-date.", "So while in aggregate, we feel very good about the first half of 2013, a quarter like the second quarter reminds us we must continue to improve to reach the goals we have shared with you, and we intend to retain our focus on daily execution.", "I have 2 other issues I would like to briefly comment on before turning it over to Pete. First, as you all know, there are public reports that XL is involved in the insurance coverage of the tragic train accident in Canada. You may have questions on this topic but I must emphasize that we cannot comment on this ongoing situation. And lastly, just in the days leading up to this call, we concluded the establishment of a new Bermuda-based company formed in partnership with a private equity firm Stone Point Capital focused on marrying our exceptional underwriters with third-party capital, where appropriate. We are delighted to announce this new venture and to partner with Stone Point. They have a fantastic track record of investment in the insurance and reinsurance sector, and this initiative aligns perfectly with XL's continued objective to offer innovative solutions for our clients.", "With that, I will turn it over to Pete.", "Peter R. Porrino", "Thanks, Mike, and good evening. Operating net income for the second quarter was $222 million or $0.75 a share on a fully diluted basis, which is the same operating income level as in 2012, but then it represented only $0.71 per share. Our net income attributable to ordinary shareholders was $273 million or $0.93 per share.", "Our P&C combined ratio for the quarter was 93.8% or 3 points higher than the same quarter last year, while our accident year combined ratio was 101.8%, higher by 3.8 points. These increases were due to higher natural catastrophe losses in the quarter, which included flooding in Europe, Argentina and Canada, and tornadoes and hailstorms in the United States. As we previously announced for the quarter, our natural catastrophe losses totaled $134 million or 9.3 loss ratio points, which was split approximately $76 million and $58 million between our Insurance and Reinsurance segments, respectively. By comparison, net losses from natural catastrophes in the same quarter of 2012 totaled $61 million or 4.2 loss ratio points. Prior year reserve development in the quarter was a net favorable $119 million or 8 loss ratio points compared to $101 million or 7 loss ratio points for Q2 2012. This reflects favorable development of $49 million and $70 million in the Insurance and Reinsurance segments, respectively.", "As you are aware, the second quarter is a significant reserve valuation quarter for us, and as a result, we have reacted appropriately to any development indications identified during our in-depth review.", "Positive movements came from specialty insurance lines, as well as casualty reinsurance, and to a lesser extent, property reinsurance lines, partially offset by some strengthening in insurance international professional and certain discontinued lines of business. Our operating expenses were marginally higher than the prior year quarter and in the first quarter of 2013, largely due to added headcount from an expansion in the underlying business, partially offset by ongoing efficiency efforts. As we have indicated in the past, we continue to expect that overall operating expense levels for 2013 will be modestly higher than 2012, but at levels which will show continued improvement in overall operating leverage.", "Turning to our investment portfolio. As a result of increasing interest rates in our key currency jurisdictions late in the quarter, our Investment Portfolio had a negative mark-to-market of $669 million for the quarter, which resulted in a negative total return of 1.6% in the quarter. Unrealized net gains in the portfolio was $686 million at the end of the second quarter. Net investment income on the P&C portfolio in the quarter was $162 million compared to $188 million in the same quarter last year, due primarily to lower reinvestment rates over the last 12 months. The P&C gross book yield at the end of June was 2.7%.", "We estimate that approximately $3.3 billion of P&C assets with an average gross book yield of 2.9% will mature and pay down over the next 12 months compared to the average new money rate in Q2 on our P&C portfolio of 1.6%. As a result, net investment income remains under pressure although current new money yields are generally up 30 to 50 basis points over what we achieved in Q2, which will help alleviate some of that gap if they are sustained.", "As Mike mentioned, our net income from investment affiliates was a very strong $74 million, up $57 million in the prior year quarter. As you know, these results can be volatile but this quarter we saw good returns in all 3 investment affiliate classes, alternatives, private investments and our investment manager affiliates. As a reminder, we report these items on either a 1 or 3-month lag basis.", "Our portfolio composition has not changed significantly. Our P&C fixed income duration increased by 0.3 years to 3.7 years. This increase was largely caused by the impact of higher rates late in the quarter on our Agency MBS portfolio.", "We also added a small amount of duration at the end of the quarter to take advantage of the back up in rates that occurred. Another notable action was the sale of almost 1/3 of our legacy Non-Agency RMBS portfolio in May, which resulted in $17 million of realized gains.", "With respect to capital management, we continue to execute on our share buyback program, and during the second quarter, we purchased 4.8 million shares for $150 million at an average price of $30.97 per share, leaving $575 million available for purchase under our previously announced $850 million share buyback program.", "While for the year-to-date, we have seen a significant increase in our share price, we continue to view these buybacks as an efficient capital management tool.", "As we announced earlier in the quarter, we continue to focus on talent development with the addition of Phil Jacobs to our finance leadership team. I've known Phil for over 25 years and he brings with him a wealth of experience from companies including Barclays and AIG, and we look forward to him joining us next month.", "I'll now turn it over to Greg to discuss our Insurance segment results.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Thanks, Steve, and good evening. Tonight, I'll cover the results for the segment, provide some comments on our semiannual reserve review, give an update on talent and finish with remarks on current market conditions.", "Beginning with the results, the Insurance segment combined ratio for the quarter was 99.6%, 0.5 points worse than the same quarter last year, driven largely by CATs and partially offset by slight improvements in our accident year loss ratio. On an accident quarter basis, excluding CATs, our combined ratio of 97% improved by 1.5 points compared to prior year, driven largely by improved operating leverage. Our year-to-date accident year combined ratio ex-CAT of 95.2% reflects a 6.4 point improvement over the first half of 2012.", "The accident quarter loss ratio ex-CAT was 65.5% for the quarter, or just 0.3 points better than prior year quarter. While I'm unsatisfied with the 2.3 point deterioration in our accident quarter, ex-CAT loss ratio relative to our first quarter results, as I've said in the past, we believe it best to look at results over a period longer than 1 quarter, given we are in a large corporate risk business with inherent volatility. We remain confident about our progress, given our year-to-date accident year loss ratio ex-CAT was 64.4%, a 4.1 point improvement over the same period in 2012. This improvement was driven by better loss and experience in our international property book where underwriting actions have contributed to a full year without a large non-CAT loss in our Marine business. We also benefited from reduced loss ratio within several of our lines, reflecting implementation of various underwriting actions.", "Briefly on CAT losses in the quarter. As Steve mentioned, although the segment incurred $76 million, we performed well relative to market losses as several of our underwriting actions such as tighter flood supplements and the use of facultative reinsurance reduced our overall loss exposure as intended. Insurance gross written premiums grew by $154 million or 11.7% in the quarter after adjusting for foreign exchange movement. We continue to achieve growth in both our mature and new businesses. Our international property North American Construction and U.S. risk management business experienced the largest percentage growth, with the U.S. risk management business benefiting from the addition of several key new clients this quarter.", "Meaningful rate increases across nearly all of our 22 businesses also contributed to the growth. And during the quarter, we renewed our core professional, property and casualty treaties, notably converting the professional treaty to a quota share from an excessive loss. On all 3 placements, we were able to achieve an improved economic result for XL.", "Shifting to loss reserves. We completed our reserve review in the second quarter based on experience of the first quarter of 2013. Overall, this resulted in a prior year reserve lease of $48 million compared to $43 million in the second quarter of 2012. Releases in our aerospace, Bermuda Professional and North American Excess Casualty books were partially offset by strength in our International Professional portfolio and a flat result for our U.S. Professional portfolio, which has been a strong contributor start with a positive PYD.", "Within the U.S. Professional business, we are seeing a security -- that as securities class action lawsuit continue to slow, regulatory investigations and M&A-related losses have picked up. These types of claims tend to incur with a higher frequency, have a lower severity and develop at a faster pace. Being one of the lead primary carriers in the U.S. professional market, XL has been working with clients to structure programs to appropriately ensure these increasing risks since the end of last year. Even with this recent shift, we continue to be very pleased with the stellar performance of this portfolio.", "The adverse development in our international professional book is related to our small solicitors business. Loss frequency has increased over the last few years, and with market competition heating up, some of it with unrated insurance carriers, we simply are not able to obtain the necessary rate increases to make this book profitable. We are in the process of reducing this book by 75% from a peak volume of $80 million, effectively returning only those accounts -- retaining only those accounts that we can underwrite at or above our target return.", "Moving onto talent. We continue to strengthen our teams throughout the segment. In addition to Andy Pinkes who joined as Global Head of Claims in May, we recruited Luiz [indiscernible] to lead our International Professional Group. Luiz starts in September. And we added Renato Rodr\u00edgues as country manager in Brazil, supporting our expansion strategy in Latin America.", "We began underwriting our new crisis management business this quarter after successfully adding 13 new hires to the team. In addition to adding talent from outside the firm, we continue to develop talent from within, promoting Kadidja Sinz to lead our Continental Europe Distribution and Network team.", "Finally, turning to recent market conditions. The second quarter was a further continuation of what we've been seeing for the past several quarters, with positive pricing trends outpacing claim trends in most of our businesses and an overall segment rate increase of 3%. Once again, nearly all businesses achieved positive rate in the quarter, on top of rate achieved in the second quarter of 2012.", "In the second quarter, our global professional book showed the most strength with rate increases of over 4%, and more than 5% in our U.S. professional portfolio. Our North American P&C businesses had another solid quarter with rate increases of 4%, led by our U.S. risk management and excess casualty businesses. Our International P&C business, which has a lower volume in the second quarter, and our specialty business, both had rate increases of 1%, impacted by the competitive market conditions in our primary casualty and aviation businesses, respectively.", "While rate increases are broad-based and 1.5 points over loss trend on a year-to-date basis, we have seen a minor slowing in short-tail lines, particularly in North America. Long-tail rates were generally stable to accelerating this quarter as the economic reality of low investment returns continues to be a positive factor. Attaining price change over loss trends is only one important component of our portfolio management strategy. Optimizing mix and developing appropriate underwriting actions are equally important activities in achieving our return objectives.", "Analyzing most of our businesses on a quarterly basis yields small data sets, and as a result, we do expect some volatility in our results from quarter-to-quarter. That said, our 2013 half year results continue to reflect the improvements that have been made in our underwriting over the past 2 years, and we remain confident in reaching our longer-term goals of combined ratio of 90% or better. From where we stand, it's clearly obtainable, given our determination to maintain our underwriting diligence.", "And now, to Jamie to discuss Reinsurance results.", "James H. Veghte", "Thanks, Greg, and good evening. The Reinsurance segment had a solid quarter of underwriting results with a combined ratio of 79.7%, producing an underwriting profit of $87 million. These results were impacted by prior year reserve releases of $70 million, and catastrophe losses in the quarter of $58 million, net of reinstatement premiums. The headline industry event in the quarter were the European floods, which generated $44 million of this CAT activity, a number well within our expectations for an industry event of this magnitude.", "Excluding the impact of these items, our combined ratio was 82%, which compares favorably to the 83.2% in the second quarter of 2012 on the same basis. During the quarter, $25 million of the prior year releases were from short-tail lines, $45 million were from long-tail lines, and of these, $35 million were from North American lines, where we performed our semiannual major reserve review. We remain very cautious on recent underwriting years and the majority of releases from North American long-tail lines were from the 2006 and prior underwriting years.", "On a year-to-date basis, the segment has produced a combined ratio of 77.3%, virtually the same result as the 77.4% in 2012. Excluding the impact of CAT losses and prior year releases, the 6 months combined of 80.9% compares favorably to the 85.9% in 2012.", "With respect to top line. Gross written premiums in the quarter were $472 million, a 4.4% increase from the second quarter of 2012. There were 2 sources of growth during the quarter. First, $9 million in growth from the property CAT line was driven by increased reinstatement premium and select new business opportunities. In addition, our other category grew by over $25 million. This included $17 million of new business opportunities in our Bermuda specialty account portfolio and $4 million of adjustments from business attaching in prior periods.", "Turning to market conditions. The mid-year CAT renewals in the U.S. have generated considerable commentary around the industry. With abundant capital supplies from both traditional and nontraditional sources chasing the business, particularly the Florida-domicile specialist companies, the pricing pressure was significant. On a risk-adjusted basis, pricing was off 15% to 20%.", "You will be aware we have a consistent and long-standing method of measuring rate adequacy. Going into this renewal, this portfolio had a very solid adequacy level, and notwithstanding the price reductions, still measures acceptably on our scale. Therefore, we actually grew our book slightly with our Florida-generated direct CAT premium increasing by $3 million. Prior to the renewal season, we targeted a limited number of clients to grow and were successful in doing so.", "In addition, we have traditionally found rate adequacy levels to be more attractive at the higher end of these programs, and the greatest pressure on pricing was at these higher attachment levels. We chose to rebalance the portfolio slightly with more capacity deployed at lower attachment levels as the rate adequacy differential tightened. So all in, we modestly grew our aggregates and our premium based on targeted client expansion and rebalancing the book. While we would have preferred a less competitive renewal, we are satisfied we have a balanced, solidly price portfolio in the region.", "On the long-tail side, our position remains cautious as we continue to navigate through an improving but still competitive primary market and the reinsurance market that seems intense on forfeiting the gains derived from primary pricing by granting improved terms and conditions, particularly on proportional placements.", "So overall, we had an excellent quarter on a calendar year basis and an accident year result that was heavily impacted by the European flood, and to a lesser degree, the flood losses in Canada and the U.S. tornadoes. We firmly believe we will continue to lever one of the best underwriting teams in the world into attractive returns to our shareholders in challenging market conditions.", "With that, I will turn things back to David for Q&A.", "David R. Radulski", "Shirley, can you please open the lines for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.", "Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Mike, I know you mentioned that you can't comment on the Canadian situation. I'm not asking you specifically about that one, but I'm wondering if you could tell us what a typical limit is for a large property placement for the company and what you typically retain, if there is a number that is typical for you?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Jay, first, I really appreciate the sensitive way you've formulated your question. We have given that some thought, and Greg has some information for you.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Sure. Jay, on our North American rail liability portfolio, it's underwritten in our E&S and our Excess Casualty businesses. We've got experienced rail underwriters in both those organizations and they adhere to strict risk aggregation limits to control our exposures. To your direct question, our average line on short line railroads across the 2 portfolios is $32 million gross, and $19 million net. That's really all I can give you at this point.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "For the underlying combined ratio in the Insurance segment, it's clear that, that moved up from the first quarter. I'm wondering if there are any large non-CAT losses in there versus perhaps an absence in the first quarter?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "It's Greg, Jay. There's nothing -- let me give you a little color. The movement of the loss ratio, which is the main piece, the expense part of it is about 1.2%, it's a lot of little moving pieces back-and-forth, generally comp-driven, related to, as Pete noted, about of growth in our talent. On the loss ratio side, we've had slightly higher lost dollars from modest losses. Nothing in the large loss category but from modest losses, and we've got an earn-out going on of some previous underwriting action which is a benefit, but the main driver is higher accident year loss ratio picks across a few lines of business. These changes are mostly based on updated views flowing from our kind of semiannual reserve review and they reflect 2 quarters of impact. In rough numbers, there's a 2% deterioration in the quarter and 1% deterioration on a 2013 year-to-date basis.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "So it essentially reflects increased conservatism on most recent accident years?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Yes, Jay, that's a good way to think about it. It's reacting to more data, but I don't think about it quite so much as 1 quarter going higher. What I really think about is that probably the first year -- in the first quarter, some of it was too optimistic, and with more information, we have a more balanced view. I think that's the more appropriate way to look at it. So I'm very comfortable with where these loss ratios are. They continue to indicate progress over where we stood last year, and we believe we can continue to expand margins.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Great. Next question is on the unrealized investment gains. The AOCI in the quarter was -- it's half of what it was 3 months ago, obviously reflecting the rise in rates. I'm just wondering, does that affect your view on excess capital position at all?", "Peter R. Porrino", "Jay, it's Pete. The short answer would be no. So when we think about our capital, our excess capital, as we do with a lot of things that we've talked about, we look at that on an economic capital basis much more than an accounting basis. We've talked about in the past about also looking at rating agency capital, right? And when we look at that stuff, we've always viewed these positive marks as potentially temporary, right, so we've never taken the benefit for them, right, and so they get cut in half, we don't -- there's no real adjustment to make when they come down either.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "So just accounting, not economic.", "Peter R. Porrino", "Right.", "Michael S. McGavick", "Yes.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Vinay Misquith with Evercore.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "The first question is on the Reinsurance segment, just a little bit surprised that property CAT premiums are higher. Would it be fair to assume that because you guys went lower down in the risks -- I mean, lower down in the TARs, that the dollar sort of premiums were higher, so that's skewing the year over result in property CAT for Florida?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "There's 2 components of the $9 million increase in property tax. $7 million was from reinstatement premiums. We obviously had elevated CAT activity in the quarter. And as I mentioned we did increase our lines in Florida. But remember, as I think we've mentioned in prior quarters, we don't depend heavily on Florida as a source of our CAT business. So we started with $33 million and ended with roughly $36.5 million.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. That's fair. The second question was on the status of maybe a sale of the Life Reinsurance segment. If you've seen another life property that's been recently sold and interest rates are higher. So any update on that would be helpful?", "Michael S. McGavick", "This is Mike. As we continue to work along the marketplace, in some ways, you could say it's more favorable but at this point, for our particular book of business, there's nothing to announce at all.", "Peter R. Porrino", "This is Pete, the only thing I'd add is spread narrowing are more beneficial than just risk fees [ph] going the right direction as well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike Zaremski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "In regards to the insurance-linked securities venture with Stone Point, do you guys envision packaging non-property catastrophe risks into the fund, such as casualty and maybe you could elaborate on when you expect the business to be written and/or the geographies?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Yes. I think you can expect that some of the preliminary focus will be on some of the lines that we've seen more traditionally associated with these activities but we do not have a limited vision for that business. We believe that there's a lot of opportunity for innovation in marrying our great underwriting talent and additional capital, and we think that our shareholders can get a good reward from that process. In terms of timing, you'll see the real focus is getting the business up and operational and involved in the 1 1 renewal cycle coming this year.", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Got it. Separate question on ceding levels. In the past, XL has talked about getting operating leverage. Would potentially keeping more primary insurance and ceding less given the favorable reinsurance market conditions be a strategy?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Well, no. Mike, as I touched upon in my comments, we're seeing what Jamie alluded to, which is we're reaping the benefit of the enhanced structures that are available. Just to give you a little color around -- a little more color on what I was referring to in my comments. We renewed our property per risk, our property CAT, our Casualty and our Professional treaties. On the property side, it's a pretty easy story. The volume of premium going in and out has not changed year-over-year. It's really a case of buying lower down, rounding out some coverage, lower down and having more exposures as we grow, going into the treaty. So you get a pick up there. Clearly, that's an economic pickup. You won't get that gain if there is no CAT losses over the next treaty year. On the Casualty North American quota share, and the Professional quota share, we are going to cede -- it is a lot of moving parts in here but just under $100 million more premium and an enhanced ceding commission on the North American Casualty side. And for the Professional side, we're converting from an excess of loss to a quota share. So on the margin, that's a little bit more than the current run rate but we just are picking up on what we're seeing on the reinsurance marketplace as Jamie alluded to earlier.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joshua Shanker with Deutsche Bank.", "Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I just wanted to follow-up, during an earlier question, you said that you might have been too optimistic about your first quarter loss picks, I'm wondering just how -- is there favorable development on current accident year in the second quarter numbers?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Exactly. Again, as the year unfolds and you start to see the real loss activity, you adjust your pick for the year to reflect the trends you're seeing. So more data gives us more information. But again, what I'm emphasizing is that this has been evolving over the 6 months, not just in the last 3 months. And it was immature to react to in the first quarter, and we do our deep dive in the second. So what you're seeing is the impact of all that. The good news about it though is, again, as I look at it, the overall book continues to improve compared to where it was last year. And while the trajectory may not be at the same rate as we saw in the first quarter, we're very pleased with the progress and think it continues.", "Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Does that mean there's unfavorable development in the tail end of 2012 coming through?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Again, we're reacting to loss patterns as they emerge, we're not talking about unfavorable development on the book. This hasn't been a -- losses that have somehow evolved unfavorably.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Yes. Some of it, if I could try -- the deterioration that we saw in some of these lines of business in a number of accident years, say, '09, '12, and that in some instance informs your view going forward. And so in learning about the 6-month reserve development of the prior year, that impacts your view of how optimistic or not you want to be on the accident year going forward in '13. So it's not -- it's an interaction of those 2 pieces is the main driver of the information we learned during the quarter of what pushed us out.", "Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So as we're trying to think about the rate increases that you're getting in excess of loss cost trend into future quarters, the question I am trying to figure out is does this recent development cause you to be more conservative in how you think your future quarters loss picks will be or did you -- or I'm saying, did you nip a few things in the bud that were irritants and now the progress will continue when we think about the future?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Well, I think, it was more as you said it in the last half of your sentence than the first. And in particular, in the second quarter, you're going to get not only the effect of what we're picking for the rest of the year based on this additional information but you are going to get a little bit of a negative catch-up effect as we apply it to the first quarter as well. So the way I would think about it is that the first quarter probably looked better than it was and because of the catch-up, the second quarter looks slightly worse than it is. But in total, again -- and you have to remember, when we're doing this, we're dealing with large accounts with high volatility and fairly small data sets so we have to have a very long view, and that's why we always emphasize looking at this on a 1 quarter is not how we think and not the right way to do it and not how our mechanics work. Looking at it over time, it is the right way. And that's why as we look at it over time, we're very pleased with the continuing progress.", "Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And unrelated, the rising interest rates, does that give you a potential opportunity to revisit the potential sale of the life reinsurance business?", "Peter R. Porrino", "Josh, it's Pete. I mean, we're always looking at that. So I wouldn't say it gives us a chance to revisit it, we're constantly looking at that would be my first comment. The second one, as I said a little earlier, the risk-free rates, move up of the rates are probably meaningful than a drop in the spread, which we have not seen yet. But that would be a bigger driver towards what we would see a more value-driven sale. So we look at it all the time, and 2, the move up is really not going to be a driver.", "Michael S. McGavick", "And I would only offer 1 other point of emphasis and that is that we remain focused on it in an economic way, I mean, we're focused not on all the different accounting elements, we're focused on the economics of it, and we have a business that's in a run-on -- runoff that is performing according to expectations. We don't feel any sense of pressure on this, we just realized that if there were a better owner, we'd be happy to work something out but at this point, we're the best owner.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "A couple of quick questions here. First, Pete, I'm just curious, the decline in investment income this quarter seemed a little more than I had expected. Was any of that due to the sale of the RMBS securities just having a higher investment yield? Is that something we may see going forward also when you sell off some blocks like that?", "Peter R. Porrino", "So certainly, when we sell off those blocks, which would have been higher-yielding blocks, you would see a potential drop. But those are not huge amounts relative to our asset portfolio. And to be honest, the net investment income that came in for the quarter was pretty much exactly what at least we thought it was going to be, so there was nothing unusual going on.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Got you. And then, Greg, quick question. On the professional liability business, was the decline in quarter-to-quarter all related to business you said that you're going to be running off?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Well, I'm sorry, say that again...", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "The gross written premium was down in Professional Liability's year-over-year. Was that related to some of the business you said you're going to get out of.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Yes, that international source, that's the main driver, it's a little bit lower as you execute on restructuring and repricing some of the U.S. Professional book that will always result in a little bit of breakage but the main driver is the beginning of that process, absolutely.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And then, on the quota share, just quickly, was there any unwritten premium that went in with that, that would have had an impact on the net written premium?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "No, it's a risk-attaching quota share. So there's nothing, it's not a straight quote share of the whole book, just to add a little more color, it's a session on just our larger limit policy. So not only is it not a straight quota share of the whole thing but it's also a risk-attaching basis.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Got you. And therefore, we shouldn't expect it to much have of an impact on your policy acquisition ratio?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "That's correct.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just wanted to follow-up on Josh's question earlier on the pick going a little higher. So that -- have you given some color on which lines this is occurring in? Is it the international professional liability book or what lines of business are you changing the picks on?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "So we're picking it up in 4 key places. One is indeed the international solicitors. The other, as I touched upon in my comments, the U.S. professional liability for non clash, we continue to be -- as you know, we reserve our clash -- our professional liability book in the clash and non clash component as we talked about in our 10-Q. And so this is the non clash piece that reflects some of this changing activity, small on our property book of business related to energy and the last piece is on our international marine cargo book, were the 4 places.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And just, again, to clarify, it was an extra 200 basis points, so really spread in the second quarter but we should think of that as kind of a 6-month 100 basis points per quarter, is that correct?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Yes.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "That's correct.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. Great. And then, just the rhythm of the way you go back in and look at reserves means we won't revisit this until the end of the year. So this will stay with us for the back half of the year as well?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "On long-tail lines, that's correct. On short-tail lines, we do pick up activity quarter-to-quarter, each quarter.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And I guess, the way I'm thinking about it is just that the picks are going higher, okay, I guess, for the long-tail books, the picks will be higher for the next couple of quarters, and then we'll see what the world brings. So we should be taking kind of the new accident year loss ratio and trending it forward for 2 more quarters, I think, to be conservative, right?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "The 64 4, yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW.", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Was there any reserves [indiscernible] for the Costa Concordia loss in the second quarter?", "Michael S. McGavick", "I'm sorry, that was for the Costa Concordia loss?", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Yes.", "Michael S. McGavick", "So overall, for the company, the answer is no.", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And is there any update on -- specifically on Professional Liability, claim cost inflation that you can share?", "Peter R. Porrino", "I'm sorry, claim cost inflation?", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Yes.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "No, we haven't seen -- no, in terms of -- we've just -- as I mentioned, it's been -- the severity actually has been lower, it's the frequency that's been up higher than we would've thought. So no, we haven't seen anything, particularly there, disturbing.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Could you give us a little bit more color on the Stone Point arrangement? I'm just trying to understand, how is that structured and is it -- would you be putting business into that, that you're currently writing or is that -- is the profile of the business that you plan whether you would like to write in there, different in some characteristic or quality than what you're writing currently on your own balance sheet?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Well, I'm going to ask Pete to give some of the detail in just a second but I just want to emphasize, this is such an exciting development for us. In the final analysis, we were one of the pioneers of side TARs and other forms of applying our underwriting to additional capital providers, and we've watched the latest flurry of activity with real interest. We know a lot about it, we've thought a lot about it, and we had a view that for -- with the kinds of profits we were already delivering to our shareholders, that we had to come up with just the right way to enter it, that we didn't have to rush in and do anything silly. And as a result, we focused on the fact that if we want to create something that could last over time to be substantial, we would have to have a partner that really understood the elements of stewardship of other people's money, of all of the various complexities that go with it, and that really understood what was going on in the insurance marketplaces so that we can have a realistic partnership, one that we thought could endure. And in Stone Point, someone we've worked with on many ventures over many years, we found really, we think, the ideal partnership. And again, as I have said on an overall way of looking at, it's about marrying our underwriting expertise and making sure, in this rapidly evolving entry of additional forms of capital, that we are able to serve our clients with innovation, that we're able to continue to see our underwriters being able to reward our shareholders with their performance. We see it as a neat combination, so I just wanted to make sure to give a little more background, but Pete, talk about the various initial activities.", "Peter R. Porrino", "Just a couple of comments. As we said in the release, it's 75% XL, 25% Stone Point. The initial plans would be that one of the funds, the activities would be in the insurance-linked securities space. There will be a collateralized reinsurance vehicle also put in place. We're also talking about some other things that would be unique to XL. One of the things that we're really pleased with teaming up with Stone Point is that we think having that asset management expertise and the real deep reinsurance property CAT expertise is going to enable us to have a broader width of product than maybe what you've seen -- we've seen out there. And as Mike said earlier, we view that pretty much as the beginning of this relationship, it could go in a number of different ways, and again, the benefit of teaming up with Stone Point is you have a natural partner as this thing potentially morphs outside of property CAT reinsurance.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I mean, would you expect that, over time, that your 75% stake would fall as other outside investors are recruited and join the program or do you expect to retain that level of ownership no matter how large it might grow?", "Peter R. Porrino", "Right. So Mike, the plan is that we would keep the 75% because that's the investment in the top company, right? So that's the -- that the asset management company is the one that we would own 75%, they would own 25%. The plan would be to raise third-party money in the funds underneath that asset management company.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. I see. And in terms of the profile of the business that this entity would write, I mean, in terms of is it going to be more skewed towards high-layer property CAT, is it -- at its inception, or do you anticipate kind of pushing the innovation through there and trying to move outside of just kind of that starting point?", "James H. Veghte", "It's Jamie. I think that there'll be a variety of products introduced in the vehicle. Some that have been traditionally associated with XL and others, such as retrocessional business where we have not been considered historically a large player. And in addition, as Mike and Pete both mentioned, ILS fund would also be involved.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then just one last one on the sequential loss ratio conversation. Looks like your marine book shrank, and it seems like you maybe took some actions there. I mean, if you back out the -- maybe underwriting actions that were associated with the premium declines there, can you sort of talk about what the sequential change might have been overall?", "James H. Veghte", "Well, at least on the reinsurance side, you're correct, it has dropped substantially. There's 2 particular specific reasons for that. One is we used to have outlets in both North America and in the London market to write marine reinsurance. We closed the U.S. operation and have focused our attention on the London market. And in addition, we've simply reduced our overall marine activity because we've just felt for a long, long time that we were better off deploying our NatCAT capacity, particularly U.S. exposed with our direct property CAT book and not the marine book.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Yes, and on the insurance side, the Marine premium flows into the specialty line and so -- but just for color, it's down just a couple of million dollars.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ryan Byrnes with Janney Capital Markets.", "Ryan J. Byrnes - Langen McAlenney", "Quickly first, I noticed that the equity in the Life segment declined pretty substantially in the quarter. I imagine that is mainly from bond marks, but just wanted to see if there's anything in there that brought down the equity?", "Michael S. McGavick", "The answer, Ryan, is that it's in essence from those bond marks. I mean, one way to think about it, we do about -- we do a fair amount of disclosure at the bottom, so that you can look at it both on a GAAP basis and on a regulatory basis but those marks, clearly, on a U.S. GAAP basis, drove the lion's share of it. The only other thing that we did was, we did dividend some money out of the Life operation that also drove that.", "Ryan J. Byrnes - Langen McAlenney", "And what was the size of that?", "Michael S. McGavick", "About $300 million.", "Ryan J. Byrnes - Langen McAlenney", "Great. And then just my second question is last quarter, I guess, in the Insurance segment, you guys noted that kind of 17 out of your 22 insurance lines were getting rate in excess of the loss cost trend. Just wanted to see where that stands now, and maybe I guess as you guys look at the re-estimation of some of the lines as well, just want to see how attractive that segment is?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Yes, it's 18 out of 22 and it's roughly 85% of the premium.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Josh Stirling with Bernstein.", "Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "So Greg, a question for you. Everybody is trying to figure out where you are in your sort of bridge to getting to a below 90s combined, so I thought, first, I'd just ask, is your year-to-date sort of 96% all-in, should we think about that as sort of a reasonable give or take number for where you think a normalized performance ought to be? And then, second, also for Greg, can you help us, with 3% pricing, should we look at your growth initiatives as the primary drivers to get your combined ratio down to 90% or below from expense leverage and loss ratio mix or are there some big initiatives in re-underwriting that we should still be thinking about?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Right. So the 96 is a number that you can observe, and it's a reasonable estimate for the book in its current state. To get to the 90%, we've got to move a number of letters. Rate is one piece of it. I talked about that. Mix is the other, big one, is we're shifting away from businesses that are less profitable into more profitable businesses. We've got about some underwriting actions identified as well. And then, Pete remarked upon it, is operating leverage as well. All 4 of those drivers are going to bring us towards that 90, I'm not going to try and break it down into numbers piece by piece but those are the 4 big drivers.", "Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Got it. Jamie, I wonder if I -- I was very interested to see your guys' growth in the whole account business. I'm wondering if you could just give us some color on that, sort of the opportunity and what sort of customer segments and underlying lines and maybe just some basics, of is it proportional excess of loss and sort of what you think the risk return looks like?", "James H. Veghte", "That book of business, Josh, is one that we've been playing in going back to the acquisition of Brockbank in the mid-90s. It's a very opportunistic play. They're basically whole -- you think about them as whole account quota shares from specific Lloyd's syndicates. We typically -- and one of the reasons you may have seen the increase in our ceded premium on the reinsurance side is because we piggyback on the outwards reinsurance strategy of our clients. In this particular case, we wrote one large new whole account of a syndicate that we've known for quite some time. It is not a specialist syndicate. It's a broad syndicate that we've known for a long time and they write a variety of lines of business. It's a book of business that we would not hesitate to shrink dramatically, as we have in the past. As I mentioned, it's very, very opportunistic in texture.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from Randy Binner with FBR.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Most are asked and answered. But just on pricing, I wanted to clarify something that's been talked about in previous calls, and that's that, I think, you said in the commentary that the U.S. lines kind of broadly speaking, this is more reinsurance, we're seeing a slowdown, but is Europe still kind of catching up because it was slower to firm in the first place?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Yes, Randy, that's definitely the case. The North American property business has gotten a lot of rate over the last 12 to 18 months. And we're still positive. We're at 3 point -- we're just 4% in the second quarter. So we're still -- it's just lower than it's been over the last couple of quarters. And the international property, while the volumes aren't as big in Q2 as they are in Q1, has picked up to 3.5%. It's nothing I'm counting on, I'm very -- our guys are driving towards more because we need more, but it's certainly a positive sign and that's finally starting to pick up in kind of almost like a 12-month lag from where North America was.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Okay. So your European business is a little less sensitive to this kind of second derivative argument on pricing?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "That's correct.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. And then, my other question is a follow-up actually on the Costa Concordia question. I just wanted to clarify something. I've read a little bit about the mitigation effort for that being quite a bit more complicated. So is it that you don't have -- you didn't have development in the quarter or you no longer have exposure to how those containment remediation costs might increase?", "Peter R. Porrino", "So we didn't have -- and I'll turn it over to Susan if you want to make a comment. We did not have development in the quarter, both because of where we had our pick going in, as well as some reinsurances that we had in place. Susan, you want to give some more color?", "Susan L. Cross", "Yes, I would just add to that, Pete, that we didn't have any impact in the quarter. And even as we look at potential further deterioration from the latest estimates that have come out of the P&I club, which are about the $1.17 billion, if that were even to go to $1.5 billion, we'd have potential deterioration of $5 million. So it's not a material exposure for us, even if there is further development on that loss.", "Operator", "At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the speakers.", "Michael S. McGavick", "Great. Listen, we really appreciate the questions. We know it's a hectic earnings season with a couple of other companies that have come out tonight. We know that you have a lot on your minds. We remain very pleased with the progress we've been making at XL. We can see the underlying trends for our business is moving in the right way and we're going to be very driven, as we've told you many times, to execute, execute and execute some more. So we look forward to being with you again in another quarter's time, and thank you for the attention tonight.", "Operator", "Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the XL Group's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2013 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "David R. Radulski", "Thank you, Shirley. Welcome to XL Group's fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings conference call. This call is being simultaneously webcast on XL's website at www.xlgroup.com. We posted to our website several documents, including our quarterly financial supplement.", "On our call this evening, you'll hear from Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, who will offer opening remarks; Pete Porrino, XL's Chief Financial Officer, who'll review our financial results; followed by Greg Hendrick, our Chief Executive of Insurance Operations; and Jamie Veghte, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations, who will review their segment results and market conditions. Then we'll open it up for questions.", "Before they begin, I'd like to remind you that certain of the matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, and therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them.", "Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only for the date on which they're made, and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Mike McGavick.", "Michael S. McGavick", "Good evening. Tonight, we are pleased to share with you XL's fourth quarter and full year 2013 results. 2013 was a good year for XL with many important metrics demonstrating our continuing year-over-year improvement. As regards to fourth quarter itself, our assessment is a bit more mixed.", "While we like a lot of what occurred including the strong performance in many of our businesses, we did see large loss activity in the fourth quarter as occurred in the third diminish the result. More on the fourth quarter in a moment, but overall we feel good about the year now in the books and very good about how we are positioned for 2014 and for the future.", "I'll start with some highlights of the year. Our operating return on equity, ex unrealized gains and losses, increased to 12.5% for the fourth quarter and to 10.2% for the full year. Our overall P&C combined ratio improved by close to 4 points versus 2012. Total P&C gross premiums written increased for the fourth straight year as we continue to implement our plans for each of our businesses. For the fifth consecutive year we grew our tangible book value per share delivering increased value to our shareholders. These are solid indicators of our progress.", "From a segment perspective, we also saw good practice. For example, Reinsurance delivered a very strong 81.4% combined ratio for the year and an underwriting profit for the eight consecutive year, and suffice it to say in the midst of tough market conditions and international CAT activity in the quarter which Jamie will discuss more later in the call, we are very proud of what our Reinsurance colleagues produced for the year.", "In Insurance, 2013 marks the first year since 2009 in which the Insurance segment delivered an underwriting profit. The segment's total combined ratio of 97.1% is the best result in five years. The segment's accident year combined ratio of 96.7% and the loss ratio of 65.9% are also the best performance in these metrics since 2007.", "Now as I noted at the opening of my remarks, there was a contrary note on the fourth quarter, as you've seen in our release. In the fourth quarter as in the third quarter, we experienced mutual losses; in this quarter mainly in our North America property book that affected the Insurance action quarter combined and loss ratios.", "As you know, these metrics are the focus of much of our attention and the slowing of our progress here does temper on our overall assessment, though only a bit. It is tempered by the fact that the 96.7 insurance accident year, ex combined ratio we delivered in the fourth quarter is no where we wanted or expected to be at this point. But as we have reviewed the second half of the year, we find this level of loss activity to be an aberration when viewed against our full year performance.", "For example, for the full year 2013, the combined ratio for our North American property book on the same accident year, ex CAT basis, was 74.3% and the combined ratio for North American P&C was at 91%, continuing their march to our overall target. The fact is that the property group experienced one bad quarter and essentially a year's worth of large losses in the fourth quarter which capped on an otherwise strong year. This isn't going to cause us to change our plans.", "As we continue to remix our portfolio, very much a work in progress, we will be even better able to absorb losses like this as they might come and we can see where this balancing effort is already at play. For example, throughout the year we grew our highest margin insurance businesses by over 10% while reducing our lowest margin businesses by 4%, further improving our mix. And to continue the trend we've reported last quarter, year-to-date 70% of insurance businesses had improved loss ratios versus the prior year on an accident year ex CAT basis.", "Even in Reinsurance we are seeing the same effect. While we had a degree of CAT losses in our international book in the quarter, the Bermuda reinsurance business produced a combined ratio of 26.2%. And when you look at it from the top of the house, like we do, the total mix of all of our insurance businesses is moving us in the direction we want with a total P&C accident year ex CAT combined ratio of 92% for the 2013 year.", "So already we are seeing the effect of a diversified portfolio and more books of business that are producing profit for the enterprise as a whole. We expect benefits from this to only increase as our remixing produces a higher number of margin expanding and less correlated businesses. This will reduce the impact of these outlier quarters.", "Turning back to the financials for a moment, and Pete will have more detail on this in his section, we were helped by the strong performance of risk assets in both the fourth quarter and throughout the year, leading to significant earnings from our investment affiliates. In fact both the P&C and Life investment portfolio strongly outperformed their benchmarks during the year helping to dampen the impact of rising interest rates.", "As we continue to gain traction from New Ocean, our joint venture with Stone Point Capital, in the end we are consistently looking to our progress over time and from this perspective, we saw a lot of what we like in 2013; a continuing success for Reinsurance, the first underwriting profit for the Insurance segment in four years, the achievement of a double-digit net ROE, it is the direct accumulation of the various actions we have taken to build a solid and strengthening foundation.", "It is because we are seeing profitable contributions from an increasing number of businesses and other sources, it is because of our continued prudence in reserving and overall, it is the product of the right and consistent behaviors we've been working towards, over time we expect this progress to continue in 2014.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Pete.", "Peter R. Porrino", "Thanks, Mike, and good evening. Operating net income for the fourth quarter was $287 million or $1 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to $39 million in 2012 or $0.13 per share. Operating net income for the full year was $943 million or $3.23 per share. Our net income attributable to ordinary shareholders was $1 million or $1.05 per share for the quarter and $1.06 billion or $2.63 for the full year.", "Our P&C combined ratio for the quarter was 93.3%, 12.6 points lower than the same quarter last year while our accident year combined ratio for the quarter was 97.3% lower by 14.9 points. These improvements were due to lower natural catastrophe losses and the impacts of our underwriting accidents that Greg and Jamie will discuss further.", "For the quarter, our natural catastrophe losses totaled $94 million or 6.3 loss ratio points which stood $24 million and $70 million between our Insurance and Reinsurance segments.", "By comparison, net losses from natural catastrophes in the same quarter of 2012 totaled $352 million or 23.3 loss ratio points, due primarily to the impact of Storm Sandy. For the full year, natural catastrophe losses were $317 million compared to $464 million in 2012.", "Prior year development in the quarter was a net favorable $61 million or 4 loss ratio points compared to $98 million or 6.4 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2012. This reflects favorable development of $40 million in Insurance and $21 million in Reinsurance resulting from our fourth quarter detailed ground-up reserve review. Greg and Jamie will cover this in more detail in their comments.", "Our operating expenses for the quarter were higher than Q4 2012, largely due to added headcount from expansion in the Insurance segment during the year and lower variable compensation in the prior year quarter due to Storm Sandy partially offset by ongoing efficiency efforts.", "Overall, fourth quarter expenses were comparable with the third quarter of 2013. Our Insurance operating expense ratio in the quarter was up from the prior year quarter due to the timing of distribution of expenses between corporate and segment initiatives as well as a change in the buying of proportion of reinsurance in the Insurance segment.", "Our purchase of increased quota share reinsurance, particularly in the U.S. professional business line, lowered net written and earned premium in the quarter resulting in approximately 0.5 percentage point increase in the insurance operating expense ratio in the quarter, more offset by the inverse impact on the acquisition expense ratio.", "Consistent with our previous disclosures, full year operating expenses for 2013 were 3.3% higher than the prior year, allowing us to improve the company's overall operating expense leverage while continuing our investments in strategic and infrastructure projects.", "Our operating tax expense was $4.9 million for the fourth quarter and $77.2 million for the full year. Our full year 2013 tax rate on operating income was approximately 7.6%. This was lower than the 10% tax rate through the first nine months of 2013 as we continue to benefit from the distribution of profits and losses across our global platform, in particular lower levels of catastrophe losses in jurisdictions with lower tax rates.", "Turning to investment performance, our investment portfolio delivered a positive total return of 0.6% in the quarter and 0.8% for the year as credit spread tightening, equities and alternative fund gains more than offset the negative effects of higher risk-free rates. We had a negative mark-to-market of $47 million in Q4 and $685 million for the full year 2013. Unrealized net gains in the portfolio were $741 million at the end of the fourth quarter.", "Our P&C fixed income duration remained unchanged at 3.6 years and remained short, our neutral duration. Net investment income on the P&C portfolio in the quarter was $169 million matching the prior year quarter. P&C net investment income in the prior year quarter was reduced primarily by accelerated premium amortization on our Agency MBS holdings due to lower government rates in an environment of ongoing quantitative leasing at that time.", "Prepayments on our mortgage holdings continue to create some net investment income volatility. We experienced slower prepayments in our agency mortgage portfolio in Q4 2013, which increased net investment income as the book yields on that portfolio is greater than current new money rates. The P&C gross book yield at the end of December was 2.7%.", "We estimate that approximately $3.2 billion of P&C assets with an average gross book yield of 2.8% will mature and pay down over the next 12 months. This compares to our average new money rate on our P&C portfolio in Q4 of 2%. We expect net investment income to remain under pressure of the increases in government bond yields that we saw in the second half of 2013, it's the same throughout 2014, we'll have to offset the impact of maturities and paydowns.", "Net income from investment affiliates in Q4 was $78 million, up $46 million from the prior year quarter. The returns for alternative funds which we all know as the hedge fund portfolio were very strong in the quarter at $49 million with strong results of $23 million in the quarter from our investment manager affiliates augmented the increase.", "Net income from investment affiliates for the full year was $272 million in 2013 compared to $87 million in 2012. The overall rate of return on our alternatives portfolio including the non-equity portion was 12.2% in the year. While we do not view this as a long-term run rate, these types of non-correlated returns represent an important part of our overall investment strategy and continues the growth in book value.", "Net realized gains on investments were $12 million in the quarter and $88 million for the full year. This compared to net realized gains of $11 million in Q4 2012 and net realized gains of $14 million for the full year 2012. These figures include a total OTTI charge in 2013 of $16 million down from $81 million in 2012.", "With respect to capital management, during the quarter we issued $300 million of 2.3% five-year senior notes and $300 million of 5.25% 30-year senior notes. The net proceeds from the sale of these notes were intended to be used for the repayment at maturity of the outstanding $600 million 5.25% senior notes due in September 2014.", "We continue to execute on our share buyback program and during the fourth quarter, we purchased 4.9 million shares for $150 million at an average price of $30.85 per share. For the full year, the company repurchased 22.5 million shares for $673 million at an average price of $29.86. This amount included the $98 million repurchased in January 2013 that was delayed from 2012 because of Storm Sandy. At the end of the quarter $275 million remained available for purchase under our previously announced $850 million share buyback program. We continue to view such purchases as an effective use of surplus capital.", "I'll now turn it over to Greg to discuss our Insurance segment results.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Thanks, Pete. Good evening. Today, I'll cover the fourth quarter and full year results for the segment, provide insight on our continued progress and finish with an update on pricing.", "Beginning with the results, our calendar quarter combined ratio of 96.7% was nearly 10 points better than the fourth quarter of 2012 which was adversely impacted by Storm Sandy. On an accident quarter basis, excluding CATs, our combined ratio of 98.2% was 1.7 points higher than the prior year, driven entirely by our expense ratio which Pete detailed in his comments.", "The accident quarter ex CAT ratio of 66.7% was essentially flat relative to the prior year quarter and better by 1.3 points relative to the third quarter of this year. Adverse large loss experience of almost $80 million in our North American property and global energy books offset the favorable experience we saw in the remainder of the portfolio.", "To offer perspective, the North America property business experienced its worst quarter since the first quarter of 2011 and its second worst quarter in over seven years. In fact, a number of these property losses emerged very late in December and led to our worst month since 2001. Despite this quarterly outcome, the team still delivered a full year accident year loss ratio of 54%, its best since 2009.", "When you exclude the two property books, the fourth quarter accident quarter ex CAT loss actually improved by more than 7 points compared to prior year and 3 points for the full year, reflecting several of the underwriting actions we have taken over past 12 to 24 months.", "As Pete noted, the segment released 40 million of prior year reserves. The primary driver's a positive movement from our aerospace and excess casualty portfolios as well as prior year catastrophes, partially offset by strengthening in our U.S. professional portfolio.", "Insurance gross premiums written were down by $68 million or 5% in the quarter driven almost entirely by our previously advised underwriting decision to non-renew our small solicitor schemes in the UK and Ireland.", "Turing to full year results which we view as the best way to measure our progress, we demonstrated continued improvement with an accident year ex CAT combined ratio of 96.7% or 1.8 points better than 2012, our best result in more than five years. All metrics include the expense ratio by 0.8 points, the loss ratio by 0.7 points and the acquisition ratio by 0.4 points.", "For the year, gross premiums written were up by $356 million or 7%. Growth was particularly strong in North America where premiums grew 17% for the year with Construction, Property, Primary and Excess Casualty businesses experiencing the largest growth. We shrunk our Lloyd's middle market programs, solicitors and aerospace writings for the year. These businesses all faced difficult market conditions and we had no hesitation to shrink our top line or target pricing that couldn't be achieved.", "Shifting to progress, we continue pulling on four levers to improve our combined ratio; mix of business, underwriting actions, operating leverage and rate. In terms of business mix, we made measurable progress in shifting our portfolio to more profitable lines. As Mike noted, during 2013 we grew our high and medium return businesses by 10% and reduced our lowest return businesses by 4%. And we continue to successfully build out new businesses.", "In 2013, our North America construction team delivered $200 million of gross premiums and producing underwriting profit in their third year of operation. And we have more new businesses in flight as crisis management, political risk and surety grew 32% to $100 million of gross premiums written this year.", "Regards to underwriting actions, we delivered roughly 1 point of loss ratio improvement in 2013 from a number of initiatives across the segment, and we continuously identify and execute on new actions as we view our portfolio. For example, in response to difficult loss experience in our international property and casualty middle market property book, we reduced long sizes for additional treaty and specialty reinsurance and of course pushed increased rate on accounts as needed. With treaty reinsurance fully in place and half the portfolio remain in the first quarter, these improvements will be felt quickly.", "We continue to demonstrate improved operating leverage with nearly 4 points of operating expense ratio improvement in 2013 as net interim premium grew by 9% whereas expenses grew by less than 4%. Improvements on our operating as well as ongoing investments in infrastructure are beginning to bear fruit that will further improve our gross operating leverage. Combined with reduced acquisition cost, we believe we will see further improvement in our total expense ratio.", "On rate, we once again achieved rate increases that exceeded trend in the quarter and a full year price increase was 3.1% versus 2.7% in 2012. While we see some slowing, particularly in North America and short tail lines, our diversified portfolio allows us the benefit from rate increases in medium and longer tail lines in all geographies.", "In the fourth quarter, all of our businesses in our international P&C operation have positive rate in excess of loss trend as well as rate on rate. Our North American and professional businesses both had rate increases over 3%, offset by our specialty business which was down 2%, driven entirely by a very competitive aviation renewal. For the segment, 75% of our portfolio achieved positive rate in the quarter.", "In closing 2013 was another step forward for the insurance segment with our best full year underwriting profits since 2007. While this validates the actions we've been taking over the past two years, there is no mistake that we have much to do in 2014. Given our talented team and determination, we believe we are positioned to make even more progress towards our ultimate goal combined ratio of 90% or better.", "Now to Jamie to discuss Reinsurance.", "Jamie H. Veghte", "Thank you, Greg. Good evening. I'd like to cover two principal issues tonight; a review of our fourth quarter and full year results and also some comments on our recent renewal season and market conditions.", "As Mike mentioned, 2013 marked our eighth consecutive year of underwriting profits with the segment producing an outstanding combined ratio of 81.4% which compares to the 86.9% combined in 2012. This result was impacted by catastrophe losses of $198 million and prior year reserve releases of about $188 million compared to 2012 where we had CAT losses of $241 million and reserve releases of $176 million.", "Excluding the impact of both CAT losses and prior year releases, we had a combined ratio of 80.6% compared to 83.1% in 2012. Our year-to-date gross written premium were down 5.7% to $1.9 billion as we continue to manage our way through very competitive trading conditions.", "With respect to the fourth quarter, we had a combined ratio of 85.1% producing an underwriting profit of $66.2 million. This compares favorably to the combined of 104.4% in the fourth quarter of 2012, though that particular quarter was obviously heavily impacted by Storm Sandy.", "During the quarter, we had the benefit of prior year releases of $21 million and CAT losses of $71 million net of reinstatement premiums. The major contributors to the CAT activity in the quarter were typhoons (indiscernible) and Haiyan and deterioration from storms Manuel and Ingrid in Mexico and the German hailstorms from prior quarters this year. Excluding the impact of prior year releases and CAT losses, the segment produced a combined ratio of 73.6% which compared to 72.9% in the fourth quarter of 2012.", "Turning to top line in the quarter; gross written premiums were $165 million, a 4.4% increase over the fourth quarter last year. The increase came from our North American crop facility, increased renewal on timing issues on our U.S. A&H book and new international casualty business.", "With respect to the prior year releases, you will note the magnitude of the releases are significantly below last year; $21 million compared to the $55 million a year ago. Virtually all of this reduction, $30.6 million, was due to deterioration in the quarter from the Tramel One surety loss in Spain.", "You will recall this loss was mentioned in our last earnings call during Q&A with the phrase I used was, if everything went to hell we would have less than $20 million of additional exposure beyond the $11 million we posted through the third quarter. I was obviously wrong.", "The deterioration exceeded our expectations in this quarter and resulted from several factors including more clarity around the potential numbers of claimants from our ceding companies and refinement of the potential impact of statutory interest on the underlying settlements. Given the ruling from the Spanish Supreme Court on this matter was not rendered until late in the third quarter, perhaps it's not surprising that our initial assessment was wrong. Nevertheless, I am embarrassed by the error. We always seek to give you what we know and be as candid as we can on these calls. I think you will note our track record in this regard has been pretty good, but in this case I got it wrong.", "Turning to market conditions. You have no doubt heard on a number of earnings calls this quarter how competitive the recent renewal season was. Given the substantial amount of capacity in the CAT market, prices not surprisingly adjusted down 15% to 20% on the U.S. business and 5% to 15% in the international market, though loss impacted geographies such as Germany and Canada had more stable trading conditions.", "In addition to price, we saw terms and conditions loosen. There was pressure on hourly causes, reinstatement provisions, increased use of multiyear contracts, expanded geographic scope and more replacements with aggregate features although the market did successfully resist some of these coverage expansions.", "Given these challenges, I'm more than pleased with the steadfast result of our underwriting teams and the resulting portfolio. We continue to monitor rate adequacy on this portfolio in the same fashion we have for over a decade. And the profile of the book indicates we expect to generate a very satisfactory return.", "In addition, we spent a good deal of time developing strategies for our individual trading partners prior to the renewal season. There is no question the market operates less and less on a pure syndication basis and we see some catastrophe placements akin to the vertical marketing environment we've seen in the aviation market for years. That is preferred reinsurers with long relationships and lead capacity get better signings and in some cases differential pricing on individual placements.", "Our status as a first tier market in this environment was confirmed during the CAT renewal season. While not a perfect barometer, our signings relative to authorizations actually improved on the Bermuda CAT book from 87% a year ago to 89% in this renewal season. While the strength of relationships is something universally claimed by reinsurers as a core advantage, there is no doubt in my mind our performance during this renewals validated XL re-status with our producers and customer base.", "With respect to long tail and specialty markets, the theme remains the same, I've been reporting for quite some time. Other than pockets of the market and select opportunities, the environment is extremely competitive and pressure remains on both reinsurance pricing and terms and conditions. This is particularly true with commission structures on proportionate placements. We continue to navigate our way cautiously through this phase of the market and our trading with long-standing clients with proven track records.", "Finally, I would like to highlight one operational note. You would recall we announced the hiring of Chris McKeown as the CEO of our joint venture with Stone Point New Ocean Capital Management. Chris was up and running, deploying capital, burning renewals, launched two funds and attracted two significant new investors for the funds. We are very pleased with the reception this venture has received from the market and look forward to its continued build out and development.", "With that, I will turn it back to David for Q&A.", "Shirley, please open the lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Michael Zaremski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. You may ask your question.", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Hi. Thanks. First question on the operating expense ratio kicking up this quarter. It sounds like you guys are confident there'll be improvement next year, but why is that given market conditions appear to be more competitive and top line growth is apparently slowing a bit?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Yes. This is Mike. Thanks for the question. I'm going to start off and turn it over to Peter. First of all, even with the uptick in the year which Pete likely had both the timing aspects and also aspects related to our reinsurance placements and the like, in the end what we forecast for the year came in at the low end of the range that we forecasted here. So, I'm very pleased with the way we control expenses and continue to gain operating leverage. We continue to expect to be able to achieve both in these lines that we've been remixing towards and I continue to be confident that that will outstrip our expenses. But this is the time of year when we try to give you some perspective on how we look at expenses for the coming year.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Pete.", "Peter R. Porrino", "Yes, Mike, as you well know there's two basic factors into that ratio; the premiums earned and then what the actual expenses are. And I'll let Greg and Jamie go through premiums. Well, obviously we don't forecast premium activity. When I think about losses \u2013 when I think about expenses, I'd say our expectation for next year would be sort of normal expense growth that you would expect and then a little bit more for some of the new business initiatives that both Greg and Jamie had in mind. As I think about it sort of in total, I'd have a mid single digit number in mind. I mean certainly \u2013 again depending on our premium growth, we would expect that you would see some continuing benefit of operating leverage there.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Yes, Mike, it's Greg. Look, I'm not going to forecast premium growth, I'd just point to what I've said in the past that a number of our businesses whether it's in programs, we talked about the solicitor scheme which is a block of business that all renews in October 1, the same date our primary casualty, our large property, I can go on, they are very lumpy businesses. To do it quarter-to-quarter growth, I know this quarter was down flat when you adjust for that solicitor's program. It is very lumpy and you're not going to have smooth gross. I'd point you back to the year where we did a pretty good job of growing into that upper single digits in the year 10% over the past couple of years.", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "That's helpful. I guess lastly, on some of the large non-CAT losses, I think you guys said it was mainly North America primarily in December. Anything there you think \u2013 you'd like to quantify for us or name?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Well, we don't talk about specific insurance, so I won't get into that. I quantified in the remarks the $80 million delta year-over-year. We had three losses that were over 10 million and then \u2013 kind of what I would call midsized, the collection of midsized losses contributing as well.", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.", "Jay Adam Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yes. Thank you. I guess if you look at 2013, looking at your buybacks and dividends, it seems to be a little less than your operating earnings. Can you talk about what that relationship might look like in 2014, especially with the stock pulling back and trading notably below book value?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Yes, so I'll start again and pass it to Pete, but Jay I appreciate the question and the observation. In total, the year came in strong and with more than $1 billion on net income for the year, obviously that was a bit more than the 575 we repurchased and the dividends combined. And that is not our goal, as you know. Our goal in essence is to not have a buffering to our rating agency capital and our regulated capital growth. So we are taking that in mind as we go before the Board in February and set the program for this year. But I'll ask Pete to get a little more granular about that.", "Peter R. Porrino", "Sure. I'll just cover (indiscernible) so when we do our share repurchase authorization. Typically we do that every year. We'll do that in the February Board meeting, so you will likely see an announcement that comes out after that. And I would say, Jay, as your comments are clearly not lost in us with our stock ticking down relative to build value. Certainly with the progress that we're making in the business, we feel really good about where this is going down the road and trading at 80% of full value doesn't feel very good. And the only thing I would add would be and consistent with what we said in some other prior years is we think about buybacks. You look at the 575, it's sort of from the baseline. You can never predict the future but our hopes will be that certainly (indiscernible) very well could see a number above that.", "Jay Adam Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thanks, Pete. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays. You may ask you question.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "Thank you. With regard to the underlying insurance combined ratio of 97 to 98 for the past three quarters, I know that target is still 90% and I was just thinking perhaps you can give us an update in terms of when you think that might be feasible?", "Michael S. McGavick", "This is Mike. We've never forecasted a specific landing on that in terms of plan. We note that we were making very significant progress. I do think as I noted in my comments, the last talk [ph] of this year didn't add the momentum we expected, but when we went back with them \u2013 we do this on an extremely granular basis, we basically said \u2013 but this is an average. We are not going to change how we're handing this book given how we put those losses in the context of everything we are doing. And we believe that as that kind of unusual activity normalizes which we fully expect it will, we're going to see the benefits of the increasing profitability of the portfolio. And as that starts to kick in, I think the progress towards where we're going fundamentally reignites. Greg, you might want to add something.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Yes, let me talk about the trajectory that we're on kind of some of the parts of the business I'm excited about and just reiterate the lever that we're pulling on. As I look at where we've been the last two years, I like the path we're on. Over the last three years, right, we always try and steer you to the annual route and the quarter-by-quarter. We've seen accident year ex CAT combined ratio improve from 112% in 2011 to 98.5% in 2012 to 96.7% last year, so our best year since 2007. And as I said in my remarks, we produced our first calendar year underwriting profit since 2009 which is a testament to what we've been working on underneath as well as prudent reserving. Is this where I'd like us to be? Absolutely not. We are on the right path and with the right team. We talked to you about where I'm excited. I see strong momentum across North America in P&C, particularly our risk management, excess casualty, construction and property businesses. As I noted in my remarks, we continue to successfully build out crisis management, political risk, surety and also inland marine, lines where both the industry and our leaders have demonstrated superior returns in past years. Also, during the year, we brought in new leadership in our marine, international and professional businesses two books that caused us somewhat earlier in '13. And our specialty business had a stellar calendar year result, in fact far better than the profitability goal for the year. Finally, I'd say as I discussed we are executing on our levers of improvement. Rates are ahead of trends for the segment. We continue to identify on the right actions to execute on those plans quickly and we're improving our mix both in the business and across the portfolio. If I put those three together, the trajectory where I'm excited and how we've been disciplined, I'm sure we're going to be able to deliver improved results over time.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "All right, thank you for that. And then on the reinsurance side with rates coming in, I'm just trying to calibrate what we should expect the impact to be on the underlying combined ratio going forward?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Well, certainly rates were off, Jay. We don't forecast combined ratios. Obviously the reinsurance book is much more volatile than an insurance book, but I think it's fair to say with the CAT market coming off substantially as it did and the CAT portfolio representing now well north of 25% of our book of business, it would not be unreasonable to expect an uptick.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "Okay. And then last one for Pete, what's the best effective tax rate to use for modeling?", "Peter R. Porrino", "So, I would have preferred you probably worded that slightly differently. So what we said in the past is that we've been looking at a 10% to 12% effective tax rate if you look at it over a number of years that's what you would see. As I said in Q3, the first nine months had indicated that we were doing better than 12% and so the nine-month number that we use was 10. And again, as I said we had again things in the right place (indiscernible) with the effective tax went up for the same \u2013 opposite reasons. I can't give you a number per se but the potential 12 range is pretty much where we've been coming at recently.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "All right, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks. I wanted to get some color on the professional lines both in the Insurance segment \u2013 especially in the Insurance segment but also Reinsurance. Specifically grossed in that, looks like you guys are buying a whole lot more Reinsurance, can you talk about why that is, the trends you're seeing? You had some issues there in the second quarter where you took your picks higher, maybe you can update us on the progress as well?", "Michael S. McGavick", "I'm going to turn it to Greg but I just want to emphasize. I saw the unsolicited offer by one of our leading reinsurers as in incredible validation of the talent of our team and I was pleased with the transaction. I think it lowers risk and it certainly have a very important point in time and I really expect in the end that both we and our reinsurers will benefit from this transaction. But Greg, would you please\u2026", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Sure, Mike. Let me review kind of the \u2013 if I can get at your question, Greg, some of the underlying dynamics of that book, how we kind of got the decision to purchase a quota share and how we look at the portfolio going forward. So, as a reminder, our Hartford team has built a well diversified portfolio over the last decade and the recognized market leader for public D&O. That seems known for solving the more difficult risks, often in the primary layer through a combination of coverage, structure and price. In the past few years, we've seen security class action lawsuits continue to slow but regulatory investigations and M&A related losses have picked up. These types of claims tend to occur with a higher frequency and a lower severity and develop at a faster pace. As you noted, Greg, we've been watching this closely and you are right, we did increase our loss ratio for 2013 during the second quarter and we also discussed the corrective actions we have been taking as well as significant rate changes that are put in place starting at the end of 2012. Over the past few years, we've protected that book with a per risk excess to loss with a sizable retention. This protection just wasn't responding to loss activity we've been experiencing and this led us to consider other reinsurance protections. At the same time if you were looking at that efficacy of that purchase, as Mike noted, one of our long time reinsurers approached us on an unsolicited basis and offered attractive quota share terms. This allowed us to place the 50% quota share of our Hartford professional line on an enforced new and renewal basis. The treaty is diversified across the panel of top reinsurers and almost all of them have reinsured this portfolio in the past either with the same firm or the same individual underwriter at a different firm. Looking forward, we remain very bullish about this book for 2014 and beyond and anticipate a return to sub 90% combined ratio for the calendar year matching our 2013 accident year performance. It is rewarding that our view of the possibility is shared by our reinsurers and we believe this will be a mutually profitable relationship. As always, we remain fully committed to achieving our targeted underlying margins on a gross basis and are not changing our underlying appetite or integrity due to treaty reinsurance arrangements. In summary, given the terms and conditions available in our reinsurance market and occupancy activity we observed in 2013 \u2013 shares a prudent approach to protect our 2014 underwriting year.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great. Very thorough, I can see exactly what you did. Just from an accounting perspective going forward, how should we be thinking about that? I don't know if it's a question for Peter or somebody else, just premiums and then other parts line as the quota share comes through just so we can get our models correct?", "Peter R. Porrino", "Sure. This is Peter. Certainly our premiums ceded in that line of business are going to go up materially net premiums written and our net premiums earning would go down materially not on the same time. For example, in this quarter we only had just under $30 million of and a much bigger number of written. When you get down and look at the ratios that reduction in the net premiums earned will impact for example our insurance operating expense ratio, right. There is no offset dollars but there is a big offset in the denominator. So the numerator stays the same, the expenses and the denominator changes materially, the premium. On the commissions and brokerage, on the acquisition expense ratio, you have an offset in the dollars. So the commission, the ceding commission that we receive from the reinsurers goes against that line. And so it's to an extent that the ceding commission is above our acquisition cost ratio, you will see in essence a negative acquisition cost for that business more than offsetting the reduction in the premium range.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley", "Great. And last this is a go-forward contract only, right, a quota share for current business being written, this doesn't cover previous accident years at all?", "Michael S. McGavick", "It doesn't cover previous accidents, it covered the book at November 1, but not back to '12 and prior accident years.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, perfect. Thanks for the color guys.", "Michael S. McGavick", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.", "Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG", "Thank you. Good evening, everyone. When you look at your overall business, you went through a bunch of changes looking at businesses that you thought were under earning or potential unattractive, if you look back on 2013, what percentage of your businesses are earning an attractive return on equity, what percentage aren't? And can you give us some guidance on what that goal is today on allocated capital?", "Michael S. McGavick", "The allocated capital will be a little bit more difficult. Let me tell you what I think about where we're headed. This is, from my perspective, when you try to look at where the book \u2013 what part of our book is in the performing versus improvement, if you will, you got to step back and it's more than just last 12 months of performance, right. We look at our longer time of results, then we blend it in with the future concepts that we can deliver in the future. As I look at it from a far, one thing to note is we're not talking about whole businesses here, we're talking about sub portfolios that reached the business. And so as I aggregate those out and look and blend that historical with the future of forward-looking, we're looking at roughly 20% of our portfolio needing to improve returns to a more acceptable level as we come out of '13 into '14.", "Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG", "And that's based on normalized loss adjusted basis?", "Michael S. McGavick", "That is a very substantial change from where we started in '10.", "Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG", "I would agree. But those businesses that you're talking about are not because of one-off losses and unusual. That's on a run rate basis, you're saying?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Yes, we're looking through those. When you get these \u2013 you have to make a lot of decisions about whether can recur, whether we should buy down or that should change your strategy. Now, we've been through all those assessments and we're comfortable with where we are. But that's really about is when we look at the business side on an ongoing basis and the trends we see on them. And as you might guess when we have something that's underperforming that's where a lot of love [ph] goes. That's where you tend to see leadership changes and we're very driven to get it right. We'll never be where all of them \u2013 well, maybe we'll have that from time to time but generally speaking, there will always be something that's a little down. It's a cyclical business and there's a bunch of sub cycles that we're dealing with. But I'd have to tell you that as we enter '14, this is a confident bunch and one that is very committed to take the actions necessary to continue to expand our margins.", "Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG", "How should I think of the allocated capital involved versus the unallocated capital?", "Peter R. Porrino", "I'm sorry, Josh. We were having a hard time following the question. Could you repeat?", "Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG", "Sorry. So I assume that your ROE on applied capital is higher than we were actually achieving because there's plenty of capital in the business that isn't being allocated. That would be a correct assumption I would think yes?", "Michael S. McGavick", "The bottom line is we look at it both ways. So we're well aware of what the required capital is in our business and then we also look on a total allocation of capital, and we run it through our models, internal model basis. And then we do go back too and allocate all the capital because in the end it's a total return for the business. So we look at it on all three of those basis, not just the one view you're describing.", "Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG", "Well, I'm just saying that if you could get your \u2013 the rating agencies on board and get your capital to where you think it ought to be, how much better would your returns be today than they are?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Well, (indiscernible) has been mentioned there to look at it. I do believe that \u2013 let me give you three pieces. This is a great question and a gift to our focus on improving the ROE which we are well aware is kind of the next generation of jump for us. The core of improving our ROE is improving these operating results. That is the heart of the matter. That's why we put so much focus on giving you all this color commentary around accident year ex CAT results. So that is the heart of the matter for this business. That's the thing we're most focused on. At the same time, you're right in observing that we have because we haven't been delivering at the level we would like. On the operating side, we have been carrying more capital because we believe that until we get \u2013 than we should be. And so we are driven to start seeing that kind of buffer come down over time as the business results go up. So those are two pieces you can think of as a motion and you've already heard Pete say that when we think about that in capital repurchase terms, we're talking about what we bought back last year as something of a minimum. We don't want to forerun our Board. We talked about it in several ways but that's how we think about it. And then there's a third piece that you have to keep in mind is as we said before, when you get the P&C businesses continuing to move on the trajectory they are moving, over time the life block becomes a bigger and bigger driver on the ROE because \u2013 you can do the math on what's it returning right now given its capital and earnings and it's very clear that that's a drive right now relative to where the book is headed. And that it's magnified over time as the P&C operations improve. So those are the three blocks that we're thinking about and then we have nice additional potential benefits from the nice block of affiliated investments that we built and everything else. So that's how we're thinking about it. We continue to believe we can drive the ROE to consistently better levers and those are the levers we're thinking now.", "Peter R. Porrino", "Josh, the only thing I would add is that that majority is allocated in that calculation.", "Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG", "That's a very good answer, I appreciate it. And just one suggestion to you and Mr. Radulski there. I think you guys could benefit from giving us eight quarters of information on severe non-CAT losses if we had the numbers. I know you give us the delta but I think it would be a benefit to your disclosure.", "Michael S. McGavick", "Yes, I appreciate that. We will look at that hard because I really do think \u2013 he gets the benefit of looking over long periods of time and that's why we're able to make judgments about whether to react or not react or how severely to react to what we see and that's why you're hearing probably \u2013 and maybe I hear you saying that you find us a little more common. He might be (indiscernible)", "Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. You may ask your question.", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess I want to go back to the severe non-CAT losses and I can understand how an analysis would suggest that there's been a flaw in the underwriting, but having ascertained whether the rates are appropriate or the frequency of severe losses?", "Michael S. McGavick", "So I'll start on that. I'm going to guess that Greg will want to add some more color. But we do a number of exercises to try to satisfy our expected losses in different buckets size of loss. And then we add that altogether and so roughly in a given year based on history and we have long data sets in books. We can analyze what's the rough expected number of each kinds of losses relative to the rates we've been charging because that's the moving target, an improving one over the last few years as you know in property but that is slowing as everybody has commented on. And then we kind of engineer what we think with all those pieces in motion, we would forecast for the next year. And obviously you see because we're dealing with specific losses and generally speaking large lines out there. Then you go back and you see how do you feel about the pattern that emerges. Right now, I'm really pretty pleased with what I see and the discipline of these underwriters in several respects. First of all, beginning several years ago and I realized I'm going to turn to Greg because I'm about to steal his thunder, but we really changed a lot of our limit strategy, we changed reinsurance. We just made so many changes that got us out of some of the really spiky losses that we were seeing. And so in that regard, I'm very pleased with where the portfolio stands. Then to go back when you have a spiky quarter like this, you try to put it in your longer term context to try and understand. And when we went through the numbers in-depth on a quarterly basis and interesting in this case a month ago, just cause it turned out that one month really packed the wallet, you just saw this \u2013 it just stood out so prominently over time that you realize you could buy down this spike that you'll be doing a good service to your shareholders because you would have to buy it down with giveaway expected profit from our point of view. So instead rather expect the normal and react only if future quarters change our view of what's normal. I'd note a couple of other things and turn it over to Greg because I know Greg will want to get into the detail on this, but \u2013 it's already a dead end to the earnings season and unlike say the third quarter, I mean it was clearly a noisy fourth quarter in terms of additional losses we saw by reinsurers, we've seen it come in, in our other markets and that's another indicator that we would take heart from. But Greg, I'm sorry\u2026", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "That's all right, Mike. A little bit about where we've been, the actions Mike referred to in our international book we've been putting out, is in the combination of '12 and '13, right. So there is international limits on CAT are lower. We've been executing on a strategy and we were very successful, may not be the best review but we're very efficient at removing our poor performing lower tier business. At the same time in our international, we've been generating some new business in less volatile industries like healthcare and real estate. So that's one piece of our international. On North America we just had some really good results and I'm very pleased with where we've been. We've been reducing sub limits along the way. In fact on one of the losses we had, it had reduced our share by 50% because we're worried about the business interruption exposure and so we're proactively getting after the book. I touched a little bit on the international middle market property. In terms of specifically on the frequency, in the two big large property books which is in our North America property and our international property, our large plan frequency was in line with what we expect. It was just the severity as we've already talked about a few times. It was higher on a few of the claims that really drove a lot of this action. I don't see anything in the culmination of all the activity we've been at and the frequency being or find what we'd expect that makes us thinking of anything other than a strong book in our property. One last thought, rate adequacy; in North America I think we're near or at rate adequacy. Clearly on the international book and we've talked about this on numerous times in the past, we've got some more work to do to get that book closer to full rate adequacy.", "Michael S. McGavick", "This is Mike. And I know we're timing this topic hard and I appreciate that not all of you may be as deeply interested in it as we are, but obviously we view these calls as our job is to represent to you as best as we can and as accurate as we can what we are feeling about the book and where we see it going. That's the job we have. And so we thought a lot about this because we know it could stick up and be a subject to questions and we were afraid that that could in essence misinformed because we know enough about this book to not believe that's where it's headed. Does it mean we know the future, we could be wrong, but we don't think this is a lesson of the strength of the book that's emerging and that's why we're spending so much time on it. Let me give you one more thought about that. We had emphasized several times that our goal is to get to 90 combined and we've also emphasized that we'll do that as a fully developed target. And one of the reasons that we emphasize that so much is in our prudent approach when we are studying reserves. When you get a bunch of large losses right at the end of the quarter, you're getting your earliest perspective on those losses. Can you book prudently in accordance with your earliest view? But I would point that even in property, a short tier line over the last three years, we've released $100 million in PYD. So that prudence has a benefit that comes to the firm over time. And while that may not happen in the future, we are in a business and lots of things can happen. That approach of the business we think holds up well for our shareholders even if it doesn't always express the accident year in the way we really believe it's performing \u2013 to perform.", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "Okay, that was very helpful. As a quick follow-up, Greg, you mentioned that there was some adverse development in U.S. professional liability and I was hoping you could sort of ballpark for us or talk about what's going on there?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Sure, absolutely. For the year in our Hartford or U.S. based professional book, for the full year we had adverse about $110 million. It's across multiple accident years but it's focused primarily on the 2009 to 2011 accident years. It's generally speaking a reduction and the need for reserves to be held against large events. I'll take to you about the offset by an increase in the higher frequency loss \u2013 the very losses I referred. And as a trend, we observe both in our second quarter and fourth quarter reserve units. For perspective on that, the 2009, 2011 accident year for that book had 2.1 billion of net earned premiums, so these are small loss ratio changes affectively representing that shift. We're seeing lower events that we're able to reduce the portion of the reserves that we allocate there, but we're increasing on those kind of higher frequency, lower severity claims. And from me anyway because -- and something we've been on for about 18 months now.", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "Okay, thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thanks. The next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. You may ask you question.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank", "Yes. Thanks. A couple of quick questions here. First, Mike and Greg, you mentioned that pricing up about 3.1% in excess of trend, what is trend running and I'm just curious Mike what are your thoughts on kind of the outlook for lost trends your going for at professional liability because you kind of talked about that?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "So for the segment and the way we look at tends here on the short tier lines, you look at trend as zero because we will pick up that exposure trend increase in the base that writes the premium. So we would blend out across the segment. We're just under 2% or 1.8% trend for the segment in '13. From where I sit at the moment, I don't see us with any significant change in that moving over time. You asked about professional, I'm just trying to fit the number here and it looks like it's about a little over 2% for our global professional business.", "Michael S. McGavick", "This is Mike. There's no seismic change out there on what's going on in right now. Remember that we're not a terribly large writer of guaranteed customer comp, so that's one of the ones that you see out there with a lot of noise because of what's going on in the health care system. We do see the big Supreme Court cases that everybody's waiting on and class action and stuff like that, which will be a positive on the trend although quickly point out that I don't care what the Supreme Court decides on that, in the end I don't see managements and boards getting less accountable over time. I see it as more accountability whatever the mechanism is. So I in the end can't pick out any trend that I'm profoundly worried about as we sit here right now. Those can emerge, you never know, but nothing sticks out. And as a result, the blended rate that we're getting, I'm very pleased by it. And then when I break it down and look at the different books of business and their difference performance, I get even more optimistic. For example, the rate in this last quarter was pulled down some by what we saw in terms of our specialty book of business and which was actually below \u2013 a downward rate pressure on that block mainly related to what's going on in aerospace kind of environment there. But when I look at the combined ratio that that business is delivering, it's terrific on an all-in basis on a calendar year basis, it's just terrific. And you know our competitors and our clients can see that because we're dealing with a lot of that being priced centered out of life, there's an awful lot of transparency to that performance. So, we're going to expect some downward pressure there but we are in a very good position to deal with that. So when I kind of break it down and then I say, well, that's a 3.1 versus 1.9 on a rate versus trend but I have that negative impact on a good chunk of our block good performance, we're getting the rate that we need it. We're under pressure. There might be some \u2013 for the pressure all day long and I'm willing to shed business from (indiscernible). I like the way the book kind of adds up as a whole.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank", "Great. And then just one quick one for Pete. I mean you guys are talking about how the Life business has continued to be a drag here. Any updates and thoughts on kind of what the market is \u2013 potentially do something with the Life business?", "Michael S. McGavick", "There's nothing to share at this time. We have said continuously that that's not a business we seem to be in. It's in runoff and we're open to ideas and when ideas come in then believe me, we\u2026", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. Any good ideas lately?", "Michael S. McGavick", "You're always wondering what's going to come in the door.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank", "All right, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. You may ask you question.", "J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill", "A lot of M&A and M&A type question but I'd like to be kind of big picture. I personally think we're going to see sort of a natural increase in M&A given the market softening, but you folks have obviously been asked and talked with this stuff and I want to ask how would XL handle when someone approaches management with any sort of offer. I'm interested in sort of the procedures, does the Board get involved early in the process or is it later? How do you look at hurdle rates for M&A and has that changed any time recently?", "Michael S. McGavick", "I'll start with the second question first because it's the easiest one. There's been no change in how we view it, the hurdle rates, for acquisitions we might make. We're looking for things that \u2013 when we evaluate ideas and we see ideas flowing increasingly across the business, we tend to focus on things that will either build out a geography or a product or something like that in terms of how we're building this more diversified book of business. So I'm really \u2013 we haven't changed in our attitude towards what kinds of returns we would expect or what kind of strategic advantage we'd expect to gain. We have tendered over time but we've always said this is not a rule but rather kind of a guideline in our mind. We tendered towards things that would be on the smaller side because we don't want our culture disrupted. We think we have a fantastic and strengthening underwriting culture and we're only interested in adding things that are consistent with that or that are small enough that it gets us by our culture and made like us and doesn't change how we operate. And what hurdle rate we would entertain, it's not going to improve the business. We tend not to be interested. So it's pretty straightforward. In terms of how we would react as things come toward us, look, a couple of notes. We choose to operate in an extremely transparent way with our Board and that's the way we would react to anything that happened in the ecosystem that we thought they should know about. I would tell you that I generally agree with your observation that the preconditions for M&A are higher all the time. I think that you've missed what I think will be one of the biggest drivers whenever and that is what I think are going to be the increased demands of the regulators and the less efficient use of capital that will create and I think that will also be another cause of increased potential to M&A. But in the end the way this management will respond to things that come at it whether ideas for us or people who might have other visions for our future is the way you would expect us to look at it. What is in the long-term interest of our shareholders and how do we achieve the best result for our shareholders. And I can assure you that there's nobody at this table and I'm referring to the management table that's I'm sitting at that will analyze that from a personal point of view or even from shareholders point of view.", "J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill", "Kind of what I expected. And separately \u2013 I apologize, this is definitely a question someone wanted me to ask which was in the life insurance book, is there some structural issues in terms of where the book arrived that makes it more or less challenging to spin it off? Is has been sort of easily carved out of your rest of the book or is it on the same paper intertwines sort of from a legal entity perspective with the rest of the book and I probably should have known this already, but \u2013 so I apologize if it's a stupid question but it's my question.", "Peter R. Porrino", "Hi, Paul. It's Pete. It's definitely not a stupid question. Let me put that into two segments. The first one is the nature of the business which we've spoken about on prior calls where the bulk of the asset to liabilities is in the premium annuity blocks that is written in Europe, most of it is written in the UK. There's a fair amount of it as well written in Ireland. That is a reinsurance block, not a primary block that is a much more typical transaction than most of them, not all of the ones that you have seen so far around the world. That's the first part of that answer. The second part of your question on the legal entities, it would be difficult to do a legal entity sale that would remove us from the primary responsibility of those policies. Okay, so any transaction that would happen would likely have some reinsurance element assigned to it.", "J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill", "Got it, interesting. Thank you. That was interesting and appreciate it. Great quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Vinay Misquith with Evercore. You may ask your question.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Hi. For the professional liability reinsurance treaty, could you remind us about the size of the treaty? You said there's a 50% quota share on that, correct?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Yes, that's correct, 50%.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Right, and what is the size \u2013 what are the dollars or the premium that you'll be saving because of that?", "Peter R. Porrino", "Vinay, this is Pete. We've never disclosed \u2013 since we've told the percentage, right, we've never disclosed specifically to that \u2013 what that book of business is. And so I gave you the number for the treaty, you would certainly have the number for that book on a direct basis but we just never disclose that.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Okay. Just curious if we should take down our net premiums on the next quarter substantially and it maybe by about $300 million to $400 million or is that too high a number?", "Peter R. Porrino", "Vinay, I don't quite know how to answer that. That's a pretty narrow range. We just don't forecast the premium. That rate is not out of the ballpark but I can't get more scientific than that.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Sure, fair enough. The second question just a follow-up on the large property losses, so fourth quarter was about 80 million, third quarter was about 30 million, so we add these two up, there's about a 110 million. So is it the right way to look at the 20, 30 numbers, 30 accurate and the combined ratio was 96.7. So take away 2.5 points from large CAT losses and is that the right way to look at it? And Mike has this changed your view to excel the ability to get to a 90% combined ratio by '15?", "Michael S. McGavick", "I'll start with your last question, no. Greg.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Vinay, those are deltas year-over-year. I'd say 2012 was a very good year, 2013 was not as strong in property and so I still think it's somewhere in between those two numbers and similarly happened what you have in 2.5 points, but it's a very subjective thing. You got to go back and look over time. As you go back over time, you see \u2013 that is the outcome on the property book. You're going to have very, very good years and you're going to have some tougher years, so it's hard to give you \u2013 it's not a straight line business like a small commercial or a homeowners' book, but you frame the delta from one year to the next. I'd like to think we're a lot closer to a 12 but being prudent\u2026", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Kumar of Macquarie Research. You may ask you question.", "Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research", "Hi. Very quickly one follow-up on the 110 million development, was that for the quarter or was that for 2013? And do you have the number for 2/4/2013? I'm talking about the professional book which you mentioned?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Yes that 110 was for the full year. The majority of it was in the fourth quarter. What had transpired in the second quarter was still the level of reduction that we took in the large event portion of the reserves was offset almost identically with the increase in the attritional. So this is the quarter where we \u2013 after we got another six months. We took a full hard look at it in our semiannual reserve review that we've changed the attrition loss ratio reserves much more than the class release.", "Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research", "Got it, that's helpful. And then I guess the only other question would be was there any adjustment to NV1 and NV2?", "Jamie H. Veghte", "Hi, it's Jamie. Let's cover Littleton in 2011 was driven by the deterioration in one large program. We had our full limits reserved up, so none there. On the 2010 again one program had a $500 million increase in the round up loss. We had a $7 million line on that program. The impact from the quarter was $2 million.", "Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research", "Got it. Thanks for the answers and congrats on the results.", "Michael S. McGavick", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ron Bobman with Capital Returns. You may ask you question.", "Ronald Bobman - Capital Returns", "Yes, I feel as a shareholder, I shouldn't be last in line, but I think I'll discuss that with Mr. Radulski at some other time. I have two questions. This solicitor's reinsure that is fond of your D&O book also now employs a large professional liability team also that came from another Hartford company and I was wondering so we don't face the same fate, did you get additional protections that the same fate with that other professional liability team doesn't happen to ours?", "Michael S. McGavick", "We were so focused on your beat down on Radulski. I'm sorry, Ron, can you help us with that last bit.", "Ronald Bobman - Capital Returns", "Sure. So this solicited reinsurer that is fond of our D&O book and that KPU and he's reinsuring that he isn't taking I guess a lead position or the only position in reinsuring the professional labiality D&O book for you, also hired a whole team of people from other Hartford-based company a few years ago. And so I was just wondering so we don't face a similar fate, I'm curious whether you got any sort of supplemental protections that the [XL D&O team doesn't make its way to this reinsurer?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Let me speak solely to what our relationship is with the team at Hartford. They've been with us\u2026", "Michael S. McGavick", "Our team at Hartford\u2026", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Yes, our team at Hartford Connecticut that writes our U.S. public D&O book they've been with us for over a decade. We have a long-term relationship with them and in fact we have just renewed it for another \u2013 basically it's never green and we just reset the contract starting January 1, 2014. We are incredibly happy with them. They are incredibly happy to be here and I'm not at all worried about the similar situation that all the other folks happening to us.", "Ronald Bobman - Capital Returns", "Okay, thanks for that. A question for Jamie, just so I understand so this hell in the hand basket increase, is the incremental 30 that you took in the Q4 of '13, is that the hell in the basket scenario or candidly does the 30 not relate to that worst-case target and things could get worst is my parting event?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Obviously after last quarter, I'm never going to give absolute. I would say that there's a fair amount of complexity to the claim. If there was to be further development I think it would be around the interest component of the claim. Basically the interest rate charge is 4% from the date of judgment, allotment of funds into the development project until they made a claim with the insurer. If the settlement is within two years of that claim, interest is 6% in that interim period. If the settlement goes beyond two years, the interest goes all the way up to 26%. We've taken very conservative assumptions around the rapidity of the settlements from our clients but frankly as a reinsurer we have less control over that than our clients and we've obviously as always done a prudent job of making the judgment and putting the reserves up.", "Ronald Bobman - Capital Returns", "Sure. Two related follow-ups. What years do these relate to as far as I guess reinsurance treaty years? And then can you in any way extrapolate to what this new sort of industry's loss from this problem then? Thanks.", "Michael S. McGavick", "I think it was from the early 2003, 2004, 2005. There aren't a large number of ceding companies involved in this and I've heard numbers of $1 billion.", "Ronald Bobman - Capital Returns", "Okay. Thanks. Good quarter and best of luck.", "Michael S. McGavick", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Ryan Byrnes with Janney Montgomery Scott. You may ask you question.", "Ryan Byrnes - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Great. Thanks for taking my question. I just had one question. As we try to calculate the Life's drag on the ROE, how should we try to allocate the affiliated returns and also alternative returns?", "Peter R. Porrino", "This is Pete. None of them would go towards that Life business. They're all on the P&C side.", "Ryan Byrnes - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Great. That's all I had. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Josh Stirling with Sanford & Bernstein. You may ask you question.", "Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.", "Hi guys. Thanks for fitting me in and you guys get a gold star for sticking through all the questions. So two quick questions really, big picture. I think maybe they're either for Mike or Jamie. There's a lot going on in reinsurance today. You made some comments about rate still being adequate in property CAT. You guys obviously have visibility to practically every market in the reinsurance business. You've got your New Ocean Re in the third party side and you're doing long tail, short tail property CAT, and you're buying reinsurance. So thinking about all the things that go into the mix, I'm wondering I guess, first, if you have a sense of how long pricing pressure could continue before rates are no longer adequate for traditional reinsurers, and if you could go past that point, given that some of the new entrants have lower cost of capital? Second, I'll give you my other question just so we can in the essence of time \u2013 your point on the casualty reinsurance deal you guys did sounds like, Mike, that could have been a great move. But at the same time, it sort of sounds like it's a sign of a competitive market if you're getting unsolicited bids for quota shares for your professional book. The question would be, are we seeing the pricing pressure that began in property CAT, are we seeing that gravitate to other longer tail lines, either because incumbent reinsurers are feeling pressure to drive the top line or whether actually you're seeing the new entrants, the new capital sources decide to want to play in longer tail lines where they can get some stability, don't have to take the risk in property CAT. Thanks so much.", "Jamie H. Veghte", "On the long tail question, I think Greg's purchase of this business although it is with very strong reinsurer and so forth kind of validates what I've been saying for quite a long time and that is I believe the reinsurance market on long tail lines has been weaker than the insurance market for several years. And I think that continues. As far as the CAT market goes, we look at it the same way we have for a long, long time. We use rate agency capital to denominator in the calculation. We believe we're still at a fairly attractive rate adequacy levels on the U.S. portfolio. I do not expect the midyear renewals to endure the same sort of cuts that we had at 1/1. My guess is if we see another round like that either it's June and July or 1/1 next year, we will take appropriate actions because the hurdle rates will be less than ideal for us. You'll recall we talked about reaction to the Japanese market over the years prior to the 2011 quake, we've reduced our aggregates by 65% over the course of the prior 10 years. So we're not afraid to reduce the book. And my guess is if we have another 20% down in the U.S., you'll see not only us but a lot of the major leads start to cut their books back as it will kind of walk over the edge I think.", "Michael S. McGavick", "This is Mike. I would point to a couple of other thoughts as well. The more I learned this last renewal season, it actually made me a little more comfortable not a little more frightened and here's why? While there was a great deal in our frenzy of activity going on, generally speaking it wasn't so much what the alternative capital guys were pricing at, it was the frenzy among the existing players not to lose share in reaction to the projection of what those guys were going to do and they were a bit more disciplined than I think some are thinking. Some are thinking that the alternative guys just came in and whacked the market. No, what happened was the traditional players were so focused on keeping those shares that they got engaged in their own little frenzy. So I don't feel the alternative guys and I certainly know \u2013 I don't expect our alternative guys are going to be somehow irrational. I think they have a different set of costs, I understand. They have two different appetites and they'll play that card. But based on what I saw, I'm a little more sequined than I think I've heard some of our competitors' comments and I particularly like the way that Jamie's team dealt with this. They were very firm on the condition side, they really focused their capital on reasonable treaties. They said no when things got irrational. And we've been cutting back on the long tail quite for a long time because of what Jamie has described in concentrating our capital where believe there's not only the return is the best but the relationships are the most longstanding and the most likely to endure. So I understand why everybody 's hairs on fire given all the press reports but based on what I saw in terms of the performance of our own book and I like the way our guys are able to handle it and I think that's because we been effective and trust in partners for a very long time .", "Peter R. Porrino", "That's really helpful, Mike, Jamie. Thank you guys. Good luck.", "Michael S. McGavick", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Ian Gutterman with BAM. You may ask your question.", "Ian Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management L.P.", "Hi. Thanks for keeping the line open. On the North America property, can we get a little more color on the size of that book as a percent of your total insurance property book, just to help understand what 80 million means and to put that into some context?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Ian, I'm going to ask Greg to do that. But before we get to that I should point out one thing that hasn't been mentioned in the flurry of words on this. Interestingly while the losses originate are assigned to our North American books, many of the losses internationally make sure they were in international locations but rolled up to programs that were written in North America which is kind of interesting because the international book generally or the international portfolio of property risk is where we've seen weaker performance over the couple of quarters. So, it may have showed up in North America but where it originated isn't unfamiliar to us.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Sure. On a net earned premium basis, the global property book is about 12.5%, the North American book is about 7%.", "Ian Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management L.P.", "Got it. And can you give us any sense of what 80 million is versus budget or \u2013 last year it was low, but maybe a five-year average large loss number? Is there anything we can do relative?", "Michael S. McGavick", "No, this is not something we have practiced disclosure. I did hear a request for more views over time and as we work through how to do that, we'll see if we can find a way to give some color to that. But I don't want to get too close because it could get into information that could help those we compete with. So we'll try and think of a way to give you a little more color around that.", "Ian Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management L.P.", "Understood. I understand the challenge.", "Michael S. McGavick", "We're getting near the end (indiscernible)\u2026", "Ian Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management L.P.", "Can I squeeze one last, on professional lines, the quota shares? I just want to understand better, Pete, the economics and how we'll see it play through. And I know this has been asked, but if I can push a little more. So obviously, you're going to have less dollars or premium. That means you're giving away profitable loss dollars, so that hurts income. As you said, it hurts the G&A ratio, so that hurts income. You get help from income from the ceding commission. Net-net, how do we see the benefits to you play out in this? Is this neutral, positive or negative to dollars of income? And if it's negative, is it made up for in less capital? How are we going to actually see the benefit? Because my concern is, if you just do it simplistically, is this actually, if you don't think it through all the way, it seems like it actually hurts earnings, not helps. And intuitively, it seems like it must help, if it's a good deal.", "Peter R. Porrino", "Right, so Ian this is Peter. I'll start and then Greg can add more color. So the easiest one is the capital release, right. I mean this is very clear a de-risking action. As far as the underwriting results go, that depends on what loss ratio you're going to pick and we're not going to get into specifics as to the size of the override, but it was significant and it was significant enough that I'll be honest, when we measured the trade economically, it did not take us a really long time to evaluate that.", "Ian Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management L.P.", "Understood. When I try to model based on what I had heard, I got it being \u2013 maybe it's not that great per dollars of income in the numerator. So it would seem the impact comes more from increased share repurchase. Is that a reasonable way to think about it?", "Peter R. Porrino", "Well, I hadn't talked about share repurchases, so this is a one-year transition that we have. So depending on how the economics play out we may or may not renew it. I don't think that that would probably be the type of transaction that you would then do a share repurchase on the back of.", "Ian Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management L.P.", "Got it. I'll follow up later. Thank you.", "Peter R. Porrino", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the speakers.", "Michael S. McGavick", "Listen, we're going to jump through a bit here and we're always happy to stay and answer the questions. This is important to us. We know that through these calls, we're communicating to many audience not just those who analyze us but also terribly important to our shareholders and of course our colleagues who are often on the line. And paying attention to those colleagues, I want to say this is a good way to end the year. We're making good progress, keep it up. We're going to make good rational decisions and we're not going to overreact. We think this is an improving book of business. We've communicated effectively why it is that we have that confidence. And while we remain a work in progress, we feel very good entering 2014. We appreciate your patience, we appreciate your questions. Dave and team will look forward to follow-ups as necessarily. I know that Pete and I are headed to some conferences where we'll get other opportunities to emphasize these messages as well. With that, I think we're at the end. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

My name is Shirley, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the XL Group plc First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Dave Radulski", "Thank you, Shirley. And welcome to XL Group's first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. This call is being simultaneously webcast on XL's website at www.xlgroup.com. We posted to our website several documents, including our quarterly financial supplement and a presentation titled Sale & Retrocession of Life Reinsurance Business.", "On our call this morning, you'll hear from Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, who will offer opening remarks; Pete Porrino, Chief Financial Officer; followed by Greg Hendrick; and Jamie Veghte, who will review their segment results and market conditions. Others with us today include our Chief Investment Officer, Sarah Street; and our Controller, Steve Robb.", "Before they begin, I'd like to remind you that certain of the matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations.", "Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, and therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them.", "Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.", "Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they're made and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Mike McGavick.", "Mike McGavick", "Good morning and thank you for joining this call. If you will permit, I'd like to start with a quick personal note. This is a call I have been looking forward to for six years. We are very pleased on this call to be able to discuss the transaction we announced last night on our now largely exited Life Reinsurance businesses. I'm truly excited by the culmination of an effort that we started working on immediately after I was hired in 2008.", "Here is how we are going to approach this call. We will get into the results from the quarter first, so you will hear from me, Pete, Jamie and Greg in the usual fashion. And then Pete and I will come back to discuss more fully the Life Re transaction as we want to them get into the details and give you plenty of time for your questions.", "So with regard to the quarter, XL had a very good start to 2014, the solid results across both our core business segments and from our investment affiliates. In fact, across many total P&C metrics, this was one of the best quarters since the end of 2008. Our Insurance segment continued to improve and Reinsurance performed strongly in spite of the widely discussed tough market conditions.", "Some of the results highlight. Excluding the first quarter of 2013, which we have noted in many ways was an outlier in terms of outperformance. Our total P&C combined ratio of 89.7%, our total underwriting profit of $145 million and our loss ratio of 58.9% are the best result since the fourth quarter of 2008. And once again we produced double-digit ROE of 10.4%, excluding unrealized gains on investments.", "Contributing to the strong quarter was an Insurance segment underwriting profit of $45 million and an insurance accident year ex-cat combined ratio of 94.6%. Meanwhile, the 76.3% combined ratio for the Reinsurance segment is obviously a very strong result.", "Now we do expect to see variations from quarter-to-quarter as we\u2019ve discussed many times with you. We are mindful and this was a relatively low cat quarter and we of course know from last year. The strong starts do not necessarily project the same kind of performance across the entire year. All of that said, we like these results and we really like the way this quarter positions us for the rest of 2014.", "With that, I am going to turn it over to Pete for a quick rundown of the financials in the quarter. Greg and Jamie will have the segment highlights, and then Pete and I will return to get into the details of the Life transaction. Pete?", "Pete Porrino", "Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Given all that we have to cover today, I\u2019ll make my remarks brief covering four items, reserve development, expenses, investment results and capital management.", "Prior year reserve development in the quarter was a net favorable $39 million or 2.7 loss ratio points, compared to $31 million or 2.1 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2013. This reflects favorable development from short tail property and catastrophe lines in this A versus E quarter of $8 million and $31 million in the Insurance and Reinsurance segments. Our semiannual full actuarial review will be reported on next quarter. Our reserve related note, we do intend to publish our global loss triangles next week.", "Turning to expenses, you may have notice that in prior years our first quarter expenses historically tended to be lower than the annualized run rate. In the past that was largely due to the lag in spend for technology and other areas in the first quarter, followed by a catch-up over the rest of the year.", "We are doing a better job of more evenly distributing our spending this year, so that while total expenses in Q1 2013 were 9% higher than Q1 a year ago that were virtually even with the most recent three quarters. And as we\u2019ve discussed on previous calls, we expect our total full year 2014 operating expenses to be higher than 2013 by mid single digits on annualized basis.", "Regarding investments, our investment portfolio delivered solid total returns of 1.8% in the quarter, P&C portfolio was 1.5% and the life portfolio of 3.2%. We had a positive mark-to-market of $302 million, with $236 million, and $66 million between P&C and Life.", "Unrealized net gains in the portfolio were $1 billion at the end of the first quarter, of which $800 million is in the P&C portfolio. This excludes the $365 million related to our held to maturity assets in the Life portfolio. And $162 million net investment income on the P&C portfolio in the quarter was 7.1% below the same quarter last year, due primarily again to lower reinvestment rates.", "The P&C gross book yield at the end of March remained pretty much unchanged at 2.7%. We still have a gap between the yields and maturing assets, and where we are reinvesting which will keep downward pressure on net investment income.", "Our investment and operating affiliates, all held in the P&C portfolio continue to produce strong results. Net income from investment affiliates was $60 million, up $10 million from the prior year quarter.", "We also had good earnings from our investment manager affiliates, also held in the P&C portfolio, reflecting the strong fourth quarter of 2013, which produced healthy incentive fees for affiliate managers.", "Now to capital management, during the quarter we continue to buyback our ordinary shares as we view such purchases as an effective use of surplus capital. Following the February Board of Directors meeting, we announced an increase in our ordinary dividend by 14% to $0.16 per share per quarter and the authorization of a new $1 billion share buyback program.", "This authorization includes the approximately $200 million remaining under the previous program. In total, during the first three months of 2014 we purchased and canceled 5.8 million ordinary shares at an average cost of $30.19 for $175 million.", "I will now turn it over to Greg to discuss our Insurance segment results.", "Greg Hendrick", "Thanks, Pete, and good morning. Today, I'll cover results for the segment, give a brief update on talent, provide some color on our continuing improvement and finish remarks on current market conditions.", "Beginning with the results, the Insurance segment produced a strong first quarter results with accident quarter ex-cat combined ratio of 94.6%, roughly 1 point higher than prior year. In fact, the first quarter of 2013 and 2014 are the two best accident quarter ex-cat results since 2007. The year-over-year change is expense ratio driven and the accident quarter ex-cat loss ratio was 63.5%, just 0.3 points above the prior year.", "As we all know and in fact, the last two quarters of 2013 has showed, there is inherent variability in our portfolio. However, the portfolio is in a best shape yet to absorb this volatility through our continuous work to reduce gross limits, grow profitable and diversified businesses and optimize reinsurance protections. Combined with our significantly improved talent, we believe the first quarter results are more reflective of the improving underwriting trends in our Insurance portfolio than those from a year ago.", "The underwriting expense ratio is 31% in the first quarter reflecting 0.7 point deterioration from the first quarter 2013, driven largely by certain non-recurring redundancy, recruitment and professional fees. More generally, our confidence in the improving results allows us to spend as Pete noted evenly through the year.", "To shift towards quarter share treaties in certain business will distort the comparisons of our acquisition ratio, which improved by 2 points over the first quarter of last year and our operating expense ratio, which deteriorated by 2.7 points. For 2014, it is necessary to look at the total underwriting expense ratio when comparing the prior year.", "Insurance gross premiums written grew by $55 million or 3.7% in the quarter when adjusted for foreign exchange movement and by over 5% on adjusted for large return premium on the multi-year account.", "Growth was once again particularly strong in North America, but premiums grew by more than 10% with construction, excess casualty and property businesses contributing the largest growth.", "New leadership in our International Financial Lines business also contributed along with growth in our cyber and crisis management portfolios. Our momentum continues to build as illustrated by our recent RIMS convention experience. We launched our new Global Kidnap and Ransom capability, and have hundreds of millions of clients and brokers eager to discuss how XL can help solve their risk management needs.", "Moving on to talent, we continue to enhance our team throughout this segment. We promoted Joe Tocco, the Chief Executive our North American Property and Casualty Group, and also announced Ken Riegler, Head of Global Risk Management assume responsibility for North American Distribution.", "In addition to Joe and Ken, we also added new talent to our International Financial Lines, marine and crisis management businesses, and recognized existing talent with several promotions. For the quarter we increased our underwriting force at 24 positions as we continue to build-out new and existing businesses.", "Talent is one of the five wins Mike has discussed previously and we continue to pull out remaining four levers to improve our combined ratio. In particular, our mix continues to shift towards higher margin businesses. In the first quarter, well over half of our business performed better over 5 points of our target combined ratios. This compares only third of the book at the end of 2012.", "Growth in some of our newer business such as North America Construction and Cyber and improvement in several other businesses such as Environment and International Financial Lines are contributing to this momentum. Further improvement is expected as 2013 and 2014 underwriting actions continue to earn growth.", "On market conditions, we continue to see some slowing in rate, particularly in short tail and International Lines. Despite of increase in competition, the segment achieved an overall rate increase of 2.3% in line with Reinsurance.", "In fact, 85% of our portfolio achieved positively in the quarter compared to 75% in the fourth quarter of last year. North American business continue to show the most strength with rate increases in the 5% range, although, on of our North American business had positive rate and rate on rate with only property, which has been widely discussed in the industry decreasing by just over 1%.", "Our International P&C businesses achieved rate for the second straight year with rate increases over 2% for the quarter. Our Global Professional and Specialty businesses had rate increase in the 1% to 2% range, adversely impacted by the competitive aviation and U.S. D&O excess markets, respectively.", "In closing, we are off to a solid start for the year as evidence by our first quarter results. Although, we benefit from another relatively quite catastrophe quarter, we believe these results are testament to the work has done on over the past 24 months to grow our higher margin businesses and make the hard decisions around portfolio that simply are not performing.", "Now to Jamie to discuss Reinsurance.", "Jamie Veghte", "Thank you, Greg and good morning. The Reinsurance segment got off to an excellent start in 2014 with the combined ratio of 76.3% and a resulting underwriting profit of $100 million for the quarter. We have the benefit of very quiet quarter of catastrophe activity but we are pleased with the performance across the portfolio, particularly in light of the competitive landscape.", "Our reserve releases in the quarter were $30.5 million, compared to $21 million a year ago. On an accident year basis, the portfolio generated a combined ratio of 83.5%, which compares to the 79.9% produced in Q1 of 2013.", "The deterioration in the accident year result resulted from the Malaysia Airlines loss where we have posted a $3.6 million loss net of reinstatement premiums, a slight increase on our acquisition ratio and nonrecurring premium items in 2013 of $5 million.", "As respect to our reserve releases, our position on long tail business remains cautious, particular with respect to releases in recent underwriting years, a full 84% of this quarter\u2019s release were from short tail lines.", "Turning to topline, gross written premiums in the quarter were $858 million, a 5% reduction from the first quarter of 2013. These reductions were largely driven by our international operations, with North America flat and Bermuda showing a slight increase due to new Lloyd\u2019s whole account business.", "In the international portfolio, our gross written premium was $445 million, down from $520 million in the first quarter of 2013. In Europe, we faced difficult market conditions in property and dropped a very large motor quota share in the United Kingdom.", "Latin America remains extremely challenging, particularly in the Brazilian market and our gross written premium dropped by 40% to $20 million in the quarter. So with respect to our top line and the market broadly, trading conditions are highly competitive.", "Since the end of the quarter, the only significant renewal for XL at April, one was in the Japanese market. While pricing was down 10% to 15% and terms and conditions loosened, we are satisfied we have a portfolio that should generate attractive returns.", "In fact, I would underscore that theme across our entire portfolio. We haven\u2019t seen trading conditions across the market as intensely competitive as this for quite a number of years. There will be winners and losers.", "We bring a number of assets to the table, including a diversified portfolio across geography and class, a stable of excellent trading partners developed over two decades, a strong reserve position and a season team of underwriters who have generated excellent return to our shareholders over a number of years.", "In short, while we anticipate continued headwinds in the sector, we enter it from a position of strength and anticipate continued strong performance. So overall we are very pleased with our bottom line results in the first quarter and we continue to successfully navigate our way through very challenging market conditions.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Mike.", "Mike McGavick", "Thank you, Jim. As I said at the outset of the call, our news about our life reinsurance transaction is the culmination of six years of effort. We are working on exerting the life re businesses when the market turned against us in 2008. At that point, we placed few businesses into runoff and have ever since continued to entertain arbitrators to exit the businesses.", "Last night, we announced that we a retroceding the vast majority of our life reinsurance reserves and we want to walk you through the transaction. I want to acknowledge upfront that transaction is a bit complex. And I think you will see that this complexity works substantially in favor of XL shareholders.", "Before I get into too much detail, let me focus on the fundamental purpose of this transaction. We are a global property and casualty insurance and reinsurance underwriter that is what we do. Having this block of life re businesses to tend to and the risk that were introduced inherently into our business by them, distracts and detracts from our core mission. Getting these risks off of our minds and substantially off of our books inherently improves the businesses that our shareholders own.", "Now let me walk you through six aspects of this transaction. First, I\u2019m going to walk you through what has changed in the environment and with XL that enables us to get to this announcement. Second, provide a brief description of the transaction itself. Third, I\u2019ll walk you through the aspects of the counterparty and what attracted us to them. Fourth, I\u2019ll give you description of the key protections for XL shareholders that are built in some transaction. Fifth, I'll turn to the right blocks that were not dealt with in this transaction and are retained by XL. And then lastly, I\u2019ll describe the implications of this transaction for capital management, going forward.", "Then Pete will come back and add some additional detail. So in terms of the first aspect what has changed? First, it is observable there's a great deal of activity with respect to discontinued blocks of life insurance and reinsurance businesses. And you\u2019ve seen a number of deals already announced.", "As I said, ours is a bit more complicated than many of those and hence has taken a bit longer to put together given the unique structure of our reinsurance arrangements with our clients. Second, it has also taken longer for the market to get comfortable with European assets especially elongated European assets, which is the central feature of the books we are dealing with in this transaction.", "The final thing that has changed is the direct result of our own work, the improvement in our own property and casualty performance. Simply put, as our P&C ROEs have continued to climb the life block, which represents something like 20-ish percent of our capital and its mid-single digit percent returns becomes a greater and in the future potentially a still greater drag on our results.", "We and the investors deserve to have our improving team see results shine through. So as I mentioned at the beginning that is the core purpose of the arrangement. So we can focus on what we do best. And before moving on to the next aspect, there is a third but more minor point to be made. It is obvious that our firm for variety of reasons carries a higher beta than many of our competitors.", "It is observable in the market that life operations tend to attract a higher beta than those in P&C operations. And since our goal is to trade like our other well performing P&C brethren, anything that gives the market a reason to attach a higher beta to us is something we\u2019d like to deal with.", "Moving to the second aspect of this deal, a description of the transaction itself. The first thing to note is whether it\u2019s a two-step transaction. A retrocession of $4.4 billion of XL Life Reinsurance reserves into an entity that has been sold. Said more simply, we are selling to our counterparty of vehicles so that they can then reinsure our risks.", "The risks that are included in this reinsurance arrangement are the overwhelming majority of our European facing reinsurance risk. In the main, there are two large blocks of Life Re business. The single premium annuities that we have discussed with you many times and then a smaller block of European term life. To put it all in perspective that is $4.4 billion of the total of $4.8 billion in reserves we held for life reinsurance.", "That brings us to the third aspect I want to describe a description of GreyCastle, our counterparts. The most important thing to note is that the counterparty is a collection of family offices and University endowments. While we had a number of interested parties to choose from, from traditional reinsurers to private equity and also some new life reinsurance start-ups.", "We view GreyCastle as exactly the kind of counterparty that should want these risks because their main focus is preserving capital. We didn't want a counterparty that was going to do this as a leverage play or juice the assets. We wanted someone that was going to run it off and take the ordinary benefits of the runoff. So we feel we have exactly the right kind of counterparty.", "That brings me to the fourth aspect I said I'd cover which is to walk through some of the obvious risk of the transaction and the way in which they are addressed. While our retrocession is not novel, what we're doing that we're doing it to an unrated vehicle is and I want to talk about that.", "First of all and most importantly, this is a funds withheld reinsurance transaction. That means that we keep these assets on our books and in our accounts. What we transfer to GreyCastle is the management of these assets and their economic benefits. But should the counterparty not perform, we are able easily because they're still in our accounts to recapture these assets under a variety of scenarios.", "This protects XL shareholders. So not letting these assets go is the ultimate protection in and of itself. One other thing I should note and Pete will describe in a moment, there is one minor inconvenience to holding these assets on our accounts and that is that there will be some accounting noise, nothing more than noise as respect to net income. Pete will get into the details of that in a second.", "So I\u2019m sure this leaves you to wonder about what conditions could cause the retrocession agreement to be recaptured by us as obviously this would defeat the purpose of ceding them to someone else. There are essentially three main categories of failure that would lead to their recapture.", "One, if failure of GreyCastle to be in regulatory compliance; two, a failure to satisfy collateral requirements and three, a failure to comply with the contractually described capital requirements. To give some perspective, since they have already paid us $570 million, none of these events are very attractive to GreyCastle as they would forsake the investment they have made.", "And to give additional perspective, we have modeled a variety of scenarios they could give rise to a recapture and they are extreme events. They are for example beyond the consequences of the Lehman failure. Even when we modeled European defaults and the doubling of the longevity assumptions, GreyCastle would still be able to perform.", "So you can see we do not expect to again control these assets and the good news is should these extreme events occur, we will have been paid $570 million for the transaction and XL shareholders will be that much better off in those conditions. We think this combination of funds was held in receiving the payment of $570 million gives us a terrific exit from the vast majority of the risks facing these blocks of business.", "To bring up another worry, you might have somehow that GreyCastle would look to manage these assets in a riskier way to get a better return. The answer is they can. We have investment guidelines agreed to with them that are essentially an extension of our own guidelines we used to manage the portfolios today and we have agreements in place to allow us to monitor the activities and to ensure their compliance.", "And then lastly you might wonder is there enough capital. Let me give you some perspective on the contractual capital requirements. The answer is that we have defined the capital standard that GreyCastle has agreed to maintain and that is the equivalent of the AA capital standard based on an S&P model. And further we have already required these counterparties to set aside additional moneys that they would commit to further capitalization should it be needed.", "That brings me to the fifth aspect that I said I would describe and that is what\u2019s out of the deal and why did we keep it. Here there is a simple answer. The nature of the various blocks we are keeping are so different that we feel that it should be dealt with differently to and separately to acquire the best outcome. Simply put, the potentially best buyer for each block is different.", "Since the transaction that we have now announced, includes the vast majority of reserves and the vast majority of the risks. We felt it was important to get this transaction done first. So what\u2019s left. There will remain about $400 million of life reinsurance reserves on our books. About $300 million in reserves are related to our U.S. term life reinsurance businesses and $100 million in a block of income protection business.", "There is also about $30 million in another block that were run up very quickly in areas that we\u2019re talking about. So you can see the relative magnitude, $4.4 billion leaving and a residual of just $400 million in reserves left behind. And these blocks, while in -- being in loss recognition for some time now are behaving in a relatively benign way. Just to be clear now that we\u2019re done with this transaction, of course, we are open to dealing with these smaller blocks as well but we are also equally happy to run them off as a small part of XL that will not distract us from our overall objectives.", "And that brings me to the sixth and final aspect that I said I would describe that is going forward to capital management. While the transaction itself does not release capital and we have suggested to the market, it would not in prior conversations. It does make the firm less risky.", "This allows us to lower the buffer to the buffer that we carry and that we have discussed with you many times. This will result during the course of this year in us repurchasing an additional $300 million in share repurchases beyond the amount that we already contemplated for the year and that we have already described the magnitude of to you in our earlier calls.", "So in sum, I hope you can see why we are so happy with this transaction. We\u2019re getting a quality counterpart. We have a transaction that protects XL shareholders and we are removing the vast majority of the remaining non-core elements of XL\u2019s businesses. This is a milestone for us in becoming a sharper and more focused and ultimately we believe more success for property and casualty insurers and reinsurers.", "With that, I will turn it over to Pete who can then get into some of the more specific details on the economics and then we will open it up to questions either on the quarter or on this transaction.", "Pete Porrino", "Thanks Mike. I\u2019ll take you through three additional items related to the transaction. First a quick description of the structure and leading agency reactions; second, a walk through our calculation of our book value loss due to a transaction and finally as Mike mentioned as a result of some of the protections we built in, a discussion from an accounting perspective on how the transaction will impact the presentation of our results in the future.", "Turning to Slide 5 which diagrams transaction structure. It is important to understand that this is a two-part deal. The subject wise businesses are first aggravated and then retroceded into XL Life Reinsurance Limited, which is then sold to GreyCastle. As you can see, we are retailing $5.5 billion of assets on a funds withheld basis. And this compares to the $4.4 billion of GAAP reserves currently held. You may have seen the press releases last night from A. M. Best, S&P and Fitch, all of whom have affirmed our ratings.", "I think the best way to describe the book value charge of $585 million would be the start with what you are all most familiar with, our financial supplement, which at March 31 showed GAAP equity allocated to this business of $1.8 billion and by this business I mean the entire life segment.", "Our debt amount approximately $1.2 billion is assigned to the business being sold today. I will get back to the $600 million we now assigned to this transaction in a second. Subtracting a small tax benefit in the $570 million in proceeds, results in the book value loss of $585 million. And as we\u2019ve noted, these numbers will changed from March 31 through the completion of the transaction, mostly due to the mark-to-market value of the underlying investment portfolio.", "Getting back to the $600 million now allocated for the business and I will make two observations here. First, our estimate of the GAAP capital required for the remaining businesses is approximately $250 million. And second, the excess of this required amount was $350 million, mostly had to do with our method of funding to XXX reserves on our life term business in the United States.", "Moving on to how our future reserves would be presented, please turn to Slide 6. First, the obligations assumed by GreyCastle under the retrocession will be collateralized by invested assets that will continue to be legally owned by XL. GreyCastle will direct the investment of these assets subject to a agreed upon investment guidelines and will receive all of the economics associated with the investments. Because of this, the retrocession contains an embedded derivative.", "Accounting rules dictate that the movement in the value of the embedded derivative, which transfers the economics to GreyCastle is recorded through XL\u2019s net income. However, the changes in the fair value of the investments that are on our books that is economics we no longer have, are not recorded through net income. They are recorded in other comprehensive income, which is a component of shareholders equity.", "There will be mismatch as you will have that embedded derivative mark-to-market through net income and the offset which is the market value gain or loss on the investment portfolio, not going through net income. This will not impact comprehensive income, operating income or book value. The important point here is that there is no economic impact whatsoever but it does create fluctuations in net income going forward.", "I will turn to David to go to Q&A in a second. But I would just like to add that we are all really pleased we\u2019ve gotten to this point with the life business. We\u2019ve been pretty clear on our cause and other public communications. So you will all understand that this really was an accomplishment to get this done and we think a big step in the right direction. David?", "David Radulski", "Shirley, please open the lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays. You may ask your question.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays", "Thank you and good morning. Lots to get through today. I was wondering with the sale of the life reinsurance business, taking into account the affect on earnings as well as book value and the increased share buyback, what do you think the effect is on a run rate return on equity for XL overall?", "Mike McGavick", "Jay, so the effect at first would be quite small because of course the gap between current P&C, ROEs and the now transacted ROEs is not done.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays", "Hello.", "Mike McGavick", "Sorry, really technical difficulty there.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays", "You cut out for like the last 10 seconds. That was all.", "Mike McGavick", "Sorry about that. So to start over, the basic impact is very modest at first because the difference in the relative ROEs and P&C today, and the transacted business are not as big as we intend for them to be. So the impact grows over time. And of course the share repurchases has an additional benefit and those will occur over the course of the year. So it\u2019s starts off being pretty modest but it gets to some meaningful impact over the next couple of years and that\u2019s what we are shooting for. That\u2019s why this was such an important time to get this done from our point of view, Jay. You really wanted to do it. You didn\u2019t want it to be a drag on the total return of the firm, which we are positioned to create which we are starting to become. So it was just starting to pinch. It will pinch all the time.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays", "All right. So less of a -- the earnings dilution from the sale of life reinsurance business taking into account the impact of book value for share buybacks. You shouldn\u2019t see too much overall ROE erosion over the intermediate term?", "Pete Porrino", "", "Jay, this is Pete. the other thing -- you used the term erosion. We don\u2019t believe that there is any erosion in ROE. We think that there is a very small, as Mike said, small pick up immediately/", "Jay Gelb - Barclays", "That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then, Pete, on the $250 million of capitals that is being held back to support the remaining businesses, that seems rather large relative to the ongoing liabilities. Why is that and how long do you think it could take for that additional $250 million to get released?", "Pete Porrino", "So there are three pieces to the $250 million. And they are very good ups between the two of the businesses that we are retaining, the U.S. term and the income protection. And then also there is some amount there for the retrocession that is in places as a result of this transaction. I will tell you that our regulatory capital that will be holding on those is a number substantially less than $250 million. So that will not runoff and really if we -- we can talk a little bit later about the likelihood of any more transactions on the remaining businesses. But some of those would cause that to runoff pretty quickly.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays", "Okay. And then last one, quick one, the effective tax rate going forward taking into account these transaction has been running around 11% overall on operating income. Is that still reasonable run rate or will that change?", "Pete Porrino", "That should not change.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Amit Kumar with Macquarie. You may ask your question.", "Amit Kumar - Macquarie", "Thanks and good morning and congrats on the quarter. Two quick question, maybe a big question for Greg. If you look at the AY ex-cat LR in insurance, it was flattish year-over-year, you were talking about competition and pricing. How should we think about I guess the improvement on a full year basis for 2014, if you factor in the increasingly challenging pricing environment in insurance?", "Greg Hendrick", "", "So let me give you the comparison for me. We talk a lot about the second quarter and the first quarter last year, kind of averaging those out with some of the things we talked about then. It\u2019s about point better first quarter this year versus the average first and second quarter result last year. I\u2019m not going to project the future. This is a volatile business, things can happen.", "I feel very good about what we built into it. We are a great matching trend and so we are good on that. We are not losing ground there. We\u2019ve got our discipline on our underwriting actions and we are going to continue to deliver some improvement there. And we\u2019ve build out a new business and the spread of business looks strong. So, I think we are positioned well but I\u2019m not going to forecast as for the rest of the year.", "Amit Kumar - Macquarie", "Okay. I guess, switching gears, just going back to the discussion on capital management. You mentioned it adds $300 million more than previously contemplated. I think on the last call, we had spend some time talking about buybacks versus operating earnings and how to sort of think about that metrics. Could you just sort of refresh that discussion keeping this number? Should we add that to what we might have previously contemplated or should we apportion accordingly? Thanks.", "Mike McGavick", "Well, a couple of things. First of all, what we said, when we talked about share repurchases before was that you look at last year, which was about $575 million as kind of a floor for what we might do in the coming year. And of course as Pete has already mentioned in this call, we did repurchase at a slightly higher rate than that would imply in the first quarter of $175 million. I wouldn't read too much into that. We think about a number of things when we are repurchasing. We are looking at our internal models of where the buffer to the buffer stands because we're trying to make sure that doesn\u2019t grow any more. So that can affect what we might buyback in the quarter. Similarly like any purchases or shares, we are looking at the economics of the transaction at a given time, as you would have in a reserve. During this quarter, there were -- there were times during the quarter when we were certainly trading below what we thought we ought to be trading and maybe we could argue we still are today.", "So their economic aspects to what amount we might repurchase at any given time. So rather than focusing on the $175 million, I had focused on the guidance we\u2019ve already given you. Just as we don\u2019t emphasize, we want to focus on the guidance we\u2019ve given you on expense. When we say, take last year and add plus or minus low mid single digits, we mean take last year in entirety, add lows, kind of mid single digits and then develop that floor. That would be how we would do it. In this case, we would say take the $575 million you can round it to $600 million, if you want, divide it by 4, that\u2019s about where should expect the quarter. If conditions allow, we might buyback more but that\u2019s kind of how we are thinking about. And then to that, I would add $300 million. That\u2019s the real simple way of thinking about it.", "Amit Kumar - Macquarie", "Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. I will stop here. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future.", "Mike McGavick", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Vinay Misquith with Evercore. You may ask your question.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore", "Hi. Good morning. So, first, just wanted to clarify the $250 million debt remains in capital, that I hear you say that would take a long-term to runoff and so we shouldn\u2019t be expecting that to be soon?", "Mike McGavick", "Vinay, so what I said was the three buckets that I allocated to, the one that would get would disappear the quickest would be, if we did a transaction in one of the remaining businesses.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore", "Okay.", "Greg Hendrick", "And then as far as, the one point I guess I will make is this is an allocation of GAAP equity, right. It\u2019s not the regulatory capital, right. It is just an allocation of equity. So, I would encourage you not to spend too much time focusing on the allocation. The total GAAP equity enterprise is not changing.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore", "So, fair enough. So when you got rid off that piece, I mean I don\u2019t think that would free up any capital, would it?", "Greg Hendrick", "", "I\u2019m sorry, I couldn\u2019t quite understand it.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore", "So even you got rid of the last piece of your Life Reinsurance business that you have in your books, that would not really free up meaningful capital because you are getting diversification benefits to go ahead.", "Greg Hendrick", "Yeah. As we\u2019ve talked about diversification benefits in the past, if we continue to exit remaining businesses, it would be same thing that Mike has talked about before, right. I mean, there is a qualitative benefit they are getting out of these businesses. It\u2019s less quantitative than more qualitative.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore", "Sure. That\u2019s helpful. And just the numbers question on the life reinsurance business. So just looking at the presentation, it seems that you are retaining about a $1 million worth of quarterly income and the rest is being seated away, correct? I mean, is that right?", "Greg Hendrick", "Approximately correct.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore", "Okay.", "Greg Hendrick", "The vast majority of the profits of the business where and why is being sold.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore", "Fair enough. Fair enough. And then finally on the primary insurance business, I just had a two sided question on that. This quarter, we had about a one-point benefit year-over-year. Do you think that\u2019s enough to get to your combined ratio target and the second point on that is the topline growth was about five points of this quarter? The expenses are growing mid single digits. Help me understand how we have expense ratio leverage in that environment? Thanks.", "Greg Hendrick", "Sure. Let me start with - it's Greg. Let me start with the second part. The first quarter had some lumpiness to it. I mentioned that return of premium. We are projecting that we will get back in line with the growth that we were trying to get to for this year. And we will control those expenses as we go through the year, if we do not see that growth materializes. It\u2019s clearly a delicate balance. We are not out there pushing underwriters into the market and trying to have them chase premiums, if the margins aren\u2019t there and so we are watching that incredibly closely, month-by-month, head-by-head. And so we will be on top of that.", "In terms of the target, if I go back to the first part, I heard you, the one point of improvement relative to the average of the first two quarters of \u201913, we\u2019ve been pretty evoke and when I was going towards our targets when I heard Vinay, it\u2019s another step in the right direction. But we are still not there. We are still pushing hard for our 90% combined ratio target and I have talked at length about all the underlying actions, the portfolio construction, the rate has slowed a little bit. So it\u2019s one, not as strong tailwind but we are well on our way to getting towards that overall month.", "Mike McGavick", "", "And this is Mike. Maybe I could add a couple of thoughts. One, from my perspective on top of the house, I do expect continuing operating leverage to be gained. And if the market were to some how turn even more competitive than it showed itself to be in the first quarter, it\u2019s a way to do so.", "We would always make the judgment to, if we couldn\u2019t get into different segments, in different places around the world, if we couldn\u2019t get appropriate, we would be willing to slow down rate of growth, that\u2019s not a problem. But I am not holding Greg to account for a specific set of expenditures. I am holding Jamie account for the ratio that he has committed to produce.", "So if there anything turned down in what we can profitably put on the books, we will manage down the expenses in order to gain the operating leverage that we have expected to achieve as a part of this year\u2019s plan. So I appreciate where you are coming from. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the way this is going to play because we are in so many different businesses and so many different geographies that tend to be -- it\u2019s a profitable growth available to us. But if we went up in that situation, we will deliver the expansion leverage that we expect.", "The second thing that I would point out, I think this is really important data of what Greg has already said. As you know, this is about portfolio management in the round. We are growing the more profitable businesses, we are shrinking the less profitable businesses, and that is producing an ability for our firm to manage these more difficult competitive conditions and still deliver improvement in the overall result. So this is directionally in line with where we are headed. But I think about the first quarter it demonstrates it.", "While we are on an overall combined ratio about a point off of the very, very good in first quarter last year, let\u2019s remember that\u2019s mostly about the expense ratio which is because we spent more rapidly this year to even it out over the year rather than kind of the wait and see and then spend attitude that we\u2019ve had in the past. That\u2019s the reflection of our confidence in where we\u2019re going.", "So if it\u2019s just that difference that pulls up above that the loss ratios are in line with that very exceptional quarter and we think on a more solid footing, that\u2019s why we are so excited. This does in fact set us up directionally for the results we do intend to deliver.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.", "Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yes. Thank you. A couple of questions. I guess first is, as you were putting this deal together, were you out of the market from a buyback standpoint at any point during the quarter?", "Mike McGavick", "No, we weren\u2019t. We had put 10b5-1 plan in place before this deal clarified, so that we could continue to transact in case something came of it.", "Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. And then the second question is, the assets that still remain from the life reinsurance business, based on the market conditions you see out there today, would you describe those as easier to sell than what you have already announced?", "Mike McGavick", "So there is -- as we noted, there is two main blocks there, $300 million in U.S. term life reinsurance and about a $100 million in income protection blocks. And we don\u2019t see much of a market for income protection blocks right now. But, I always at this point pause and I advertise it\u2019s 1-800 Porrino if you are interested in it, feel free to get Peter call.", "On the U.S. term re, which is the $300 million, the larger of the two blocks, I do think there is good signals in the market, but we have not been actively seeking to transact at this time because we wanted to get this larger and more complex arrangement behind us. With that done, again it\u2019s 1-800 Porrino. But as I said, these books are performing in a fairly -- in a way that doesn\u2019t worry, we would be happy to just wind it up. And maybe Pete you can try a little more color on that?", "Pete Porrino", "Yes. So, Jay, the other thing I would add in addition to the capital market is to -- just to give you a flavor of the books and what\u2019s going on. I mean, they are both in loss recognition and they have both been in since 2005. We take the income protection book since 2005 the total reserve changes -- the total reserve charges have been about $12 million, right. So, clearly insignificant. And then the large U.S. term bucket again since 2005, $39 million over an 8-year period. So, again very comfortable running these off.", "The other thing I guess that I would say, as Mike talked about, the U.S. term business and the potential of a transaction. And I am changing my phone number by the way. But to give you perspective, if an opportunity came to offload that business, it\u2019s hard to imagine that we would do the transaction where we would incur a loss of, let\u2019s say, $50 million or more, it just wouldn\u2019t be worth it.", "Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. That\u2019s really good color. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. You may ask your question.", "Meyer Shields - KBW", "Thanks. Two questions I'm going to focus on the P&C side if I can. One, can you talk a little bit -- I guess this is a question for Pete about the section or the portion of the loss reserves that were not for short-tail lines, what accident years and lines of business you are seeing those and what trends have been driving the releases?", "Mike McGavick", "Yes. So I am just going to have Susan cover that real quickly.", "Susan Cross", "Right. So in terms of the prior year development the quarter as you mentioned it was the 31 million and is slightly driven by short-tail lines. In terms of by accident year within insurance that was primarily the 2012 accident year. And in reinsurance it was spread across the 2004 to the 2012 accident years. There was a modest amount of strengthening in 2013 that related to the German hailstorm losses, the cat losses in 2013.", "Meyer Shields - KBW", "Okay. Last quarter we talked a fair amount of an uptick in large losses. How did the first quarter play out, I know the general perception was that the weather was kind of bad?", "Greg Hendrick", "There was in insurance, there was nothing remarkable to the positive or the negative about the quarter in terms of large losses.", "Meyer Shields - KBW", "Okay. That was fine. Thank you.", "Mike McGavick", "And back on the reserves questions, remember Pete mentioned in his comments, but Global Loss Triangles come out next week, I am sure you all be waiting eagerly.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question comes from Dan Farrell with Sterne Agee. You may ask your question.", "Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee", "Hi, and good morning. Just when looking at the capital that\u2019s supporting the P&C business, it still looks like you\u2019re going to be operating at a fairly conservative level. I was wondering if you could comment as your earnings power improves in P&C, how if any does that impact your view of the capital buffer as we go forward that\u2019s remaining?", "Mike McGavick", "Yes, that\u2019s an excellent observation. And clearly, our earnings strengthening, and I would also say us doing a better job as we have been working to do a better job in terms of managing the variability in earnings all the time. As we continue to do a both better job on both of those, I think the Board would agree with us that firm\u2019s risk decline further and that we would take into account. Now, remember we go through kind of a three part analysis. The first part of the analysis is how much capital is required for the primary buffer which is to the rating that we carry.", "Then, we look is, are there opportunities to put it to work at a similarly profitable level for our shareholders are better. And then third, we look at what kind of buffer to the buffer should be carry and after we do all of that, we say how much can be return to our shareholders through repurchases or dividend or whatever method. And we look at other things at that time of course like where we are trading and all that kind of things.", "So it\u2019s a fairly complex. You will note in there is can we put money to work. We\u2019ll always be looking for ways to grow the impact we make in the world at a profitable return to our shareholders. But still at this time, I would tell you that our -- when we do that, we tend to come back to repurchases as the best use of money that\u2019s left over. But your insight is right, as we have stronger and more robust earnings which we do expect to produce even in this environment, and as we see our ability to through portfolio structure and reinsurance all the tools to better mange the variability of the book, I think you are thinking about that way.", "Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee", "That is very helpful. Then, just a quick question on your reinsurance purchase. You obviously purchased more reinsurance this quarter. I am wondering just what\u2019s your view going forward given the reinsurance market environment on the ability to maybe do some more reinsurance purchases to improve overall risk management, shape the returns with the portfolio, etcetera in the insurance business? Thanks.", "Mike McGavick", "If I could start with two introductory comments and then I will turn it over to Greg. One introductory comment is we look at these kinds of transactions through the alliance and partnerships. We believe everybody ought to know what they are doing and do the right thing and we are not looking to arbitrage the hot market is my point. We don\u2019t think that that\u2019s the right way to do business, but we want to understand what the other party gets out of it, we want to know what we get out of it, and then we will do the transaction. But at the end, the second introductory comment I will make is that you would have been in news as you\u2019re asking that question to look at the faces of my colleagues. Greg was smiling and Jamie was frowning just to be really quick. Greg?", "Greg Hendrick", "I think there is some more room to Mike\u2019s point. This is a long-term trading. We have been trading a lot of our reinsurance partners for many, many years, so this is not about chasing the hot money or putting to work new cares. I\u2019ll just use an example. We\u2019ve just recently wrapped up our May 1 property risk and property cat protections. We gave a good hard look at what our portfolio look like to make sure that we had the right protection for XL based on our own internal capital mine and we went out and peer benchmark ourselves on our net risk position. And we found that we could -- we\u2019re able to achieve this renewal a little bit lower risk attention. We purchased a little bit more limit on our international U.S. cat. We\u2019ve got some expanded coverages and we\u2019re able to add what\u2019s called a risk area cover that helps protect us in the middle kind of middleing size losses that might accumulate over a year. And we\u2019re able to do that within a very, very reasonable purchase relative to last year\u2019s payments. I think there is more to be had, but to Mike\u2019s starting point this is not about being egregious and taking advantage of our long-term partners.", "Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee", "That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Ian Gutterman with BAM. You may ask your question.", "Ian Gutterman - BAM", "Hi, good morning. I guess my first question is the 1-800 Porrino tagline, give us 15 minutes and we will sell you a company?", "Mike McGavick", "Ian, the only thing I would say is this one took a hell of a lot more than 15 minutes.", "Ian Gutterman - BAM", "At least it wasn\u2019t 15 years, so that\u2019s good. I would like to -- I guess the problem, Pete, is as soon as one thing gets wrapped up, we focus on the next thing so, but this one is hopefully a good thing. When I look at -- obviously there has been a lot of focus on how much book value you\u2019re going to lose in this transaction. But when I look at another part of your business, the operating affiliates business, it seems the book value there is substantially understated. And I was hoping you could give us some color on how to think about that. I guess I just did a couple quick things using your 10-K and some statutory filings. And the investment managers you had, I'm just focused on the operating affiliates, the investment manager operating affiliates were on the books at $62 million at year end and they earned $78 million last year. And I understand that might be over earning some maybe.", "But the point is if you\u2019re earning more than book value, it\u2019s got to be worth a lot more than book value if we put a PE on earnings. And the strategic affiliates, it looks like ASI alone is maybe $150 million to $200 million of book value, and I look at the publicly traded peers in the Florida homeowners market are trading at north of 2 times book. So if I add those two together, it seems that arguably the operating affiliates are understated per book value by the same $578 million or maybe even more that the life reinsurance took a loss on. Am I in the right ballpark? Is there any other information you can give us to help us maybe give you some more credit for the value of those businesses?", "Mike McGavick", "Well, Ian, as always, a very thoughtful observation and the amount of homework you do shocks me sometimes. I think you know our numbers at least as well as we do sometimes. So your points are exactly accurate, right. So I am trying to add a little bit of color, but I don\u2019t have much more than what you said, because again you went through that in a fair amount of detail. But again as we break out sort of our investment affiliates, as you know we\u2019ve got three categories, the fund investment that we equity account for, our investment manager affiliates, and the insurance affiliates as you laid out. The fund affiliates, these are carried at the net asset value, so really fair value and what\u2019s on our balance sheet are probably pretty close.", "For the investment manager affiliates and this is the top one, but I\u2019m trying to walk through it and then give you one specific piece of data. For the investment manager affiliates, we carry those at the end of this quarter with $89 million and just everybody knows what that mean, it\u2019s what we paid for our current stakes, plus our share in the earnings over the years net of the distributions that we\u2019ve received. And according to the equity accounting, we do not write up any of these even if we think that the fair value exceeds the current carrying value, right. So that\u2019s the accounting side of it. From the business side of it, this is a business we really like we\u2019ve been in a long time.", "And asset management is a business characterized by strong cash flows and high return on capital. That\u2019s been our experience with our affiliate holdings. So just from numbers around the earnings power that you mentioned the one year, but I\u2019ll go back and I give you a five year view. The $220 million in operating earnings in this business right, the investment management business over the last five years, significant amount of money and again you compare that to what we\u2019re holding it at right now the 89. And again not apples and apples but it is indicative, right.", "Now the $220 million includes some meaningful liquidity event realizations and let\u2019s call that sort of 25% have been capitalization event proceed as part of the $220 million, but still significant amount of money. And as we look at the business today, I\u2019d say it\u2019s sort of a mix of established firms, smaller companies in growth, the mix of businesses that look more like asset management companies and may have liquidity events and others that maybe cash generative but less franchise value.", "And I now will talk about one company specifically because it is public, but it is hard to put some of the values on these stakes. We are long-term strategic holders of these assets. We\u2019ve got a great track record and we\u2019re very proud of it. The example I would take you to is the one thing that you didn\u2019t talk about is Polar Capital Holdings. It\u2019s publicly quoted in London, we own 7 million shares. We carry our stake at just under $16 million. What it\u2019s trading at these days, the market value of the holding is $23 million above the $16 million. So I can say that you can apply that ratio across the board, but it does give you some sense. Ian, I think you\u2019re exactly right.", "And then on the insurance affiliates, new companies, America Strategic is by far the largest one that we have. We record it at book value. Our book value cost on that is something in the $160 million range. And you all know the markets as well as I do. I will disagree with anything you say, but clearly that is a really well-known company in a market that\u2019s getting good valuations right now. And so it\u2019s clearly is worth a multiple of what we carry it on. So I\u2019m sorry for the long-winded answer but it was a very good question.", "Ian Gutterman - BAM", "That\u2019s very helpful information. Again, I don't think you guys get enough credit for it. The only other follow-up I have is you mentioned, I forgot at the one part, I did forget to ask was you did mention at the book value on the investment managers changes by the earnings minus the distributions and it seems that those distributions are I guess, I would think of that as excess capital, right.", "So I think when we think of your capital, we are used to thinking of maybe the insurance earnings. But can you give us a sense of how to think about what dividend capacity out of those? I don't know if there is such a thing as normal distributions but you see what I am getting at, right? Just how do we think about how much capital those things generate on an annual basis just from the distributions?", "Mike McGavick", "I\u2019m going to ask Sarah, if you don\u2019t mind, Ian, just give a little color on it.", "Sarah Street", "Hi Ian. Because asset management businesses are not heavily capital uses. The actual distributions of the earnings that we would see every year is relatively high, relative to the earnings that we actually booked through the P&L.", "Ian Gutterman - BAM", "Okay, that is what I was guessing, so that is basically why the book value doesn't change very much?", "Sarah Street", "Correct.", "Mike McGavick", "Correct.", "Sarah Street", "And then it will also go down obviously from the sales. But yes -- no, we get god distributions in terms of dividends out of them every year.", "Ian Gutterman - BAM", "Got it. Great. Very helpful answers. Thanks guys. Congratulations.", "Mike McGavick ", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.", "Mike Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks. Can I get a little more color on the other reinsurance business that you wrote? It looks like that lifted a bit. I see the footnote but is there a piece of that business that is growing faster than others and what sort of margin are you writing that business at? Thanks.", "Mike McGavick", "Yeah. Mike, there are several components in it but far in a way the largest of what we described as other would be whole account quarter shares out of select Lloyd\u2019s syndicates. And this particular quarter we wrote one new one which drove the entire increase in the other category of business. The margins on it I think would be similar to a whole, a quota share on a multi line commercial carrier i.e. overtime certainly not as high as our property cat book but we\u2019ve had very, very steady returns on that business over a longer period of time.", "Mike Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs", "Got it. And I guess, I mean, you dovetailing off of that. I mean, how would the property GAAP book coming down a bit. And I\u2019m guessing just generally profitability in that book that you\u2019re keeping is probably a little bit lower now versus where you thought it might be at the beginning of the year. How should we think about the target 90 combined and what are -- maybe the answer is you\u2019ve also got higher combined ratio businesses also receiving a bit so maybe the mix is not changing all that much. But just trying to get some understanding for how we should about reinsurance as sort of a contributor toward that 90 goal? Thanks.", "Mike McGavick ", "Well, let\u2019s be clear, the 90 is really what Greg has been driving to. If reinsurance was to run at a consistent 90, there will be about a 5 point deterioration of what it is running?", "Mike Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs", "No, right, but all-in, I guess, right. And all in, I mean, it is part of the company that also plans to get to a 90 combined.", "Mike McGavick", "Well, obviously, there is competition all over the place. The property cat business is still on a pro forma basis a very profitable business. And frankly, I still believe even with the pricing pressure on it, it is still driving the vast majority of returns in the reinsurance market right now. I\u2019ll tell you one thing, I'm very happy to be running a reinsurance business in the company like XL now where we have -- there are certainly challenges around running it and doing a platform business.", "But we can focus on driving bottom-line profits, wherever the margins are right now. I'm not worried about expenses and so forth, while Greg continues to improve his portfolio business. I'd be much more concerned about the pricing environment if I was running a standalone medium-sized pure reinsurance company.", "Mike Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs", "Got it. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question comes from Randy Binner with FBR. You may ask your question.", "Randy Binner - FBR", "Hey, thanks for staying on. Just a couple of follow-ups on the deal. I guess the first question is pretty high-level and that is there is been a lot of talk here about $300 million of additional buybacks for 2014. But I think, it is safe to say that when 2015 comes around, you kind of roll into a new set of expectations around leverage, earnings and whatever you would do their to figure out what the incremental buyback would be in 2015 in addition to the $300 million in 2014. Is that correct?", "Mike McGavick", "Well, we\u2019ll look at \u201915 as that year come upon us. We have a hack of a lot of work to do throughout the next three quarters. And we will see where we are when the smoke clears.", "Randy Binner - FBR", "Right. But just to clarify, the $300 million is not all we get out of this, I guess I would say is that it would be reevaluated every year.", "Mike McGavick", "I will say it differently from that. We constantly evaluate the buffer to the buffer in light of all the factors that have already been discussed in this call, including the fact that we no longer have this business and possibly maybe even exit some more we will see and unlikely side. And also how do we do in terms of building more robust earnings and dealing with the variability. We\u2019ve been showing from quarter-to-quarter. So, we\u2019ll take all that into account. We\u2019ll take a look at how XL is trading.", "There is just a lot of variables that we\u2019re going to think about as we go into it and we have developed something of a tradition that at the beginning of the year we give you some perspective on how we\u2019re thinking about share repurchases. We\u2019ll do that at beginning of next year. And of course, we\u2019ll try to give you as effective as we can some -- the other thing we really give that could even be remotely called guidance around how we are handling expenses because those are in our control.", "Randy Binner - FBR", "All right. Understood. And then there has been a lot of interest on the call about maybe how you would get rid of the remaining run-off items. But I guess my question is more towards what kind of yield like investment yield or return can we expect on that and the cash inflow? My expectation when modeling this out is that you can generate some positive income from those two pieces and so any color you can give on that would be helpful?", "Pete Porrino", "Yeah. This is Pete. I would just say that we -- when we run our models, we\u2019ve done in pretty simply and you can look at what our new money rate is, we are not assuming. When we look at that economics of these deals, we don\u2019t assume that we are going to reinvest those at the ROE of the rest of the business, right. It isn\u2019t that we need that capital in order to write that business, right. And so we are looking at a reasonably low yield with the cash proceeds that we get.", "Randy Binner - FBR", "What is your new money yield right now? ", "Pete Porrino", "1.9% I think that overall mix of the business for P&C.", "Randy Binner - FBR", "Okay. So you reinvest cash proceeds at that -- at the book yield basically?", "Mike McGavick ", "I mean, yes, basically I\u2019ll say that is true. I mean, we\u2019re not doing anything different with those proceed. I would say that they are more allocated to capital. They\u2019re no longer backing specific liabilities and so they would go at the capital and therefore, they make it a higher percentage of some of our riskier investments, but that is a level of detail we really don\u2019t get into.", "Randy Binner - FBR", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the speakers for closing remark.", "Mike McGavick", "Yeah. This is Mike. Couple of things, first of all, again, this was a day we really looked forward to around here and we\u2019re very pleased to have this moment, and I want to, because I know, I\u2019ll have a lot of XL colleagues on the call as well. I want to single out a couple of their colleagues who deserve special recognition for this coming to fruition. On my staff, of course, the Pete and Kirstin Gould, who is our Chief Counsel have been extraordinarily busy and involved in the transaction. ", "But representing them as on the point for the whole things has been Steve Robb and Arabella Ramage and they have just done outstanding work and I just want to single them out now.", "Sometime, the night, I imagine the teams and people that have been involve with those will probably celebrate a moment in time then they will get back to work and bring it to an actual close. What more than anything, I want to thank all of our XL colleagues. They have been doing great work day and day out to continue to improve the overall business, which is a big part of why we chose to do this. We are able to do this.", "And that work continues. It is hard work improving a P&C business from where we started to where we are and to where we need to go. And that\u2019s the principle work that this firms engaged and we\u2019re back to work everyday to achieve our objective on behalf of our shareholders.", "So I thank everybody for their continued effort and particularly, Steve and Arabella for their exceptional work in this particular exercise and we look forward to nearly delivery for our shareholder especially in light of the better firm we\u2019ve now created. Thank you very much. Have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you. This does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the XL Group plc Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "David Radulski", "Thank you, Shirley. And welcome to XL Group's second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. This call is being simultaneously webcast on XL's website at www.xlgroup.com. And we posted to our website several documents, including our press release and quarterly financial supplement.", "On the call this evening, Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, who will offer opening remarks; Pete Porrino, XL\u2019s Chief Financial Officer will review our financial results, followed by Greg Hendrick our Chief Executive of Insurance Operations and Jamie Veghte, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations who will review their segment results and market conditions. Then we\u2019ll open it up for questions.", "Before they begin, I'd like to remind you that certain of the matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, and therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them", "Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they're made and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement response to new information, future developments or otherwise.", "With that, I turn it over to Mike McGavick.", "Michael S. McGavick", "Good evening and thank you for joining the call. XL had a good second quarter and we are pleased to see our broad-based progress continues to the first half of 2014. This is particularly true given the headwinds in the market, some of which will get into little bit later. But overall we believe we are demonstrating that the levers we have our at our disposal can help to offset these market conditions and we can continue to produce solid results, harvesting both our prior and ongoing work.", "In the second quarter, our results included \u2013 total P&C combined ratio of 88.3%, total underwriting profit of $168 million and a loss ratio of 57.6% all of which were better than the prior year quarter. At the same time, as you we feel our progress is better viewed over longer trends and from a year-to-date point of view nearly all of our core metrics are head of the first half of 2013 as well.", "Given the market we like where we are. One contrary metric is our operating expense ratio and we will spend some more time tonight going over our expenses in general. As we want to make sure that we are clearly on our expectations of what we\u2019ll develop for the full year. We also experience the one-off benefit in the quarter of some size and we want to make sure that is clear as well. Pete will get into both of these topics during his comments.", "Focusing on the insurance segment, we\u2019re pleased with the way the year is developing, specifically insurance underwriting profit in the quarter was $63 million well ahead of the $5 million reported in Q2 of 2013. Overall, we feel we are demonstrating our ability to absorb large losses, including in unusual number of large losses that have already taken place in the first half of this year, while continuing to expand margins.", "We\u2019re not out of our goal yet of course, but we like the trends particularly the calendar quarter loss ratio, which was the best result in 5.5 years. We can see that an increasing majority of our insurance businesses, our demonstrating expected performance inline with the market in their particular books. That\u2019s a much different place than were just a year or two ago.", "Looking at reinsurance here as well, nearly all of our core metrics are ahead of the prior year quarter as are the year-to-date figures against the first half of last year. Jamie will spend some more time discussing marketing conditions in his remarks, but I\u2019ll just say that we are really proud of the performance for reinsurance colleagues. We are all seeing nearly daily reports regarding the turmoil in the reinsurance market and a continuing lowering of expectations of rate, while expectations are raised for terms and condition on the part of the plans.", "You will note that our gross premium written is right about where we\u2019re at the same time first half of last year. This means that with the tough discussions on rate and renewals firms with the distinctive offerings and historic relationships will continue to be better positioned. At the same time, we do expect to feel the impact of the market it is in escapable and we will continue to manage our book to what we feel is the right level of rate for our business and let the chips fall where they may. But we are awfully proud of the way our book has performed to date in this difficult marketplace.", "Before turning to Pete, I just want to make one more comment regarding the life reinsurance business. As planned and without surprises the transaction closed in the second quarter. As you recall because the transaction is a sale and retrocession on a funds withheld basis. There are some complex accounting implications we want to make sure you fully aware off.", "While we discuss this to some extent last quarter the details are now in the numbers. We are happy to discuss this during Q&A or as a follow up to this call. But in sum we continued to be very pleased both with the transaction and with our counter-parties and are particularly appreciative of our ability to spend our time on the core businesses in this challenging period. Again, through two quarters it has been a very solid start to the year.", "With that, I will turn it over to Pete.", "Peter R. Porrino", "Thanks Mike and good evening. On net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders was $279 million or loss of a $1.03 per share, including the impact of the life reinsurance transaction. Operating net income for the second quarter was $280 million were $1.02 per share on a fully diluted compared to $222 million in 2013 or $0.75 per share.", "Our P&C combined ratio for the quarter was 88.3% or 5.5 points better than the same quarter last year, while our accident year combined ratio was 94.2% better by 7.6 points. This improvement is largely driven by lower levels of catastrophe losses this quarter at $35 million were 2.4 loss ratio points compared to $134 million or 9.3 loss ratio points in the second quarter of 2013.", "As we\u2019ve outlined on previous earnings calls the second is a significant reserve valuation quarter for us. And as a result we\u2019ve reacted appropriately to any development indications identified during our in-depth review. Prior year reserve development in the quarter was a net favorable $84 million or 5.8 loss ratio points compared to a $119 million or 8 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2013.", "This reflects favorable development of $37 million in the insurance segment and $47 million in the reinsurance segment. Our operating expenses were higher than the prior year quarter due to the normal underlying expense growth as well as the impact of improved underwriting results on our variable compensation metrics and foreign exchange.", "As we\u2019ve indicated in the past we continue to expect that overall operating expense levels for 2014 will be modestly higher than 2013 approximately a mid single-digit increase excluding foreign exchange in variable compensation. As a reminder, the increased use of reinsurance will impact the reported operating expense ratio. As noted by Mike we completed the sale & retrocession of our European life reinsurance operations on May 30, to GreyCastle Holdings for $570 million in cash which resulted in an after tax U.S. GAAP net loss of approximately $620 million.", "The change in the reported loss from the estimate provided as of March 31, relates to the mark-to-market and FX impacts on the underlying asset portfolio and exposures between the time of signing and closing, which we indicated would be the case at the time we announced the transaction. The prospected accounting and disclosure requirements will add some complexity to our financial statements. Now we hope the example we provided last quarter as well as our summary consolidated financial data included in our press release will help in understanding those impacts.", "The way we think about this is that following the May 30, closing of the transaction and reflect no net underwriting results related to the retroceded business. The investment income and change in market value of the asset portfolio backing the seated liabilities is offset by an embedded derivative expense passing those economics onto GreyCastle with the resulting net impact on operating income and comprehensive income being zero.", "In the summarize income statement data included in the earnings release we have combined the various components further to show the net income contribution from the life retrocession agreements of $6.5 million for the month of June and it related will offsetting change in accumulated other comprehensive income of $6.5 million to try and make this point clear. It will across before the details to rather Form 10-Q explaining how the results of this business no longer impact the underlying performance of the company.", "Turning to the investment portfolio, the life retrocession transaction restricted on the funds withheld basis with the risks and rewards of the $5.7 billion of related funds withheld assets having been transfer to GreyCastle. Investment performance and net investment income generated by the life funds withheld assets since May 30, peaks with the derivative instrument created as part of the life retrocession agreement.", "Given that GreyCastle is now direct trading on those assets presumably to investment guidelines we\u2019ve agreed with them and all of the related economics exploded them. And we\u2019ll be excluding these assets from our investment commentary in this and future quarters. To clarify the XL managed assets now include P&C operations. The assets related to the outstanding structured product transactions and the remaining life assets.", "However, with that point made these funds withheld assets due continue to sit on our books, so we added new schedule throughout the financial supplement will be disclose a high level summary of the life funds withheld assets by sector, credit rating, currency and duration. Because we\u2019re 11 of the financial supplement details net investment income generated during the quarter and separates the life funds withheld assets for informational purposes. The asset details on schedules 2 through 10 now exclude the life funds withheld assets.", "Further to be above and focusing solely on the assets and which we do return the economics, I\u2019m sorry we do retain the economics. The investment portfolio return 1.9% for the quarter driven primarily by decreasing government rates in our major jurisdictions coupled with spread narrowing.", "Unrealized net gains in the portfolio were $1.2 billion at the end of the second quarter. The duration of our fixed income portfolio excluding the funds withheld assets, but including the remaining life assets was 3.6 years. To give you a basis for comparison the P&C component of the XL fixed income portfolio is essentially unchanged at 3.4 years. We still remain short duration relative to our benchmark.", "At $214 million net investment income on a portfolio excluding life funds withheld assets was $19 million below the same quarter last year. This variance was due to the life transaction with the investment income life funds withheld assets for the month of June it\u2019s now being separately reported. The gross book yield for the portfolio excluding the life funds withheld assets at the end of June was 2.7%.", "We still other GAAP between the yields on maturing assets and where we are reinvesting, which will keep downward pressure on net investment income. We estimate that approximately $3.1 billion of XL assets, excluding any funds withheld assets with an average gross book yield of 2.9% well mature in pay down over the next 12 months compared to the average new money rate in Q2 on the portfolio of 1.7%.", "Our investment in operating affiliates continued to produce strong results. Net income from investment affiliates was $18 million driven by structured credit strategies and emerging market funds down $29 million from an exceptional prior year quarter.", "The overall second quarter return on our alternative portfolio including the non-equity portion of 1.5%. We also had good earnings from our investment manager affiliates of $13 million. Net realized gains were $92 million in the quarter driven primarily by sales of equities this compared to net realized gains of $36 million in the second quarter of 2013.", "Our tax rate on net income is distorted somewhat due to the Life transaction on which we recorded a tax benefit of 6.7% of the pre-tax loss on sale. Taxes on operating income, an income for the quarter were approximately 12%. As Mike mentioned in his opening remarks an additional contributor to income in the quarter was a one of commutation of one of our remaining structured product transactions that resulted in a $28 million reduction in interest expense.", "And with respect to capital management we continue to execute on our share buyback program and during the second quarter we purchased $5.5 million shares for $175 million at an average price of $31.96 per share leaving approximately $718 million remaining available for purchase, under our previously announced share buyback program.", "As we noted in our first quarter call our intention as a result of the elimination of the risks associated with the transferred life business, is that our share buybacks for the year will be increased by as much as $300 million. We continue to view these buybacks as good use of capital for our shareholders and an efficient overall capital management tool.", "I will now turn it over to Greg to discuss our Insurance segment results.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Thanks, Pete, and good evening. Tonight, I'll cover the results for the segment provide some comments on our semi-annual reserve review. Give a brief update on talent and finished remarks on current market conditions.", "Beginning with the results, the Insurance segment produced a second quarter calendar year combined ratio of 93.8% or 5.8% bearing the same quarter last year driven largely by lower cat activity. This marks our sixth consecutive quarter of profitability. On an accident quarter basis excluding cat, our combined ratio of 96% improved by one full point. This year-over-year improvement was driven primarily by the accident quarter ex-cat loss ratio to 64.7% which was 0.8 points better than prior year.", "As we have previously discussed, our underlying portfolio continues to improve through our focus on expanding underwriting margins and reducing volatility, we believe this is evident in the fact that we have been better able to absorb large loss activity this quarter without adversely impacting results. Quite simply our underwriting actions and improved reinsurance volume are yielding results. The underwriting expense ratio was 31.3% in the second quarter, reflecting a 0.2 point improvement in the second quarter of last year. As mentioned last quarter, the shift towards quarter share treaties in certain business will distort the comparison of our acquisition ratio which improved by 3.1 points over the second quarter of last year in our operating expense ratio was deteriorated by 2.9 points.", "For 2014, this necessary look at the total underwriting expense ratio when comparing results to prior year. Let me give some contexts to increased sessions. For the quarter our exceeded premiums written increased from $423 million to $622 million. This was driven predominately by an increased use of quarter share reinsurance. Given as increased utilization as our reinsurance the first half of 2014 saw a ratio of exceeded premium to gross premium increase from 25% to 33%, with our July 1 renewals complete we expect roughly distortion rate for the remainder of 2014.", "Insurance gross premiums written grew by $125 million rate or 8.5 % in the quarter when adjusted for foreign exchange movement. All of our business groups had solid growth in the quarter. North American Property and Casualty premiums grew by over 7% with construction and excess casualty contributing the largest growth.", "On new leadership of Louise Dennerstahl our International Financial Lines of business contributed the growth of more than 8% in our global professional group. Our international property and casualty business grew by nearly 10% after adjusting for foreign exchange partially due to a new, large single limit multi-year account in our primary casualty book. And our specialty group was up over 9% reflecting strong growth in both of our political risk and crisis management businesses.", "While markets are increasingly competitive for many of our business, we continue to see, increased commission flow will remain a market of choice when clients are looking for help in solving their risk management needs. Shifting to loss reserves as Pete noted we completed our semi-annual reserve review in the quarter. Overall this resolved in a prior year reserve release of $37 million compared to $48 million in the second quarter last year.", "Releases in our aero space and marine books along with the favorable settlement in our discontinued pharmaceutical book were partially offset by straightening in our environmental and Lloyd\u2019s middle market portfolios. Our professional reserves, which experiences some strengthening in the fourth quarter of 2014, were unchanged as continued favorable class action loss activity was offset by unfavorable development of regulatory and M&A related claims.", "Moving on to talent we continue to enhance our teams throughout the segment. We recruited Kelly Lyles who will be joining as Chief Executive Global Professional replacing Bernard Horovitz will move into a new business development role.

I\u2019ve see this now slipped below loss trend several lines as markets particularly the shorter tail lines continue to deteriorate.

We leased $17 million of casualty reserves this quarter from the U.S. and international business groups, but continue to be very cautious on recent underwriting years.", "Finally, we had $18 million of deterioration on 2013 cat losses, the hailstorms in Germany and windstorm Christian, which dampened the overall release.

With respect to top line gross written premiums of the quarter were $493 million a 4.5% increase from the second quarter of 2013. The increases came from our North America and international business groups and resulted from timing differences additional crop premium in the U.S. increased Aviation premiums based on one new treaty and increased premium estimates on treaties written in prior years in Latin America.

On the international side we also saw a downward pricing pressure at mid-year renewals. Our Australian and U.K. business showed price reductions up 10% to 20%.", "Overall the cat market well under pressure remains on an actual and modeled basis a very profitable component of our global portfolio. We did increase our spend on retrocessional protections at mid-year. A significant capacity and attractive product options were available.

The first question is on the primary insurance. And looking at the accident year loss ratio and combined ratio ex-cat for the first six months of this year versus first six months of last year, and those numbers seem to be relatively flat. I would've thought that there would have been some improvement, given the re-underwriting of the business mix. So, if you could help us understand the future trajectory and why it hasn't happened a little sooner, that would be helpful. Thank you.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Sure, Vinay, its Greg. I think the biggest explanation for us to drill hole a bit down some of the large losses that I referred to in my opening remarks. On the property line of business we look at large losses has been losses larger than $10 million and so I am thrilled that you\u2019re using a longer data points in just the quarter. And so the first half of the year in this year, we\u2019ve observed $62 million of those losses in the six months.", "In the first half of last year that number was just actually was zero. And so there is about three points of large loss in the first half of this year relative to the zero, it\u2019s masking the underlying improvement. In fact, if I look when I just give you a little more color. If you look back in the second half of last year, we observed 4.7% of large losses in that half six month period.", "So, we go 1.6% better on large losses just first six months to the last six months. In our loss ratio is improved 3.3% from 67.4% to 64.1%. To trying to give you even a little more context went back to the first half of 2011, which was the last six months it looks exactly closing dollars to this six months. We had 4.2% of large losses and our accident year ex-cat loss ratio net six month period was 74%.", "So, we\u2019re full 10 points better with only half of point of that coming from improved, half of that by a large loss activity. So, we think there is a lot of good things to go underneath with built a book its better able to observe this loss activity. So, we don\u2019t see has been anything other than reinforcing point they were on the right path.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc", "So was this quarter's loss higher than average? Or was it plus the average?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "", "Yes, on the property counted this quarter\u2019s loss was higher. In the last 18 quarters we\u2019ve had three that have been $50 million of greater in this $10 million and above then we\u2019ve had nine would have been zero. So, it\u2019s a quite a wide \u2013 we have quite a wide distribution there and this was much higher than our normal expectation.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc", "Sure. And for this quarter, how many points in the combined ratio do you think it was? Higher than average? ", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "Excuse me a second Vinay.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc", "Sure. While you look for that number, can we just go on to the reinsurance side? So I was pleasantly surprised that the combined ratio was flat year-over-year, product accident year, ex-cat basis. So if you could explain that to us, given what we are hearing about pricing on the reinsurance?", "Michael S. McGavick", "Well, we don\u2019t have a consistent portfolio of business today.

Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.", "", "I'll give you some comfort that you're not alone. Everyone's having these large losses. And so I always certainly respect that. But the question I have sort of relates to it. It may just be serendipity, but if I go back five or 10 years ago, we were never talking about one-off quarters with large losses. Has the XL book or the industry's underwriting or the amount \u2013 or wave of people buying reinsurance, do you think anything's changed in the last decade that's giving us this problem? I mean, it's not just you guys. Everybody has it. And we've been listening about it for about three years now, with some quarters that are blessed that we don't have them, but many of them do. Do you have any thoughts on this?", "Michael S. McGavick", "", "Josh this is Mike, I\u2019ll start off and ask Greg or Jamie to add in, I would start with \u2013 and so certainly in my time in XL this has been a regular conversation. So I can\u2019t give you the 10 year perspective, I can tell you when they have happened as Greg mentioned those three in the last ten, five years as recorded that really had really excessive large losses we have commented on them.", "What was so pleasing to me about this quarter is that we were able to produce an overall loss ratio for the first half of the year that, we think is really a solid result and that we could do that well experiencing one of those quarters as a testament to the improved overall behavior of the XL book of that said I do note that many companies out there and we noticed this from a reinsurance perspective or holding more of their, increasing their attentions and holding more of their risk in that.", "And so I think that introduces additional volatility into their book and I notice several of my peers commented in their calls, as that they still think that the economic trade of the greater volatility is better than the cost of reinsurance, that maybe their view, but certainly we find that is always we managed our attritional book well then we are, we should be better able to absorb of these we\u2019re still producing good result which was exactly the effect we had this growth.", "So I am feeling pretty good about what this quarter demonstrates about the performance of our book so I do note that industry wide we have seen a lot of commentary around large losses in this particular quarter. Greg?", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "", "Joshua, I would say if XL specific 10 years ago we were not as big property player as we\u2019re today. So that\u2019s part of the reason you wouldn\u2019t have heard it from within the XL story. And to Mike\u2019s point we\u2019re actually heading the opposite direction, we\u2019re working hard to buy the right reinsurance to make sure reduce our volatility, we lowered our risk retention at this prior past renewal May 1, and we also bought a risk aggregate cover that will stop the pain of losses in kind of mid-range loss than if we encourage many of them over 12 month period. So, we\u2019re actually taking the opposite approach of taking more of that risk we\u2019re going to try and for at least the foreseeable future by down a little lower.", "Joshua D. Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.", "Okay. And on \u2013 you gave some color on the operating expense numbers.

McGavick", "Hey Josh, before moving on it just thought one of the thing back when the interest rates permitted a number of us including excel worked hard to shift our books to more short tail participation because we were very edgy about casualty rates, that could be another reason that you are seeing more spikiness and because more folks are trying to do write short-tail alliance. The same time in more recent as you know on the last year so we have actually seen some positive rate in the casualty lines making them better performer. So this is a shift back going on, but I just want I\u2019m sure that one of the thing I remembered a lot of the conference calls focused on that back three years or four years ago.", "Joshua D.

And so my first question is really on the insurance combined ratio. And if you look back, you're making some \u2013 a lot of improvements. But if you look at the average for the first half, that's still the full load \u2013 fully loaded combined ratio is still around 95%. If you want to achieve your 10% ROE, I believe you've got to get this segment into the low 90%, probably in the 90% to 92%. I just wonder how could you do that in a now more competitively pricing environment? Could you \u2013 I mean, Greg, talk about the business mix? Could you give a little more context to that?

McGavick", "", "Sure, I mean as we\u2019ve said before there a number of areas that we\u2019ve been working to improve that we think can keep us able to continue to improve the book even as these headwinds increased.", "First I would note that well rate has been deteriorating element it doesn\u2019t mean its across the board we\u2019re seeing pockets of solid rate still and as Greg said more than half of our premium and more and even more than half of our businesses are still in a positive rate relative to trend environment. So that\u2019s good for the \u2013 for that right at the same time between remixing into more profitable businesses between the new businesses that are now up and running and contributing our ability to lower some of our operating expenses over time through investments that we\u2019re harvesting.", "And we believe we can continue to expand our operating margins and continuing to nor they combine. And well \u2013 when you think about the explanation Greg just gave about the degree of large losses that we experienced well at the same time improving our last ratio by a point nearly eight tenths of a point in the period over the prior period.

So, let me speak about what wee see in the aggregate since the beginning of the year.

Hendrick", "", "Kai its Greg again. As far as with the aviation insurance market will do there\u2019s been some other commentary and clearly I agreed the war the specialist war market will move up dramatically and pricing, we would expect to see that by clearly in the more general airline market, but this has been our market that\u2019s been very competitive for a while.

Porrino", "Hi, Randy it\u2019s Peter. So, the $570 million approximately $300 million will be targeted as we talked about for share repurchases or the reminder of that would enter into the general investment portfolio. As I mentioned on the last quarter call, we would expect that to be basically the same risk and interest rates as we\u2019re seeing on total portfolio with the one caveat that\u2019s since we\u2019ll be back in specific liabilities you could see some more risk weighted assets in that, but not enough that would materially move the needle.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Okay. And then I guess the follow-up then is, so we see $175 million in buyback in each of the first two quarters, and so the $300 million you mentioned was on top of whatever the plan was before. So I guess it feels like that run rate needs to go higher to get to that $300 million higher buyback goal for the back half of the year.

Your observation is perfectly accurate as we talked about on the last quarter, we were under 10b5-1 plan for the second quarter of the year and so that was all put emotion before the sale of the life business and so.

And the last one then is, I'll try in the buffer to the buffer topic, but I believe that that was in place to defend against an externality from having the life runoff, which is now gone. So, what's the latest there? When would that potentially narrow to further facilitate capital return?", "Michael S. McGavick", "This is Mike, Randy. The 300 that is in addition these impart an effort to narrow that as a result of what we viewed as the life component of the risk. It is certainly not our goal to grow that buffer reduced to that repurchase action is desire to less net. I don\u2019t think we would very often run the company without any buffer to the buffer.

We had this kind of smoothly raising rate environment for a fairly brief period of time if I know means under the pricing decreases of the prior handful of years and if you step back and think about the business model the fact that those prices have not remained more resilient it\u2019s somewhat surprising even with the additional capital that\u2019s been focused on narrow places, in the reinsurance marketplace.

So, 15%, 20% down broadly in property cat. And you guys mentioned specific pressure on ceding commissions and other reinsurance lines. I was sort of wondering, I've never heard anybody calculate a number, but it would be really great to get some form of \u2013 or some view of like an all-in measure of changing per pricing per unit of risk for your other reinsurance lines, so we could kind of all have a yardstick to know what the pressure is that \u2013 it sort of sounds like it's still more focused on property cat. But as it broadens, and figure out how material that really is?", "Jamie H. Veghte", "", "So I would spend a little bit of time on that one Josh, but if you are asking what the impact on expected margins are on the proportional business that I mentioned, the pressure on commissions that would really depend on what line of business you\u2019re talking about right. Because even with interest rates low the investment income component of casually proportional business is a lot different than property. And that we are also largely also depend on how much capital to supporting the various costs of business. So, I would need to spend a little bit of time and may perhaps need some more specific guidance from you on which classes of business.", "Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.", "Oh, I'm not trying to be difficult. I guess I just \u2013 I'm just assuming you guys must have some internal way of talking about pricing pressure across other lines, where there just isn't the same approach. And you might \u2013 you can train us to ask the right questions so we can get the useful answer. But if you need to reflect on that, that's fine.", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "", "Well, I can tell you that we use pricing methodology on cat and non-cat that is called rate adequacy level. And the denominator in that calculation is rating agency capital and 100% rate adequacy depends on the line of business, but broadly 100% rate adequacy is about 20% on that. The overall rate adequacy in the portfolio is in the low-90s right now.", "Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.", "So if you were to just, from a really big picture simplistic way of saying, how much deterioration are you seeing in the broader lines outside of property cat? Or is this still really a property cat phenomenon? ", "Gregory S. Hendrick", "It\u2019s more on property that the impact on the property tax portfolio is more profound but frankly the rate adequacy level before we saw pricing pressure on property cat was much higher than our non-cat portfolio. The U.S. cat portfolio before we saw a lot of pricing pressure was well over 100%.", "Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.", "Right, okay. Great. Well, thank you guys for the time.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Ian Gutterman with Balyasny. You may ask your question.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management L.P.", "", "Hi, thanks. Most of my questions have been asked. I guess I want to maybe re-ask one from earlier just because I'm still a little unclear. On the trend in ceding, Greg, in your business, I think you said in your comments that the cession rate for this Q would be reflective of the second half?", "And I guess I just wanted to dive into that a little bit more. Because when I look at Q4 of last year and Q1 of this year, with the professionalized treaty, in effect, you see that close to 30% of your business, and this quarter, went up to 40%. And I guess I'm wondering why it should stay at 40%? Sort of what changed versus last two quarters. I thought we already had those treaties in place. ", "Peter R. Porrino", "Yes, So Ian, so I quoted the six months number which was 25% to 33%, all right there is a lot of individual moving parts in some time in the converted one quarter share and that is a loss. So in this quarter we drag out, we recorded our excess of loss reinsurance as return and seeded return all on the quarter when is incense. But I think that 30% to 33% rate that you just is the right way to look at it for our run rate. And in the quarter for last year it was just a professional fees that we incepted to spend some other changes along the way here that make that Q1, Q2 more reflective of the overall run rate.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management L.P.", "Got it, got it. Okay. Because it looked like \u2013 just flipping back between this quarter supplement and last quarter is that it wasn't just professional, let's say, cessions picked up significantly in both casualty and property versus Q1? ", "Peter R. Porrino", "", "That\u2019s correct. Yes, on the property piece that\u2019s more of \u2013 some of our ability to reduced volatility on our global business particularly where were at lead and then what shows up as faculty of our capital reinsurance seeded to our common shares. We decide in some risks we like, we like the client, we love the engineer and we\u2019re able to provider than the other risk services, but we don\u2019t like the net pricing end of the day. And so we\u2019ve reduced our net share nearby having a bigger growth share being see it out. Another casualty piece we think we were able to achieve some more efficiency by combining three programs in one and seeding more business into that one single quarter share North America.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management L.P.", "Got it. And within that casualties piece specifically, would a run rate for that also be sort of blended in the first two quarters? Or was Q2 more of the run rate now that there is these new \u2013 you've combined those treaties? ", "Peter R. Porrino", "On specifically casualty I want to get back to you, because I haven\u2019t done the math on that piece of it. So, let me come back to you.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management L.P.", "Fair enough. And then my last part on that topic is, should we expect benefit to the expense ratio going forward? I'm assuming you've probably got positive overrides on the nonprofessional things you reengineered? ", "Michael S. McGavick", "But, as I said in the top right we\u2019ve got that benefit on the acquisition ratio side and it\u2019s the operating expense ratio side. We\u2019re hopeful to achieving gains there, but as Mike noted and I would reiterate our investment in talent and technology has been the meaningful impact of why we turn things around and we\u2019re continue to invest in that so, it won\u2019t be straight linear, I guess with the over-riders and apply that, but we are still continue to invest in our people and our technology. ", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management L.P.", "Fair enough, fair enough. And if I can just ask one quick one on pricing. Just \u2013 is there any \u2013 obviously, you gave a lot of color on sort of my type of business. But is there any sort of difference in competitive pressures, whether it's large account versus midmarket account? Whether it's London versus Bermuda versus US? ", "Peter R. Porrino", "Sure, absolutely. So that the one if you just start with this International versus U.S., international is just more competitive than the U.S. marketplace. And certainly as I talked about in the past, we see a very big difference between in any given risks that\u2019s syndicated whether the primary layer and then excess structure above it. We see rate being achieved on the primary layer and then being back on the excess layer. In terms of and in that excess basis it just a lot of compensation right now with a lot of capital path. There isn\u2019t anything I see Bermuda London instead of the where your capital source of set that they are equally competitive.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management L.P.", "Got it. I think that\u2019s all I have. Thanks for the answers.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays. You can ask your question.", "Jay H Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.", "", "Thank you. I want to discuss the concept of operating net income. That's new, I believe, for XL. And one thing that I believe you are backing out is the $19 million of investment income to support the life retrocession agreement. That was about $0.09 a share, correct? ", "Peter R. Porrino", "That be about right it was $19 million so just this to be clarify the $19 million was one month\u2019s work of net investment income for the life funds with hell block of business. And since the deal closed on May 31, that would be what was separately in there.", "Jay H Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.", "", "Right. So you are backing that out of operating net income. Correct?", "Peter R. Porrino", "Yes.", "Jay H Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.", "", "Now \u2013 so that was one month's worth of investment income. That would be expected to persist, right? ", "Peter R. Porrino", "Yes absolutely.", "Jay H Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.", "Okay. So it's in net income. It's a recurring net investment income item but you are backing it out of operating? Do I have that right? ", "Peter R. Porrino", "It\u2019s being backed out through AOCI so it\u2019s yes it\u2019s out of operating income, right because it is no longer part of the ongoing economics to excel. Right so its in the top line but it get taken out but that derivative the promise I talked about that last time it\u2019s the derivative is in a different place and geographies and things like unrealized game are loss.", "", "Jay H Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.", "Okay. So, just from a modeling standpoint, that's helpful. So, can you talk about the recurring investment income from the P&C business? Was there anything else in there that was unusual or one-time? Or should we use that \u2013 I believe it was $213 million as a run rate? ", "Peter R. Porrino", "Yes, I think Jay the consistent what I just said I would probably referred you to that $214 million that you mention that and this is in the schedule 11 that I mentioned earlier and then was \u2013 and there would be two quarters growth of the net investment income on the life funds with all the assets.", "So for and got a little careful broad numbers like this, but the $214 million the takeaway two months work at the 19, so takeaway 38 that sort of from reward stroke will give some reasonable run rate now you need to change that for maturities coming out of the portfolio what I talked about the $3.1 billion coming out over the next year. Then really wasn\u2019t anything material in this quarter that would have move that net investment income versus an expected one now.", "Jay H Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.", "Okay. So the starting point is essentially $176 million, and there is the benefit of new cash flow but the offsetting \u2013 partially offsetting impact of reinvesting existing casual lower rates?", "Peter R. Porrino", "Exactly.", "Jay H Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from David Small with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.", "David Small \u2013 JPMorgan", "Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I have a question on the expense ratio. You mentioned earlier that you continue \u2013 you plan to continue investing. And I guess I'm just trying to figure out how much more investing do you have? And when do you think we should start to see the positive operating leverage coming out of the expense ratio? And I guess at this point, what are you still investing in? Is it more talent? Is it technology? Because I would have thought by this point, the level of investment spending might be coming down. Thanks.", "Peter R. Porrino", "Hey, David, it\u2019s Pete. So let\u2019s split it most of the new what we call it investment dollars or the new spend is on the \u2013 I am trying to remix the book of business. So it is mostly on the people side and entirely on the underwriting side of the business. The investments that we made in technology those are not going up. As a matter of fact they\u2019re flat but over the next couple of years we would expect that those would start to go down, a little bit so that we talk the investments and the reason why the underlying is even mid single digit is because we are still investing in the business.", "David Small \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question comes from Brian Meredith. You may ask your question.", "Brian R. Meredith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC", "Yes, thanks. So, Mike, this one's for you. You talk about uses of excess capital as far as growing your business I guess organically and through share buyback. Where does M&A fit into that, particularly given that we are heading into this softening market? And I guess if you're going to do any M&A, you probably want to do it fairly soon?", "Michael S. McGavick", "I\u2019ve always discussed the how we approach capital management as the several part exercise and the first thing we do of course, we look to what we are required the hold by meeting our rating agency and increasingly our regulatory requirements. Then we talk about a buffer that\u2019s appropriate to the risk profile the firm, the risk profile of firm have been declining. ", "So I think our effective management and as a result we have been talking about decreasing the buffer to some degree, but we then say if there money is in excess of that. First could we put it to work in a way that would improve our shareholders position, that\u2019s the first thing we think about, that includes the opportunities for growth as we\u2019ve been talking about, where we can find profitable opportunities to which to grow the business. And that would include examination of opportunities to buy as well as our daily effort to add teams into increase the underwriting potential to firm.", "So, we consider that along the journey and when we are done with that if we can put it into work in a way that we think is better for the shareholders, we attempt to return into the shareholders that\u2019s how we think about the process. So, we\u2019ve always said that identifying opportunities to create a better firm is one of our first thought process is after we determined how much capital is required for the firm.", "And we continue to do so as you know in the six now plus years, but this management team has been assembled, we\u2019ve only made one very small acquisition in the reinsurance the ag space, but that doesn\u2019t mean we haven\u2019t continue to examine opportunities and if ever see anything where, we think it will really improve the firm we would act on that.", "Brian R. Meredith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC", "Great, thank you.", "Peter R. Porrino", "", "You bet.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. At this time I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the speakers for closing remarks.", "Michael S. McGavick", "This is Mike, I just want to thank everybody for the time and attention. I know there is a number of companies that are come up tonight and you have very busy \u2013 be very busy long into the evening. So we appreciate there with spend sometime with us. I reiterate where I started we\u2019re very pleased with the way the year as started out.", "We feel like the things we\u2019ve been doing to improving the book are showing themselves and in particularly in the period where we\u2019ve had unusual number of large losses to still produce the kind of quality of result we did for the first half of the year it\u2019s truly heartening. And I think it reflects on the efforts we\u2019ve made de-risk the book and to be better able to observe our volatility.", "We don\u2019t think the job is done well, we think we can continue to build the better firm and we are driven produced to everyday.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "David Radulski", "Thank you, Shirley. Welcome to XL Group's third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. This call is being simultaneously webcast on XL's website at www.xlgroup.com. We posted to our website several documents, including our press release and quarterly financial supplement.", "And first we apologize for the technical glitch that resulted in our release coming out later than usual and we will work to avoid that recurring.", "Now on our call tonight, you're going to hear from Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, who\u2019ll offer opening remarks; Pete Porrino, XL's Chief Financial Officer, who'll review our financial results; followed by Greg Hendrick, our Chief Executive of Insurance Operations; and Jamie Veghte, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations, who will review their segment results and market conditions.

Tonight, we are pleased to discuss the third quarter in which we produced solid across the board results and continued a strong year for XL.", "Total P&C underwriting profit for the quarter was $144 million, $67 million greater than the prior year quarter. This was driven by better year-over-year P&C combined ratio of 90.1% and a loss ratio of 59.1%, which is really six points better than the third quarter of 2013.", "From a year-to-date view, the majority of our core metrics including gross written premium, our calendar combined ratio and loss ratio are also all better than the same period a year ago.", "While we, like the majority of the industry benefited from a relatively quiet CAT quarter, the primary driver of these results were the continuing improvement of our businesses and the cementing of our re-underwriting and remixing actions.", "For example, our Insurance segment produced $54 million in underwriting profit in the quarter and an accident ex-CAT combined ratio of 94.8% which is $42 million and three points better respectively than the prior year quarter.", "Greg will get further into the reinsurance results, but as our work continues, I\u2019ll say that we are pleased with the progress across the segment. Our business leaders are taking the necessary action to achieve their targets and to fight in a tough rate environment. Even when that retranslates into maintaining discipline on pricing, they are not chasing the markets down in search of top-line.", "Reinsurance contributed another strong quarter with an underwriting profit of $90 million and a combined ratio of 79.2%. These results were $25 million and six points better than the prior year quarter on lower gross written premium which goes to show the quality of our reinsurance book and the talent of our underwriters.", "Jamie will have more on this segment and the reinsurance market, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be skewing this under or surprising you when I say that the tough conversations on price terms and conditions in the reinsurance markets continue.", "But here too, we like our disciplined approach in when it means opting not to renew a line or being unwilling to follow terms refined unacceptable for the market and for our business.", "And while we see the market remaining competitive for the foreseeable future, we are confident in our unique ways to continue our improvement and find our advantage. As we\u2019ve discussed, rate is only one lever we can pull, our underwriting actions are a constant for us and we continue to examine and reexamine our progress even when we like we are seeing there is more we can do same with remixing this too is a work in progress.", "And in this next phase of competition, we see expense management and the ability to gain leverage from the prior strategic investments we\u2019ve made as being increasingly important.", "Back to reinsurance for just a moment. We made a recent announcement of course that Jamie Veghte will be retiring at the end of this year. This will make this the last earnings call in which he will participate.", "Now there has been a lot said about Jamie and the great results that he has produced over time and many of the people on this call have sent their kind regards which all I know are appreciated. But I just want to say the obvious.", "There is no one who touch his excel whether a client or colleague, a shareholder or just a friend of the company that doesn\u2019t know how important Jamie has been to all of us and each of us on this call and certainly knew personally are going to deeply miss working with Jamie.", "The good news is, we made that announcement in order to make sure that Jamie got a good farewell circuit in this tough renewal season. I think it\u2019s been crucial to our team that we have a nice stable reinsurance renewal season and then Jamie has his plan will leave his direct employment role at the end of the year. But I want to just extend our heartfelt thanks and congratulations to Jamie for the extraordinary run he has with us at XL and all he does as a friend.", "With that, Pete?", "Peter Porrino", "Thanks, Mike and good evening. Operating income for the third quarter was $187 million or $0.70 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to $155 million in 2013 or $0.53 per share. Our net income attributable to ordinary shareholders was $72 million or $0.27 per share on a fully diluted basis.", "Our net income attributable to ordinary shareholders excluding the impact of life purchase arrangement was $223 million for the quarter or $0.83 per share on a fully diluted basis.", "I am going to come back to a discussion about the life transactions\u2019 impact on net income at the end of my remarks because while we have explained this in theory before, it is now present in the full quarter\u2019s numbers for the first time and I want to make sure that everything is clear. But first, to our financial results.", "Our P&C combined ratio of 90.1% for the quarter was an improvement of 4.9 points versus the same quarter last year, while our accident year combined ratio was 92.5% better by 7.6 points. This improvement in our accident year combined ratio was driven by improvements in both our catastrophe loss experience and our underlying ex-catastrophe experience in both insurance and reinsurance including a reinstatement adjustment in reinsurance.", "This adjustment relates to reinstatement premiums associated with prior year non-catastrophe case reserves and our international reinsurance business that have not yet been recorded. The net of tax impact of the adjustment was approximately $20 million, the majority of which relates to cash reserves from previous years. This represents approximately three points of the reinsurance loss ratio and one point for our overall loss ratio.", "As we\u2019ve outlined on previous calls, the third quarter is what we refer to as an actual versus expected quarter for our entire insurance segment in our US reinsurance business. Prior year reserve development in the quarter was a net favorable $35 million or 2.4 loss ratio points compared to $79 million or 5.1 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2013.", "This reflects favorable development of $20 million and $15 million in the insurance and reinsurance segments. Jamie will discuss prior year development for reinsurance in a few minutes. As we\u2019ve indicated in the past, we continue to expect that overall operating expense levels unadjusted for foreign exchange and performance-based compensation for 2014 will be modestly higher than 2013 at mid single-digit growth levels.", "Excluding the negative impact of these two items on the quarter, our operating expenses grew by approximately 4% in the quarter compared to last year. We continue to be highly focused on balancing cost efficiency with continued investments in both infrastructure and insurance underwriting teams.", "Our increased use of reinsurance cede will continue to impact the reported operating expense ratio as ceding commissions which cover all expenses are reported on the acquisition expense line.", "Turning to the XL investment portfolio and similar to our second quarter focusing only on the assets which XL does retain the economics, the investment portfolio returned 0.5% for the quarter and 4.3% year-to-date.", "Unrealized net gains in the retained portfolio were $1.03 billion at the end of the third quarter. The duration of our fixed income portfolio increased by 0.2 years to 3.8 years which still remains short duration relative to our benchmark. At $170 million net investment income on the portfolio excluding the life funds withheld assets was $68 million below the same quarter last year primarily due to the life transaction which contributed $56 million of this reduction.", "The gross book yield of the portfolio at the end of September was 2.7%. We still have a gap between the yields on maturing assets and where we are reinvesting which will keep downward pressure on net investment income. We estimate that approximately $3 billion of assets with an average gross book yield of 2.9% will mature and pay down over the next 12 months compared to the average new money rate in Q3 on the portfolio of 1.9%.", "Our investment and operating affiliates continue to produce strong results for the XL portfolio.", "Net income from investment affiliates in was $25 million, up $20 million from the prior year quarter with solid performance across the majority of our strategies particularly private investments. We also had good earnings from our investment manager affiliates of $16 million.", "Net realized gains were $10 million in the quarter driven primarily by sales of equities. This compares to net realized losses of $2 million in third quarter of 2013. When combined with the negative movement in unrealized gains and losses of $119 million and \u2013 gains of $5 million, we ended the quarter with a negative mark-to-market of $104 million on our portfolio excluding the life funds withheld assets.", "On a tax related note, you may have heard that the Irish government announced to intend to abolish the so-called double Irish tax strategy by treating companies incorporated in Ireland as tax resident of Ireland.", "This change, if it goes through will have no impact on XL because all of our companies incorporate in Ireland are already Irish tax residents. And a positive side-effect of this review is that the Irish government also announced it is fully committed to its current 12.5% corporate tax rate.", "With respect to capital management, during the quarter, we repaid at maturity, our $600 million 5.25% senior notes, which you will recall, we have pre-funded with five year and third year debt issued in November of 2013.", "We continue to execute on our share buyback program at the higher level noted during our core following the life transaction. During the third quarter, we purchased 8.2 million shares for $275 million at an average price of $33.35 per share for a total $625 million year-to-date.", "That leaves $443 million available for purchase under our previously announced share buyback program. We continue to view these buybacks as an efficient capital management too.", "Now back to the life purchase session discussion. As we discussed in our April and July calls, regarding the life reinsurance transaction we completed in May, our net income numbers will be impacted by the mark-to-market movement of the derivatives that transfers the economics of the assets backing that transaction.", "This quarter is a good illustration of how we previously indicated accounting implications would occur, so let me walk you through what is happening. First, please remember that the vast majority of our life funds withheld assets are invested in European assets and while our US interest rates generally increase during the third quarter, European interest rates generally declined resulting an unrealized gains arising on that portion of the portfolio.", "The increase in unrealized gains resulted in a derivative loss that lowered our net income attributable to ordinary shareholders, but that derivative movement is offset by investment income, realized gains and losses and the change in the unrealized position of our portfolio and does impact our net book value operating income or comprehensive income. We show that relationship in the summary consolidated financial data included with the press release.", "And I\u2019ll now turn it over to Greg to discuss our insurance segment results.", "Gregory Hendrick", "Thanks, Pete and good evening. Today, I'll cover the results for the segment, provide insight on our continued progress and finish with the remarks on current market conditions.", "Starting with the results, the third quarter marked our seventh consecutive quarter of profitability with the segment producing a calendar year combined ratio of 94.7% compared to 98.8% in the same quarter last year. This year-over-year improvement was driven primarily by the accident quarter ex CAT loss ratio of 64%, which was four points better than prior year.", "And the same loss ratio improved by 1.5 points on a year-to-date basis. We believe our continued improvement in performance is evident the fact that we have once again been able to absorb medium and large loss activity in the quarter with a lower impact in our results relative to prior year.", "Remainder of the calendar year improvement results from a 1.7 point increase in favorable prior year development driven by releases in short-term lines and was partially offset by CAT losses that were 0.4 worse than the prior year quarter. The underwriting expense ratio is 30.9% in the third quarter, reflecting a deterioration of 1.1 points from the third quarter last year mainly due to continued investment in certain businesses.", "As mentioned previously, the actions we have taken to shift towards quota share in a number of our businesses has restored the comparison of our acquisition and expense ratio to prior year. These quota shares have increased in commission income improving our acquisition ratio by three points would have lowered net earned premiums partly contributing to a 4.1 point higher operating expense ratio.", "It is worth noting that for the three main businesses where we increased our quota share usage, we have seen an improvement of over 4% in our underwriting expense ratio. Overall, we continue to focus on improving operating leverage and actions are underway to ensure the total underwriting expense ratio reflects this ongoing improvement.", "Insurance gross premiums written grew by $57 million or 4.5% in the quarter when adjusted for foreign exchange movement. North America property and casualty premiums grew by 13% with construction and excess casualty contributing the largest growth.", "Our specialty group was up over 11% reflecting strong growth from new teams in both our marine and crisis management businesses. Professional lines were flat for the quarter with growth in our cyber and design books offset by the timing of a large renewal in our international financial lines book.", "And our international P&C business was down almost 9% resulting from underwriting changes due to underperformance in our energy and Lloyd's middle market books. While markets are increasingly competitive for many of our businesses, we continue to see increased submission for and a higher default ratio as we continue to have positive momentum in the large commercial marketplace.", "Shifting to our ongoing progress, using results for the trailing 12 months, we experienced a 1.3 point improvement in our accident year ex CAT loss ratio relative to the prior 12 months period despite experiencing a higher level of large losses in the more recent 12 months.", "This improvement is a result of our focus on an improved mix of business and the underwriting actions that we have taken. Our mix of business continues to improve as we shift our portfolio to more profitable lines.", "On a year-to-date basis, nearly 60% of our gross premium is better than or within 5% of our target combined ratio. And our underwriting actions continue to contribute as we have delivered roughly two loss ratio points of improvement over the past two years and have identified additional actions for the fourth quarter and into 2015.", "And our talent continues to get stronger as well. This quarter, we appointed Dave Schmitz to lead our Global Property Risk Engineering team. We added Michael LaRocca as its Chief Underwriting Officer in its North America Property business and Anthony Vidovich as General Counsel for our Claims operation.", "In addition to these new appointments, we also strengthened our crisis management team in Asia, increased our financial lines and surety capabilities in Latin America and expanded our trade receivable insurance team with appointments in London, Baltimore and New York.", "For the quarter, we increased our underwriting force by another 17 positions as we continue to invest in our businesses.", "Turning to market conditions, we saw a continued slowing in rate across more lines of business as the overall rate increase for the segment was flat in the quarter and positive by 1% on a year-to-date basis.", "That said, two-thirds of our businesses are still showing positive rate for the year. In the quarter, our international property and casualty and global professional businesses achieved rate in the 1% range adversely impacted by property and high excess D&O business respectively.", "Our North American businesses were flat in the third quarter driven by a 4% reduction in property offset by a 7% increase in our environmental business. And our specialty business continues to be most severely impacted with an overall rate decrease of 2.5 points largely reflecting a competitive aviation marketplace.", "As fourth quarter renewals begin, our aviation business is now driving positive rate movement due to recent market loss activity.", "Finally, while we once again benefited from a relatively quiet catastrophe quarter, we are pleased with the continued improvements we see in our accident year results excluding CAT. But we are not satisfied. There is still room for further improvement and we remain confident with our ongoing growth in higher margin businesses and our continuous underwriting actions across all businesses will allow us to achieve our profitability targets.", "On a personal note, I am honored to turn the call over one last time to my friend and colleague of 25 years. Jamie?", "Jamie Veghte", "Thanks, Greg and good evening. The reinsurance segment had an excellent quarter of underwriting results with a combined ratio of 79.2% and a resulting underwriting profit of $90 million. This compares to a combined ratio of 85.4% in the third quarter of 2013.", "Excluding the impact of prior year releases our combined ratio in the quarter was 82.7%. This result compares favorably with the 102.4% achieved in Q3 of 2013 a quarter that was significantly impacted by catastrophe activity, most notably the German hailstorms that contributed $43 million of third quarter losses last year.", "With respect to the reserve releases, you will note the $15 million derived in this quarter was substantially below what we enjoyed in the third quarter of 2013. We had the development of a large marine energy claim YME Energy which contributed $11 million. This compares to a favorable development of $12 million on cost to Concordia reflected in Q3 last year due to the trigger of retrocessional recovery.", "In addition, in 2013, we had reserve reductions on prior year CAT losses of $25 million, a full $17 million larger than the release from this source in the third quarter of this year.", "Broadly, we remain very comfortable with our reserve position and due to the reduction in our release, that\u2019s principally a series of one-offs.", "Turning to top-line. Gross written premiums in the quarter were $276 million, a 21% reduction from the $350 million written in the third quarter of 2013. The main drivers of this reduction were from our North American business unit, there we had $44 million of share reductions and cancellations largely in casualty treaty as well as $24 million of timing differences and premium adjustments.", "Our international operations included reductions of $25 million primarily from our Latin American operations due to the cancellations and reduced shares. This was largely offset by the impact of premium adjustments including an additional reinstatement premiums from prior year non-catastrophe losses. Our Bermuda business unit was generally in line with last year.", "On a year-to-date basis, the segment has generated a combined ratio of 77.1% which compares favorably to the 80.1% achieved in 2013. Excluding the impact of prior year releases, our combined ratio was 84.3% which compares favorably to the 92.9% generated a year ago with the improvement driven by a lower level of catastrophe activity this year.", "With respect to top-line, our year-to-date gross written premium is $1.6 billion, 5.9% below 2000 year-to-date. For the full year, our Bermuda operation was up 4% with the major reductions coming from North America and international operations which were driven by competitive market conditions, cancellations, share reductions and client retention.", "Things we have discussed regularly over the course of the last few years. Operationally, we have pointed continued progress with Chris McKeown and his team at New Ocean Capital Management. Chris continues to build out his infrastructure with the hiring of a Chief Operating Officer this quarter and he is attracting third-party capital including the signing of a distribution agreement with a global financial institution.", "Finally, a brief word on market conditions. Other than the mid-year CAT renewals which were clearly very competitive, the third quarter is fairly quiet from a renewal perspective. I commented at length in our second quarter call on the CAT market, so I\u2019d like to look towards the year end renewals.", "As Mike mentioned, I am nearing the end of my term at XL, but look forward to one last renewal season. I\u2019ve always viewed predicting year end trading condition as a bit of a full variant. This is a heavily syndicated market and forecasting its behavior with precision is extremely challenging.", "Nevertheless, I look forward to this renewal for two reasons. First, the emphasis of the recent Monte Carlo and Baden Conferences pointed toward a reasonably orderly renewal season would perhaps left pressure on rates than we\u2019ve seen over the recent renewals.", "A major theme was the desire of many clients to consolidate their reinsurance pattern over the tighter group of major trading partners. Given our global footprint, multi-line capabilities and long-term relationships, we are ideally situated for such an environment.", "In addition, I have supreme confidence in our underwriting team\u2019s ability to navigate its way through the harshest of trading conditions. Their track record over a long period of time is proof of this and I am really looking forward to working closely with them at this yearend. I have no doubt they will perform superbly whatever trading conditions we face.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it to David for Q&A.", "David R. Radulski", "", "Thank you, Jamie and Shirley, can you please open the line for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Kai pan with Morgan Stanley with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.", "Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Thank you and good evening. First question regarding to the insurance underwriting, the 300 basis point improvements year-over-year and how much of that is sort of contributable to lower level of large non-CAT losses which was present in the prior quarter? And also going forward, if the current pricing environment persists or even getting more competitive, what\u2019s your confidence of \u2013 or to show continued improvements in the insurance segment?", "Gregory Hendrick", "Sure, thanks Kai. It\u2019s Greg. On the first part and if we look at the short tail non-CAT large losses, they were roughly the same dollar amount, one loss for about just over $20 million in each of the third quarter of last year and the third quarter of this year.", "Moreover, we look at losses, we tranche them up in the affidavit levels. So we use our short tail large being $10 million or greater. As I said in my remarks, we had some medium as well where we are little bit heavier this quarter than last quarter, but in the aggregate the non-CAT losses quarter-over-quarter are roughly the same. So the improvement is really coming from the other views of the book and better profitability embedded across the remainder of the portfolio.", "In terms of your second question, the current pricing environment, no doubt about it, we\u2019ve talked about long about the four levers we pull on underwriting actions, rate, mix of business, reinsurance efficiency and so, no doubt. The rate is becoming a little more difficult.", "It\u2019s not a tailwind or at back as I noted, there is still little bit of positive left in the book but on an aggregate basis, but not much and I just as an aside, observed what I observed in the past which is for short tail lines, we are seeing rates go down a little more, longer tail lines rates are going up slightly.", "Whenever you are in excess market, so you have a layered syndication, excess price is going down and primary pricing is going up. So those dynamics remain the same. We still have those levers and we are working them on. I noted that the underwriting actions we have a point each year over the last three years in the hard work of getting better of how we underwrite each of our portfolios.", "We are mixing our business better and better each time. We are investing in people to grow those higher margin businesses as fast as we prudently can. So, I am still confident we are on the right path. No doubt about the rate as that the headwind will make the timing of that a little bit longer than we would have hoped originally.", "Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Thanks for that. Then the second question on expense ratio, it looks like you keep building the teams here adding some team positions, and at the same time, the market environment is becoming more competitive. I just wonder what the rational in this environment to try to grow your team and what\u2019s the outlook for the expense ratio going forward?", "Michael McGavick", "Hi, Kai, this is Mike. I\u2019ll start off and Pete and Greg may want to throw in. The bottom-line is there are still places in our product suite where we are very pleased with our profitability and want to take more of it into the book. That\u2019s a key part to the remixing in which we are engaged and that is achieved by adding people and teams across key positions around the world.", "Greg mentioned specifically for example, expanding our presence in crisis management in Asia during the course of the quarter or expanding our financial lines and surety operations than Latin America. Those are both very positive businesses for us and any expense we are undertaking there should be repaid very handsomely, very quickly in terms of the improvement in profitability through the remixing of the book.", "So I would continue to make those kinds of investments all the time. You heard Pete say in his commentary, that expenses on quarter-over-quarter were up 4%. That\u2019s actually on the lower end of the range we\u2019ve been forecasting for the year and that\u2019s because we\u2019ve already taken note of the fact that things are getting more difficult out there and are already beginning where we are not gaining profitable business as Greg has described to pool in some of our activity.", "So we are already at it, we are not saying that\u2019s a coming thing. We are already managing to the more difficult environment or experiencing. And finally, of course, we are coming to budget season right now and I am quite sure it won\u2019t come as a surprise to my colleagues who are listening.", "We have sent out a message as people are working through their budgeting pricing that this is the time in the market we are going to be extraordinarily conscious of every penny we spend. And we are going to have to start harvesting some of the investments we have made to deliver a more efficient platform.", "Just given where these markets are going that\u2019s what we are going to have to do. I know that\u2019s kind of straight out of the soft cycle playbook, but we don\u2019t quite think of it that way.", "This could be forever, we don\u2019t know. We have to be prepared to continue to drive toward the goals we\u2019ve set for ourselves and the expense lever becomes more important and frankly so does remixing as we get into this more difficult pricing environment. So I am very pleased with the approach of the team, the attitude of the team the things we are already starting to do and what I believe we can do into the future.", "Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Thanks so much for all the answers.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.", "Mike Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thanks. Just one question, I guess, Jamie in the reinsurance segment, can you talk a little bit more of the year-over-year on the underlying whatever it\u2019s the severe loss math or something in that region, just trying to figure out if you want to adjust for differences year-over-year or normalize \u2013 what was the margin trend in that book? Thanks.", "Jamie Veghte", "Well, I am assuming you mean, normalized by excluding prior year releases and CAT losses\u2026", "Mike Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Yes, so that was five, yes?", "Jamie Veghte", "The improvement went from 55.8 to 48.9. The major components of it were the reinstatement premium adjustments that Pete alluded in his opening remarks about three points lower level of non-CAT large losses about 0.5 and then better attrition loss ratio in our property proportional and risk XL book.", "Mike Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it. Okay, and that makes out the difference. Okay, thank you. And then, would it be possible maybe to talk through, Greg, maybe a little bit more on the impact of the shift towards pro rata on the expense ratio in the insurance segment?", "Just trying to make sure, something we got some headcount increases but also this dynamic. Just trying to understand how we should be thinking about that and if the current mix of business is the right baseline to start from? Thanks.", "Gregory Hendrick", "Sure, the pro rata treaties are predominantly in our professional and casualty protections. We are still seeing some of the change we have made during the course of this year play through. So there could be a little more shift, but the overall session ratio that we\u2019ve been observing should \u2013 you\u2019ve been observing the last couple of quarters should hold steady for the insurance segment.", "At the moment, it\u2019s always \u2013 you are always evaluating this and using all the levers you have to pull to see if you can improve your book either on the frontline on the gross basis on whether you can do that on a net basis as well. At the moment, I don\u2019t foresee anything that major shift coming. We\u2019ve been hard at this work to get more efficient on reinsurance over the last 12, 18 months.", "So we will see the rest of that play through. That helps a little bit where it is professional and casualty the biggest areas and then we are getting out of rate of session that we should see hold pretty steady.", "Mike Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it. Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays. You may ask you question.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Good afternoon and Jamie, congratulations on the announcement of your retirement.", "Jamie Veghte", "", "Thank you, Jay.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "The thing I just want to \u2013 not for much longer, can you give us a perspective on whether that year-to-date premium volume slight decline is a better indicator what you view as the run rate of growth in the reinsurance business?", "Jamie Veghte", "Yes, I think so. That\u2019s a very good point. As I\u2019ve said to you all over the years, reinsurance by nature is a lumpy activity and that we are not in a daily trading business. We have three or four very large renewal days each year and so you can show anomalies in quarter-to-quarter increases or drops in your top-line.", "So, I think you are absolutely correct to look on an year-to-date basis would suggest \u2013 I think the 5.6% decline year-on-year and I think that\u2019s reflective of both the market conditions that Mike referenced and our underwriting philosophy.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "And then separately for Greg, the underlying insurance segment combined ratio has been oscillating right around that mid 90%, 95% range year-to-date. What\u2019s your level of confidence that that could continue to improve over the next year or so?", "Gregory Hendrick", "Yes, as I said earlier, Jay, I am confident we can continue to improve that number. We talked earlier about the rate being not to help it had been, being a bit of a neutral. I think I said headwind, it\u2019s actually still slightly positive, but, not keeping up with trend. We still got those other activities that we can pull on.", "The underwriting actions, the mix of the portfolio, the analytics of bringing the bear and so we have a lot of other areas to work at. I think if we look at the progression we\u2019ve been on from a 104 in 2011 to 98.5 in 2012. The 96.7 in 2013 and to 94.8 in nine months this year. Now we are on the right path, it\u2019s just going to probably be a little slower as we go here both because of where the market is and it always the last few yards of a hardest ones to dig out, so.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "It\u2019s helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask you question.", "Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Hi, good evening. Thank you, thanks for taking the call. So, Greg, congratulations on a good quarter. Actually something you said in your prepared remarks, I wonder maybe I either missed out or just was a little bit surprised. So maybe, if you could clarify a bit, something you said was something on the lines of \u2013 I think 60% of your premium is better or worse than \u2013 is better I guess than 5% below target or above.", "But I think that would imply something like 40% of your businesses is more than 5% worse than its target. And I just thought maybe you could if that is right, sort of walk us through what challenges \u2013 what businesses those are, what challenges those businesses are still facing and what the plans are? Or if I am wrong, maybe you can set me straight, thank you.", "Gregory Hendrick", "Sure, Josh, no, you heard right, Josh. We have a process as you look from the top down and how much capital you allocate to each business, each one is different target combined ratio and indeed 60% of our book on a premium basis is in that category of either better than what we are targeting as our combine ratio to make our return or within five combined ratio points of that target.", "So, either they are close. The remaining 40% I am not going to drill every business. We did that a few years ago. You are always going to have a certain percent of the book in that category. Somewhere in that 10% to 20% range. You are not ever going to go through any period up or down in the cycle to not going to have something struggling.", "But we are working through, if I think of one that we talked about during the call, our marine book, we brought in Lea Merrick about 18 months ago and embarked on a strategy to improve the performance of that book from where it\u2019s been. We\u2019ve identified cargo as an area where we struggle being too European-centric, we are pulling back the right things there.", "We\u2019ve added new teams hence this ties this investment conversation we\u2019ve been having why we believe to get it more global book and as those teams get up and running and that business comes online we should be in a better performing basis. So, there is not a whole business in any of that 40%. It\u2019s now chunks of certain portfolios that we manage that are in that grouping.", "Also the last piece I\u2019d add is, all the business that we are building out, crisis management, political risk, business surety., in marine, all of those are in growth mode and so they are in their first three years, so by definition all four of those are going to be in that bucket of not yet performing on target.", "Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Well, that\u2019s interesting. So that\u2019s not just sort of, I mean, I don\u2019t want to use the word challenge businesses, but I mean, so it\u2019s not just underperforming businesses, some of them are just immature.", "Gregory Hendrick", "That\u2019s absolutely right.", "Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Is that your conclusion? And so, overall, over the next couple of years, you guys have looked for that number presumably to decline now and that drags most of your improvement?", "Gregory Hendrick", "Absolutely.", "Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. Cool, if I can just think one more and Mike, really big picture. You guys let a news around sort of the alternative capital space here. You mentioned the soft market playbook somebody else talked about New Ocean or Jamie did I think, I apologize.", "The question is, when you think about the various approaches to using alternative capital whether it\u2019s figuring out and people to partner with sort of create captive reinsurers and things like that, or just sort of being a more aggressive buyer of reinsurance in the open market, how are you guys thinking about the relative pros and cons and sort of the different approaches that you can see people all across the board is starting to take? Thank you.", "Michael McGavick", "", "Yes, thanks for the question. Couple of things. Number one, I\u2019ve been of the view for sometime and I know there are other sorts, this is, well, uncomfortable, this is positive, in fact very positive.", "And in putting in simple, simple term, I always want to be in a space that is more attractive to capital them less and certainly seeing these new forms of capital coming into our sector while have short-term difficulties in the long run this is good news and this provides us more capital to solve more of the world\u2019s problems and that\u2019s our job.", "So, I really like it. Exactly how to apply it is the great question it comes in a number of ways, one is you notice, we are ceding more than we were in the past. We are doing it not only because of what\u2019s going on in the reinsurance marketplace and because of what alternative capital is already doing in that marketplace, but also because we have re-thought how to create greater stability in terms of our earnings all the time.", "So we have been doing, I think a better job and a more strategic job of buying reinsurance that\u2019s partly influenced by what\u2019s going on in the pricing environment, partly influenced what\u2019s going on in search of capital. So that is one place where we are conscious. The second thing that we consider all the time is whether or not in every case, it has to be XL\u2019s capital that goes to the client\u2019s solution.", "We haven\u2019t done anything dramatic in this space, but we spend a lot of time thinking about it because in the end, if our underwriting powers can determine a solution for a client that is made better by using capital other than our own, we should do it. We have to be open to that because ultimately, if you are solving the clients\u2019 problem that\u2019s where we are in business and that\u2019s where we are well paid for our activities. So we are looking at a variety of models for how to achieve that.", "One, we\u2019ve already shown the market through New Ocean. But, I can assure you there has been a long range of people coming by with ideas, we have had a few that originated here as well, and as things evolve of course, we will announce them. I do want to note though there has been one change in how that market is behaving that I think is very important.", "And I think this speaks to the importance and centrality of underwriting in what will come. When this started out, this was all about those who gather assets and they were calling all the shots. They were designing basically fit for purpose things for themselves and not really for solving clients\u2019 problems so much. My view is different.", "As we\u2019ve seen conversations evolve, especially last month, six months or so, the people coming to us are no longer saying, hey we\u2019ve got a big bunch of assets and we are good at this. You just go off and don\u2019t lose too much money on that underwriting stuff and we\u2019ll make a bunch of money which was kind of how the first conversations went.", "To where now, we are realizing, we have to be able to gather together pools of risk in an effective way and then match that to a solid asset gathering strategy. That\u2019s a more balanced partnership, a more reasonable and sustainable way to solve clients\u2019 problems and we happen to be pretty good around here at creating profitable portfolios of the kinds of risks with characteristics that match well for the goals and the characteristics of some of these asset managers.", "So, I am very optimistic that by being thoughtful about how to go forward and being the kind of underwriter we are, that the world is coming that one that plays right into the hands of a global carrier with a complex risk profile and the selfless attitude about how do cite client problems and not just how to throw their own balance sheet around. So I like the world that\u2019s coming and I think we are poised for.", "But that\u2019s kind of how I see that all playing out. It\u2019s going to show up in lots of ways across the entire place and every one of us has to be open to and thoughtful about how we can creative and enable that capital to come in and solve client problems. One last thought, sorry.", "And we shouldn\u2019t just focus on the problems we are solving today. Every time there is a difference between economic loss and insured loss, we should track subtract a little b it for retention to make sure the risks are aligned and then we can say the rest of it is a problem insurance could be solving, why aren\u2019t we.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Vinay Misquith with Evercore. You may ask you question.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Hi, good evening. So the improvement in the primary insurance combined ratio, just curious how much more is left in terms of the re-underwriting of the business because you\u2019ve been at it for a while and where would you say you are in the process of remixing the business right now?", "Peter Porrino", "So, Vinay, on the first part, the underwriting actions is a continuous and never ending process. You are always working through your book to sort through and find how you can improve it and underwrite it better. That\u2019s what I call of additional underwriting site, so you are guiding the book by industry, by geography, whether it\u2019s in the actuarial pricing side or whether it\u2019s in the predictive.", "We are bringing all three to bear on that problem to get better and better. We are \u2013 on the second part, where are we in that remixing, we are more \u2013 so we are there more than further close to where we want to be, but the new business that\u2019s coming online still have a long way to come up to get up on plan there. Some of them are already in this \u2013 they are six months, one year, 18 months period.", "So, really it takes three years for those books to get up and going and so, I\u2019d say in the activities of the core book were there but in those, particularly those new businesses we believe are really going to have a lot of lift, we\u2019ve got more runway to go.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And on the reinsurance side, I mean, we\u2019ve seen margins there hold up pretty well relative to last year, are we seeing prices sort of coming down. Would remixing of that book, so for example, I think this quarter, some casualty quota share treaties were not renewed. So do you think that the remixing of portfolio will have to maintain margins near term next year?", "Peter Porrino", "Vinay, we have always been of the view that remixing the portfolio based on market conditions is a core part of our strategy and competency. I would point out that property CAT in 2005 was about 11% of our global portfolio today, it\u2019s about 30%, that\u2019s because, we like the CAT business.", "We made a lot of money out of it, but we\u2019ve seen tricking margins in other parts of our portfolio. So, we go forward with the same attitude. We are completely unafraid to shift the mix of business based on the margins out there.", "Michael McGavick", "Vinay, \u2013 kind of touching into all of this conversation, I think it\u2019s important to remember that, while we have been at it, as we said a while now, all of the books here in \u2013 when we look at insurance we are talking about 22 different specific books and activity with different leaders.", "All of them got to their attention whether the underwriting is at a different point in time it didn\u2019t all happen at the same time. For some of them that are on the second route does have improvements. For some of them that are still in the first year of experiencing improvements, my point is that even those initial underwriting reactions, or re-underwriting actions, are not completely exhausted in terms of being run through the book.", "At the same time, we are extremely cautious of the pace at which we take credit for them which I assure you is the right way to do it as a prudent reserve but I can also tell you that, our underwriters often throw fits about the gap between their action and its recognition.", "So, when you ask have you seen all the benefit from what we\u2019ve been up to, the answer, my book is not even close and remixing is a constant. I think, Jamie said it well and it\u2019s something we are not getting better out in reinsurance not just in insurance \u2013 not just reinsurance which is there has to be a core competency.", "We have to be constantly having the capital flow to where the opportunities are and when we can get into the businesses that have more flexible designs of operations so that we don\u2019t have as much fixed cost to drag which is what you are doing when you are growing out specialty lines.", "I really think you are seeing some great benefit. I just want to kind of pound on it again, because this has been a theme throughout the line and well, we are great to see the progress but are you going to stall out here? And our answer is, based on everything we are up to and what we are seeing, no.", "And I would just \u2013 just like what\u2019s happened this year, two of our three quarters are under 95. I got to go back a long ways and certainly a long ways back before me to get to where those were the kinds of numbers we were regularly delivering and delivering with a fair amount of consistency. So I am really pleased with where we are.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Sure, that\u2019s helpful and so, just to follow-up on that, the expense ratio sort of coming down with the growth in the top-line with one of the levers I thought that was supposed to have the combined ratio. So, with growth slowing down and expenses growing at north of 9%, just wanted to follow\\-up. I mean, I think you said that expenses are going to be more important. How should we look at sort of the disconnect between right now at least the top-line versus the expenses?", "Michael McGavick", "Well, first-line expenses, remember you got to correct for FX and for the comp volatility which tracks the improvement in results. So, when you normalize for that as I observed earlier as Pete emphasized in his remarks, you are talking about 4% increase quarter-over-quarter.", "The second thing I would point out and I think this is crucial expenses are a lever that when you pool them, if you do it right, especially if you have everything investments you made, they fall right to the bottom-line. So the fact that we are starting to adjust already on expenses in light of what we are seeing as they coming slowdown is exactly where we ought to be.", "Third, some of what slowing down is some intentional continuation of your first point, the underwriting actions. When you had that slowdown for example, in our \u2013 forgive me, on energy for example, as Greg mentioned in his remarks, we made some very specific re-underwriting and I already booked to take risk at the table to lock away from premiums and we did it very aggressively.", "That wasn\u2019t in our original plan as a result, we have to adjust expenses to match to that but that\u2019s still the right action to take even if you sacrificed a bit of top-line because it will pay off in the long run.", "So, again, I think we are being in the right kind of steward and we\u2019ll get another chance to talk about expenses when we announce next year\u2019s plan which will be one of the few times where we give something approaching guidance which is right to give some explicit view of expense and we will be able to give you a clear picture of how we\u2019ll play next year given all these conditions at that time.", "But given that we went from saying, it can be kind of mid-digit, single-digit this year, ex forgetting FX and forgetting what were the comp that\u2019s volatility that we can forecast, given that we already said, we\u2019d be kind of mid to upper mid single-digits, we kind of said five to six at the beginning of the year, now we\u2019ve pulled it back down to four because of what we are seeing, I think we are handling this about right.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners", "All right, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets. You may ask you question.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "", "Great, thank you very much. I just wanted to follow-up on the top-line being lower in the reinsurance segment, I appreciate the commentary on first it\u2019d be lumpy in the year-to-date result being better.", "But I guess, I\u2019d like to ask if anything is changing in those markets in particular, notwithstanding the higher level of comments from Mike and alternative impacts for XL, but is alternative capital coming into that area? That\u2019s the first question. The second is, is there any impact from a slowdown in the macro economy particularly in places like Latin America that might be affecting that line more so now than in the past?", "Peter Porrino", "Let\u2019s talk about the alternative capital first. The impact to-date has been obviously in the property CAT area.", "There has been expanding discussions about other lines of business principally short tail lines of business although I do believe that there is some problem solving going on to address long tail lines as well. So, the direct impact on the marketplace to-date has recently been in property CAT but my expectation over time is that you will see alternative sources of capital taking on risk at other parts of the marketplace. In terms of macroeconomic conditions, flowing things down.", "I suppose there is an argument that, that slows down, for example, increased insurance penetration and the development of the middle-class and so forth in emerging markets, I hadn\u2019t really thought about it that closely and linking it to our own top-line. We have just now particularly in Latin America extremely challenging trading conditions for a long, long time and we are just re-underwriting that book of business until we get it right.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Okay, so those are more concepts anything you felt like you felt in the top-line for reinsurance this particular quarter. Is that a fair takeaway both with alternative and emerging economies?", "Peter Porrino", "Yes.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Okay, thank you. And then, another one on the aviation book, you mentioned that you were seeing better rate because of the loss activity. I think it\u2019s the worst year on record for aviation losses. Can you give us a sense of what kind of rate you are getting there and the other clarification or detailed question was, have the losses emerged out in the reported results for the third quarter or is that still being sorted out?", "Gregory Hendrick", "Randy, it\u2019s Greg, So, on the first part, on the aviation book, a little color. It\u2019s always very difficult for us to get very precise industry numbers on a lot of these specialty lines. But as we look at that aviation market as a whole, we think we are around about 5% market share player by premium. And as best we can tell on the losses we\u2019ve recorded relative to what we think the industry loss is, we are about 1% to 1.5% share of loss. So, we\u2019ve done a very good job of underwriting around those losses this year..", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Gutterman from Balyasny. You may ask you question.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management", "Hi, thanks, Peter, I just have a few numbers questions, I am just struck on to reconcile the release to the net income as you can everything that up right. I guess, first, on the life business that\u2019s retained, am I getting it right that there is about $6 million of operating income? And if so, is that a reasonable run rate or might that not be a higher or lower going forward?", "Peter Porrino", "Ian, it\u2019s Pete. $6 million is the number that was recorded in income for the quarter around the retail business. I\u2019d say, within a few million that would be a reasonable number to expect in the future.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management", "Okay, great. On investment income ex \u2013 or ex the fund withheld, there are two different sports that\u2019s in the supplement and there are different numbers on Page 4 it\u2019s a $153 million \u2013 I am sorry, Page 8, it\u2019s a $153 million and Page 4 it\u2019s $170 million, what\u2019s the difference?", "Peter Porrino", "Let me take a look that, if I\u2019m guessing, it would be on the structured, we had this structured business that we record out separately both the income and expenses. So let me take a look at the pages and confirm that by the time of your last question come in.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management", "Got it. Okay, and the $20 million reinstatement that you talked about, can you explain that again, it went a little too fast for me, is that basically prior period development comes into your earned premium or is it something else?", "Peter Porrino", "So, anyhow I am happy to \u2013 Jamie and I just are discussing who is going to go and talk about it. So, if you look at \u2013 I apologize \u2013 so if you look at sort of the go back to the reinstatement premiums and we are very familiar with the property CAT business, right, this is not property CAT, much of the adjustment was for all the claims, short tail lines of business.", "We haven\u2019t received an indication of closure from these. We hadn\u2019t recorded reinstatement premiums most of them in the property risk area. And with that a detailed analysis of the older claims and we did released the case reserves, but also felt that these older claim reserves were released or paid the related premiums should be accrued.", "So that\u2019s what we did. It was about $20 million net. I gave you the materiality to the overall results. We don\u2019t see that as significant either and the trends in the combined ratios are an income.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management", "Okay, just to clarify, I am still little confused. So, it\u2019s basically $20 million to premium and $20 million earnings or is it some offset somewhere?", "Peter Porrino", "No, there is a little bit of tax offset in there.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management", "Right, okay. And this refers to prior year\u2019s losses then? And you just then take a reinstatement at the time?", "Peter Porrino", "Yes.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management", "Got it, okay. And then my last one is, do you have, I was able to reconcile everything to net income, but I can\u2019t get the operating income right, I am guessing it\u2019s taxes. Do you have the tax rate or the operating tax rate or the operating tax dollars?", "Peter Porrino", "Yes, the operating tax rate for the quarter was approximately 12%.", "Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management", "Okay, then I am going to try it with you later. Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Newsome\u2026", "Michael McGavick", "", "Okay, and then Ian, just going back, we\u2019d confirm that it was the structured product.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. You may ask your question.", "Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O'Neill", "Thank you. Congratulations on the quarter and obviously, congratulations to Mr. Veghte. I want to ask kind of a big picture question. We \u2013 XL has been, I think much more focused on hiring to expand product lines as opposed to acquiring. We are getting into a softer cycle, I think that tends to change the outlook. I\u2019d like to know a few things that that\u2019s happening. Anyhow XL is currently balancing the hire versus buy trade-offs, just given today\u2019s environment?", "Michael McGavick", "Paul, it\u2019s Mike. I think that, we\u2019ve obviously established a bias. We\u2019ve been adding teams and individuals to grow our premium for a while and we found it a very successful strategy. We have identified businesses that we think we would be good at that are complementary to our core skills and that would our core strategy of serving as the company the world turns to complex needs. So we still see that strategy is unchanged.", "The question really goes to, if acquisition would help in a strategy would you do it? Well, if that would accelerate our strategy, sure. We\u2019ve made only one small acquisitions in my six years here, I think in my time at \u2013 we also made one small acquisition in those five years.", "So in a 11.5 years, I think I have done two small things. We look at a lot of things, but generally speaking, when we do get involved we don\u2019t come up to winner, because we do it on an economic basis not just some kind of strategic calculation. And I think in the end, we are so proud of our culture and our approach that we are very cautious about how we would approach those kinds of questions.", "So do we look sure, do we think that the market conditions generally point toward greater M&A. hell, I am on the record, on that I\u2019ve been asked that on panels and I\u2019ve been saying for a couple of years I think market conditions increasingly point to M&A as a more likely activity in the next period of time. And I think every day that gets a little more likely. But for us, it\u2019s a matter of strategy, if something accelerated the \u2013 our drive to our goals, we\u2019d be intrigued by it. If it doesn\u2019t serve what we are doing, we are not.", "Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O'Neill", "Always appreciate your thoughts. Thank you very much.", "Michael McGavick", "Thank you.", "", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.", "Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "Yes, thank you very much for taking the question late. Most of my questions have been answered, I just want to refresh something about investment funds and look your outlook. You said in the past that some of your funds get marked on a one month basis, others on a three months basis, is that still correct?", "Peter Porrino", "Yes, Josh, it\u2019s Pete. That is still correct.", "Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "So, thinking about your outlook I\u2019ve seen some of your competitors who are shrinking their equity risk performance, some of them are increasing. Do you have an outlook as a company right now and in terms of \u2013 I was a little surprised that the point it\u2019s a little better this quarter I guess, given what we see in the strong performance from many of your competitors, if you have any thoughts on that?", "Peter Porrino", "So, as far as the change in strategies, no, we really haven\u2019t changed the strategy and our alternative investment and as far as go forward Sarah, if you want to take that?", "Sarah Street", "Yes, we have more \u2013 this is Sarah, we have more hedge fund buyers form many of our payers who are more private equity and you have seen some big write-ups in private equity. So that might be the differentiator.", "Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Sarah, I think that answers it perfectly. And so, no change of allocation going forward though?", "Peter Porrino", "No, no.", "Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.", "", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "", "Yes, thank you. So just one other question I had. You have obviously changed your retention strategy on your insurance business but it looks like on the reinsurance business, you\u2019ve done very little from a ceded standpoint. I am wondering, given the changes in the market, have you considered opportunities on that side?", "Gregory Hendrick", "Yes, Jay. And I think I mentioned in the second quarter call, we actually increased our spend on our CAT program. I think we are always looking at opportunities to buy reinsurance, I think actually Greg probably has more opportunity the retrocession market is a narrower trading market, but, yes, the answer is, we are constantly looking at opportunities.", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, I forgot about that 2Q. That\u2019s right thank you.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. And our final question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. You may ask your question.", "Meyer Shields \u2013 KBW", "Okay, great. Thanks for fitting the end. Mike, sort of big picture question. Has the timeline that you imagine or that you expect let\u2019s say, for achieving 10% ROE been impacted at all by interest rate declines year-to-date?", "Michael McGavick", "Well, I mean, there is no question that the entire sector and the entire insurance business model is been impacted by these interest rates and it\u2019s challenged everyone. How the year will finish out, it\u2019s hard to tell, it just depends on part on \u2013 there is just a lot of variables that we just don\u2019t know.", "So, we\u2019ve been kind of hovering around that 10% ROE line. Made it last year whether we do or not this year, it\u2019s little hard for me to forecast and I wouldn\u2019t do such even if I could. But, there is no question that the interest rates make it more difficult.", "When our reinvestment rate is something like 1.9%, this is a very tough environment and it just makes it obvious why it is so important for us to keep driving the levers. I thought this is a very good call. I just want to comment the questions because we are talking about the right thing.", "The core to the story at XL for the last period of time and then rate of improvement and likelihood of continuation improvement and getting out insurance combined in line and where does the reinsurance go getting the strategic pressures. It\u2019s been holding up nicely on the strategic pressures on the reinsurance, it\u2019s difficult but it\u2019s fine. On insurance, we are seeking continued expansion in margins.", "There may be some slowdown because of the headwinds and pricing, but that\u2019s already been matched to the idea that interest rates aren\u2019t going to suddenly become our friend. So, well it\u2019s made more difficult. It is how we have designed the plan and it\u2019s certainly going to be on our minds next year as well given all that we are seeing in terms of the interest rates that we are taking for next year in our budgets.", "So, I am optimistic only because we are on the right thing, and we are accepting that as a given rather than saying, somehow we don\u2019t meet our hurdles until that turns around, we are saying we got to deliver it, even if the rate environment is difficult and even if the interest rate environment is difficult. So, I hope that\u2019s helpful. But that\u2019s how we look at it.", "Meyer Shields \u2013 KBW", "No, it is. I appreciate it and then, Greg, if I can go really quickly, would you talk about the immature businesses not being at return targets. Should we look at that as an expense ratio issue or does that felt in loss ratio as well?", "Gregory Hendrick", "It\u2019s mostly in the expense ratio, Meyer. It\u2019s little bit in the loss ratio because, as Mike noted earlier, we tend to be pretty conservative about how we look at things early on until we can get established track record of loss, but by and large that\u2019s just getting your book up to size and covering all the expenses and the investments you made just set the business up in year one.", "Meyer Shields \u2013 KBW", "Okay, fantastic. Thanks so much all.", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to Mike McGavick for closing remarks.", "Michael McGavick", "Well, I guess, I made them in essence. But I really did think this was a call that\u2019s focused on the right issues. And the good news from my point of view is where we stand to have two of our three quarters this year below 95 ex CAT action here combined and our insurance operations is a good feeling and have this third quarter be the second of those, it\u2019s a great feeling.", "I think Jamie\u2019s troops continue to do a very good job in very difficult conditions and I think we are thinking about the business in the right context which is where all starts from. You have to have the right problem to solve in order to solve the problem and I think we\u2019ve got the right problems solved in our minds and are working with real diligence around it.", "I am also very proud of the expense story. Because we\u2019ve been reacting in an appropriate way even when those are always difficult things to do and we have \u2013 I think, I am pleased with where I see the planning process so far. So, I have actually enjoyed this conversation because it felt like the business we are actually running and I appreciate that spirit.", "I do want to add one thought, though. I didn\u2019t want to do in this personal of way at the beginning, because I knew Jamie had some work to do tonight. But six years ago, I got here and Jamie was already here and if Jamie hadn\u2019t been in the engine room of this business for these last six years, while we finished all of these \u2013 and been dealing with all of these incredible problems from the time that we solved SCA to all the other things we\u2019ve done, we wouldn\u2019t be on this call.", "And I think the people who represent XL in the market or comment on XL in the market really owe Jamie a huge debt of thanks. Now I feel it that way. So, thank you very much and again, we do want to apologize that the press release on the path for most of you got a little slowdown, but in the end, I hope you\u2019ve gotten this call useful. Good night.", "Operator", "Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Please be advised that this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "David Radulski", "Thank you, Kelley. And welcome to XL Group's first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. This call is being simultaneously webcast on XL's Web site at www.xlgroup.com. And we posted to our Web site several documents, including our press release and quarterly financial supplement.", "Please note that public information regarding our proposed acquisition with Catlin Group may be found on our corporate Web site and our transaction specific Web site, xl.transactionannouncement.com. As noted in the offer announcement, the UK Takeover Code does not apply to Catlin as it is a Bermuda domicile company. However, due to provisions with respect to the UK Takeover Code and Catlin\u2019s bylaws, the parties have agreed to certain matters regarding the application of the UK Takeover Code to the potential transaction. As we disclosed in previous communication, this puts significant constraints around the party\u2019s statements which we hope you can understand and we have Jason Eisenstadt of Goldman Sachs with us this evening as the city code monitor.", "On the call this evening, Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, who\u2019ll offer opening remarks; Pete Porrino, XL's Chief Financial Officer, who'll review our financial results; followed by Greg Hendrick, our Chief Executive of Insurance Operations and John Welch, our Interim Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations, who will review their segment results and market conditions. And then we'll open it up for questions.", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain of the matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements, including those with respect to XL and the proposed transaction of Catlin. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations, all of which involve risk and uncertainty, and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, and therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them. Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, as well as other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they're made, and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response with new information, future developments or otherwise.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Mike McGavick.", "Mike McGavick", "Good evening and thank you for attending tonight\u2019s call. Obviously the big event we want to talk about is the pending completion of our acquisition of Catlin and as I am sure you are aware our anticipated close date was is as soon as this Friday, May 1st. It is true that at this point we have received all of the necessary regulatory approvals and the approval of Catlin shareholders. Our last step in fact was sanctioning order by the Spring Court of Bermuda, which we received just today. And while the 1st is so very near it is not yet occurred, so all we can share about the transaction remain limited to what we have otherwise publicly disclosed as per the UK City Code on Takeovers.", "Tonight therefore the call will focus on XL\u2019s first quarter results and is our intention to hold the transaction focus conference call currently scheduled for May 28th. On that call on May 28th, we intent to give you a sense of the post call integration process, share with you our impressions of the first month of combined operations and provide you with some information to support your modeling of XL Catlin as head into the second half of the year and beyond. As we will still be only in our infancy as a combine company, it won\u2019t be everything you want, but I think we can at least get to the point where you get the detail that you need to start understanding the company we\u2019re creating.", "The only other note I\u2019d offer on integration planning is to say we are very pleased with how the planning process is proceeding, we set ourselves an aggressive timeline and have asked much of our colleagues and from our regulators in the past month and they have responded to me and often even exceeded our expectations. And so to all of the XL and Catlin colleagues listening, thank you and soon we\u2019ll be on to the really exciting work of putting into action all of the plans that we have made.", "Now as to our first quarter result. We have said that despite all the Catlin-related activity we would remain focused on delivering XL's 15 plan. Q2 we are enormously proud of how our XL colleague have responded to the solid start to the year made clear by these results. P&C combine ratio for the quarter was 88.9% better than the 89.7% of a year ago. The lost ratio and underwriting profit for the quarter of 58.3% and $148 million were also slight improvement on those metrics from the same quarter a year ago. Gross written premiums were 2.48 billion for the first quarter versus 2.43 billion of a year ago. For the businesses both the insurance and re-insurance segments had strong starts for the year and insurance combine ratio of 94.1% was 1.3 points better than the first quarter of 2014 or even more importantly the accident year ex-CAT combined ratio continue to move in the right direction. 93.2% in this quarter versus 94.6% a year ago. In this his last call of the head of insurance operations pending of course the transaction to close, Greg will get into more of the insurance segment results in a few minutes. In reinsurance while the familiar refrain of being a tough market continued we remain confident in our teams discipline to underwriting in these conditions. ", "This was again demonstrated in the segment combined ratio of 74.7% an improvement from the 76.3% in the prior year albeit added by a relatively light CAT quarter. John Welch will provide additional detail in his reinsurance report. A few final notes before turning it to Pete for additional comments on the financials of the quarter. First as you would have seen on Monday we released our global lost triangles which we believe illustrate the continued prudence of our reserving approach. Second you can also now find our 2014 letters to shareholders posted on the Investor Relations section of xlgroup.com. And third we are very excited about the recent announcement of XL Innovate, the XL sponsored venture capital fund we recently launched. The idea which led to XL Innovates launch is pretty simple. We want to be able to identify and move swiftly to create model solutions around the new and evolving risk challenges facing the globe.", "And once we have created such novel solutions we want to have the flexibility to marry them to the right sources of capital and to bring them to market in a variety of potential forms. As a result here the scope and the potential for what we think we can accomplish is both broad and very, very excited. In this I'm really pleased that we will be able to have Tom Hutton who has deep insurance and technology expertise to lead the effort of course Tom is a past director of XL as well. So it\u2019s great to be partnering with him again. Most recently, Tom helped create New Energy Risks, new energy and technology and consulting company that partnered with XL uniquely last year to launch an innovative field sell insurance product. That\u2019s the kind of effort we're seeking to replicate through XL Innovate across a variety of different sectors and risks and as just one more example to how we're pushing to drive for innovation at XL and we think by extension across the industry. With that I'll turn it over to Pete.", "Pete Porrino", "Thanks Mike and good evening. Operating net income for the first quarter was $194 million or $0.75 per share on a fully diluted bases compare to $239 million in 2014 or $0.85 per share. We've excluded $25 million in Catlin deal related transaction cost from operating earnings which I will discuss a little later. Our net income attributable to ordinary sales for the quarter was $36 million or $0.14 per share on a fully diluted basis as we have previously noted our net income numbers are impacted by the mark-to-market movement of the derivatives that trends to the economics of the asset packing, our second quarter 2014 life reinsurance transaction. However that derivative movement is completely offset by investment income, realized gains and losses and a change in the unrealized position of our portfolio and does not impact our net book value operating income or comprehensive income. We continue to show that relationship in the summary consolidated financial data included with the press release. The continued declines in UK and EU interest rate have caused an increase in the value of those assets with an offsetting derivative loss. Our property and cash combined ratio for the quarter was 88.9% or 0.8 points better in the same quarter last year.", "Our accident year combine ratio for the quarter was 92.5% the same as the first quarter of 2014. Greg and John will discuss our underwriting results in further detail. For the quarter our natural catastrophes losses totaled $15 million or 1.1 loss ratio points, by comparison net losses from natural catastrophes in the same quarter of 2014 totaled $17 million or 1.2 loss ratio point. Prior year reserved enrollment in the quarter was a net favorable $48 million or 3.7 loss ratio points, compare to $39 million in 2.7 lost ratio points for the same quarter in 2014. This reflects favorable development of 6 million and $42 million in the insurance and reinsurance segments. Our semiannual full actuarial review will be included in our results next quarter.", "As I mentioned we incurred approximately $25 of transaction cost related to the Catlin acquisition. These are predominantly made up of legal and due diligence fees relating to the transaction totaling approximately 10 million which are included in operating expenses combined with the cost of bridge financing facility of approximately $15 million which is recorded in interest expense. We continue to expect this transaction to close in the second quarter and therefore we would expect to incur additional deal specific cost in that period. Excluding this cost operating expenses have decreased 8.7% from the fourth quarter of 2014 due primarily to the impacted variable compensation in last year's fourth quarter number. Compared to the first quarter in 2014 our operating expenses excluding this cost have increased by approximately 1.5%.", "Turning to investment performance, the XL investment portfolio returned 1.3% for the quarter including a positive mark-to-market of $95 million. Included in the quarterly mark-to-market when net realized gains of $5 million, this compares to net realized gains of $19 million in the first quarter of 2014. At $158 million net investment income on the portfolio was $75 million below the same quarter last year primarily due to the Life transaction but also the impact of reinvestment yields and to a lesser extent foreign exchange on the P&C portfolio. The gross book yield in the portfolio at the end of March was 2.6%. ", "During the quarter our average new money rate was 1.3%, this was negatively impacted by the purchase of short-dated treasuries as we started to build liquidity to fund the pending Catlin acquisition. Adjusting for these purchases and more reflective of our ongoing investment activities that new money yield was 1.5%. Given current yield net investment income will continue to remain under pressure as we've approximately $2.9 billion of access with book yield of 2.8% rolling off over the next 12 months. ", "Unrealized net gains in the portfolio were $1.2 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. The duration of our fixed income portfolio at the end of the quarter was 3.7 years slightly shorter than the previous quarter. Net income from investment fund and investment manager operating affiliates was $39 million for the quarter, down $21 million from the prior year quarter as incentive fees from our investment manager affiliates were not as strong as they have been in the previous year when they had an exceptional quarterly performance. ", "The investment funds particularly the alternatives portfolio continued to perform well generating $35 million in earnings. On April 01st, 2015 we completed the previously announced sale of all of XL shares in American Strategic Insurance to the [Progress] Corporation. On March 31, 2015 the company's carrying value was $223 million. XL received approximately $560 million in proceeds from the transaction and will record a gain of approximately $337 million in the second quarter. ", "With respect to capital management, in connection with the proposed acquisition of Catlin on March 30, 2015 we issued $500 million of 4.45%, 10 year subordinate notes and $500 million of 5.5%, 30 year subordinate notes. These notes were designed to meet Solvency II capital standards for loss absorbency. To the best of our knowledge this was the first Solvency II debt financing conducted in the U.S. fixed income market and we\u2019re very pleased with the results. ", "The net proceeds from the sale of these notes together with cash and cash equivalents from other sources have been deposited in ESCROW to discharge the cash consideration payable to Catlin shareholders in respect with the acquisition. According XL cancelled the 1.6 billion pound bridge facility effective as of April 08, 2015 to avoid future bridge costs. At December 31, 2014 $268 million remained available for purchase under our share buyback program. We suspended active share buybacks during the first quarter to the close of our proposed acquisition of Catlin. We will discuss capital management in our May 20th quarter call that Mike referred to. ", "I will now turn it over to Greg to discuss our insurance segment results. ", "Greg Hendrick", "Thanks, Pete and good evening. Tonight I\u2019ll cover the results of the segment, provide some color on our progress during the quarter and finish with remarks on current market conditions.", "Beginning with the results the first quarter marked our 9th consecutive quarter profitability. With the segment produced in calendar quarter combined ratio of 94.1%, compared to 95.4% in the same quarter last year. Insurance segment produced a strong accident quarter ex-CAT combined ratio of 93.2% compared to 94.6% in the first quarter of 2014. This is our best result on this basis since 2007. ", "This year-over-year improvement was driven primarily by 1 point improvement in the underwriting expense ratio as well as an accident quarter ex-CAT loss ratio of 63.2% which was 0.3 points better than prior year. The results also benefited from another quarter of favorable CAT activity, which contributed 0.2 points to the improvement and this was mostly offset by slightly lower prior year development. ", "The underwriting expense ratio was 30% in the first quarter, reflecting an improvement of 1 full point in the first quarter of last year. This improvement was largely result of the actions we've taken to shift towards quarter share trades in a number of our businesses improving our acquisition ratio to 8.4% in the first quarter, compared to 10.6% in the first quarter of 2014. ", "As we've discussed previously our operating expense ratio increased by 1.2% partially driven by the quarter share usage. We have been actively managing our stocking levels as we've completed the build-out phase for many of our businesses. Our headcount increased by just 1% during the first quarter of the year down from 2.5% increase in the first quarter of last year. ", "Insurance gross premiums written grew by 169 million or 10.8% in the quarter, when adjusted for foreign exchange movement. All of this has contributed this growth, led by North American Property and Casualty our gross premiums were up 16%, driven by new business and higher renewal retention in construction, Global Risk Management and E&S. Specialty was up 15%, reflecting higher new business in Marine and Offshore Energy and strong retention in crisis management. International Property and Casualty gross premiums were up 8% to the continued growth in international middle markets an increased new business and primary casualty, partially offset by lower premium in property. And professional is up 6%, mostly due to higher new business in our international financial lines business and continued growth in our cyber book. Underpaying this growth, we continue to see an increase in submissions across the segment and quote a higher percent of these submissions reflecting our positive momentum in the large commercial marketplace.", "Shifting to ongoing progress, as mentioned earlier we experience a 1.4 improvement in our accident year ex-CAT combined ratio relative to the first quarter of 2014, despite competitive market conditions which I\u2019ll talk about in a moment. We continue to focus on an improved mix of business and ongoing execution of underwriting actions both of which contributed during the quarter. In addition, our measured use of proportionally insurance to strong [seating] commissions, our efforts to create operating leverage through efficiencies and rigorous expense management and the increase in the scale of our newer businesses have all contributed to the 1 point improvement in our underwriting expense per share. While we continue to pull this leverage and have delivered continued improvement over the past few years, we strongly believe that the XL Catlin transaction will allow us to pull these levels even harder and accelerate our progress towards top quintile performance.", "Turning to market conditions, we saw continuation of our reported during the second half of 2014. First quarter pricing is flat and slightly negative across most lines of business, as the overall rate change for the segment was minus 0.2%. As the momentum has clearly continue to slow, 13 of our 23 businesses have price decreases compare to only 6 in the first quarter of last year and overall pricings are now lagging trend by just under 2 points. In the first quarter, our professional businesses achieved rate increases just over 1% driven by our Cyber and miscellaneous professional businesses. Our international P&C were flat with slight increases in cash [indiscernible] markets offset by slight decreases in property. Our North American specialty business continue to be most severely impacted with an overall rate decrease of one to two points, larger reflecting continued competitive conditions in property and aviation lines respectively. Finally, while we once again benefitted from a relatively quiet catastrophe quarter, we delivered another solid quarter of underlying profitability and more importantly, we continued our ongoing trajectory of underwriting improvement.", "Had a great run over the past three years, steady improvement resulted from a hard work of a great group of colleagues and while this moment is a little bitter-sweet for me, and I turn over the reins to Paul, [indiscernible], I feel strong as this segment is well positioned for continued success. Combine their leadership with a high caliber of the combined XL Catlin Insurance team, the segment is poised to delivered continued improvement in our results.", "Now the John will discuss reinsurance results.", "John Welch", "Thank you, Greg and good evening. The Reinsurance segment got off to another excellent start in 2015 with the combined ratio of 74.7% and resulting underwriting profit of 90 million for the quarter. This compares with the combine ratio of 76.3% and the underwriting profit of 100 million for the first quarter of 2014. We had the benefit of the light quarter of catastrophe activity and continued favorable reserve runoff. Considering the competitive landscape, we are pleased with how the portfolio performed in the first quarter. Our reserve releases in the quarter were 42 million or 11.9 points compared with 30 million or 7.2 points a year ago. The current quarter release was entirely driven by favorable run-off in short tail lines of business.", "The year-over-year improvement was produced by the property catastrophe line. Excluding prior year development, portfolio generated a combine ratio of 86.6%, which compares to the 83.5% produced in the first quarter of 2014. The accident quarter loss ratio rose 1.7 points to 54.7% for the quarter. The primary drivers of the loss ratio increase were one-time premium reductions and prior underwriting years and underlying rate deterioration with a partial offset due to an improved mix of business. There was no impact from catastrophe losses for the first quarter in the current or prior year. Turning top-line, gross written premium for the quarter was 826 million, down from 858 million in the first quarter of 2014.", "The impact of FX on gross written premium year-over-year was a reduction of 54 million or 6.2%. Excluding the impact of FX, the 2.5% growth in the quarter was primarily driven by the specialty crop insurance book and a few new opportunities in U.S. casualty treaty for which we are the lead reinsurer. The net earn premium experienced a year-over-year reduction of 63 million or 15%, 18 million or 4.4 points related to the impact of FX with the remainder driven by the decline in net premium during 2014. This decline was driven by the property catastrophe and casualty lines.", "Turning to market conditions, we experienced deteriorating rate adequacy across all lines and regions during the first quarter. The largest magnitude of deterioration was experience in the property catastrophe book followed by other short tail lines and finally casualty. Since the end of the quarter the only significantly renewal for XL at April 1, was in the Japanese market. Japanese renewals were competitive with Cat-ex oil rate of 10% to 15% and upward seeding commission pressure on proportional treatises. There were some isolated pockets of increase demand from some large buyers.", "In conclusion it was successful quarters from a profitability perspective. Prior year reserve continue to run off favorably and benefited from light quarter for catastrophe. Market conditions continue to be challenging however we have found some pockets of opportunity and are pleased with the portfolio written to date. With that I will turn it back to David. ", "David Radulski", "Kelley can you please the open the lines for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instruction] The first question will come from the line of Mr. Josh Stirling of Bernstein. Sir your line is now open.", "Josh Stirling ", "So Mike I think I and everybody who reads [Bloodberg] enjoyed your comments about M&A in the shareholders letter. You made some comments about companies historically sometime becoming road kill and I thought -- I know we can't ask you about details on the deal. So I won't try to do that, but big picture as you look back over your history in the industry, when you think about challenged deals that often didn\u2019t work, or were really difficult for the companies to digest. When you look back, what are some of the pit falls that you think M&A presents and then how would you guys tried to design this acquisition and probably -- even more important you are approach to integration to try to think through and prevent some of these promise in the merging?", "Mike McGavick", "So I'm glancing over at our takeover council as I answer. So that he can hit me directly between the eyes more easily. I do think Josh that you\u2019ve asked an important question that I can answer. Couple of thoughts, first of all we did as a part of our work with our risk management committee and with the full board. We actually did an analysis of all of the deals that have gone before not just in our space but in other space. And went through what we thought were their causes of failure in various transaction to try and understand how if we did any transaction much this specific one we're talking about; how we would approach it. So we had a general rule book of what can happen in transactions and what can be done to mitigate that.", "So we went into this knowing that for our sectors specifically and generally there are an awful lot of failures in M&A and I can give you a handful of the things that were very much on our mind as we thought about them. Number one, many of them failed because of the way they are entered into. In other words, the initial pricing, terms and conditions of the agreement and the approach to bringing the companies together. So lot of it's about how you get into in the first place. The second thing is so many failures can be related to culture, were the companies truly comparable, where the leaderships of the company approaching these integrations in the right way. Third category of failures is when there is not sufficient emphasis on the economics of the transaction but just some kind of focused on strategy and our belief that if you get strategy right everything else will follow.", "I think I mentioned in my letter that we particularly don\u2019t buy into that notion we believe it has to answer both on the strategy level as well as on the financial level. And finally a fifth category of failure is when you sort of loose control on the integration when in essence the things that you believe will happen whether synergies or retention of key people or business proved to be wrong. And therefore as you go along you cannot create the economic or strategic outcome that you believed was worth the deal in the first place.", "So those are some of the big ticket -- there are a good dozen of these if I remember the list. But those were some of the big ticket items that we were very focused on. And here I will only comment on things that we have previously discussed. But as previously discuss we have the advances because we weren\u2019t already in the deals frenzy that has subsequently evolved, we had the advantage of a very long period of run up, in which really amounting about 18 months in which Steven and I and later the broader leadership teams and we and later teams of people, through due diligence across the companies could confirm to our satisfaction that in fact the cultures were compatible, highly compatible in fact. That in fact, the economics and not just the strategy made sense; that in fact we believe we could pull people along to the common vision and there is just been nothing that has taken place since, that has changed any of our view that we are starting with a very advantaged hand as we enter what becomes now, the real integrations. ", "As we entered what becomes now the real integration. As we've mentioned before we've had a teams of literally dozens upon dozens -- hundreds of people from the company focused on the integration activities in accordance with the law, while at the same time the vast majority of colleagues from both XL and Catlin have focused on delivering a quarter first quarter which as you can see from the numbers we've managed to do. So I suppose only one last though and then if you have a follow-up I will see if someone can answer.", "But the other thought I would add is, this quarter continues to show that this wasn't something we felt we needed to do, our own book of business is performing very well, and I can tell you Greg and I look each other from time-to-time say man it's going to so well, and yet at the same time we believe that respecting the strategic imperatives about which I\u2019ve talked so much and is in the letter as well, these five big things and they need to respond to the write off change in the sector. We continue to believe that the combined company XL-Catlin once it if closed, will even be more effective that positioning our ability to solve client needs and thereby return of an appropriate return for our shareholders. ", "So I hope that\u2019s helpful but this was done fully aware of the various pitfalls, in fact with fair amount of analysis around them and in a deep believe that we had done all we could to mitigate against those in both the run up and now in our preparation to jump in the next deal together should it close in fact on Friday. ", "Josh Stirling", "Mike, thank you. I think that was really thoughtful and complete. I guess my only follow-up would be when you think about -- you may have talked a lot of about culture of the firm being compatible but it is a combination you got into the XL Catlin is new trade name. How does an XL underwriter begin to look at the world differently? How does the Catlin underwriter begin to look at the world differently? And how should we think about you guys long-term. I mean is this XL but plus [indiscernible] company or Catlin starts to look more like Bermuda company or you both look more like a specialty company? I was just trying to maybe get a sense of what you think the longer vision is? And how from an underwriting perspective particular the world changes?", "Mike McGavick", "Unfortunately, now you really are in the perspective questions. So I can\u2019t talk about how XL Catlin will compete because it doesn't exist yet. But you can presume very strongly based on your intuitive logic is that we didn't spend all this money to then go and somehow make it just one or the other that would be too limited. It's really about how they bring as we've said many times the best of both forward. I do think though there is an implicit element to your question, but I can answer that. That Pete reminds was certainly important to how we\u2019re comfortable with this transaction. And that is -- it is clear to me that one of the other big failure risks is the inability to be decisive and one of the things I would have formulated your question differently but I\u2019ll anticipate that others would want to know this, and believe me we\u2019re not going to spend a lot more time on this topic. So you actually kind of got away with one.", "But the bottom-line is I've been hired twice to clean up the mess of under executed transactions before. I could argue that the [indiscernible] of transaction here wasn't complete and that we completed it. And I\u2019d know for sure that when I got to Safeco, one of the big problems was that they bought American stakes and they never fully made the tough decisions to integrate the companies to really bring forward the best of best, they acted like they could just go on as they were before. You can't do that and you have to be decisive and willing to be decisive and make tough choices as to both organizations in order to create truly world class going forward competitor. And I can say that I watched some of that work and cleaned up some of that work when I was at C&A as well. ", "So I can just tell you we\u2019re being decisive, you\u2019ve seen the rollout of choices amongst competitive competent people of our various leadership jobs all the down several levels now that have been in the press and we\u2019re going to approach saying we\u2019re absolutely determined and will not be thwarted it our ability to bring the best forward and to deliver on the economics we promised to the marketplace. ", "Operator", "The next question will come from the line of Cliff Gallant of Nomura. Sir your line is now open. ", "Cliff Gallant", "You touched on share repurchases and how that you might revisit that question in a few weeks. But I am just wondering how you feel about the capital position of the company today as you head into the merger? And from your perspective Pete do you think it is capacity for buyback and what would your thinking be around that?", "Mike McGavick", "There is a couple of things that are obvious, because we have not been buying back shares during this period of time and because we had the successful sale of our ownership of ASI, clearly capital is building it, the company. At the same time we've said very clearly that we will talk about capital management as a part of giving you the information necessary to model us into the future and that is referred to the May 28th call and until then we are not going to get into those questions.", "Cliff Gallant ", "As a follow-up then just on the quarter\u2019s results then, when I look at the insurance progress and you guys continue to have great progress on the underlying combined ratio. And then even 1.4 points this quarter, I didn\u2019t notice all that from the -- in the second half of last year was more like 3 points a quarter and I am curious, are we getting to the point now where you would have expected that the rate of improvement would have slowed, that a lot of the low hanging fruit was sort of -- have been taking care of?", "Mike McGavick", "Not at all, I would say we would believe there is a lot less [environment] and it turned over to Greg, but the one win that was still somewhat contributing then and is not now of course is rate, I mean that\u2019s why you're seeing some shift in what\u2019s going on between this year and last year, but that doesn\u2019t -- [Rob] as something we\u2019re doing to make progress.", "Greg Hendrick", "Right, we\u2019re still making progress, Cliff, part of it is on mix, we continue to mix in -- most of the new businesses are kind of higher margin than we\u2019ve had in the past. We continue to be very rigorous as I mentioned in my comments on the underwriting actions that yielded over half a point in the quarter this year. So we have a couple of other levers to pull on. It does get -- the quarter-over-quarter rate of improvement does get little bit harder as you get to the end, but we still feel we\u2019ve got a lot of room to go is what we\u2019ve got in hand.", "Mike McGavick", "The other thing I would remind you of is, is in first quarter of the year this is really an [A versus E] quarter, PYD doesn\u2019t get looked at hard until you get to the second and fourth quarter which also would add to the accelerating phenomena of some of these benefits in prior years.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question will come from the line of Mr. Brian Meredith of UBS. Sir, your line is now open.", "Brian Meredith ", "A couple of questions here for you, the first one, just looking at field reinsurance during the quarter, anything different that happened there, looked like bought some more retro on the property cap book, any positioning actually for the Catlin acquisition as you kind of look through the summer months?", "Greg Hendrick", "This is Greg, I\u2019ll start with the -- on the insurance segment, we\u2019ve been running quarter-to-quarter around about 66% to 72% net-written to gross-written retention ratio and it was 66% I believe this quarter. There is a bit of noise in that number, we wrote a couple of sizeable and meaningful transactions on our global risk management which is the -- where we ensure Fortune 1000 companies, they retain a significant amount of it, so large amount [indiscernible] and sometimes to call insurers. There is a little bit of noise there, there is also a true up on one of our quarter shares from prior year. So we don\u2019t anticipate that run rate in the first quarter to do what you would see underneath the insurance segment.", "Mike McGavick", "Brian on the reinsurance side, what happens in the first quarter as we book the majority of our crop premium is sales closing for especially crops are essentially December through February, that led to about two point bump in the ceded written premium or the gross written premium relationship. But that\u2019s about probably 80% of the premium we\u2019ll book for the year for that business. So I think for the next three quarters we\u2019ll just revert back to a more normal historical ratio of ceded to gross.", "Brian Meredith", "Anything specific on property [Cato] that particularly look like a sometime pretty significantly year-over-year?", "Mike McGavick", "No, not really. The only thing I\u2019d add to what\u2019s been said is that that none of it has anything to do with [excel] calendar; obviously given that the transaction hasn\u2019t close, we\u2019ve had to maintain entirely separate reinsurance purchases strategies and won\u2019t get through to work on the benefit said that we have described and we think to our benefits there, but we won\u2019t start being able to bring those to life until the company are actually bought together.", "Brian Meredith", "And just one quick number question for Pete, Pete what is the impact of FX on the investment income for the P&C in the quarter?", "Pete Porrino", "It was about $3 million.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question will come from the line of Mr. Meyer Shields of KBW. Your line is now open.", "Meyer Shields ", "I was hoping that we could talk a little bit more about the mix shift in the insurance segment and whether the -- I guess year-over-year progress is likely to accelerate from what we saw in the first quarter?", "Greg Hendrick", "We may to same progress we\u2019ve talked about on a number of calls where kind of in that 70% to 75% were we are at or within five points of our target combined ratio. That\u2019s been fairly steady improvement along the way. I don\u2019t see anything that would cause me to think that progress will continue through the rest of the year, I am not going to forecast where we think it's going to get to, but it's just continuing work and continuing remixing of the business.", "Meyer Shields", "And I don\u2019t know whether Mike you answer this before, but could you apply any reinsurance for less than the full year 2015 during the first quarter in anticipation of the calendar?", "Mike McGavick", "No, we really couldn\u2019t approach the world that way, I mean the reality is until its close, it isn\u2019t close and we had to do everything as though we were continuing to operate independently, or as through for some reason, it might not close. Obviously, as we get into these final days, we are feeling very good about it, but that\u2019s not the same as being done. So we did everything to deny to, hey what if it didn\u2019t happen, you have to operate like it would. ", "Operator", "The next question will come from the line of Mr. Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank. Sir your line is now open.", "Josh Shanker ", "I guess for John and Mike, it's not surprising, I suppose you said that most or actually all lines of business and reinsurance show pricing deterioration. And we had a point obviously where we're not sure there is much of inflation on the claim side but clearly negative is been good on the pricing. Not to take guidance -- I mean directionally is there a way for you guys to improve your margin reinsurance here or to the -- or it's about time to non-renew business in order to minimize that situation?", "Mike McGavick", "Actually where we certainly went to a process last year trying to change and accomplishing changing the mix of business. When we look at the economic returns we would say casualty would have the worst economic returns at this point for our portfolio and so essentially we pull back faster last year on that than the other lines. Going into this year those lines have been somewhat stable it will be hard I think -- we've had some new opportunities the crop business was one of them, to attempt to offset some of that loss business as the margins deteriorate. But it will be difficult as we go through the year to foresee finding new business that will offset some of that lost business, where the margins aren\u2019t acceptable any more.", "Josh Shanker ", "Do you think we should expect you to get smaller?", "Mike McGavick", "Well the way I looked at the premium in the first quarter is, if you back out the crop business the FX one time premium adjustments. We are essentially flat year-over-year that\u2019s not what we aspire to but I think we be happy if that\u2019s the outcome. ", "Josh Shanker ", "And on tax, the taxes it's hard predict any given quarter and one quarter is not a full year make. Can you give us some thoughts on the second quarter maybe? And relatively you don\u2019t want to take that line of questions, looking at same thing should help us understand tax over the long term for XL has a larger more global company?", "Pete Porrino", "Sure Josh its Pete, I'm going to answer half of your question directly and the other we'll cover on the call on the 28th. So what you would need to do in taxes -- it is a complicated quarter with the continuing noise in the life transaction impact in the net income. If you looked at on an operating basis you would have saw our tax rate would have been just about exactly 13% which is pretty consistent with what we've been saying in the past we've sort of talking in the 12% range or so. I don\u2019t see anything that would change that as a standalone company Catlin has a lower tax rate than we do. But at this point I really can't comment on what the likely tax rate of the combined entity would be.", "Josh Shanker ", "That\u2019s as good as I\u2019m going to get, I guess, so I'll take it. Thank you guys good luck.", "Operator", "The next question will come from the line of Mr. Amit Kumar of Macquarie. Sir your line is now open.", "Amit Kumar ", "Just one quick follow if you go back to Q2, 2014 we spend some time talking about large losses and at that time you had purchased a large risk aggregate cover. Can you remind us if there is anything remaining on that or has that been fully utilized? And how should we think about that piece going forward?", "Greg Hendrick", "Through the end of the first quarter we have utilized, recovered from a portion of that, covers still has limit left in it. It runs through May 1st of this year, we're in the process of considering what to do with it, that renewal and it's still some days ago. So I don\u2019t have any answer for what we will do going forward, not to least what will be wrapped up within store -- we were not going to talk about our XL Catlin. But there is limit left the first quarter was not anything abnormal in large loss activity. ", "Amit Kumar ", "Got it that\u2019s all I had. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future.", "Operator", "The next question will come from the line of Mr. Ian Gutterman of Balyasny. Sir your line is now open.", "Ian Gutterman ", "First I'm going to ask that maybe it is a little bit in the grey area but I think the way I\u2019ll ask it, you\u2019d way the ask that you can answer it. As of Monday is there anything that prevents you from buying back stock if you choose to, I'm not asking if you will or you won\u2019t; but is there anything that presences you from starting to buy back stock at Monday if you wanted to?", "Greg Hendrick", "No.", "Ian Gutterman ", "Second lot of my other ones has been answered here. The crop you talked about I think a fair amount of that\u2019s in California is there any reason to be concerned about the drought?", "John Welch", "While it certainly something we monitor, the crops that tend to be the most exposed to drought tend to be rogue crops which is not the target of the portfolio. The portfolio is targeted towards almonds and citrus and grapes which do have the necessary irrigation to have a good year. We\u2019ve had a few good years in a row here. We think given the target crops the draught shouldn't be an issue for us over the next 12 months, we\u2019ll say, I think as we look at what develops over the next three years to five years, if it can become a concern at that point. ", "Pete Porrino", "This is Pete, just to confirm. Yes indeed it is the vast majority is California. ", "Ian Gutterman ", "And then just my last and this is asked a little bit; but just to get a little more detail. The drop in the investment income sequentially, are you short from where the run was, I think about 10 million maybe little bit more that\u2019s focusing just on the P&C part, I guess 12 million from last quarter. You said 3 was FX there is about 9, that seems like a lot to explain by just holding cash for Catlin plus the normal maturities versus new money. Is there anything else in there or is this new run rate? The one I made when I backed up just couple of things. ", "Pete Porrino", "Sure it's Pete. And some of this goes into a new run rate and some of it is one off. There was a one off distribution last quarter and all the numbers I am going to give you are right all around $3 million. And so we actually capped at slightly more than 12 more or like 14 million over drought. So there was a one-off distribution last quarter, I guess about 3 million, in addition to building cash for Catlin acquisition we also sold some of our higher yielding assets, the two of them together I would say that was about 3 million, and then the last one was just a general reduction in yields from reinvesting maturing bonds. ", "And so when you add those four up that\u2019s a pretty much get to the money I think you were looking for. ", "Operator", "The next question will come from the line of Mr. Ryan Tunis of Credit Suisse. Sir your line is now open. ", "Ryan Tunis ", "My first question is just on the operating expenses, XL Catlin. They are up 1.6% year-over-year. I think you guys have said you think you can do low single-digits, and if I recall correctly I think in the back half of last year when we had more of the difficult comps with the higher variable compensation level. Am I right to think that as the year goes on, it should actually be easier to grow organic over operating expenses less or am I not thinking about that right on the variable expense side?", "Pete Porrino", "First off and after this quarter, we\u2019re not going to be able to measure them anymore on the same basis. But you are right that in the last quarter of last year we had a significant amount of variable compensation which drove that up which is why we had large decrease this quarter sequentially. The one thing I would is that we benefited from foreign exchange in this quarter in the expenses. So if you would have normalized to that it would have been more in the 5% range. And so if you would have thought about that going for the next couple of quarters and then having a decline in the fourth quarter that\u2019s where you would get to the low single-digit for the full year. ", "Ryan Tunis ", "Just to be clear, everything you saw this quarter though still makes you feel good about that low single-digit guidance you gave in the fourth quarter?", "Pete Porrino", "Absolutely, it's completely in line. ", "Ryan Tunis ", "Just one more, I guess is more general question in insurance, right property I know is an area you guys have been trying to grow in. We\u2019ve heard competitors talk about how that\u2019s a difficult line in terms of rate. I am just curious maybe you could talk about the competitive environment there and any of the challenges turn to grow that line?", "Greg Hendrick", "Sure Ryan, its Greg Hendrick. It is definitely the more competitive as in general, the most competitive area we see in the insurance marketplace. Property in North America was down about 5 points and internationally down about 2 points. Particularly North America, in North America we\u2019re coming off pricing levels which are generating sufficient margins for us. So there has definitely been more capacity put to work. It's definitely a lot harder and more difficult marketplace but it's one I think we can navigate well and these aren't run away rate reductions that we\u2019re seeing on the insurance side. ", "Mike McGavick", "This is Mike; I would add couple of things. I was down there, I just got back last night from [Rem\u2019s], which is always very good place to get handle on what\u2019s going on in the market, and I can just tell you that the combination of the underwriting team we've assembled in the property space and the respected commands in the sector combined with the additional we\u2019re able to make around risk management and through our GAAP's offering and the various mitigation program; we\u2019re still able to make some headway in that sector. We are not that bigger market share and that team and that offering are so compelling that we continue to see opportunities coming our way that still need our hurdles. ", "If we were a larger player perhaps I\u2019d be more worried about our continuing ability to write but we certainly saw examples when I was down in [Rem\u2019s], of places where we still have [indiscernible] to pick up some attractive business.", "That\u2019s my first point, the second point on the question you asked Pete on expenses, I just had one more thought, I think it's really important, not only are we well positioned because of the momentum in improving our broker business that we come into this period with, but I\u2019d much rather be in the position of executing upon a transaction in the midst of it as well because it simply gives you obviously more to work with and more levers to pull. So I like both elements of our positioning should the deal in fact close on time.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question will come from the line of Mr. Jay Cohen of Bank of America. Sir, your line is now open.", "Jay Cohen", "On your acquisition expenses and you reinsurance business, I guess I would have expected that number to be rising over the past several years just given higher ceding commissions, yet that number really haven\u2019t budged, is this a business mix issue, why is it been so stable?", "John Welch", "Jay it really is at least for this quarter, Jamie is not here to answer for the other years, but for this quarter it\u2019s a business mix issue, the crop business in particular, the proportion of CAT business that all helps the proportional business as commissions have reason exactly as you describe has been more difficult to write. So as we\u2019ve contracted over the years it's been disproportionately on proportional business side. And so that\u2019s how we\u2019ve manage to control the commission rise.", "Jay Cohen", "And my other questions were answered, so thanks I\u2019ll talk to you at the end of the month.", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time we do not have question from the queue. Speakers you may proceed.", "Mike McGavick", "We appreciate the way in which the questions were approached today. Obviously it's an uncomfortable thing to that there are important items you can\u2019t talk about and I can\u2019t tell you how eager I am to get to the 28th and to Friday to the days beyond to get this hopefully up and running. I do think it's appropriate to take one minutes and couple of thank you. First of all John Welch, thank you very much for your Internship presuming it all goes through when Greg will slide back over, so thank you.", "Second to Sarah Street, Sarah has been announced to chosen to take a reduced responsibility and to enjoy little more free time which she certainly has earned through the rather remarkable efforts to restructure our portfolio both during and after the financial crisis and providing what is simply an exemplary leader to the wonderful group of investment professionals that we have and I am thrilled that she will continue to work in the strategy and the XL innovate areas where I think she has enormous contributions to make.", "But we should pause and I think it's appropriate in this venue to note in front of the shareholders the remarkable work Sarah has done over these years and finally to Greg, well it's going to be thrilling to see what he does with the excitement that is structural shifts going on in the reinsurance world; it cannot be passed up the opportunity to again -- in front of our analysts and shareholders to thank Greg for the absolutely stellar leadership he has provided to the turnaround of our insurance businesses and I know very well both of them would immediately reflect to their colleagues for all that they have done, but I want to make sure leadership matters and these two are really extraordinary at leadership. So thanks to you both and thanks for the call you guys. We\u2019ll look forward to the 28th.", "Operator", "Thank you. And that conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participating.

My name is Shirley and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the XL Group PLC second quarter 2015 earnings call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "David Radulski", "Thank you, Shirley and welcome to our call. Our call today is being simultaneously webcast at www.xlcatlin.com and www.xltgroup.com. We have posted to our website several documents including our press release and quarterly financial supplement. On our call this morning is Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO who will offer opening remarks, Pete Porinno, XL's Chief Financial Officer who will review our financial results, followed by Paul Brand, our Chief Underwriting Officer and Chair of our Insurance Leadership Team, and Greg Hendrick, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations who will review their segment results and market conditions. Then we'll open it up for questions. Also with us is Kelly Lyles, our Chief Regional Officer and the Deputy Chair of our Insurance Leadership Team.", "Before we begin, I would like to remind you that certain of the matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations all of which involve risk and uncertainty and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them. Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors including those identified in our most recent reports on forms 10-Q and 10-K as well as other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.", "Forward-looking statements speak only as the date of which they are made and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise. With that, I turn it over to Mike McGavick.", "Mike McGavick", "Thank you each for joining our call. Today, we're very pleased to discuss our second quarter 2015 results. The first results period for the combined operation of XL Catlin. And although the quarter includes only two months of joint operation, in that short time we're already seeing the many positive indicators supporting the rationale for our joining forces and for the quality of are integration work.", "I'll give some of the highlights of the quarter and Pete Porinno will have further details on the numbers and then, for the first time since the close of the transaction, Paul Brand will discuss the insurance operations while Greg Hendrick will handle reinsurance. In terms of the quarter, as you have seen from the release issued last night, our results included an operating ROE of 10% excluding unrealized gains and losses, a P&C combined ratio of 89.9%, an underwriting profit of $209 million, gross written premium of just over $3 billion and operating earnings of $0.84 per share.", "Impacts to these results in the quarter included higher levels of cat in medium to large losses as you've already heard broadly from the market, as well as $28 million in integration costs. Overall, these are solid results and we like our positions. We're particularly pleased with these results we're delivered during a quarter that was messy for the industry and when we're fully into our integration work.", "I also think these results bespeak progress toward a goal we've had for a long time of an increased ability to better absorb volatility. As I have said, we had a few large cats and higher than expected levels of losses and nonetheless, the overall result is quite solid. Now, this could be luck. We're in the fortuity business, but this is something we've been striving to deliver for a long time and we have believed that the combination with Catlin would create an even more resilient and better spread book of business. This could also be a result of that progress. We will see.", "Before turning it to Pete, I also want to give you a quick update on the three areas related to the ongoing integration, our current thinking regarding top line, second, our expectations for expenses and then third, capital management. First, as to the top line. As we all know, the market faces plenty of headwinds. We intend to maintain our discipline and the continuing guidance to all of our underwriters is that as much as we intend to grow, our primary focus is and will always be on the bottom line.", "The simple truth is, for us, bringing the two firms together is not the difficult thing. The difficult thing for us and for everyone else in the market for that matter, is the market itself. And yet, in the quarter, we actually grew our top line and can only identify less than 1% of the business that was lost as a result of the deal. That is far better than we had modeled going in. Second, regarding expenses, we remain on track to achieve our synergy target of $250 million by year-end 2017 on a run rate basis and the ratio of cost to savings remains the same. ", "Roughly $1.25 in expenses for every $1 we can achieve in synergies. That said, we're in fact a bit ahead of this schedule in getting to our goal. In addition, we're also on track to gain the non-operating expense savings from areas like reinsurance, purchasing, claims adjustment expenses and investment management fees as discussed with you on our previous call.", "And then, third, turning to capital management. Since restarting share buybacks following the May 1, close of the deal, we have followed the rate previously shared with you of a bit more than $50 million per month. Here again, we like being in a position to resume our capital management program and to continue to create additional value through buybacks.", "Lastly, I just want to emphasize once how pleased we're with the overall progress we have made on our integration. Integration work is by its nature very hard and there are many changes that our people around the world are adapting to. Yet they are anticipating and solving issues that arise and the market reaction remains well beyond our hopes. A great example of what we've already achieved would be come from their quarterly results review that we recently held with all of the key leaders of our underwriting divisions, regions and major functions.", "My expectations for the meeting were very high because I believe these two cultures are innately aligned. However, I can tell you that for many of the people in that room, they're meeting together for the first time. To see the camaraderie and to see the command that people already had of the numbers and operations under their responsibilities was simply astonishing. I know everyone in that room left heartened at the likelihood of success for what we're bringing together. I was simply blown away by what I participated in. This speaks well to the distinctive cultural we each had and to the unique way it will now fit together.", "We're not claiming victory and we're not done by any means. Our focus on speed to close the deal and I'm bringing these two companies together as quickly as possible, has put us in a fantastic position to build on, especially in a market that is experiencing a high level of subsequent M&A and turmoil. With that, I'll turn it over to Pete.", "Pete Porrino", "Thanks, Mike. Our consolidated results for the quarter reflect the addition of the Catlin Group for only the months of May and June and reported prior year figures include only legacy XL results. Most of our prepared remarks will be on that basis. As promised, we have included segment information for the first six months of 2014 in our financial supplement which combines XL and Catlin to help you with your analysis.", "This table is in response to many of your requests. Please note that the presentation does not represent pro forma financial information in compliance with GAAP and the combined June 30, 2014 information has not been audited. Operating net income for the second quarter was $246 million or $0.84 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to $280 million in 2014 or $1.02 per share. As we indicated during our May call, we exclude direct transaction costs from operating income while including integration costs. During the second quarter, we excluded $37 million in Catlin deal related transaction costs from operating income and included $28 million in integration costs. Both of these are recorded in corporate expenses.", "On net income attributable to ordinary shareholders for the quarter was $915 million or $3.11 per share on a fully diluted basis which included the gain of $340 million on the sale of our operating affiliate, ARX Holdings which closed on April 1. Additionally, as we have previously noted and I'm sure by now you are expert in this matter, our net income numbers are also impacted by the mark to market movement of the derivatives that trends through the economics of the assets backing our second quarter 2014 Life reinsurance transaction and which have no impact on net book value or operating income.", "We recorded a derivative gain offset by a book value loss in the quarter due to the increasing interest rates on the underlying assets. Our P&C combined ratio for the quarter was 89.9% or 1.6 points higher than the same quarter last year. Our accident and combined ratio for the quarter was 95.2%, 1 point higher than the second quarter of 2014. Natural catastrophe losses this quarter was $60 million or 2.9 loss ratio points. By comparison, net losses from natural catastrophes in the same quarter of 2014 totaled $35 million or 2.4 loss ratio points.", "As we've outlined on previous calls, the second quarter has been and continues to be, the significant reserve valuation quarter. As a result, we have reacted appropriately to any development indications identified during our in-depth review. Prior year reserved development in the quarter was a net variable of $109 million or 5.3 loss ratio points compared to a net favorable $84 million and 5.8 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2014. This reflects favorable development of $38 million and $71 million in the insurance and reinsurance segments.", "We completed the GAAP purchase accounting process and made fair value adjustments to the required balance sheet. These adjustments will earn into income over the next number of quarters. Overall, the impact is relatively small. However, certain line items can be distorted in each quarter. For example, we advertised the fair value adjustment from deferred acquisition cost to value business acquired into acquisition expense, thereby increasing that ratio slightly, particularly in the reinsurance segment.", "This is offset by the amortization of the fair value adjustment to reserves which decreases loss ratios slightly, particularly in the insurance segments. To the extent that these are meaningful, they will be noted by Paul and Greg. Operating expenses have increased materially in the quarter as a result of the consolidation of the Catlin Group. Overall, however, the run rate operating expenses of the company are significantly lower than the baseline levels we discussed with you in May. If you recall, we indicated that we intend to measure our synergy levels against the run rate cost baseline on a combined 2014 expense level from the two companies, increased by low-single digits for XL and a slightly higher rate for Catlin.", "During the second quarter, our expenses, excluding deal and integration costs, were approximately 3% lower than the two companies' combined costs in the prior year. We expect the integration costs to increase significantly over the next two quarters then begin to decline through 2016 and 2017.", "Our operating tax rate has declined slightly from approximately 13% to approximately 11%. This relates to the actual and projected profits of the company by jurisdiction as well as the slightly lower overall historic rate that legacy Catlin experienced. On a net income basis, the tax rate really jumps around given the impact of items that don't impact operating incomes such as the Life derivative and the sale of ARX Holdings.", "Turning to the investment portfolio. Net investment income excluding the Life fund's withheld assets, was $176 million or $37 million below the same quarter last year, primarily due to the Life transaction having taken place mid-quarter last year, along with the impact of lower investment deals. These were partially offset by the addition of two months of investment income on the legacy Catlin portfolio. The gross book yield of the portfolio at the end of June was 2.4%. During the quarter, our average new money rate was 1.2%.", "Given current yields, net investment income will continue to remain under pressure as we have approximately $4.1 billion of assets with book yields 2.4% rolling off over the next 12 months. Net income from the investments fund and investment manager of operating affiliates was $40 million for the quarter, up $9 million from the prior year quarter driven by higher earnings from our private investment fun affiliates. Net income from other operating affiliates was down from the sale of ARX Holdings on April 1. Net realized gains on portfolio assets were $4 million, down $77 million from the prior year.", "We had large gains on sale of equities in the same part of last year. Our unrealized gain position declined by $319 million for the quarter driven primarily by rate increases in all our major jurisdictions. Unrealized net gains were $871 million at the end of the quarter. All together, the total return on investments was a negative 0.5% for the quarter. In general, we anticipate a transition to a rising rate environment and while we expect this to be handled sensitively by the central banks, we assume this will be accompanied by bouts of volatility in the market. In light of this view, we have not yet extended the ratio on our newly combined portfolio. However, the ratio on the overall portfolio decreased by 0.2 years to 3.5 years at the end of the quarter due to the inclusion of the legacy Catlin assets.", "This kind of an environment can provide opportunities for a long-term investor like XL Catlin but it will likely create a little more volatility in both net investment income and book value as we navigate our way through this. We've integrated the legacy Catlin assets into the combined portfolio. There has been no fundamental change in our investment policy or approach as a result of the Catlin acquisition, although the combined entity is expected to benefit from expanded capabilities including internal fixed income portfolio management.", "Now with respect to capital management, we resumed active share buybacks during the second quarter after the close of our acquisition of Catlin. During the second quarter, we purchased 2.9 million shares for $110 million at an average price of $37.57 per share, leaving $158 million available for purchase under our previously announced share buyback program. We continue to view these buybacks as an effective capital management tool and have continued purchasing at similar levels in July in line with the philosophy we laid out in May. I will now turn it over to Paul to discuss our insurance segment results.", "Paul Brand", "Thanks, Pete. Let me start by saying that both Kelly and I are really excited to be leading such a talented team of insurance professionals and that we look forward to sharing our continued progress over the coming quarters. Today, I will cover the results for the segment, provide an update on our integration and finish with remarks on current market conditions.", "First, the results. The second quarter marked our tenth consecutive quarter of profitability for the segment producing a calendar year, calendar quarter combined ratio of 97%, compared to 93.8% in the same quarter last year and a first soft combined ratio of 95.8% versus 94.6% during the first half of 2014. Increased cat activity, largely due to the eight ball Sydney hailstorm, compared to a low cat quarter in quarter two 2014, accounts for 2.7 of the 3.2 point quarter two deterioration. Lower prior year development as a percentage of net earned premiums account for another percentage point deterioration.", "This was partially offset by an improvement in our operating expense ratio reflecting changes in our expense structure as a result of the transaction. On an accident quarter ex cap basis, the combined ratio was 95.4% compared to 96% in quarter two, 2014. While this results reflects some improvements year-over-year, it is slightly higher with the 93.2% reported in quarter one primarily due to some medium-sized losses that occurred in the quarter. For the first half, we reported an accident year ex cat combined ratio of 94.5% compared to 95.3% to 2014 further demonstrating the resilience of our growing book of business as we were able to resolve these losses without jeopardizing profitability.", "For quarter two, reported an acquisition ratio of 12.9% which was three percentage points higher than quarter two 2014. This is because the legacy Catlin business included a larger share of wholesale specialty business largely from the lowest platform where the acquisition costs are higher than the legacy XL business. This is offset by lower loss ratios reflected in our quarter two net accident year ex cat loss ratio of 61.9% which was 2.8 percentage points lower than quarter two 2014. Insurance based premiums written in quarter two increased by 37% or $600 million year-over-year, driven largely from the Catlin acquisition. This growth occurred in all four of our underwriting divisions with the biggest growth in our energy, property and construction specialty divisions.", "When we look at a full quarter for both legacy organizations and normalize for foreign exchange and other items, our actual year-over-year growth is roughly 2% in quarter two and 4% year-to-date. We're clearly pleased with the business is growing despite the challenges of an integration and whilst the rate of growth has slowed when compared to recent quarters, in my view, this is for more indicative of market conditions than anything else.", "Shifting to progress and integration. Let me just share a few highlights from the insurance segment perspective. First off, the market response to the deal has been very favorable. We're seeing increased dialogue with our brokers, giving our greater market prominence and these brokers have been providing support to our one plus one equals two or more mantra. As a result, we tend to tracking ball with historical trends and new business is trending up despite market conditions which I will discuss shortly.", "Second, our leadership teams are now fully in place across the insurance segment as we carefully selected the best talent from both legacy organizations with minimal disruptions. Plus we successfully executed our legal day one plans, we're now hard at work executing our longer-term plans, including the realization of synergies which Mike mentioned earlier and we will share more on our progress in future quarters.", "Turning to market conditions, we saw even stronger headwinds in quarter two than we reported during the past three quarters. Pricing was negative across most lines of business as the overall rate change for this segment was down 3% in the quarter and 2% year-to-date. Our casualty and professional businesses were down 1% with only our Cyber and North American Environmental businesses achieving material rate.", "Our Specialty business was down 3%, largely reflecting continued competitive conditions in the aviation lines and our energy, property and construction business were most severely impacted with pricing down in the mid-single digits. That by reductions to the energy book driven largely by the recent fall in oil prices. Given the reality of the markets, we continue to focus on an improved mix of business and our ongoing execution of underwriting actions, measured use of reinsurance and effort to create operating leverage through efficiencies and rigorous expense management. These leaders have delivered continued improvements over the past few years and as XL Catlin, we will have ability to pull these levers even harder.", "In summary, we delivered another solid quarter of underwriting profitability despite the internal focus required to complete the acquisition. With much of this now behind us, both Kelly and I look forward to picking up where Greg left off, continuing our trajectory of underwriting improvement towards top quintile performance. Now to Greg to discuss reinsurance results.", "Greg Hendrick", "Thanks, Paul. Today, I will discuss the results for quarter and provide a few comments on current market conditions. Beginning with the results, the reinsurance segment got off to a great start in our inaugural quarter as XL Catlin with a calendar quarter combined ratio of 74.5% and resulted underwriting profit of $166 million. This compares with the combined ratio of 75.7% and underwriting profit of $105 million for XL's second quarter of 2014. We had the benefit of another quiet quarter of catastrophe losses and continued favorable reserve runoff. The large increase in underwriting profit is a result of our new scale as XL Catlin. Concerning the competitive landscape we're pleased with how the portfolio performed this quarter.", "Excluding prior year development, the portfolio generated an accident quarter combined ratio of 85.3% which compares to the 86.7% produced by XL in the second quarter of 2014. The accident quarter loss ratio decreased 7 points to 50% for the quarter. The primary drivers of loss ratio decrease included 4.8 points related to lower catastrophe activity and 2.3 points due to favorable attritional loss experience.", "Offset improve loss ratio was an expense ratio of 35.3%, up 5 points of expense compared to the second quarter of last year. This increase is a result of purchase accounting adjustments Pete noted earlier which contributed 3.3 points with the remaining increase due to a change in business mix as a result of the Catlin acquisition. Our reserve releases in the quarter were $71 million, compared with $47 million a year ago which benefited a combined ratio by 11 points in both years. The current quarter release was driven primary by favorable runoff in North American and European casualty lines of business as well as favorable prior year catastrophe losses.", "Turning to top line, gross written premium for the quarter was $782 million, up from $493 million in the second quarter of 2014, driven by the Catlin acquisition. Looking at the full quarter for the combined XL Catlin, gross written premium fell 11% relative to the second quarter of last year. Most importantly, just 0.5% or $6 million is part of the 11% drop resulted from aggregational concerns from the XL Catlin combination. This drop was more than offset by increased participations with a number of our core clients.", "Over 60% of this quarter's drop results from the accounting treatment of multi-year premiums written by legacy Catlin. This treatment increased the prior year premium while decreasing the 2015 premium. The remainder of the drop is driven by our underwriting discipline in the face of competitive market conditions and the timing of certain treaties.", "Turning to market conditions, we continue to experience deteriorating rates across most lines and regions during the second quarter and into the July 1 renewals. In general, global property catastrophe rates fell roughly 7.5%, other excessive loss covers fell 5% and steam conditions on pro rod trees grew by 1% to 1.5%. However, we did see a slowing on the rate of a decreases on U.S. property cat. And in particular, roughly $4 billion of increased demand in U.S., primarily in Florida, but due to a number of covers being repriced or unable to be completed at the initial firm order terms. While this may not be a definitive floor, we're encouraged by the pricing discipline emerging in both the traditional and I-loss markets over the last few months.", "In summary, from both a financial and market momentum perspective, we're off to a great start. Our second quarter financial results were strong and while marketing conditions continue to be challenging, strong support from our clients and brokers allowed us to find profitable opportunities. The integration of our two teams into XL Catlin has gone very well and our reinsurance operations are well-positioned for the rest of the year and into the January 1, renewal cycle. I will now turn it back to David.", "David Radulski", "Shirley, can you open the line for questions please?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.", "Kai Pan", "First question, is on the expense ratio. Just wonder, how much is that the accounting adjustments impact overall for the company, as well as how long will it last? Is that a few quarter phenomenon or is that ongoing?", "Pete Porrino", "There is about a $15 million adjustment in the amortization expense that hits the commission and brokerage line for the quarter. I think it would be safe to say that I would expect that to decline slowly over time until it expires in quarter five or six.", "Kai Pan", "And then, maybe this is a bigger picture is that, wouldn't you guys now three months into integration, do you see anything surprise you to either the upside and downside? Given now you have some experience with accounting now, do you have a more detailed in term how do you plan to have the $250 million cost savings by 2017? What I mean is that do you have more granularity, for example, savings for 2015 and 2016?", "Mike McGavick", "I will start with the more general bit and then turn it over to Pete. I would say that, I personally have experienced one negative surprise. That is, having been through a fair amount of large scale corporate activities that have involved job loss, you start to think that somehow you'll get used to it. You never do.", "These things are painful. We're dealing with people and families' plans and lives and we're hard at work at things that are very unpleasant. I would say that I find it just amazing that it is every bit as painful now as it was the very first time I was ever a part of something like this. The second thing though, I would share two positive surprises. One is, we believed that because it was in the -- because these actions were taking place in the context of a merger, that people would be more understanding, that they'd be aware these things kind of go along with it.", "And there, it has been true. Our colleagues have stayed very focused on their clients, very focused on supporting one another even through difficult times and it's just a really remarkable thing to watch. That has been a good thing to experience, I think, for all of us. Finally, I would tell you, the most positive thing of all is, while we thought that the market would really like a company in the shape of XL Catlin, with a deep focus in specialty and deep flexibility around loyds and the globalism and all of the rest, we intellectually knew what the arguments were but to actually see the reaction of our colleagues and to see the reactions, most importantly, of our clients and of our broker partners, it has just been amazing.", "They are excited by what we're building and that excitement has translated into the kind of top line support that we've been able to achieve despite what is a very difficult market. Those things are exhilarating. You realize that, at least some of what you were thinking, is coming true. Whenever you are dealing with strategy and ideas, you're truly exciting to see it translate to numbers. And that's been a really gratifying part of this process.", "In terms of synergies, a couple of high-level comments. Number one, as I mentioned, we're seeing it come together even faster. This suggests that some of those costs that go with the achievement of synergies will take place at higher levels earlier than we originally would have modeled. Of course, that all attaches to the already higher promised $250 million in run rate savings by the end of 2017. I think Pete already referenced that you'd see it climb and then decline. Pete, you might want to give a little more color.", "Pete Porrino", "Well, on the two things, on the synergies just exactly what Mike said. I think we all feel more comfortable every passing month that goes by but I don't think we're at a place now where we would change the overall timing that we've talked about back in May 28. I would say the integration cost, again as Mike said, are coming in quicker than we expected. If I had to sort of ballpark it, I would say for the next couple of quarters, we probably expect them to go up by about 50% each quarter and then drop off after that.", "Kai Pan", "Lastly then maybe for Paul. Given the pricing commentary, clearly is a more competitive marketplace now. Do you see room for underlying loss with your improvements? Do you think the overall combined ratio improvements more coming from the expense side rather than from the loss ratio side? Thanks.", "Paul Brand", "Absolutely, we've got something we can deliver on expenses. I think we could also do some stuff around reinsurance benefits, get a bit more organized around that. And then, generally, underwriting actions and tuning the portfolios and pulling the business properly together. I think we've got quite a lot of tailwinds. Mike referred to the support from brokers and clients, that's tremendous. That really does help. The job is, is making certain those more than offset the headwinds of rate decreases, that's what we got to do.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays. You may ask your question.", "Jay Gelb", "In terms of level settings over the foreseeable future, I think it would be helpful to get a perspective on what gross written premiums for property-casualty could be given we've got Catlin coming in. I'm modeling around $11 billion of gross written premiums of P&C in 2015 and just approaching $14 billion in 2016, taking into account the full year of Catlin. Is that a decent starting point?", "Mike McGavick", "Jay, I'm sorry to be unhelpful but we have not given guidance on top line in that way. We've always tried to talk about the things we can control which is why we're willing to give sort of more explicit guidance around how we view expenses at the end of the year, each year. We have given commentary around how we will treat capital markets, assuming nothing changes in the terms of buybacks.", "Those things we have control over so we can forecast them with a bit more accuracy. What the markets are going to do and how the top line will perform is something you'll have to model based on your assumptions and we'll treat according to ours.", "The one thing I would observe is as we have already said, we have this mantra that one plus one should equal two or more. Meaning that we're not accepting that bringing together two well-run organizations must lead to some kind of dissynergy at the top line. We just don't accept that.", "We think that with the greater balance sheet strength, with the greater capabilities, we should be up to grow, not shrink. The countervailing fact, as I described in the call a couple of months ago, is you've got tremendous headwinds in terms of pricing and we're a bottom line driven shop. And how those two things feather together is what will decide the matter. This quarter and the way each company functioned separately through the six months until the two months that we were together, both indicate that there is a good bias to the idea that we can grow our business, subject, particularly in reinsurance today's market conditions.", "Second, we have from my point of view, looking at new business and submissions, the kinds of activity we're seeing which speaks to the support I've described from the brokers and others, I really like our position. But giving you an absolute forecast is just something we don't do.", "Jay Gelb", "With regard to the return profile with the company generating what I would characterize as a very solid 10% annualized ROE this quarter, do you think that's a reasonable run rate here or perhaps something XL can build on?", "Mike McGavick", "Again, we have said our objective is to run double digit or better ROEs. We had a strong year last year. We've had a good start to this year. We always look at it -- we encourage looking at it by looking through the unrealized gains and losses which we believe is important at a time when the unrealized are high. We also think it's an important at a time when unrealized gains are shifting around and lowering. I think you should always view on some kind of a constant basis to the core performance of the company. We have said that we expect, looking through all of the distortions that will go on, we have said that with that basis in mind, we have expected this transaction to be meaningfully accretive to our ROE. We have no change of view.", "Jay Gelb", "Right. And that's on book value ex AOCI, not just on tangible, right?", "Mike McGavick", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Cliff Gallant with Nomura. You may ask your question.", "Clifford Gallant", "Just one question on the comment you made. A number you gave, Mike, in your prepared remarks. You talked about, I think you said 1%. You identified 1% of business that was lost due to the direct impact of the combination. I'm just wondering, how do you derive that number? Because I assume that there's always some turn in normal lost business that needs to be replaced but all the time.", "Mike McGavick", "Absolutely. What I said was less than 1%, actually. I'm going to ask each, Paul and Greg to comment on their own segment's experience. What we mean by that, at some level, you are right. There is some opaqueness to it but we're looking for the client that says to us, you know, you already were a significant part of my program from both the legacy Catlin and the legacy XL. I can't stomach that much exposure to you combined. I'm either going to cut you back or do something like that. We're looking for direct effect of the transaction on a buyers decision-making.", "I can tell you, overwhelmingly, the direct effect of this balance sheet is clients wanting more connection to us, not less. We even saw that, I mentioned that in the meetings that we held with our brokers at RIMS and our partners at RIMS, people were already offering us additional business. Now whether it's priced to our standards is where we get into challenge. ", "And that's why we have found, absolutely, that it's market conditions that are challenging, not what the transaction has done. The transaction has done nothing but help us with the exception of, as I said, that less than 1% that has something that bothered them that caused them to either cut us back or some other such effect. It's only if it's related to the transaction that we're going to put it in that bucket. Paul?", "Paul Brand", "Yes, I mean we've already carefully monitored risks. We've insisted that eventually we can recapture data on every risk that renews with us saying essentially, has our line been squeezed because of an addition of XL plus Catlin? Or has that happened absolutely correctly as we would expect? As I say, again, this is risk by risk.", "We've got all the underwriters completing this data. We monitor it on a monthly basis. It's one of the first, one of the key metrics that I wanted to institute in terms of measuring process and progress against that goal. We've also been very clear, I think, with the market and with our client by what our ambitions are here. There's no confusion there and there's no confusion internally about what we're trying to achieve. I think if you put those things together, the clarity of the message and monitoring and keeping the metric, again, that just really helps you drive for the right result.", "Greg Hendrick", "Yes and in reinsurance, Cliff, it's the same. We were able to code treaty by treaty, client by client exactly what was lost due to any concern. Over 0.5% was what the number was for reinsurance. I think also we got, like Paul just noted, we were after the client and brokers very early on to make sure that could communicate deeply with them whenever they had concerns. And quite often it ended up the conversation turning from I'm a little concerned to actually, that makes a lot of sense and all things being equal, if there's room, you can have more.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. You may ask your question.", "Brian Meredith", "A couple of quick questions here for you. The first one, just on the peak app adjustments you mentioned, you said what the impact was on the expenses were, Pete. I thought you said there was offsetting on the loss ratio? What was that and where was that?", "Pete Porrino", "Yes, that would've been pretty much the same percentage on the overall book. As I said, more of that was on the insurance side. So that would've been about 0.8% on the insurance loss ratio for the quarter.", "Brian Meredith", "Mike, I'm just curious, to date, you see reading the press reports of some people leaving Catlin. I'm curious, were any of the people that have departed unexpected? When did you -- would rather not have left?", "Brian Meredith", "First of all, let's put it all in context. If you look at the first half of the year, we're only running slightly above the same level of attrition, the level of attrition that we experienced when we add the two firms together in the first six months of last year. The fact that we're going through a major integration and are only seeing slightly more turnover speaks volumes. I will say, that is slightly higher when you reach the underwriting ranks and that we expected because you are bringing together teams of people.", "Sometimes those people have history with each other. There were hot spots that we identified well before the transaction closed. In fact, in some of our earliest meetings, where we knew of people who had used to work together and didn't anymore for a variety of personal reasons and all of that kind of stuff. If I step back and say, are there people we've lost that we'd rather have not lost? Sure, a handful. If I were to step back and say, are there teams we've lost that we would have rather have not lost or not expected? I'd say, maybe one. That was kind of five people. Other than that, no. They were the anticipated hot spots. They played out pretty much as we expected.", "But are there a handful of levers that I wish were excited and had stayed? Sure. This is a big integration. But as against any of our metrics that we had in mind before going into this, it's lower than we expected in that count. In fact, that just makes it a little harder because we have to get to our synergy goals. And if they don't leave voluntarily, sometimes it has to happen another way.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Amit Kumar with Macquarie. You may ask your question.", "Amit Kumar", "Just two quick follow-ups on Catlin. Number one, can you disclose if there was any reserve release benefit from Catlin or not?", "Pete Porrino", "As you know, we closed on May 1 and did a full review at that point in time. The answer would be, no, there was no reserve release. We did not expect one. It will be part of the full reserve review that we do in the fourth quarter.", "Amit Kumar", "And I just quickly related to the discussion on what I guess Cliff was asking regarding aggregation and what was lost. Excluding that, if you look at the legacy book, do you have some sense as to the percentage that was non-renewed which did not meet your return thresholds or is that number not available?", "Greg Hendrick", "Yes, I would say on the reinsurance side, as we went through it, it was roughly about 7.5% to 10% offset clearly by new business and other things going on. That would be both legacy books. We're operating now as XL Catlin, so I don't track what Catlin business we lost or what XL business we lost. It's just what we lost in the aggregate for the quarter.", "Paul Brand", "Overall for insurance, on our retention ratio which is how we measure it year-on-year, is broadly consistent in the mid-80s mark. It varies a bit as you get into different business lines. We're clearly lower retention in those most and negatively affected by pricing. As I said in my prepared remarks, very consistent retention levels year-on-year.", "Amit Kumar", "And if I could quickly sneak one more. Can you broadly talk about, obviously you've seen the Ace-Chubb deal. How does that impact XL going forward? Or how do you view the changing scenario out there with all these acquisitions taking place around you? Thanks.", "Mike McGavick", "We have said for some time and it was certainly what prompted Stephen Catlin and I to begin talking about this in the first place is we see a broad set of industry conditions that are leading, we believed would lead to a broad set of M&A. At the time that we announced the transaction, that was something of an original thought. It isn't anymore. There's been quite a number of subsequent transactions.", "The way to think about a couple of things. One, when you have something like Ace and Chubb come together, I think of that as being one less larger competitor. I think of their as being the same kind of work that we've been going through is about to be gone through by them. Even when I see companies coming together who are more our sites, I kind of have the same reactions. It's one less competitor and another set of two organizations that are going to go through challenges. That is just a marketplace that, to my mind, is pointing towards more companies like the one we're building. The thing that we really appreciate and will try to maximize the value of is going first is good. It gets you through the hoop faster.", "We think we're turning out, at least the early indications are, we're pretty competent at managing this kind of thing and that is showing up. Every day that we get further through the hoop and that others are finding their way through it with all the challenges that goes, every bit of that I like. The market is the market. I think there's going to be more, not less, of this kind of activity. I don't think we're at all done with this wave of M&A because these underlying conditions have not changed and there is a lot of firms that have not yet reacted. I think many may think they like their position.", "I think they are going to find themselves more and more wishing to be part of something broader and deeper. As those realizations come, there will be less and less partners. All of that argues for early, not late and for us liking our position, realizing with all humility, that these are difficult things and they'll be difficult for the other guy. They're difficult for us and that's just the way it is. It's a convulsion of activity the market's growing through. We just feel particularly well-positioned having started early.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dan Farrell with Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question.", "Dan Farrell", "I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you think the balancing buyback and debt reduction as we head into 2016 and 2017 and likely ramping of cash flow in those years? What I'm getting at is, you talked about a goal of wanting to get the debt and preferred down to the low 20s. At the same time, it doesn't seem like there would be a pressing need to get to that level given a lot of that preferred. I'm just wondering how you would balance the two?", "Mike McGavick", "I will start and Pete may have some additional color commentary. This is Mike. First of all, our general approach to share repurchases remains the same as it has always been. Many of you are long-time regulars so I'm not going to bore anybody, but the basic concept is, meet your highest required capital. That's going to usually be asking, at least in this day and age, that could change. Once we're done with that, we have a buffer. That buffer is generally equated to our largest most likely source of loss with a little cushion to that just for the normal vagaries of competition.", "Once were there, we look at how much we got and we say, okay, if we've got capital in excess of that, what's it's best use? For every quarter saved, the quarter of this transaction, the answer was, buy back shares. So we bought back shares. Obviously, we used some of that excess capital in this transaction. As we see, again, the Capitol building up and, obviously, by virtue of buybacks, position of excess to those first two requirements, we've initiated buybacks again at the level we've previously described and are quite comfortable with that.", "Now, the question with respect to mixing debt repurchase in, the transaction, when all got said and done, we wound up a bit better on the leverage ratio than we had forecast going into the transaction. We maintained a goal of being middle of the pack. Middle of the pack is not a stagnant notion because with all of this M&A, you're going to see some of that number move around over time and probably move toward us a little bit. But nonetheless, its clear to us that over time, the flexibility that is gained by some reduction in the debt is wise.", "I think what you are going to see is a continued appreciation for the value of buybacks. You are going to see a continued attention to how we could, perhaps, opportunistically think about the debt level but you're not going to see a sudden drive to get it down. This is the same approach we used the last time that got us to our goal over a handful of years. I have the same mindset here. There's no urgent drive here. We'll just look at how the flexibility it creates for us and keep it in balance with the share repurchases.", "Pete Porrino", "The only thing I would add to that is if you do look at our debt maturity schedule, you will see the first debt coming due in 2018. We talked about very modest repurchases of debt. I think that would continue to be the right guidance there.", "Dan Farrell", "And then a quick question on how to think about components of expense management. The corporate segment costs to be well controlled this quarter. As we think about costs getting taken now, if there is more coming out of corporate first and then some of the operating segment costs follow a little later or if there's no time to think about there? Thanks.", "Pete Porrino", "As you all know, we manage our costs on a total basis irregardless of whether they are corporate or in the insurance or reinsurance segment. That continues to that day. Corporate expenses as a percent of our total expenses went down this quarter after taking out the integration costs and transaction costs. I think it would probably make sense to you that you would expect to see that, right? We continued the push on retaining every underwriter that makes sense for us to retain. Clearly, there's more pressure on some of the more functional areas. I think you would see that reflected in, what I said, the corporate expenses being a lower percentage.", "Mike McGavick", "And corporate expenses also contain some of the larger strategic investments that we have made over time. Some of those are rationalized during the course of the transaction.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ian Gutterman with Balyasny. You may ask your question.", "Ian Gutterman", "I guess to start, first, Greg, you went a little fast for me. I missed it. Was the 11% decline number you talked about, was that premium decline for the combined Catlin and XL reinsurance? What was that?", "Greg Hendrick", "If you took three months of 2014 XL Catlin together and three months of 2015. So it's XL Catlin to XL Catlin.", "Ian Gutterman", "That's what I thought. In the press release, I think it said down 3% ex Catlin. Does that imply to be a total 11 that Catlin was down well more than 11?", "Greg Hendrick", "Yes. That was where, as I refer to in my remarks, that was the impact of that multi-year accounting.", "Ian Gutterman", "Can you give a sense of what Catlin only was then ex the multi-year?", "Greg Hendrick", "I cannot do that at the moment. I will have to come back to you.", "Ian Gutterman", "Okay, got it. What I'm getting at big picture is, was there more pressure just based on -- not reception to the merger, but just business mix and the market conditions on the Catlin reinsurance top line than XL or was it similar for things were kind of apples to apples?", "Greg Hendrick", "Absolutely similar to both. The books have some nice diversification to them but they also have some overlap. This is purely how you book a three-year reinsurance treaty pre the May 1 acquisition and post the May 1 acquisition. Nothing to do with anything of a client or brokers view of the Catlin book.", "Ian Gutterman", "Pete, this is a request more than a question. The last two pages with the first half 2014 performance was helpful. Can we get that for second half of 2014, hopefully, before the third quarter call?", "Pete Porrino", "What I can tell you that you can't get, this is Pete again, is the third quarter. One thing that we're limited to is only to release those periods at which Catlin had released it publicly. They only released six months results and so we would not be able to do a nine-month number. To be honest, Ian, we haven't concluded. We'll want to talk to you and others and understand the value of that last two pages of the financial supplement.", "Ian Gutterman", "Okay, we can maybe discuss it offline. But I think it would be helpful to have -- maybe if I can ask this? I assume I can't take the reported Catlin 2014 numbers, subtract the first half Catlin you show and get to their second half because of accounting differences?", "Pete Porrino", "Right. You wouldn't be able to do that for one reason. For example, differences in corporate reporting. The other would be, former Catlin did not separate insurance and reinsurance.", "Ian Gutterman", "Right. We can follow-up on that offline. And then, the other one that I want to understand a little bit better, is there invested assets, invested income leverage is much lower than not just your P&C book but I think your traditional P&C book? Is there any color you can give on why the invested asset leverage is so low there?", "Pete Porrino", "There are two things. One's invested the leverage is lower because they wrote a shorter tail book of business than historical XL wrote. The other question, I think implied in that is the yield. We talked about it before. It was a very short duration asset book, even shorter than what the liabilities would have indicated.", "Ian Gutterman", "And then, Mike, I want to ask you sort of a bigger picture question I asked on another conference call about tangible book. This is becoming obviously a bigger issue for folks with all the deals going on. I want to get your thoughts on why tangible book's the most appropriate measure for XL because you seem to highlight that over reported book.", "My premise of why I would disagree with that is, first of all, it seems every 8-K or proxy that comes out along the way, the goodwill's moved up or down $100 million, $200 million at a time. It seems just a concept of tangibles is a bit fuzzy to begin with as far as what the right number is. Isn't the better way to look at it, obviously XL in its past has had some deals that did not work out and it wasn't that the market didn't know and so you took a goodwill write off five years later.", "We knew because your ROE wasn't good on reported book. If the Catlin deal works well, we'll know because you earn an appropriate ROE in the total capital invested. Not just the tangible capital invested. Why isn't ROE on total book and growth in total book a better measure for the company's success than tangible?", "Mike McGavick", "First of all, of course, you have all of those measures and you can judge as a shareholder which you are going to value the most. We have found, we think that the tangible book, the tangible capital is the better measure of what we're controlling and doing and a lot of the rest of this is the usual vagaries of the accounting rules around transactions. You can do it whatever way you want, Ian and I'm sure you do. I think the reality for us is that I think the tangible remains a better core measure of what decisions we're making with the capital available to us.", "Pete Porrino", "Other than enjoying reading the transcripts as this gets argued from company to company, we look at it both ways. When we do an acquisition, we look at it both ways and when we look at our reported results, we look at it both ways. I don't think one is better than the other. I think they serve two different purposes and you use them accordingly. I have been enjoying reading the transcripts.", "Ian Gutterman", "I will be happy to discuss it offline if you want. Thanks.", "Mike McGavick", "This is just more of a commentary on Pete than the rest of us. And Ian, on your earlier question, I've had a number of conversations with our finance group about how to report and a number of conversations with Pete. This is a very difficult thing. On one hand, we're always devoted to doing all we can to help you understand what is really going on in the book of business.", "On the other hand, when we create reports that don't give us any insight, if in managing the company, it becomes very difficult to justify the expense, especially at a time of extreme imposition on our finance department and others to try and get the work done and the insight we need to actually judge the business day to day.", "I'm sure you appreciate the tension that's created and we're doing our best we can to create what we think is meaningful information for you to use within the legal constraints of how companies actually report it over time and we'll continue to. But we're also mindful that we've got a finance department that is stretched and that will be stretched until the systems all come together over the next year or so. We have to be mindful of that too. And that's the direction I've given Pete is to balance it as carefully as possible. Do what we can but let's not create a lot of stuff that in the end, isn't useful as to us managing the business.", "Operator", "And your final question comes from Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.", "Ryan Tunis", "Just one for Pete following up on Ian's question about the investment portfolio. It sounds like the asset duration there is a little bit lighter than liability duration. I was wondering if you could quantify what you think you could be running that duration at if it were matched? Along those lines, Pete, you also said that the pro forma portfolio will benefit from internal management. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that if that pertains to mix or anything along those lines?", "Pete Porrino", "Sure, Ryan, it's Pete. If we match duration, you'd probably be somewhere around 0.3 years, maybe slightly more than that. But I think that's a good ballpark. And then as far as the question about the internally managed, that really would be on the same assets that we have today. It would be taking and it has been pro forma Catlin, it has been doing it and we will be doing it at former XL. We haven't transitioned it quite yet. But it would be taking the more of the vanilla type of investments that are in the fixed income portfolio and managing those in house.", "Ryan Tunis", "And I was hoping for maybe for some help on thinking about a run rate for large losses. I'm not sure what you can give us there but is there a way to quantify what we can expect as a quarterly run rate? I know that was sort of an issue for Catlin. Any help there? Appreciate it.", "Mike McGavick", "We've looked at that question time and time again and never being able to come up with something that we thought would be very useful. We continue to have our own experience to show the kind of volatility we should expect in a book like this.", "What we concentrate more on is making sure that our reinsurance strategies and our limit strategies are well meshed to create volatility the book can absorb. That I think we're having success around. But actually predicting a level across the various segments we have that have a propensity towards volatility, the volatility is too little spread across too many places that wind up yielding something that we think is very predictable our useful.", "Operator", "Thank you. I'm going to turn the call back over to the speakers.", "Mike McGavick", "Great. This is Mike. First of all, thank you very much. I know very well that given all of the noise that goes into the numbers at a time like this that you all are working even harder to try and understand this. We know that that complexity will decline over time as the results become clearer and become measured against themselves instead of against pro forma numbers.", "We look forward to working through this with you as well as we can. We really do appreciate your for forbearance and thoughtfulness as we work through it. At the same time and I know here I'm particularly conscious that we always have a lot of our colleagues on the phone as well, we simply couldn't be prouder of what our colleagues are doing to get us through this transition in an effective way to make sure that we're fast and fair with our people and to make sure that our clients and brokers understand the strength of what we've created and why it is that we knowingly are going through something so complex to deliver something that we think is really special.", "It's clear, the early reports are clear to me and I think clear in the numbers and clear across the market, that XL Catlin has been well received. It's viewed as a thoughtful and well-structured transaction. We're incredibly excited about what its potential is and we think we're starting to see some of that potential in this very quarter.", "The real credit to that goes to the thousands of people on the ground dealing with clients and brokers and with each other's needs. We're very grateful for their hard work every day. Thanks everybody for the call and we'll look forward to the next report.", "Operator", "Thank you. This does conclude today's conference.

My name is Shirley, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the XL Group Plc Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "David Radulski", "Thank you, Shirley. Welcome to our conference call. Our call today is being simultaneously webcast at www.xlcatlin.com and www.xlgroup.com. We have posted to our website several documents including our press release and quarterly financial supplement.", "On our call today Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, will offer opening remarks, Pete Porinno, XL's Chief Financial Officer, will review our financial results, followed by Paul Brand, our Chief Underwriting Officer and Chair of our Insurance Leadership Team, and Greg Hendrick, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations, who will review their segment results and market conditions. Then we will open it up for questions.", "Before we begin, I would like to remind you that certain of the matters we will discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations all of which involve risk and uncertainty and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them.", "Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors including those identified in our most recent reports on forms 10-Q and 10-K as well as other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.", "Forward-looking statements speak only as the date of which they are made and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement also new information, future developments or otherwise.", "With that, I will turn it over to Mike McGavick.", "Mike McGavick", "Good evening. Thank you for joining our call. We have been eager to have this discussion regarding our Q3 results as this is the quarter where the underlying fundamentals of our newly combined business continues to prove themselves, but obviously the miss to estimates could create a different impression. In some ways that there is difficulty in modeling our progress is understandable.", "We know that everyone is trying to get a handle on the future earnings potential of XL Catlin and there was so much going that it is tough to do. You can see evidence of this in the very wide spread of analyst expectation. In my now 30 XL earnings calls, this is the fifth widest spread of estimates and before that we are larger surrounded major external events like Hurricane Sandy, so our view of tonight's job is simple, be as clear as we can about how the business is performing and where there are opportunities to clarify items that we think are prone to miss estimation, we will try and help.", "Let me start with that overall idea. The business itself is performing as expected or better and we are incredibly excited by the additional opportunities we are seeing and the fundamental strength of this new company.", "Let us look at some fundamentals. In the third quarter XL Catlin produced a P&C combined ratio of 95.3% and our accident year combined ratio was 96.3%. This was a relatively light CAT quarter, and offsetting that, we did experience the Tianjin explosion. With respect to Tianjin, it is noticeable that our level of losses relative to our market share came in as we expected.", "Both companies came into this transaction with admired underwriting cultures. Tianjin was another proof point that the discipline remains once the companies are combined.", "With regard to the top-line, we produced $2.6 billion in gross written premium versus $2.8 billion in the same quarter a year ago, when compared on historical basis and adjusted for FX, so let's consider the top-line a bit further.", "First, many had modeled some drop in business due to overlap and alike. We certainly did in modeling the transaction pre acquisition, but in fact that is less than 1% of the business that has been lost is due to merger impacts. We are delighted with this result.", "Second, market conditions remained difficult. Despite these conditions, we are seeing more opportunities to write business than ever before. This is because our brokers and our clients have seen the benefits of our new position in the marketplace and our working eagerly to find more to do it together.", "Our meetings at the Reinsurance, Rendez-Vous, CIAB, FERMA, Baden-Baden and now at PCI, all affirmed again very high broker and clients report for this transaction. I know that many of the analysts and investors on this call have their own market contacts to that which they can collaborate what we are saying.", "As we complete the upcoming 1:1 renewal cycle, we have been through the entire renewal book with the merger either in mind or in place. In fact, you could argue with the pre-Christmas week of the proposal deal last year, some 1:1 renewals are already market tested as well and the retention levels are staying at historical norms. This too is incredibly gratifying.", "Third, we are doing a good job of walking away from business where appropriate. There has been much talk of pricing pressures for example in the specialty insurance and the overall reinsurance marketplace. While Paul Brand and Greg Hendrick will give more detail in a moment, let me offer two proof points of our continuing discipline.", "Our overall top-line and insurance adjusted for FX is slightly up, but that masks our adjustment to our mix of business according to profitable opportunity. For example, it is well known that in the energy sector where we are leading writer is going through a rough patch, rates are off around 10%.", "Because we are even more cautious, our writings are down 26% in the energy segment in this quarter. On the other hand, we like our opportunities in political risk and crisis management, taking together premiums there are up 23% year-over- year. In other words, we are continuing to remix the books according to profitable opportunity.", "Turning to Reinsurance, while the business there is a lumpier quarter to quarter, as you will hear more from Greg in a moment, consider that on a year-to-date basis, adjusted for FX, Reinsurance is down about 5% overall, given the rate environment that makes sense. We also know that in North America casualty, where we are especially concerned, we have reduced our writings by 11% year-to-date.", "We are bottom-line underwriters. In this regard, there is no change. Even with Tianjin, in the quarter we produced a P&C underwriting profit of $114 million and both segments were profitable.", "Of course, it is foremost the capabilities of our people that make all of this possible. Here too are few important thoughts. Over the next several weeks, we will finish our second and last round of employee consultations in London. It is now true that the vast majority of our colleagues who have been or will be affected by this transaction already know their personal outcome, but they are leaving the firm now or in the future.", "The speed with which we have acted has been a critical factor and keeping voluntary turnover of key people well below our pre-deal forecast and only modestly above prior-year levels. During this quarter, there were wonderful reminders of our colleagues' ability to stay focused on clients. For example, the recent Gracechurch survey confirmed our leading position across underwriting claims and overall reputation in the London market. A recent U.S. broker survey also showed us our leading our peers in claims service.", "In Singapore, we were recently recognized as Aon's Asia innovator of the year. Given all that is going on, this is a remarkable set of external validations of our people and their capabilities and Management is very proud to be their colleagues.", "Turning to the last of the transaction related variables and that is expensive savings. We have already raised our estimated savings from $200 million to $300 million on a runway basis to $250 million on a run rate basis. We are ahead of schedule in the synergy savings, with $54 million saved year-to-date. The savings increments needed for 2016 are already built into our budgets and that $250 million will be attained.", "Taking together, considering the top-line retained and the fact that we are mostly through a complete renewal cycle, considering the remixing of the book to offset the difficult market conditions, considering the retention levels of our people and their award-winning continuing focus on client, given what that says in total about the reaction of brokers, clients and colleagues, and given that savings continue to meet our commitments, our view is that once the 2016 activities become incorporated into our budget, we will view next year as much more of a business year as usual, just a bit heavy on the continuous improvement activities than in a normal year.", "Having said all that, what else is going on in the quarter and where might this misalignment to estimates have most occurred? There are few things to consider here. The first is PYD. If you look at the consensus for what we were estimated to release and what we are in fact announcing is big delta, but as you know we have a long-established with quarters one and three being in A versus E quarter and our deep dives in quarters two and four to really get at our last picks. That is why we mentioned in our last call and maybe we did not say it strongly enough that we would not expect to see any releases from the legacy Catlin book during this third quarter and in fact there were not any.", "In the spirit of giving information when this estimation is possible, I would say to be mindful that we are still in the process of harmonizing the two legacy books to common reserving principles. You can see how that process could have some dampening impact on future PYD. We do not know that to be true yet as the work is still being done, but you can see how a process like this might alter what you would naturally estimate simply looking at past experience of the firms respectively.", "Second, I mentioned that the vast majority of our colleagues already know or will know shortly any effect on their job due to the transaction. While speed is critical to reducing anxiety and confusion for our colleagues, it also means that we are moving faster through our estimates of integration expenses, so integration related expenses were $55 million in the quarter, higher than the number we had guided you toward on our last call.", "We believe that there is real benefit of speeding this process, so we will continue to move as fast as possible and we remain ambitious about growing these synergies over time. That said in the spirit of giving you clarity where we can as it is proven difficult to give you an accurate estimate of these costs, we will post the integration related expense number for the fourth quarter to our website ahead of the fourth quarter call.", "Then third, the affiliate income portion of our investment portfolio is near zero, due to the recent financial market volatility. The bulk of the impact coming in the hedge fund managed portion of our investments. Offsetting these was a one-time positive benefit impact. Net of these four items, the estimate variance is more than explained.", "In the end, the fundamentals of our business are proving to be strong. Our integration is increasingly shifting to business as usual and we are continuing to see new opportunities which did not come our way before. As we look at the quarter in total, we are excited.", "We will continue to believe that we are on track to deliver double-digit expansion in EPS and meaningful lift in ROE.", "With that, I will turn it over to Pete.", "Pete Porinno", "Thanks, Mike, and good evening. We have been a combined company for only five months. As such, this represents our first full quarter of consolidated results.", "Operating net income for the third quarter was $71 million or $0.23 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to $187 million in 2014 or $0.70 per share.", "As we indicated during our previous calls, we have excluded direct transaction cost from operating income, but included integration costs. During the third quarter, we incurred $1 million in Catlin deal-related transaction costs and $55 million in integration costs. As Mike noted, this is higher than we forecast you to on last quarter's call as we have moved faster than expected on all elements of our integration plan.", "We expect that by the end of the year, we will have provided the vast majority of our colleges with clarity on their position with the company going forward and we will have identified our major systems and infrastructure design changes. From that point, we are truly in business as usual mode on all fronts.", "We continue to expect that the relationship of one-time integration costs, the run rate synergies will remain as we previously estimated at 125%. Our net income attributable to ordinary shareholders for the quarter was $27 million or $0.09 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to $72 million or $0.27 per share in 2014.", "As we had previously noted, our net income numbers are impacted by the mark-to-market movement of the derivatives that transfer the economics of the assets backing our second quarter 2014 life reinsurance transaction. We continue to show that relationship in the summary consolidated financial data included with the press release. As always, it is no impact on comprehensive income or operating results.", "Our P&C combined ratio for the quarter was 95.3% or 5.2 points higher than the same quarter last year. Our accident year combined ratio for the quarter was 96.4%, 3.9 points higher than the third quarter of 2014.", "The chemical warehouse explosion Tianjin has significantly impacted the quarter. Excluding this loss, the accident year combined ratio for the quarter is consistent with third quarter of 2014.", "For the quarter, our natural catastrophe losses totaled $31 million or 1.3 loss ratio points. By comparison, net losses from natural catastrophes in the same quarter of 2014 totaled $30 million or two loss ratio points. Paul and Greg will discuss our underwriting results in further detail.", "The third quarter prior year reserve development was a net favorable $28 million arising from the legacy XL reserves or 1.1 loss ratio points compared to a net favorable $35 million and 2.4 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2014. This reflects unfavorable development of $7 million in Insurance segment, driven primarily by the impact of an unfavorable judgment on a single claim.", "The Reinsurance segment had favorable development of $35 million. As we have discussed in previous calls, during the first and third quarters, our reserving process is based on review of actual versus expected loss activity for the property, international construction and entre energy lines of business insurance and for non-U.S. business in reinsurance.", "The remainder of our business, including casualty, professional and specialty insurance lines and all U.S. reinsurance lines of business are reviewed in depth semiannually during the second and fourth quarters. This business tends to be medium to long tail in nature, which generally requires at least two quarters of additional information to credibly imply changes to ultimate loss ratios.", "As I noted in our call last quarter and Mike mentioned earlier, we are aligning reserve methodologies and assumptions between the two legacy books. The results of this review will form part of our usual fourth quarter full valuation update.", "As we indicated previously, our normal purchase GAAP accounting adjustments will earn its income over the next number of quarters. Overall the impact is relatively small; however, certain line items can be distorted in each quarter. To the extent that these are meaningful, they will be noted by Paul and Greg.", "Operating expenses have increased materially in the quarter as a result of the combination. Overall, however, the run rate operating expense level of company continues to move towards the expected level of transaction expense synergies. On an annualized basis, our third quarter expenses excluding integration costs are approximately 5% less than the combined companies' 2014 expenses adjusted to align accounting practices.", "If you recall, we indicated that we intend to measure our strategy levels against the run rate cost base of a low single-digit increase on a combined 2014 expense levels from the two companies. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded tax benefit of $31.6 million resulting in a negative effective tax rate.", "The tax benefit in the quarter is driven by our ability to utilize certain of the legacy Catlin entities, U.S. deferred tax assets as we restructure our legal entities in the United States. Our operating tax rate excluding the direct tax benefit from the legal entity restructuring has declined to slightly less than 10% primarily due to the favorable change in the geographic distribution mix of income.", "Turning to the investment portfolio, net investment income excluding the life funds withheld assets was $179 million or $9 million above the same quarter last year, primarily due to the addition of the legacy Catlin portfolio or offset by the impact of lower investment yields.", "Gross book yield of the portfolio at the end of September remained at 2.4% consistent with the second quarter. During the quarter, our average new money rate was 1.7% given current yields, net investment income will continue to remain under pressure as we are approximately $4.2 billion of assets with book yields of 2.4% rolling off over the next 12 months.", "Net income from investment fund and investment manager affiliates was $2 million for the quarter, down $38 million from a strong prior year quarter, driven primarily by our hedge fund portfolio with a negative market backdrop provided a strong headwind to a number of our event-driven and market-neutral funds.", "Net income from other operating activities was $2 million, lower than the same quarter last year attributable to the sale of ARX Holdings on April 1st.", "Net realized gains, excluding derivatives were flat for the quarter, down $10 million in the prior year. Our unrealized gain position declined by $101 million for the quarter, driven primarily by our equity portfolio against the negative market environment, while with fixed income, gains from lower U.S. treasury yields were largely offset by unrealized losses from credit spread widening.", "Unrealized net gains were $746 million at the end of the quarter. Altogether, the total return on investments was 0.2% for the quarter excluding FX. The duration of the total portfolio, which includes P&C and the remaining life assets was 3.2 years at the end of the quarter and remained short the duration of all of our liabilities.", "We continue to anticipate bouts of volatility in the market reflecting uncertainty around the timing of the U.S. rate hike and the consequent impact on the market and wider economy.", "With respect to capital management, during the quarter, the Company paid ordinary dividends of $61 million in preferred share dividends of $57 million, preferred share dividends in the quarter included the semiannual payment of $22 million in the legacy Catlin preferred share dividends for the first time as a combined entity. These dividends are paid semiannually in January and July.", "We plan to execute in the fourth quarter a very limited liability management program and will redeem legacy Catlin subordinated debt amounting to approximately $91 million. The proposed action improves operational efficiency and is part of streamlining our capital structure.", "We continue to execute share buybacks during the third quarter. Our Board of Directors approved a new share buyback program in our August meeting, authorizing the repurchase of up to $1 billion of our ordinary shares, replacing the remaining amounts under our previous share buyback authorization.", "During the third quarter, we purchased 4.8 million shares for $180 million at an average price of $37.85 per share leaving $880 million available for purchase under our share buyback program. We continue to view these buybacks as an efficient capital management tool and the continued purchasing in line with philosophy we discussed in May.", "I will now turn it over to Paul to discuss our insurance segment results.", "Paul Brand", "Thanks Pete. Today, I will cover the results for the segment, prove an update on integration and finish with remark from current market conditions. First the result, third quarter marked our 11th consecutive quarter of profitability, with the segment producing calendar quarter combined ratio of 97.2% compared to 94.7% in the same quarter last year and year-to-date combined ratio of 96.4% versus 94.6% in 2014.", "PYD strengthening of $7 million compared to release of $20 million in Q3 2014 accounts to 2.4-point to-2.5 point deterioration. The remaining variance is a result of our acquisition expenses offset by an improvement in our operating expense ratio, lower CAT activity and lower accident year ex-CAT loss ratio.", "On an accident quarter, ex-CAT basis, the combined ratio was 96.3% compared to 94.8 in quarter three 2014. While this is higher than we would expect, it should be noted that the insurance portion of Tianjin loss equals to 1.5% difference in the segment combined ratio. If we look at the first three quarters, the reported accident year ex-CAT combined ratio of 95.3% similar to the 95.1% we reported in 2014, demonstrating that we could absorb the Tianjin loss without jeopardizing profitability.", "For Q3, we reported an acquisition ratio of 13.2%, which was 3.8 percentage points higher than Q3 2014. This is because the legacy Catlin business included a larger share of wholesale specialty business, largely from the Lloyd's platform, where the acquisition costs are higher than the legacy XL business.", "This is offset by a lower loss ratio as reflected in our Q3 net accident year ex-CAT loss ratio of 62.7%, which was 1.3 percentage points lower than Q3 2014, just under three points lower when adjusted for the Tianjin loss.", "Insurance gross premiums written in Q3 increased by 66% or $876 million year-over-year, driven largely from the Catlin acquisition, this growth occurred in all four of our underwriting divisions, with the biggest growth continuing in our energy, property and construction and specialty divisions.", "When me look at the full course of the both legacy organizations and normalize the foreign-exchange, our actually year-over-year growth is roughly 1% in Q3 and 3% year-to-date. While this growth is not as robust as recent quarters, it does reflect our success in maintaining the two legacy portfolios while at the same time writing new business that is on par with 2014. Given current market conditions, this growth is something we continue to be extremely proud of.", "Shifting to progress and integration let me share a few highlights from Insurance segment perspective. Firstly, the market response to the deal continues to be very favorable. Having just returned from CIAB, I can tell you first time that there was an increased enthusiasm within the broker community to work more closely with us given all greater market prominence.", "Kelly experienced much of the same sentiment from both, brokers and clients; on last month's FERMA conference and it is not just talk. Our retentions continue to track well with historical trends and our new business opportunities continue to be strong despite market conditions.", "Second, whilst our leadership teams were announced last quarter, we have now finalized our entire underwriting organization from top to bottom retaining key talent and with minimal disruptions.", "Third, we have made further advancements in centralizing our outwards reinsurance purchasing. We combined several programs and we are on track to deliver $50 million in savings in 2016. With regard to our longer term and state plans, we have made significant strides with regards to our pricing methodologies, our operating model and our legal entity structures, while at the same time focusing on our synergy opportunities. We will continue to share our progress in future quarters.", "Turning to market conditions, the headwind we expected in Q2 have continued, pricing was negative across most lines of business as the overall rate change for the segment was down 2% in the quarter and year-to-date. However, this was a result of general decreases in rate being offset by broadly flat rate in some lines. For example, Casualty North America, as well as some increases, most notably Cyber and Environmental North America.", "Overall, our Casualty and Professional businesses were down just 1%. Our Specialty business was down 2%, largely reflecting continued competitive conditions in the aviation lines and our energy, property and construction businesses were once again we severely impacted, with pricing down in the mid-single digit led by reductions of the energy book as well as our international North American property books.", "Despite these market headwinds, we continue to focus on margin expansion by improving our mix of business, leveraging analytics into underwriting actions, increase our reinsurance efficiency and creating operating leverage through increased productivity and rigorous expense management.", "In addition, we continue to make strategic investments in our claims capabilities that should also deliver meaningful improvement to our bottom-line. In summary, we delivered another solid quarter of underwriting profitability, continue to grow the book and made significant progress on our integration. As we finalize our plans and prepare for 2016, we firmly believe we are positioned to continue our trajectory of underwriting improvements towards top quintile performance.", "Now, to Greg to discuss Reinsurance results.", "Greg Hendrick", "Thanks Paul. Today, I will discuss the results for the quarter, provide some thoughts on Tianjin loss and close with the current market condition.", "Beginning with the results, the Reinsurance segment produced a solid result despite an active loss quarter with the calendar quarter combined ratio of 91.2% and resulting underwriting profit of $68 million. This compares with the combined ratio 79.2% and an underwriting profit of $90 million for the third quarter of 2014, with the benefit of a relatively quiet quarter of catastrophe losses and continued favorable reserve run-off.", "The decrease in underwriting profit is mainly attributable to losses from the explosion in Tianjin, China. Considering this loss and a competitive landscape, we are pleased with the results for this quarter.", "Excluding prior development, the portfolio generated an accident quarter combined ratio of 95.8%, which compares to the 82.7% produced by XL in the third quarter of 2014. The accident quarter loss ratio increased eight points to 59.8% for the quarter. The primary driver of the loss ratio increase is related to Tianjin.", "Further, the expense ratio of 36% was up 4.9 points from the third quarter of last year. This increase is a result of purchase accounting adjustments Pete noted earlier, which contributed 2.2 points with remaining increase due to a change in business mix as a result of the Catlin acquisition and higher ceding commissions as a result of the competitive marketplace.", "Our reserved leases in the quarter were $35 million compared with $15 million a year ago, which benefitted the combined ratio by 4.6 and 3.5 points, respectively.", "The current quarter release was driven primarily by favorable runoff in our European casualty, property treaty and marine lines of business.", "Turning to the top-line, grocery written premium for the quarter was $459 million, up from $276 million in the third quarter of 2014, driven by the Catlin acquisition. With the third quarter being a relatively lower top-line quarter, the year-to-date volume is more reflective of our portfolio premium.", "On a year-to-date basis for the combined XL Catlin, gross written premium fell 6% relative to the same nine-month as last year. This reduction was driven by the timing of certain treaties, lower multi-year premium and foreign-exchange.", "Consistent with last quarter, less than a 0.5% or $8 million, part of the 6% drop resulted from client concerns about the XL-Catlin combination. This drop is more than offset by $70 million of new business written in the third quarter alone.", "Shifting to the tragic explosion in Tianjin, the segment recorded $70 million of net losses. Our estimates based on extensive client by client review of our portfolio, our prudent reserve for losses that are not allocated to client and local dollars to our Shanghai and Beijing offices.", "Our detailed lost estimate corresponds to nearly $3 billion loss estimate for our client, which translates the high-end of the current market loss estimates. It is important to note this is a very complex man-made loss that will short-tail in nature may have long tail characteristics as it is adjusted.", "Turning to the market conditions, we continue to experience deteriorating rates across most lines and regions during the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, global property catastrophe rates fell roughly 7.5%, other excessive loss covers fell 5% and ceding commissions on pro rata premium grew by 1 point to 1.5 points.", "Through our early renewal meetings, we are seeing increased demand from some clients as well as the general acknowledgment that rate decreases are slowing across the reinsurance marketplace.", "In summary, while our profitably in the quarter decreased due to Tianjin, our market momentum continues to be very positive. Our recent meetings in Monte Carlo, CIAB and Baden-Baden, all reinforced our leadership position in the market. We continue to get very strong support from our clients and brokers and we are well-positioned as we are headed in the January 1 renewals.", "I will now turn it back to David.", "David Radulski", "Shirley, can you open the lines for questions please?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thanks. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead with your question.", "Kai Pan", "Thank you so much for the detailed description of the discrepancies on the PBD [ph] and other items for the quarter, just want to follow-up on the large losses Tianjin, is there any sort of like losses related to the Volkswagen investigation?", "Overall, if you look at your CAT losses as well as large losses, how do you feel about the combined organization compare with that you had XL legacy business and do you feel that we will see more volatility in terms of your earnings in the past.", "Mike McGavick", "This is Mike. Hi. Thanks for the comment. On the question first of all with respect to Tianjin, we were very pleased with our results. It was very much in line with what we would have expected given our presence in Asia and given our relative position in both insurance and reinsurance that we were gratified by.", "With respect to Volkswagen, which I know is very much on peoples' minds, first simply in the nature of these contracts that we do not disclose individual client relationships. In the rare cases, where that does happen, it usually has to do with either other reports in the marketplace or with somehow the level of losses with respect to that particular name exceeding what we would consider kind of the point at we would have to think about materiality and disclosure.", "I think you can take some comfort from the fact that we are not commenting specifically on that loss at this time.", "Kai Pan", "I understood. Then my second question, if you look at your comments about market condition actually getting tougher, you try to maintain the top-line as well as the investing continue under pressure, because low rate environment. In such a condition, how do you see we getting from the current level year-to-date about 7% ROE into a double-digit or what are drivers and what timeframe in your guys' mind that we can get there?", "Mike McGavick", "First I will get to the ROE expansion in a minute. Finishing the answer to your earlier question, I apologize. In terms of large losses in the quarter, they were largely in line with prior year. Nothing really exceptional to speak of and we do believe that Tianjin in fact makes the point that we can have very large losses in the quarter and still remain profitable some level. I think that is greater absorbency and large loss than we would historically have, so we are actually very pleased with the spread of the book of business in the way that can continue our longstanding effort to try and reduce volatility by having greater diversity in the portfolio.", "The second thing with respect to the ROE expansion, clearly we continue to believe that this will meaningfully uplift ROE. We have never given an exact timeframe to a double-digit target, though that certainly is what we expect over time. The main uplifts are coming kind of two parts if you think about it.", "One, you see a good story at this stage of our ability to continue to remix our book of business to offset market conditions and I think our overall attritional loss ratios continue to show that strengthened certainly better than you would have expect given pure rate impact, so that is a piece of the story.", "Second and critical piece of the story is expenses. At this stage in the cycle, we are all in a very difficult headwinds. You mentioned interest rate environment, that ain't going to change. You heard Pete talk about the downward pressure on the reinvestment rate, but at the same time, we believe one of the most important aspects of this transaction was the way in which the two companies offset each other's weaknesses with regard to expense and we are diligently trying to bring that to truth and that is the way in which we were building out at XL, a global specialty platform, obviously combining with Catlin completes that. We are now truly in a leadership position.", "Second, of course, Catlin had been building out a global platform that too was not yet fully scaled and added through the existing XL global platform. We really have that fully global capability at a much more affordable basis, so our view is that by delivering on the synergy is implicit in those two comments on the general synergies available in any combination of two publicly traded companies, we believe that that together with managing against these headwinds and by mixing our book of business, we really believe we can deliver what we have said that is meaningful ROE expansion and obviously at this point we have the benefit of having early views of 2016 plans that we are certainly seeing the progress we expected.", "Kai Pan", "That is great. Just lastly, you outlined back in May about the major bucket of cost saving 215, G&A, about 30 from investment, 50 from claims and 50 from reinsurance. It looks like we are going to realize potentially the 50 in reinsurance. How about the other buckets? You have any updates in terms of magnitude as well as timing of those? Thanks.", "Mike McGavick", "We are on track for those. Of course the 50 for the reinsurance was the estimate for next year. The others are estimates over time, not in the same timeframe, and we do all of those estimates through '17, which is when we expect all of things to be fully actualize on those - so we would not describe those to be fully actualized next year. The reinsurance piece, which we think is a portion of what we can ultimately do the $50 million is for next year.", "Kai Pan", "Thank you so much for the answers.", "Mike McGavick", "Pete, you have something to?", "Pete Porinno", "Kai Pan, it is Pete. Just to add one thing to what Mike said or two things on the on the investment bucket, I would say part of that was around expense saves and part of that was around extending duration from the legacy Catlin portfolio. The expense saves, the actions of been taken those - the expenses saves will come in next year. The extended duration as you could tell from my comments, we still have not fully extended to what the liability duration would be, so that is still lagging behind. On the claims, as Mike said - as I said on the on the call post the transaction that those would come in as claim start coming in, we harmonize the processes, so those will take some time to come in.", "Kai Pan", "Thank you, Pete.", "Operator", "Thank you. The question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays. You may ask your question.", "Jay Gelb", "Thank you. With regard to the expense savings since there is increased confidence, I believe a quarter ago, I am thinking what else could happen that could give you potential upside to expense savings.", "Mike McGavick", "This is Mike, Jay. As we continue to work through these processes, it's interesting that you discover two things. One, sometimes you discover additional opportunities for savings as you actually bought the things together and you realize that you have got some more things that you do not need.", "On the other hand, as you are going through them, sometimes when you do something you were planning on, you realize an unintended consequence that might require some offset or increase in expenses elsewhere, so the numbers does move around a bit and we have been unwilling to put forward any higher number until we are absolutely certain that it will be achieved, so at this point we are still sticking with the 250, because that is the number we believe will absolutely be achieved, but we continue to believe we can do better than that and when and if that number moves meaningfully higher, we will certainly share that with you, but it continues to move. As you do things, you realize either unintended benefits or unintended consequences to your actions and we would want to alert you to new number until we are certain on them.", "Jay Gelb", "I understand. The next issue I guess more for Pete is on the fund affiliates. I guess, it shouldn't be too surprising to anyone that it was a pretty challenged quarter given what happened in the markets in August. However, given the sharp rebound in equities, especially through September and October, I am wondering if we might see a benefit there in 4Q.", "Pete Porinno", "Hey, Jay. It is Pete. Thanks a question. Let me back up for a second. Let's talk about what drives - I think the question really is around the affiliate income and the drivers there, so let me spend a minute if I could and then try and help you on a go-forward basis.", "As Mike said, one of the things we are trying to do which provides some clarity here, so I will do what I can to achieve that.", "First on the hedge funds, on the alternative investments, there is about $1 billion of that in the affiliates. There is about another $700 million of that not in affiliates.", "For the third quarter, we had for the affiliates a loss of about 1.1%. When you include all hedge funds that was about 0.7%, the benchmark on those was negative 1.8, right, so we are pretty comfortably ahead of the benchmark, but still a loss for the quarter. It is a business that we are really comfortable with. We obviously have been it for a long time.", "As I said think about that business, that is the one that has a one month delay as you correctly pointed out, so September was as bad as August. October, the equity markets are looking better than the hedge fund market so far, so we think that is still going to be under some pressure for the fourth quarter when we report that out.", "The other bucket that I would draw your attention to that it was implied in your question is the investment management affiliates and this is the one where there has not been much on the balance sheet. There is only about $100 million, but there is a fair amount of earnings power and that is really lumpy as you well know because the incentive fees that are built into that number.", "That one has a one quarter delay, right, as opposed to the one-month delay of the hedge funds, so that one as you think about Q4, you really have to think about the fund performance in Q3, right? We know what the fund performance was in Q3. It was not good, right, and so that is one where you could see a return of incentive fees in the fourth quarter, which could actually push that into negative territory for the quarter.", "I hope that helped a little bit. Jay, any follow-up on that?", "Jay Gelb", "No. That was very clear. Thank you. The final one I had was on the patient share buybacks, so I think initially we are looking at $50 million a month. That might have been the commentary from last quarter. I cannot quite recall, but with $180 million this quarter, it seem that XL was taking advantage of some pull back in the stock price and just trying to get your perspective on the return of capital story.", "Pete Porinno", "Jay, it is Pete again. I would say, when we spoke about this last time, I think what we said was there will be somewhat marginally above the 50. We do like the timing right now. We are buying back stock, so we are doing. It was $60 million a month for this quarter and based on what we have seen so far, we have no plans of changing that for the next quarter either.", "Jay Gelb", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question.", "Josh Stirling", "Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. Mike, maybe others want to jump. Two, I will let you decide. I wanted to talk big picture about the operational challenges. The challenge is operational changes that you guys are working through. Obviously, merger is a big deal. I would love to go behind the numbers.", "Better understand what is going on operationally and culturally, for your internal folks I was kind of thinking like what are the most important priorities that people who actually to firm and really focusing on now and how should we think about some of the more operational staff of things that might be happening in the back office, consolidating systems as well as more sort of top-down things like how are you changing goals and measurement and sort of cultural management of underwriters and claims people, because can we get various press reports from the trades and I would really get to a sense of what is really going on with the new XL Catlin.", "Mike McGavick", "Sure Josh. I appreciate the question, and I particularly appreciate that you brought up culture, because I think that is a consistently underestimated impact on how great businesses are formed and functioned, so it's nice to hear that in the question on this call. I am going to walk through three different things.", "First of all, remember Stephen Catlin and I had a long run up to doing this. We spent something like 18 months just the first year just the two of us talking and then adding slowly a few more people to the mix. All that conversation was around culture. We were both, deeply aware that we had successful franchises, had no need to do anything, we felt that the indicators leading to consolidation in a sector very present, so we expected there to be consolidation and we thought that if that was true, we should pick your partner as Stephen has so well put it.", "The greatest concern we had was where these cultures is really compatible. I think in the end, we are discovering the answer to that is very much. Yes, and it is yes for a couple of logical reasons. Number one, we were both definitely underwriting cultures and the disciplines that come with being great underwriters they are healthy to our skepticism a real regard for numbers and analytics. Those kinds of things, we are clearly culturally present across both places.", "Second, we were both, relatively small groups of colleagues spread over the world. As a result, the premium on collegiality, mutual respect, on using tools to defeat time and distance were both deeply embedded in each culture and there was a real culture of globalism. These are companies that are truly about the world and not just about any one geography. Those two things gave us great hope and have proven to be true and I think it is logical given that we were both trying to solve similar problems that they were true.", "I will tell you in a Townhall I held in London recently though, I did acknowledge something that is different and that people have to work their way through and that is I really do believe that Catlin was able to create an unusual level of family feel within the business, really extraordinary for a firm of their size and complexity.", "When you get to the affirm of the now size and complexity of this firm, it is even more of a challenge to have that kind of family feel, so I advised our Catlin colleagues that I would not, if I were them, believe it will be the same.", "Stephen is a unique leader and each of us is different and the size and complexity now is a bit greater and it is more difficult to retain that exact feeling. However, each firm went into the transaction with extraordinary employee engagement scores, far beyond the financial services or insurance sector generally. Meaning, each place was a place that colleagues enjoyed working.", "What we said to our colleagues, you are still going to like it. It just won't be exactly the same and each person will have to choose for themselves how they feel about that. I noted in my comments earlier that voluntary departures are still only modestly above what they have historically been, which I think tells you that people are taking their time, going to make their own decisions, but generally are moving along with us and this transaction, so that is the first piece and that is because I think generally speaking the cultural traits fit together was one of the first things we addressed as a firm.", "Second thing, the hardest part will always be in the back office functions. Underwriting, we were all over, acted on very, very quickly as you would expect, because you had to get the underwriting colleges working together in teams that we did literally overnight.", "However, when it comes the backroom, it is hard to sort out and that is where more overlap is, so I would have to say that if you are in one of our back office functions, you would feel that the progress seen elsewhere in the firm is coming slower and that of course creates frustration, because if you are in a part where it is going fast and great and you are sitting next to somebody for whom it does not feel as good, we all are affected by how our colleagues feel, so that is why I emphasized in my remarks that the speed up of integration costs was tied to good things, the speed with which we are getting clarity to our colleagues.", "With this, as I said, this business process in London around consultation, when you have redundancies as we finished this second wave, which is the last one we expect in London, you really see the functions brought up to pace with the underwriting side and that is going to go miles towards getting everybody excited about the future.", "Then the third thing is the system stuff, kind of naturally fit together. It was odd where there was currently a deep investment in claims forecast for talent. We had already made those investments, where there was a need for a new strengthened underlying financial system, we had just almost finished our own investment in that and are now just going to have to add on the Catlin financial reporting systems. This not only will improve our financial reporting capabilities, but more importantly it will start to feed into analytics once completed by mid-year and therefore feed into what we think is a better ability to forecast losses and alike.", "There, we were really neatly offset. The one place where there is a lot of work going on is in underwriting systems. There we were both making investments. It is not exactly clear how to resolve those investments and the best answer that will take a couple of years to get done, but I think if I take across those three, culture, as expected we are feeling very comfortable, but it does not mean it will be identical and we are being candid with our colleagues about that.", "Second, with respect to our functional areas, a bit behind the speed and success we have had on the underwriting side, but coming into line now and hope that will become just a better and better experience and third with systems we had nice offsets and only one really remaining puzzle that we will sort over the next couple years. I hope that takes you a little bit behind the curtains, but the amount of detail that goes behind what I just expressed is books and books of stuff that we review every week in our integration steering committee meeting and have detailed reports of course for our Board, and everybody else, but we are most the way through all that work and now it is just about starting to grind back in the diary business in the difficulty of competition.", "Josh Stirling", "Thanks, Mike. I appreciate you filtering that for us. Just a brief sort of question for you as an underwriter, you and the team is underwriting portfolio manager, one of things people have framed recently, so idea there is a spectrum pricing stability in cyclical impact from same more syndicated insurance businesses on one hand and until like little less cyclical stuff like small accounts on the other.", "Specialty lines kind of fit somewhere in the middle, I guess. I was curious you guys have a whole bunch of different businesses here that we sort of loop or link together. I am wondering if that framework makes sense for you and if you do sort of where you throw your various businesses on the spectrum and how we should think about this whole idea of cycle sensitivity and sort of where you fit. How is that informing your strategy as we start to feel the softening market?", "Mike McGavick", "Well, I will start with a couple of thoughts. I mean, ask Paul and Greg if they would like to add more clarification, but our reserve first of all unless you are in a really hard or really soft period, generally speaking it is not one cycle. It is a whole bunch of little cycles. In fact I touched on that when I talked about what is going on in energy and what is going on in political risk and crisis management and how differently we are approaching them, because they are just in such very different phases of their own profitability cycle.", "I think for our business, so we generally seek to play in the morbid spoke and the more complex risks generally speaking. We like the transaction in part because it really doubled down on specialty and reinsurance underwriting, not exclusively do a lot of other things great, but they really doubled down our loss and those we think are the lines of business which are the most innovative in the sector. Over time as greater and greater opportunity comes, we believe that that critical mass of creative insurance underwriting specialties, by that I do not mean specialty lines. I mean, specialism will really be the differentiator for XL. We can handle the rate of change going on in the world, we think, better than anybody over time and that is the biggest field for us.", "That distinguishes from what I would call the commoditized underwriting lines, where fundamentally the modeling has gotten so cycle so different in the way they vary, not absent but very much tighter volatility as it were and where marketing costs and the other things become the greater driver of success. We are still in more of the underwriting end of things, weather individual risk or syndicated.", "Generally remember that where we generally play is as a lead not just the follow-on, so we would view that underwriting expertise as still critical even though we are heavy players in the syndicated lines, but we are more - should not work individual underwriting, does not matters, we are more interested in where there is complexity to risk and we would say therefore we have lots of little cycles going on all the time and we are trying to sort through that to create the best possible portfolio.", "Paul Brand", "Just, I would in some ways reiterate what Mike just said. I mean, I think the importance of leaving business at the moment. I mean, cannot be overstated. It's absolutely not a good market to be a - need to order following line. I mean, we get better insights, we better get better client relationships.", "You heard Mike talking about the Gracechurch surveys on both, underwriting and claims and the survey in the U.S. and Aon's recent calling us for best renovation in Asia. Unless you are really at the top table in the lines of business, you are - executed is very difficult to sustain that type of buying from clients, brokers and everything else and does help us convert that into the margin and differentiated margin over time.", "Pete Porinno", "For us in reinsurance, I think that top table that Paul referred to is having a broad set of product, geography and the combination of XL-Catlin has really given us on a P&C reinsurance basis a truly top-10 position. We can service any clients' needs across a broad set of products and we can take care of their business just about anywhere in the world, so that ability puts us in the conversation with top-tier reinsurers.", "Josh Stirling", "Thanks guys for being so comprehensive. Good luck.", "Pete Porinno", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America. You may ask your question.", "Jay Cohen", "Yes. Just a couple of follow-up questions, Pete, the integration expenses you had given us some indication for the third quarter. Frankly, you weren't too far off of what you said. I know you wanted to put some stuff out before you announced earnings next time. At this point, any indication for the fourth quarter what those expenses might look like?", "Pete Porinno", "I have not done a very good job, because I think what I told you, you would have come to 42 and we came to 55, so I thank you for being nice, but I am not sure I was accurate.", "Jay Cohen", "I may\u2026", "Pete Porinno", "As we look to fourth quarter, it is really hard to say. I would say, we are probably looking - that the third quarter was more the acceleration more than anything else. I think fourth quarter will be higher than third quarter, but nowhere near the same magnitude.", "Jay Cohen", "That is helpful. Then the other one, the $50 million in savings associated with outward reinsurance. Where would that show up in the P&L?", "Mike McGavick", "This is why we have been careful to separate those three buckets of costs that are synergies claims around investments and around reinsurance, because unlike OpEx which is the $250 million, that we forecast these are actually very hard to point to explicitly. You are going to see them in expense ratios, you are going to see them in acquisition costs and you will see them hopefully in loss ratios, but of course then you have to have known what we thought was going to be the case, what does turn out to be the case, so they are very hard to get your head on. Some are absolute costs, because the absolute level of reinsurance purchasing is likely to shift as we consolidate programs and therefore can negotiate fewer contacts and fewer fees and hopefully with greater impact, but those are the simple costs. It is the matter that we are really driving toward.", "Jay Cohen", "That shows a bit different part to the model at this point.", "Mike McGavick", "It will. Yes.", "Jay Cohen", "That is okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Cliff Gallant with Nomura. You may ask your question.", "Cliff Gallant", "Good afternoon. I had a question. You mentioned Cyber insurance a couple of times in your remarks, about that being a growth area and I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about what type of risks are actually being assumed here? Is this just for data breaches and how big is the book, how many customers do you have? I mean, anything that you can give us some color perhaps on how much risk is being taken as you go into cyber?", "Paul Brand", "The bulk of the - which is principally based on data breach as a team, we had in place for four years. Just coming up, it is obviously growing quite rapidly. As we have seen breaches in last quarter changed by the appetite and also in pricing and conditions. We are obviously very careful in terms of policy construction most of the business would be retro date inception for example. We would see single LIBOR [ph] growth across portfolio, so it is one of the areas that we are a sort of extremely pleased with how the pricing dynamic is improving at the moment.", "Cliff Gallant", "Is there like a type of client that XL specializes in when you think about the profile of who you are underwriting?", "Mike McGavick", "The critical objective of that team is to write broadly diversified portfolio, so you would not see a particular class. We would mainly be dealing with a smaller clients, we tend to stay away from kind of the big obvious retail financial and intend to just focus on mainly smaller clients with smaller limits.", "Even if we did write in some larger programs, we would write very small limits because we want a very broadly diversified book of small limit business.", "Cliff Gallant", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.", "Josh Shanker", "Yes. Thank you for taking my question past 6 o'clock, I have a question similar to Cliff's. I want to know more about the Chinese market and the syndication of losses for events like Tianjin. Can you tell us the extent to which the industry is well penetrated in that market? Are you surprised so much showed up in the reinsurance verse insurance? Maybe you can just help us understand the shape of that market a little bit?", "Mike McGavick", "Yes. This is Mike. I can give you some perspective and I will ask Greg to add in. The first thing to think about is that in terms of the primary insurance marketplace is overwhelmingly written by the domestic carriers, so that is why, of course you would see it largely as a reinsurance impact for most say industrial carriers like ourselves. While we did have some a percentage of the loss that came from a primary marketplace, because we do, by the way those would also mainly be syndicated losses on larger accounts to which we had a slice of in the Tianjin explosion vicinity, but you would expect more to come in reinsurance.", "We would tell you that China, - first of all you can take out kind of personal lines and all the commodity businesses those that are being overwhelmingly grown by the domestic players. We have had had meetings in China with folks that we do some business with there and it is simply remarkable. The rates of growth, the rights of sales and the way that they are building out those markets, there are some non-Chinese success stories, but when you study them they have been in the market for a long time and still have tiny market shares, so that is not something we are involved with except for as a reinsurer.", "When you get to the industrial and specialty spaces, you do see some activity from outside of China insurers, but it tends to be the case that that is on syndications for clients that have activities in China, but do not originate in China.", "For example, we might follow a client to their plant in China with a portion of a treaty or something, but we would not have written the Chinese competitors out of China. That tends to be written by the domestics as well.", "As we see the market, it is mainly an opportunity for specialty expertise to be applied. There we are seeing some success, we see it principally through our own activities, we see it also through the inherited of Lloyds Catlin operation in China.", "Finally, we see our market for those risks written out of Singapore that has become something of a territorial hub, but the bigger opportunity and the more likely active area is going to be reinsurance, we think, for the foreseeable future.", "Greg Hendrick", "Sure. Just to put some numbers behind what Mike was saying, from the 2014 year the international carriers in China represented 1.5% market share on the P&C side and that is after some of them being added for 30 or 40 years, so it is a very, very small market between internationally and locally in China.", "If I look at our loss, I think it is fairly representative of any broad-based global reinsure like ourselves about 60% to 70%, our loss is going to come from the domestic insurance marketplace, which is going to be a range from personalized, the small commercial to industrial properties, so I do not have nor we would we have, because most of our carriers write across that spectrum, so I do not have a breakdown for you within those buckets what it looks like.", "Another 20% of the loss is going to be from Cargo, Marine-type losses from international players depending upon how the loss exactly was pushed out which is to yet be determined between what's Cargo and what's property. Then there is kind of two smaller buckets for us, 10% of it about being what is referred to sometimes as soft retro non-peak retro from either within China or neighboring countries. Then the last 10% of was just large risks, reassuring folks that look not dissimilar from XL Catlin insurance and might have an odd risk here and there, so that is about to breakdown of the loss as we see it.", "Josh Shanker", "One question, which might sound a little na\u00efve, you learn something after every big loss. After this loss, do you come to the opinion that the business you are writing in that market it is fairly priced, so that business could use more rates?", "Greg Hendrick", "After the event, a couple things I would say, we learned, one, I am quite pleased that we are less pro rata inclined as a carrier than the marketplace would be, so we have less of the stake on those pro rata treaties relative to our market share and certainly that conversation needs to be had around the level of risk that is inherent within China marketplace relative to what we are getting and we would submit at this point, we would need a little more rate to help compensate for that risk being taken on.", "Josh Shanker", "Thank you for the answers, very educational.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. You may ask your question.", "Brian Meredith", "Yes. Thanks. Two questions here. First one, just for Greg, just curious, Greg, could you tell us what the impact you think that the changes in BCAR may have on renewals?", "Greg Hendrick", "I am not a BCAR expert, but it has been as you can probably guess a topic of conversation over last couple of months. Based on the last set of information, I read from A. M. Best themselves, one, it is going to be a staggered implementations, it is not going to be a hard jump at January 1, but through the course of '16 and then it will be a subjective one as they are with everything they do.", "We do see it and we have had conversations already around by clients percentage buying more limit on the CAT side, particularly ahead of that change, orders of magnitude of kind of 10% to 20% more limited than they had brought before, but it is still an evolving topic, Brian.", "Brian Meredith", "Great. Then second question for Mike, you said at the beginning of the call that you are going through your budget for next year and you are pretty happy with the way they are coming out. I am just curious, if you take a look at the budgets today versus what you would expected back when you start the transaction, how much of an impact increasingly competitive pricing environment can had on your kind of view of the potential profitability and then if that price competition eating into maybe the cost savings that you would have expected here going forward?", "Mike McGavick", "First of all, Brian, that last bit is a really important element to think about. It won't change how much we save. It could change how much we earned.", "Brian Meredith", "Right.", "Mike McGavick", "Their earnings will be constant. We will deliver the numbers that we have promised to deliver in streams lined operations and should our top-line be constrained by virtue of the marketplace. Our goal would be to make sure our expenses savings reflect that in addition, to what we are saving due simply to the possibilities of transaction, so that is how we are thinking about that problem. Which means that, when you take those two statements together, that means that we should be able to stay on schedule to both, expand in double-digit our EPS and meaningfully uplift ROE, so we do not see their market conditions as necessarily constraining our progress. What we would say though is that it will require us to be even more firm on how we manage our expenses.", "Now there are some level of market craziness that you cannot outrun. We understand that, but so far I think we are doing a hack of a good job at remixing our book to try and offset those pressures. We will keep trying to do and if we think that market conditions have gotten so difficult that we have a difference to that, we will talk about it.", "At this point, when I look at the budget for next year, by the way I am always cautious. I do not think that the word pleased actually crossed my lips. We are still mid-way through the budgeting process and I am looking at all of my colleagues. I do not think what they are taking from my face right now is pleasure, but it is directionally in line with what we expect and it is within shouting distance of what ultimately I think we will need to be.", "Brian Meredith", "Perfect. Thanks for the answer.", "Mike McGavick", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Sarah DeWitt with JPMC. You may ask your question.", "Sarah DeWitt", "Hi. Good evening. I was wondering if you could help us understand what normalized EPS was in the quarter.", "Pete Porinno", "Yes. Sure. This is Pete. I apologize. I am not sure how to answer that.", "Sarah DeWitt", "Okay. The reason I am getting around $0.50 if I take out Tianjin and normalize for the investment affiliates and take out the tax benefit?", "Pete Porinno", "Okay. Now I understand. Thank you. Thank you for that clarification. We have not done that. That would be pretty much I think backward normalized earnings guidance, which we have not done that. I think you have identified some of the things that you would look at.", "Certainly, Tianjin, I mean again, you can assume it is not going to happen. There are expected losses is that portfolio. The affiliates would be one. Mike talked a little bit about the PYD, so I think you would factor those in, but we have not come up with what we thought the quarter would have been, if not for a few of those.", "Mike, I do not know if you want to give any more color on the PYD.", "Mike McGavick", "Again, I am glad Pete answered the way that he did, because we can certainly through the four buckets that I described, account for the difference between estimates and what we have produced. Importantly, none of those had to do with the core earnings of business. It had to do with other items and this estimation is that given the cloud of the transaction, I think are understandable, but if you step back from it, probably the one that has the most impact on go-forward I guess is how you think about PYD, so maybe I could clarify that just a little bit more.", "First of all, remember we regret not having done it more forcefully, but we did say that we did not think that there would be any release from Catlin in the third quarter, because again that is an A versus E quarter. We knew we had work to do to harmonize the two approaches for reserving, so that will be done in the fourth quarter. As I said in my comment, you would intuitively expect that process would probably dampen any likelihood of releases in the fourth quarter from that Catlin book.", "At the same time, think about it this way. First of all, XL's reserving philosophy remains unchanged and that will be the going forward philosophy, so that is the first thought.", "Second though, and by the way, obvious with the disclaimer none of knows. PYD goes where it goes and things certainly can surprise you that world, but just if you would look at it right now the second thing I would say is the XL portion of our reserves continued to performance as expected, so we are very comfortable with the way the prudence there has played out.", "Third, we respect to that Catlin portion reserve, let us put it in scale the ratio of XL to Catlin reserves is 3:1 and they are performing as we expected them to according to our due diligence. That is another important point to make. We think the Catlin reserving approach made sense. We have not seen any surprises, but here is something important to understand. We are in the process of harmonizing the approaches.", "As the larger casualty rider XL has historically been a bit more conservative in the speed with which we were recognized development in the portfolio. As we get to a consistent methodology, this would likely you have to expect dampen the releases from the Catlin portion of the book at least if you were to look at just looking at the pattern of historical releases, because we are going to that XL approach, so I just think that that is an important thing to keep in mind when you are looking at potential favorable development. We have just started recognize it and that is the philosophy that will now be applied across the piece.", "Sarah DeWitt", "Okay. Thanks. You think for the fourth quarter, we should models mostly modest reserve releases?", "Mike McGavick", "Again I cannot give you a direct guidance on that, because we are still doing our work. In the end, we have the obligations to produce our best estimate and we will, but I just would know what I have said. It is likely that our approach, which because of our long history in writing casualty, there we have learned that you cannot ever wear rose-colored glasses the effective that is we have tend to be slower to react to positive news. If that were true historically, I think you would have had a different historical pattern from Catlin. For XL there should not be any difference to what we normally do and there has been some happy consistency there. Look, I just remind you in the end that PYD is not plan on. It is something that is studied in results, whatever it is.", "Sarah DeWitt", "Thank you. Thanks for the answers.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Amit Kumar with Macquarie. You may ask your question.", "Amit Kumar", "Thanks for putting me in. Maybe just one question, maybe a follow-up to Kai and Brian's question regarding the go-forward sort ROE thought process, if I look at the level of recessions, can you sort of update where XL stands on maybe pursuing a hedge fund re-type of strategy going forward? Thanks.", "Mike McGavick", "Yes. Look, we have said in the past that we will be constantly looking for ways to apply our expertise and to partner with those who wish to participate in that marketplace, but at this point I just have nothing to report. We continue to work at identifying the best way forward.", "Amit Kumar", "Okay, because there was some press speculation regarding something in the pipeline and it sounded it was fairly eminent?", "Mike McGavick", "I am fairly surely you would not want me to comment on\u2026", "Amit Kumar", "Fair enough. Then maybe I will just switch very quickly. In the opening remarks, and I guess Jay was asking this question regarding the affiliate income, have you ever previously disclose what percent of that $1 billion is event-driven, maybe the different sort of buckets et cetera, so that maybe we can have better insight as to how we sort of benchmark those different buckets or has that not been disclosed?", "Pete Porinno", "Well, if you go back to our 10-K, I mean you will get a broad overview, but not overly detail, but I do think that if you would go look at it at a standard index like it is a HFRI or something like, it at least get you in the ballpark.", "Amit Kumar", "Got it. That is what I had. Okay. That is all the questions I have. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. You may ask your question.", "Paul Newsome", "I just got a couple of a modeling questions and thanks for that. One, just the tax, could you just give a little bit more detail as to what - benefit actually happened and is it fair to say that 10% normalizes is the right general number for us to think of prospectively?", "Pete Porinno", "Sure. Just real quick on the benefits, so they were operating losses in the United States in the legacy Catlin book of business which they could not recognize. They had to defer tax allowance on that. When we conducted the transaction, we put the legal entities together. We made sure that the Catlin legal entities will underneath the XL legal entities and therefore you follow consolidated return to get the benefit be able to use that.", "To the extent that there were losses from prior years, they would have come all in the third quarter when we affected the reorganization to the extent that the losses would be coming into all of '15 that would be taken in three quarters in the third quarter in the last and the fourth quarter.", "As far as your question about the 10%, we really try not to give the exact numbers. We have in the past at legacy XL, we had that number slightly above 12. I think with the lower tax positions that legacy Catlin had that number had come down. I think I had talked about that and sort of in the 10 to 12 range, so 10 I would say would be sort of at the low-end of that range, but certainly in the range.", "Paul Newsome", "Okay. That gets me where I need to go. Then I was wondering if you have some guidance for us on how to think about your FX exposure of the combined company from a bottom-line perspective?", "Greg Hendrick", "You talking income statement or balance sheet?", "Paul Newsome", "Income statement.", "Pete Porinno", "All right, so in the income statement it really depends if this a mismatch in pretty much the legal entities between the non-monetary assets and liabilities. For example, this quarter you saw that I think we had about $12 million loss in income statement, so that would be something like where we had all three assets in a non-monetary assets sitting in a U.S. dollar denominated unit, so there is no easy way that you could sort of say ballpark it should be something like this. You have to go legal entity by legal entity and determine what the functional currency is in that legal entity and then compare what currencies the non-monetary assets and liabilities are, so it is a fair question Paul, but it is not one that I think I can give you a rule of thumb that it should be something like this. We do manage the FX exposure, but we do that really more on a balance sheet basis than on an income statement basis.", "Paul Newsome", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. You may ask your question.", "Meyer Shields", "Thanks. I will try to be quick. I know it is late. When you have accelerated integration expenses, does that mean that there is also acceleration in the recognition? Should that $13 million delta from original guidance mean that we will save $10 million in the fourth-quarter?", "Mike McGavick", "No. When you think about it, for example as we go through the FX on headcount, because of the accounting rules you can book that expense when you know it by name and so on, but that actual saving maybe later maybe a year or two away because some of the people who know that there won't be a future job might have a couple of years of work that we asked them to do and have lined up for them, so it really depends on the specific category of expense.", "Generally, while we are continuing to accelerate the cost, it does mean the less of the cost will be in the period when you have the synergy masking it, but it does not mean necessarily that the synergy is brought forward. They could be anytime during the three years.", "Meyer Shields", "Okay. That is helps. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Gutterman with Balyasny. Your may ask your question.", "Ian Gutterman", "Hi. Thanks. Mike, why do not I just ask a big picture one? We have dealt with a lot of different items that are maybe one-offs, maybe not, if I just asked you looking at your internal numbers for '16 and for '17 now versus the quarter ago, are they really changed? I mean, maybe a little bit on the margin prices as little bit different, but has there anything materially changed?", "Mike McGavick", "No.", "Meyer Shields", "Okay. I think that is the main thing we are all after. Then just one detailed question was probably one that I could come up, so the Catlin reserves, you talked about the casualty part, but I guess they were surmise given their a mixed of business a lot of their releases would tend to be more property and event-driven, so that if they had attritional IVR for energy and marine and things like that and there has been a losses this year, why would not we expect in Q4 or at least Q1 of next year that has to be released?", "Mike McGavick", "Again, it depends on the mixed performance of those shorter tail and those medium and longer tail, so it is really about how they all work together not just the one.", "Meyer Shields", "Okay. I guess. Isn't they are mixed more geared towards shorter tail lines. I guess I would have thought historically that they would have well more than half of their releases be short tail than long tail. I do not know that for fact, but I would have guessed?", "Mike McGavick", "In more recent years, there has been pretty substantial growth in the casualty portion of the book, so that pattern that you would have historically seen, I would not expect to emerge in the way you described and that is why I made the comment that I did.", "Meyer Shields", "Perfect. Thank you. I will save the rest offline. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Farrell Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question.", "Dan Farrell", "Thank you and good evening. Just a question with regards core combined ratio mostly insurance business, but you have obviously showed some nice improvement in the core loss ratio from mix changes, but you had a lot of offset from the acquisition ratio too and I am wondering if the increase in acquisition ratio all from mix or is there some tighten competition marketplace that is also driving those costs up.", "Then secondly, how do you feel about your level of core loss ratio right now if you exclude Tianjin. It looks like a pretty sold a level right now. Do you need that to get lower to sort of hitting your goals or are there other levers and is there stuff in your control that you can continue to drive improvement in that core loss ratio? Thank you.", "Mike McGavick", "Yes. I will start. The biggest things that we can control well is a couple of things, number one, expenses, expenses, expenses. I think that is in this part of the cycle the thing you can control most certainly yourself and that is why I make the comment that I did that why you cannot outrun everything going since we get a portion of it back and that is our job.", "When you talk about the loss ratio, you can continue to work on mixing your book of business appropriately. The world is not one theme, either by geography or by product line. You can continue to refine your mix of business in order to get up that, to try and offset the impact of deteriorating conditions in any one given segment and that is why we like having the broader breadth of product both, in insurance and reinsurance and the broader breadth of debt in geography. That this give us more choices around how to manage that.", "Then of course if you become smarter in your reinsurance or retrocessional purchasing you also can gain a benefit over time, but those are three levers that you have to hand and all of which we will be pulling on. We are certainly very pleased with the overall attritional loss ratio as the two companies combined create.", "While that creates some pressure on acquisition that is mainly due to mix with the much every year portion of cover holder writing that those going on and will be continuing to go on in the legacy Catlin or portion of the book. We like having both of those expertises, by the way because it gives us more ways to get to clients, but those are the general commentary I would make and look at Paul and Greg and see if they have anything they want to add.", "Greg Hendrick", "Yes. I think other needle, which you did not mention was we are obviously working to build up analytical insights to try and make [indiscernible] is more resilient in and of themselves. I think as you look at the larger book of business, you have great opportunities with the data site, so there is definitely market headwinds, but it is about converting all the tailwinds that we have got all those leaders and to more than offsetting and hopefully that will lead to a better outcome as we look ahead.", "Paul Brand", "Yes. I would say reinsurance, that I think the only place you would see the slight increase in acquisition, with ceding commissions gone up, although I will say through July 1, we start to see a ceiling being set, particularly on the long tail casual line - so that is the only part I think when you mixed it all together there is relatively small part of the overall equation, but that is the driver of reinsurance.", "Dan Farrell", "Thank you very much. I just have a really quick question, Tianjin. I am you curious, do you have any reinsurance or retro protection that had kick in or will start to kick in at certain point. I am just wondering if we had overall industry creep in the industry number, if there is any projections that might start to offset that from your perspective.", "Greg Hendrick", "This is Greg. There are reinsurance protections that are from both, legacy firms that they have come into play but there is a - I do not what Paul here for a second. There is a risk?", "Paul Brand", "Clash.", "Greg Hendrick", "\u2026clash between insurance, marine reinsurance segment as well as, but has not come into play yet, but what if there is for the development.", "Pete Porinno", "Yes. This is Pete. The only thing I would add is that the number that we disclosed that net number, our gross number was not materially higher that. It was a little bit higher that, but not of a huge magnitude.", "Dan Farrell", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.", "Ryan Tunis", "Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. On the reserve integration, I guess my question is could the impact of that have an impact on the accident year loss ratio on a go-forward basis like for instance if you conclude that Catlin hadn't been reserving as conservatively as XL?", "Mike McGavick", "I do not think there is going to be anything material. Certainly not that we have seen. In a pricing environment like this, you are always going to get some pressure on attritional loss fix. If you remix your book, you can dampen the impact of that, but we would expect over time within our multiple years of softening pricing that there will be pressure over time on those picks, and we are awfully happy to enter the period of time with such a breadth of product region to work among as we remix and also to have what we think is an unusual opportunity because of the bringing together the two firms and the expense side to hopefully even more than offset that.", "Ryan Tunis", "Got it. Then one quick follow-up for Pete, I think. Last quarter, I think there was some fair value adjustments to lower the loss ratio on insurance. Then something I think in the reinsurance side that raised the acquisition cost ratio. Could you quantify what those were this quarter and is the forward look still the same as what you gave previously?", "Pete Porinno", "Sure. They were pretty close quarter to quarter, so in total the acquisition cost, the amortization was about $12 million and the reserve was $15 million. Again, I think I said last time the commission, the result of amortization run off as you as you run off there and - reserve [ph], so by the first quarter of '17 it is pretty much over. The reserve one goes up over the life for the Catlin reserve, so that one does last a little bit longer.", "Ryan Tunis", "Okay. That is what thought. Thanks so much guys.", "Pete Porinno", "Welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Vinay Misquith with Sterne Agee. You may ask your question.", "Vinay Misquith", "Hi. Thanks. Pete just a follow-up, so the $15 million of the amortization, that is going to last through the end of '16, correct?", "Pete Porinno", "The $15 million of amortization, so the amortization for going to the end of '16 that was on the acquisition cost, right, so that was $12 million. That goes through the end of '16 and then drops off almost to nothing, the reserves which was the '15, one will go through '16, will continue into '17 and you will see it stop to drop off later in 17.", "Vinay Misquith", "Okay. That is helpful. Thank you. Big picture for Mike, Mike, just curious as to why you think the profitability has not really changed for the future despite softening? Are you planning to remix the book or is it sort of higher expenses? Thanks.", "Mike McGavick", "First, we would expect to all the expense lever harder should it be necessary, particularly given where premium might go as we remain disciplined underwriters. As we have said before, it has turned out that the merger has been incredibly well received, so we have a lot of new opportunities to look at too.", "We get to shift through an awful lot to find things that you like in a market like this, but you can find them out there. A second opportunity for us as we renew business, business that you know and are comfortable with, we may be able given our new presence in the market do even better with those clients and we have certainly seen indications of that as we worked along.", "The third thing is the remixing and I have spoken very directly about that with illustrations, but that is a constant. I mean that is not something we would just be doing next year that is something we would do every year to try and get to right place.", "As I have indicated, it would not surprise me in the coming years to have some pressure on that attritional loss ratio, because of the amount of the rate that has been coming off on consecutive years now, but I also think that so far our ability to damp that impact as proven, but having this breadth of geography and product mix really does give you an opportunity to offset that meaningfully and that has certainly been the case so far and then I do not see any reason that we won't be able to continue to offset it into the future.", "When you do that it makes it a lot easier to get that last bit done with rates. Look, these are difficult market conditions, but we are I would say at this way, we are even more grateful that we Stephen Catlin raised the possibility and that we were able to consummate this transaction, because that get both firms into a position that was much stronger relative to these very different market conditions.", "Vinay Misquith", "Okay. That is fair. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, I will turn the call over to the speakers for closing remarks.", "Pete Porinno", "I am sorry. This is Pete, I just want to go back and clarify Paul, some questions about the alternatives. We hold the K in two difference places in Note 7, we have lay four buckets out for the affiliates and then in Note 8 related same four buckets out for the non-equity accounted affiliates, so that is where you wound, non equity accounted hedge funds that is where you would - if you want more detail, that is where you would go.", "A - Mike McGavick", "Listen, I know we have gone longer than we usually do, but obviously as we have mentioned before it is a difficult time to get it right. It is a difficult time to estimate what is going on. We want to provide as much clear as we could not answer every question as best we could.", "We remain as you can tell a very bullish about what this transaction enables us to do not just now, but into the future. We are excited to be up there working with clients and with their brokers partners and we are incredibly proud of the work that our colleagues have been doing and we are delighted to be able to say to them that we are getting to the backend of the worse of it and onward and upward from here and that has been a long time coming, so it is they were hoping enter this holiday season on something of a high note after all of the hard work for both of these organizations really beginning from the time of the leak last year.", "Thank you for your attention, for your very thought questions and we look forward to next quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised this conference is being recorded.", "Now I would like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "David Radulski", "Thank you, Rita. Welcome to XL Group plc's fourth quarter and full-year 2015 earnings conference call. Our call today is being simultaneously webcast at www.xlcatlin.com and www.xlgroup.com. We have posted to our website several documents including our press release and quarterly financial supplement. We also refer you to the combined historical financial statements and 8-K referencing Q4 integration costs we have posted to our website on January 21, 2016.", "On our call today Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, will offer opening remarks, Pete Porrino, XL's Chief Financial Officer, will review our financial results, followed by Paul Brand, our Chief Underwriting Officer and Chair of our Insurance Leadership Team and Greg Hendrick, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations, who will review their segment results and market conditions and then we will open it up for questions.", "Before we begin, I would like to remind you that certain of the matters we will discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations all of which involve risk and uncertainty and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them.", "Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors including those identified in our most recent reports on Form 10-Q and 10-K as well as other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as the date of which they are made and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise.", "With that, I will turn it over to Mike McGavick.", "Mike McGavick", "Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Today we are pleased to discuss the fourth quarter and the full year 2015, a year in which we produced solid results, increased the relevance of the firm and built a strong position from which we intend to grow value in the years to come. Thinking about 2015, it's pretty fun now to reflect on what we have achieved, but it wasn't so much fun during the year, of course, because it was an incredibly intense year for the people of XL Catlin.", "Bringing together two high-performing organizations would be difficult in any environment. It is particularly difficult in the context of the current pricing environment. As we view it, we are confident that the hard work of our people last year will be well rewarded by the market, because if we think about the totality of market conditions and some of the wild challenges that are going on and when we think about the work we have already done, we feel incredibly well positioned for that comes next. We believe there is a huge payoff for having gone first, for having carefully picked out our partner and for having done this work rapidly and efficiently.", "So before getting into the quarter and full year in more detail, let me walk through some of what I think proves out what I have just said. When we set out to put these two firms together, our objective was to build a company for the future, because as risk keeps mutating we want to have the best underwriting minds in the lines of business most able to anticipate and respond to that change. This implies we would have to do a number of things.", "First, we had to keep the book together, at least as far as we wanted to do so. Second, we had to keep our workforce together and energized by the prospect of being part of this future oriented company while creating a common culture. And third, we had to get our systems together so we could understand how the company is performing and begin applying our unique levels of insight to the needs of our clients. And finally, we had to do all of that while still delivering an acceptable result, because we said all along this was about both long-term strategy and a compelling financial rationale.", "So how did we do against those goals? Number one, we kept the book of business together. In fact, we believe we lost less than half a point of premium. I will say that again, less than half a point of premium that both companies had went away because of the transaction. Now I should said parenthetically that this will go up a little bit more as we know of one program that will end during the second quarter of this year, but even when that is added, it will be about one point of premium loss. We are thrilled by that result and they are less than a tenth of what we had modeled going into the transaction.", "Number two, we kept the workforce together. Our voluntary attrition rates this year were only slightly elevated from historical levels. Of course, because of the integration, there are certain key areas where you would expect higher turnover, including in underwriting. But let me put it in perspective. Of our more than 1,200 underwriters, there were literally just a couple of handfuls of voluntary departures that gave us pause. We are simply thrilled that the vast majority of our XL Catlin colleagues see the potential I had.", "So we kept the book together and we kept the workforce together. And our third goal, we managed at the same time to bring all this key systems together. We were able to stop duplicative investments and products that no longer fit our needs and we are already mining the bigger dataset with which we can now work.", "Now we have said that we should do all of those things and not lose sight of the fundamentals of trying to build a better business with better margins over time. One aspect of this, of course, is savings. You will recall that when we first announced the transaction in January of last year, it was certified that we could reach at least $200 million in synergies and then when we closed the deal in May, we came over the top of that and said that we could do at least $250 million in savings.", "We have been wrestling with whether we could commit to a higher number. We never want to commit to a number until we are absolutely certain we can achieve it. So today, we can announce that we have identified not less than $300 million in synergy savings and that we are committed that we are absolutely committed to deliver and we are committed to searching for more.", "Now you can ask, why? How did you find more money? Well, a number of reasons. Number one, the transaction continues to reveal additional savings opportunities. And when we see one that we are confident in, we grab it. Number two, in line with these challenging market conditions, we continue to increase internal expectations for savings. Our people are well aware that these are difficult times in the pricing environment and they have responded and come forward with additional identified opportunities for savings. And our hand will not come off the expense lever because the simple truth is that these markets continue to worsen and if we don't run the business as though we are accounting and we do not ever run the business as though we are expecting a turn in the cycle. We may hope for it. It may come. But we don't plan for it.", "Additionally, throughout the year as we have become increasingly confident that we would meet our integration and synergy targets, we have resumed share repurchases, buying back over 12 million shares during 2015. I am also pleased to note that S&P recently announced that they have revised the outlook of our main FSR rating from stable to positive, which clearly reflected their review of our competitive position. Additionally, the ratings on several of the core Catlin subsidiaries were upgraded from A to A+, during the course of the year.", "And then as I said, we hope to continue to improve the business throughout the year as well. In terms of the result in the fourth quarter, we produced a total P&C combined ratio of 92.3% and gross written premiums of $2.6 billion. We think that's a solid result for the quarter, but there are some mines in the quarter that do make it a bit messy. Pete will provide more detail in a moment, but I would like to note a couple of important items.", "First, there was a fair amount of tax benefit in the quarter. For those who have been following along over the years, you can think of it as the book ends to the fourth quarter of 2011. You may remember that in the 2011 quarter, we had all of our losses happen in the wrong places and wound up with an unusually high tax rate. This quarter is the opposite, with our losses happening in places that yield tax benefit.", "Second, it is noteworthy that we have had pretty solid PYD releases and I am sure that was particularly comforting to you given the questions that were raised during the third quarter and it reflects the continued prudence of our approach.", "And third, I would like to note that we beat our expense targets in real savings during the year and we are very pleased about that.", "And then to the all-important insurance ex-CAT accident year loss ratio. While not ending up where we want to, we should note that from the market commentary that there have been a number of large non-CAT losses. You heard that from around the market. We have experienced some of those as well. But our ex-CAT accident year loss ratio insurance did improve both year-over-year and improved sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter. If we can make this improvement in the conditions of last year with all that was going on, we can and believe we will do it in the year ahead.", "I should note that our underwriters actually began optimizing our books about halfway through this past year. They threw out the growth plans that both legacy had realizing that market conditions have worsened more than were predicted back at the time they were planned and are already hard at work walking away from either wildly underpriced businesses or accounts that simply don't meet our performance standards. That's why we did not grow much in this past year. And we are certainly telling our underwriters the past year that this year growth is not the objective. The books are assembled. Let's begin to optimize them. The underwriters are keeping their wits about them, especially through this complicated market.", "So all-in-all, we produced, what I would call, an acceptable quarter and a solid full year effort, particularly when we consider the potential for distraction throughout the year that simply didn't emerge. This is no market in which to be chasing premium. But I remain confident that given our geographic positions in our broadened product lines we will find isolated spots where there is profitable opportunity for growth.", "Last and I have emphasized this before, we still firmly believe that the strategy in and of itself is great, but it doesn't mean anything until is married to the right people and the right culture. We have made leaps and bounds of progress in getting our teams together. They are think about XL Catlin and not just how it used to be and by knowing that they are part of one of the most powerful forces in the insurance sector, they really believe they are doing special work and I agree.", "As I have said, this is true every day. Our leadership team functions and so it's has been working together for years. We make decisions together quickly and efficiently. We even have a sense of humor about it and we worked damn hard because we believe that we have a common goal that is worthwhile.", "Now I know that if progress doesn't show up in the numbers, it isn't real. So let me be clear. We did a lot in 2015, but this wasn't the year the financial progress would show. All you will be able to see are the indicators. I like the indicators. Our loss ratios, despite this pricing environment continue to come down and we believe that will continue. Our expense ratio is coming down. We kept the book together. We kept this incredible group of colleagues together and we have energized them around a common future. That's the company we were trying to build. We are pretty happy about where we are.", "I would note, we are a bit glad that last year is more of a memory now. We are really excited to take on this difficult year because it is now about the progress we can and will make together.", "Pete?", "Pete Porrino", "Thanks Mike and good morning. Operating net income for the fourth quarter was $195 million or $0.65 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to $294 million in 2014 or $1.12 per share. Operating net income for the full year was $706 million or $2.43 per share. As we indicated during our previous calls, we have excluded direct transaction cost from operating income, but included integration costs.", "During the fourth quarter, we incurred $73 million in deal related integration costs and $2 million in deal related transaction costs. The previously disclose $35 million loss associated with the 100% reinsurance of our U.S. term life business has also been excluded from operating income.", "Our net income attributable to ordinary shareholders for the quarter was $229 million or $0.76 per share on a fully diluted basis compared the $139 million or $0.53 per share for the same quarter in 2014 and $1.2 billion or $4.15 per share for the full year, compared to $188.3 million or $0.69 per share in the prior year. As we previously discussed, our net income numbers are impacted by the mark-to-market movement of the derivatives that transfer the economics of the assets backing our second quarter 2014 life reinsurance sale transaction. We continue to show that relationship in the summary consolidated financial data included with the press release. And as always, it has no impact on comprehensive income or operating results.", "Our property and casualty combined ratio for the quarter was 92.3% or 7.8 points higher than the same quarter last year and the full year's 92% was 3.8 points higher than the prior year. Our combined ratio, excluding prior year development for the quarter was 97.4%, six points higher than the fourth quarter of 2014 while the full year's 95.8% with higher by 3.2 points.", "Our natural catastrophe losses totaled the $108 million or 4.6 loss ratio points for the quarter compared to $32 million or 2.3 loss ratio points in the same quarter of 2014. Our natural catastrophe losses for the full year of 2015 were $213 million or 2.6 loss ratio points. By comparison, net losses from natural catastrophes in 2014 totaled $113 million or 2.1 loss ratio points. Paul and Greg will discuss our underwriting results in further detail.", "As we indicated on our previous earnings call, our fourth quarter ground-up reserve review included the alignment of reserving assumptions across the two legacy portfolios. The results of this exercise led to modest strengthening of the legacy Catlin portfolio, which is included in our overall favorable development of $121 million or 5.1 loss ratio points for the quarter compared to net favorable $97 million or 6.9 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2014. This reflects favorable development of $28 million in the insurance segment and favorable development of $93 million in the reinsurance segment.", "For the full year development was a net favorable $307 million or 3.7 loss ratio points compared to $255 million or 4.5 loss ratio points in the prior year. As was indicated previously our normal purchase GAAP accounting adjustments will amortize through income over the next number of quarters. Overall the impact in the quarter is relatively small. However, certain line items can be distorted each quarter and to the extent, these are meaningful, they will be noted by Paul and Greg.", "Operating expenses have increased in the quarter as result of the combination with Catlin. Overall, however, the run rate operating expense level of the company continues to decline towards the now higher level of expected transaction synergies and excluding integration costs are significantly lower than the combined historic levels of the legacy companies. We continue to believe that these will be achieved in full by the end of 2017 and we continue to view the overall relationship between the one-time cost to achieve integration and the ongoing synergies to be approximately 1.25:1.", "You can see from our fourth quarter expense levels that we have already made material progress achieving the synergies. In fact, compared to the combined starting point we had guided you to of $2.3 million back in May, based on these fourth quarter expenses we have already achieved over $300 million of run rate savings. However, that would be somewhat misleading as we have had some benefit from foreign exchange rates reducing these costs. We remain committed to driving real expense leverage from this integration and will only report to you though savings when we are sure they are real and not a function of market movements.", "Looking towards 2016, we expect that additional synergies will exceed normal course growth driven by compensation inflation and additional cost from added businesses. And as a result, we expect to improve our overall operational leverage.", "The large tax benefit in the quarter and overall tax rate for the year was heavily impacted by both the absence of catastrophes in lower tax rate jurisdictions and higher proportion of large risk losses in higher tax locations. For the full year, this combined with the benefit we realized following our ability to utilize legacy Catlin U.S. net operating losses resulted in annual operating tax rate of a negative 2.8%.", "Turning to the investment portfolio. Net investment income excluding the life funds withheld assets were $172 million, in line with the same quarter last year notwithstanding the addition of the Catlin investments. Changes in foreign-exchange rates resulted in approximately $5 million reduction compared to prior year. The gross book yield of the portfolio at the end of December was 2.3%.", "During the quarter, our average new money rate was 1.3%. Given current yields, net investment income will continue to remain under pressure as we have approximately $3.7 billion of assets with book yields of 2.3% rolling off over the next 12 months. In the current volatile market conditions, we will continue to manage the portfolio for long term benefit of our shareholders. We have already taken steps in the quarter to reduce our exposure to asset-backed securities and high yield bonds and we will continue to take such action as we deem necessary to protect the value of the portfolio even if this has an adverse impact on reported net investment income in future periods.", "Total affiliate income was $15 million for the quarter compared to $34 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due through our operating affiliates or our investment manager affiliates as expected experience losses across the board driven by tough third quarter market conditions. Investment fund affiliates were $10 million lower than the prior quarter driven by our hedge fund affiliates where many of our event driven funds performed poorly on an absolute basis due to the impact of continuing market volatility. Despite these disappointing absolute returns, our hedge fund portfolio continued to outperformance benchmark and we continue to believe that a modest allocation to this asset class improves the risk-adjusted returns we earn on the overall portfolio.", "Net realized gains, excluding derivatives were $11 million for the quarter, down $2 million from the prior year. Our unrealized gain position declined by $203 million during the quarter driven primarily by increasing rates offset by tightening spreads and an increase in unrealized gains on our equity portfolio of $59 million. Unrealized net gains were $544 million at the end of the quarter, including other investments.", "On a performance basis, the total return on investments was 0.2% for the quarter excluding FX and on a year-to-date basis, the total return on investments was 1.38%. The duration of the total portfolio was 3.3 years at the end of the quarter, which was broadly unchanged from the prior quarter.", "With respect to capital management, we continue to execute share buybacks during the fourth quarter where we purchased 4.7 million shares, leaving $703 million available for purchase under our share buyback program. We continue to view these buybacks as an efficient capital management tool and continued purchasing in line with the philosophy we discussed with you in May. As we continue our share buyback program, we will remain focused on ensuring that our overall financial leverage move towards our target levels over the next few years. And as previously indicated, we have called and canceled all former Catlin subordinated notes assumed in conjunction with the transaction. These notes were called at par value of $90 million.", "Now I will turn it over to Paul to discuss our insurance segment results.", "Paul Brand", "Thanks, Pete. This morning I will cover the results for the segment, provide an update on integration progress and finish with remarks on current market conditions.", "First, the results. The fourth quarter marked our twelfth consecutive quarter profitability, with the segment producing a calendar quarter combined ratio of 98.2% compared to 93.8% in the same quarter last year with a full year combined ratio of 96.9% versus 94.4% in 2014. More than half the Q4 deterioration is due to higher CAT experience of $68 million compared to $18 million in Q4 2014 with the majority of the balance due to lower prior year reserve releases of $28 million compared to releases of $35 million in the same quarter last year.", "The remaining variance is a result of higher acquisition expense offset by an improvement in our operating expense ratio and a lower accident year ex-CAT loss ratio. We had an accident quarter ex-CAT basis combined ratio was 95.7% compared to 95.4% in Q4 2014. For the full year it was 95.4% similar to the 95.2% we reported in 2014, again, demonstrating that we can absorb exceptional losses such as Tianjin without jeopardizing profitability.", "For Q4 we reported an acquisition ratio of 13.9%, which was 4.8 points higher than Q4 2014. As mentioned last quarter, this is because of legacy Catlin business included a larger share of wholesale specialty business where the acquisition costs are higher than the legacy XL business, which was largely retail. This is offset by a lower Q4 operating expense ratio of 19.5% which was 3.3 points lower than Q4 2014 and by a lower net accident year ex-CAT loss ratio of 62.3% which was 1.2 points lower than Q4 2014.", "Insurance gross premiums written in Q4 increased by 59% or $859 million year-over-year, about $2.4 billion or 41% for the full year, driven largely from the Catlin acquisition. This growth occurred in all four of our underwriting divisions. When we look at both legacy organizations and normalize the foreign-exchange, our actual year-over-year growth was still positive in Q4 and up nearly 3% year-to-date, reflecting our success in maintaining the two legacy portfolios. This is something we continue to be very pleased with particularly given current market conditions.", "Shifting to progress and integration, let me share a few highlights from an insurance segment perspective. Firstly, the market response to XL Catlin continues to be very favorable. As mentioned in last quarter's Q&A, we have established a robust process to track loss business emanating from the deal and throughout 2015 this metric has consistently been tracking at less than 1%. Business protections that continues to track well with historical trends and most importantly, our new business opportunities also continue to be strong despite market conditions.", "Second, with our new leadership teams and underwriting organizations fully in place, we have exceeded our 2015 synergy targets for the segment, as we have been able to streamline our underwriting capabilities across divisions and regions.", "And third, with regard to our longer term and state plans, we continue our efforts to consolidate pricing methodologies, operating model and legal entity structures. And our progress is on plan and most likely ahead of plan. As Mike mentioned earlier, we are also developing plans to pull our synergy lever ever harder in 2016 through further efficiencies. We will continue to share progress in future quarters.", "Turning to market conditions. The headwinds which strengthened throughout the year have continued. Pricing was negative across most lines of business as the overall rate change for the segment was down 2% in the quarter and year-to-date. The most significant decreases were once again in our short tail lines. We saw broadly flat rates in our long tail lines and we continue to see some rate increases, most notably in cyber and environmental North America.", "Overall, our casualty lines are down just 1% and professional businesses were flat. Our specialty business was down 3% reflecting continued competitive conditions in the aviation lines as evidenced by the December airline renewals and our energy, property and construction businesses were once again most severely impacted led by reductions in the energy book of approximately 10% and reductions in our international and North American property books of 5%.", "Despite these market headwinds, we continue to focus on margin as we transition from retaining the business to turning the business. Clearly expense management, as Mike mentioned earlier, will remain a very important lever in 2016 as will improving our mix of business, leveraging analytics into underwriting actions and increasing our reinsurance efficiency. By pulling all of these levers, we firmly believe that there are opportunities for further underwriting improvements and given our greater market presence, we are confident in our ability to expand margins despite the difficult market conditions.", "In summary, we delivered another quarter of underwriting profitability, continued to grow the book and made significant progress on our integration and we fully expect this to continue into 2016.", "And now to Greg to discuss the reinsurance results.", "Greg Hendrick", "Thanks, Paul. Today I will discuss results for the quarter and provide a summary of the January 1 renewals.", "Beginning with the results, the reinsurance segment produced solid underwriting performance with a calendar quarter combined ratio of 79.1% and underwriting profit of $154 million compared with 61.2% and $156 million, respectively for the fourth quarter of last year. The result for the quarter continued to benefit from favorable prior year development, modest catastrophe losses offset by a higher accident year ex-CAT loss ratio.", "Reserve releases in the quarter totaled $93 million compared to $62 million a year ago, lowering the combined ratio by 12.6 and 50.4 points, respectively. In the current quarter, all five regions experienced releases, driven primarily by the property catastrophe and casualty treaty lines of business. As Pete noted, we continued the process of harmonizing the reserving methodology across the segment and our reserving process continues to recognize values quickly and allows potential good news to become credible.", "Catastrophe losses totaled $39 million net of reinstatement premiums during the quarter compared to $40 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The major contributors to CAT activity during the quarter was the U.K. December storms, Indian floods and Australian hail and bush fire events. While our combined disaster portfolio is better diversified, this quarter's CAT activity is indicative of a book that is likely to incur loss at lower industry loss levels relative to the XL portfolio.", "Segment produced an accident quarter ex-CAT loss ratio of 50.2% which compares to the 39.9% produced in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase is driven primarily by a property facultative large loss, loss activity on our worldwide agriculture portfolio and the impact of recent rate decreases.", "The expense ratio increased 2.9 points to 35.8% in the fourth quarter compared to 32.9% for the fourth quarter of 2014. This increase is primarily driven by a purchase accounting adjustment of $18 million or 2.4 points.", "Turning to topline. Gross written premium for the quarter was $206 million, up from $158 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase was driven primarily by the Catlin acquisition and was partially offset by the time of a large quarter share renewal, which moved to January 1 inception.", "Given the light activity in the fourth quarter, the full year for the combined XL Catlin is more indicative of how our portfolio changed and the segment's gross written premium fell 8% year-over-year. This reduction was driven by foreign-exchange, lower multiyear premium and adjustments to estimated premium. After adjusting for these three factors, our topline was essentially flat year-over-year. Less than 0.5% or $10 million, part of the 8% drop resulted from client concerns about the XL Catlin combination. And even in these difficult market conditions, we were able to write $372 million of new business in 2015.", "Turning to January 1 renewals. The market generally renewed in an orderly fashion and we continued to experience deteriorating rates across most lines and regions resulting in a low single-digit decrease. We saw increased demand from a number of clients that have increased retentions over past renewals and broadly speaking terms across the book remain as expiring.", "Expanding on rates, our global property catastrophe portfolio fell 6% with the U.S. market down roughly 5% and the rest of the world down 7% to 8%. Contrary to press coverage, while some clients achieved double-digit decreases, we did not see that as a broader trend across the international catastrophe market.", "The non-catastrophe property treaty portfolio fell 4% between declining rates and some clients achieving ceding commission increases. On a positive note, our casualty treaty portfolio across the world renewed essentially flat. Overall this renewal reinforced our view that rate decreases are decelerating across the reinsurance marketplace.", "In summary, the fourth quarter and full year results were solid for the reinsurance segment. Despite the challenging market conditions and the rapid integration with Catlin, our underwriting teams did an excellent job retaining a profitable business and finding new opportunities while maintaining underwriting discipline. As we head into 2016, we are well-positioned for continued success as our momentum the market remains strong and we have broad support from our clients and brokers.", "I will now turn it back to David.", "David Radulski", "Rita, can you please open the lines for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "David Radulski", "Hello Kai.", "Kai Pan", "In fact, how much of the contribute of those are above normal levels or because last year reinsurance segments, the exiting the loss ratio is abnormally low. I just wondered, these are new normal level or above your average?", "David Radulski", "Kai, this is David. Sorry, the first part of your question was cut off. So hate to ask you, but could you repeat that please?", "Kai Pan", "Sure. The first question is for Greg. The question is on the large losses, non-CAT losses as well as agriculture losses. I just wonder, are those losses above normal levels or it just returned to normal levels from the low levels of 4Q 2014?", "Greg Hendrick", "Sure, Kai. If you took the 10 point delta year-over-year, 3% of it is from a single large back loss. It's a risk that both XL and Catlin wrote through the combination. We renewed it. We looked at the loss. We write the risk again. It was just an abnormally large loss for us on our faculty of portfolio. Both faculty of portfolios have run very well over the years. So that's one piece that's out of the norm.", "The second is the crop. This is partly a testament to where I talked earlier about reflecting bad news fast. We had in our U.S. global ag business a particular crop that underperformed relative to some conditions that are needed to be successful. And so we took all of that bad news of roughly about $8 million in this quarter. The remainder of the crop may go well. In fact the freeze coverage is the remaining risk left and it's going very well so far, I am touching wood, in California which is our major exposure. The remainder of it was abnormal activity, somewhat weather related around the world.", "So the six points there, that I would say, are well outside the norm. The remainder of it is a lot of little moving things. Part of it is what we talked about in terms of harmonizing reserve. That's just a reflection of that in the fourth quarter. In the current accident year, we would have made some higher picks. We would have taken the entire impact of the full year in the fourth quarter and some of it, a little bit of it is mix.", "But in the end, it is also a little bit due to rate. It is impossible to expect flat accident years, year-over-year, with what we have been going through the rate environment. But I would put that in the one or two point range out of that whole 10. So by and large, a lot of it is unusual activity, a little bit of it as it reflects the current market conditions.", "Kai Pan", "Okay. Great. Well, then I follow-up o the reserve. You mentioned, Pete, on the modest strengthening in the Catlin book. In the past, Catlin has been sort of steady release reserves. I am wondering if could you talk a little bit detail about that? Is that just reserving philosophy change or process change? And what's the outlook over there?", "Pete Porrino", "Hi, Kai. It's Pete. So we had, obviously talked about this during last quarter's call as well about the harmonization process and we did put the legacy Catlin reserves through our semiannual process in the fourth quarter here. And just to be clear, in the in the fourth quarter and for the year, we recorded about $33 million of adverse prior year development on those reserves. And what we mean when said the harmonization, well we harmonize assumptions at the reserve profile level.", "So very, very detailed and that included assumptions, such as initial expected loss ratios, reporting and payment patterns, ground-up loss estimates, the natural cat perils as well as major events. I would say, while this harmonization is largely complete, the ongoing alignment to our process of reacting more slowly to potential good news will take a little bit time to fully implement. And as Greg just noted, I also wanted to mention that we did harmonize the accident year picks as well in 2015, which did cause a true-up in the fourth quarter.", "Kai Pan", "How long process could last? A few more quarters?", "Pete Porrino", "No. The harmonization process is done.", "Kai Pan", "Okay. So you are on the same process right now.", "Pete Porrino", "We are on the same process now.", "Kai Pan", "Okay. That's great. Then my last question for Mike is really, given standing back, if you can look at your expense savings target to $300 million or more, at the same time, you experience some CAT losses, large non-CAT losses as well as the pricing pressure. I just wonder is that expense savings will be enough to offset these headwinds? And will you be able to still achieve underlying combined ratio improvements going forward?", "Mike McGavick", "Kai, thank you. The answer is yes, we do expect to achieve continued combined ratio improvement period, but not just because of the expense lever. While we are pulling it hard and in fact harder now than we were at the beginning because of market conditions, we do not mean that we think expense and rate pressure are simply offsetting and will leave it at that. Our belief is that this book of business has plenty of room to improve and that's the underwriter's task for this year.", "I think Pete said something that I really want to underscore. In the fourth quarter, you have seen not only the harmonization of the reserves come through, but you have seen the harmonization of the loss ratio picks come through. So I do not believe that the fourth quarter ex for example, in insurance. I do not believe that the fourth quarter, for example in insurance, I do not believe that the fourth quarter ex-CAT accident year loss ratio, you are looking at this quarter of 62.3%,", "I do not believe that that's the run rate for next year, because we have had things that were harmonized during the year when the catch-up was largely in the fourth quarter. So that would have elevated that loss ratio beyond what we actually believe the book is running at. And that doesn't account for the underwriting actions that began, as I mentioned in my remarks, midway through last year and the will start paying off during the course of this year.", "So we don't accept that we -- probably could offset rate with expense ratio, but we don't believe that's the game. The game is a stronger and more profitable book of business and we believe were in the process of creating exactly that.", "Kai Pan", "That's great. Well, thank you so much for the answers.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Mr. Cliff Gallant with Nomura.. Sir, your line is open.", "Cliff Gallant", "Thank you. Great quarter, great year. My first question is on the additional $50 million of savings. Could you just give us some sort of tangible examples of what drove that? Is it real estate? Is it people? And in terms it hitting the bottom line, where will we see it? Will it be in the corporate expense line or the operating expense line?", "Mike McGavick", "It's mainly going to be in the operating expense line, a little bit of that comes down over the corporate but we are focused on that operating expense line. So that is the driver. And it's across the place. I mean, when you get past the easy and obvious, it starts to be more of a grind around processes that yield greater efficiency. So you shift from the real estate stuff or shutting down an investment or kind of obvious duplicated efforts and now you are into making the whole place work in a more efficient way from beginning to end of our dealings with clients from seeking them to serving them. And that's the work that now comes to the fore.", "So by definition that has more meaning in terms of the headcount than other kinds of expenses. And by the way, as Pete mentioned when he walked through the numbers, we can already see that it against what we forecast our expense levels to be, although a little bit helped by FX, I don't want to overstate that, it's just a little bit, we are already at a run rate of $300 million already today. So we wouldn't use a number like that if we weren't highly confident, but it isn't like you are going to see some big new thing and the people that are affected are largely already informed.", "Now it's not to say that everybody who may be affected by it has yet been informed because there is continuing work to make it better and better across each process. But in my experience with this, which goes back to Safeco days is that once you get this in motion and you get the right mindset in motion, more and more reveals itself because people strain themselves to imagine it to be better and they can do that. So I am sorry, I can't point to this or that process, I do think the one area that I am highly focused on beginning of this year is some duplication that crept into reinsurance or insurance organization management levels that we are focused on. So there are pieces we are working on right now and they will be dealt with quickly.", "Cliff Gallant", "Okay. And as a follow-up question on the tax rate, I appreciate that quarter-to-quarter, it seems like there is going to be a lot of volatility to that. How should we think about it long-term though? It maybe an annual rate or even just longer, like what is XL Catlin's tax rate?", "Pete Porrino", "Well, that is every quarter and every year, you are right, Cliff, this is Pete, that that will change. What we have talked about in the past would continue to be true. What happened this quarter, I don't think is something that would get us to change our overall view in what we have been saying over time that we thought it would be in the low double-digit rate. I think we have talked in the past of sort of in the 11%, 12% range.", "Cliff Gallant", "Okay. That's great. Thank you very much.", "Mike McGavick", "I just want to add that your question gets to a larger issue. We know and understand and sympathize with the frustration of getting to kind of clear baseline for the long-term future. We are working hard to make it as clear as we can but that's just the reality of transactions. I mean I have to say, we could not be more delighted with the way this transaction is going. We agree that it creates some appearances of volatility or opaqueness that we are not used to having and we promise as things become clear, we will share them with you in the clearest possible way we can so we can get back to the orderly review of the business and not this constant of what's the new norm. We get that. We are frustrated by it too.", "But we would remind you, these two businesses have now been operating together for nine months. I mean, a period of rapid reorganization and when I think of what our competitors are going through, when I think of the combinations that have been announced, but not yet completed we would rather be us than anybody in terms of being through the hardest part of our hard work and ready to compete in what are difficult conditions, but difficult conditions that I would rather have our hand to play. So I just want to say, I empathize with the frustration on getting to the new normal and we promise to do everything we can to help you get there along the way.", "David Radulski", "Next, operator?", "Operator", "All right. And our next question comes from Mr. Mike Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is now open.", "Mike Nannizzi", "Thanks. Mike, maybe picking up on the commentary around the expense ratio. It looks like you are trading off a higher acquisition cost for a lower operating expense ratio, but that trade-off is not quite balanced out compared to pre the acquisition. So first off, how should we think about how that sort of moves forward? And from your comments, it sounds like you would expect once synergies and everything else is fully baked in that we should be better than we were before the acquisition? And I would think that would sort of need to happen in order for it to begin to trade-off against loss ratio deterioration from pricing. But can you give me some idea, because just looking at what we have seen sp far this year versus the comments, I am having trouble seeing where we start to crossover here?", "Mike McGavick", "You are right. I understand the question. So a couple of pieces, Mike. First of all, I just want to note something that I note with some pride, in this quarter, when you take out the cost of synergies and just look at the rate of operating expenses, we overachieved on absolute dollars delivered to shareholders in this year alone and in fact this is the first quarter in two years that our operating expense ratio is below 20%. I mean our insurance operations. So I was delighted to see that. And all I would say, tell you is we view that as a preview of events to come and not the resting point.", "Number two, there is an elevation in acquisition expense for reasons Paul mentions, that there is a different mix and there is more program business in the Catlin book. But we also believe there is levers to drive that down as well. So we don't accept it's at the long run level. Between those two taken together, yes, you will see absolute improvement. There is expected to be between those two absolute improvement in the expenses of the company taken together across the acquisition expense.", "That's the first thing. Second thing, you did slip in a comment of expected accident year loss ratio deterioration because you are right, we don't accept that. We believe this book, even in this environment, can continue to produce through mix exchange and the reunderwriting already going on, improvement over the course of next year in the accident year loss ratio. So I don't -- I am sorry to note that, but I don't accept the observation.", "Mike Nannizzi", "Okay. Thanks for that clarification. And then maybe can we talk a little bit about within the insurance segment you had some unusual loss activity. It sounds like some large loss frequency events. Can we quantify that at all? I realize it's a business you write and you will probably write again next year, but it sounds like there is a little bit more than expected. So if we can just get some boundary around what that was?", "Mike McGavick", "Yes. I am going to ask Paul to get into some of the detail, but let me observe two phenomenon that are really important that we have underscored a couple of times. Number one, we did have within year loss ratio pick harmonization. So that process is now complete. And we go off on a common footing for next year. And that would have been mainly toward the end of the year. There was a little bit in the third quarter and cleaned up in the fourth quarter. So you would have seen some elevation that doesn't reflect these larger losses that have been discussed.", "Second, you also would have seen some larger losses from the first half of the year develop into the second half of the year and you did see that across the market, particularly in the marine and energy books, which I think had tough years across the market, not just in our company.", "So those are two categories that don't fit the theme of simply elevated loss activity. But Paul?", "Paul Brand", "Yes. As you look at losses, say about $10 million, there is four or five of them made in this quarter adding up to around $50 million. So that's a little over 3% on the loss ratio. If you compare that to the last year, there is about 1% difference in loss ratio, say maybe just over 2% for last year.", "Mike Nannizzi", "Great. Thank you. And then just a couple number ones, if I could Pete, any thoughts on alternatives for the first quarter just given where we are?", "Pete Porrino", "Yes, Mike. The only one that you could really talk about right now would be the investment manager affiliates, right. Because as you know that's done on a three month lag. I think on the last call I had indicated that we would likely have a loss in the fourth quarter which is what we did. Right now, as we said, we haven't finished the numbers but I would expect that to be a small positive.", "Mike Nannizzi", "Okay. And then last one. Pete, could you provide, I mean there are obviously lot of moving parts here, the operating tax and pretax operating income, just so we can have that?", "Pete Porrino", "Sure, let me step back, because I have heard there are a few questions about the tax rate and what the $39 million meant? So let me spend a minute if I could and try and help people think through that. The first thing I would say is, the $39 million that we disclosed, at XL almost all the tax is on operating almost all the time because the nonoperating things, the realized gains and losses, sales outcomes, that kind of stuff typically have very little tax impact on those. And so the operating tax impact would have been $41 million gain rather than the $39 million that we disclosed in total.", "To put that in context, okay. So the question of, okay, so you recorded on operating income a $41 million gain, how do I think about that? And if you look at what the operating income was before tax, you ask about that number, it was $153 million. I had guided everyone just now to 11%, 12% tax rate. If you use 12%, you would have had an expected tax in the quarter of about $18 million, just working the math, but we had, as I said, a $41 million benefit. So a delta or a difference of $59 million, right.", "And as was in my comments, you really got to think about two things, the actual tax rate for the year, given the distribution of income around the world and the second one is, I refer to our ability to use the legacy Catlin net operating loss carry forwards in the U.S. So in the third quarter, right, we had adjusted our expected tax rate down to 10% was what I disclosed. So now in the third quarter, I need to adjust that again for what the annual expected tax rate is. It turned out for the year to be about 3.5%. So that difference times the nine month's income is about $35 million. So that's the first benefit.", "The second one is the fourth quarter itself, 3.5% versus 12%. That's about a $13 million benefit.", "And the last one is this quarter's use of the legacy Catlin NOLs. That was about $11 million or $12 million benefit and that gets you to the $59 million. So I am just trying to transparent here on why the numbers are so different from what you might have expected. So I hope that answers your question, Mike.", "Mike Nannizzi", "That's great. And then if I could sneak one last quick one in here. What should the life segment look like from here, now that you have completed this reinsurance transaction with the remaining term life block?", "Pete Porrino", "Yes. So Mike, it's Pete again. I would expect to be, in essence, breakeven. There is virtually nothing left of those in the disability business.", "Mike Nannizzi", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Mike McGavick", "And just to add, this is Mike. You will recall, that was long ago promised that if we got the right pricing, we would get rid of that last term life block. So I was pleased to get that cleaned up.", "Mike Nannizzi", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Mr. Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill. Sir, your line is now open.", "Paul Newsome", "Good morning. Thanks for the call. I wanted to ask kind of a little bit of a broader picture question here, in that I think insurance companies are valued in part due to their complexity. More complex is bad and less is more valued. Your company, to-date, is one of the more difficult ones to model in the U.S. listed because you have things like affiliates, this runoff life business that's still running through your income statements, the mergers obviously, the tax stuff we just discussed, currency risk. I think I can probably go on. So my question is, forget about next quarter, what are these big pieces are going to be less complex two years from now, besides hopefully the merger piece? And is that an effort you are thinking about, because you obviously sympathize with our difficulty with the complexity, but I think it's evaluation concern as well.", "Mike McGavick", "So I think that always, one of those I feel is something that we have already adjusted to, in the most part and that's the complexity of the life transaction. And what we should remember, it does introduce complexity, but it's a pretty simple complexity. It goes in, it backs out. And you can fairly easily and we transparently show you how to do that every quarter, that isn't going to go away. So to me that's just a matter of patience. You just recognize that that thing has nothing to do with understanding the earnings performance or potential of the company. And you get used to it. My observation would be, Paul, that it becomes more annoying when the underlying results aren't clear and it becomes less annoying when the underlying results are strong.", "So I am guessing we all get simply used to that and what we need to be reminded of perhaps from time-to-time is that the benefit of that transaction was to take enormous volatility and risk off of our balance sheet when before we had done that for some of those and certainly you would remember this, Paul, we used to trade something like a European bond, reacting our stock price, reacting every time Europe got edgy. I would note, Europe's edgy again right now and I just assumed trade for what we produce in terms of insurance operating earnings than whether our life exposures credit portfolio that creates a lot of noise every time Europe has a hiccup.", "So I think it's easier to remember to back in or back out as we clearly delineate every quarter than to have that noise driving the share price. So that one, it will be around for a while. I don't have any plans to cure it. And it's just something I believe, we all get used to and I think we do normally. But when it gets noisy, I think we get irritated.", "The second thing I would point out is, most of the noise that has gone on in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter has been transaction related. And I think we are all going to have to work together quickly to get to kind of a new normal of understanding of what the component parts are, of how to analyze profitability. But the core to it all is, do we believe that this firm is better positioned to generate improved earnings? And my answer to that is yes and it has been ever since the transaction.", "Number one, because we believe we can optimize this book of business to more profitable levels. We have more levers to pull than we ever have. We have a more diversified book of business by both geography and lines of business and that simply gives us more to play with in order to create a better result.", "We, second, are able to optimize the expenses and this was a drag on both companies' prior performance. It was certainly an issue of concern for analysts over time and we are demonstrating with real effort and I think real passion that we can create a very efficient expense platform for this business going forward.", "And then third, we believe that it is about underwriters who have the real ability to make a difference for clients in a changing risk environment. And there, the level of creativity, the continued innovation that we are able to bring into the marketplace will be a source, we believe, of long-term competitive advantage.", "So these are difficult times in the sectors we are in, both specialty, particularly in London and reinsurance have been under some pressure. But that's never a permanent condition. We don't believe it is at all and we like our competitive position in both businesses. Being the leader at Lloyd's gives us a greater ability to influence the market than anybody else has. And being one of the largest writers in reinsurance gives us more both more intellect and more capital and more position with which to influence the direction of that market and to take a leading role in the changes coming about in that market.", "So when I think about the cause of most of the noise that frustrates, it is to do with the recency of the transaction. That resolves itself over time and I don't mean over forever. I mean over pretty soon. And I think the earnings power of the firm due to the expense actions and the speed with which they have been taken and the positioning of the company in the markets we play in, I think comes out over the course of next year, in large part and certainly with great clarity in 2017.", "So I get what you are saying. We view it very differently. We view the core has always been straightforward. Where is the accident year ex-CAT loss ratio going? Are we in line when CAT's do appear? And can we create a more profitable expense platform from which to grow? I think the answer to all of those are yes?", "Greg Hendrick", "So Paul, just a quick follow-up on the on the life reinsurance transaction that Mike talked about, over time the volatility on that will reduce, as GreyCastle, the owner of those assets and liabilities turn that investment portfolio over, that's accelerated recently, so about 25% of those investments have been turned over are now in our trading account rather than available for sale and that will reduce the volatility going forward.", "Paul Newsome", "Great. Thank you guys. I appreciate it.", "Mike McGavick", "Thanks Paul. I appreciate it and I know that these are well understood. And I know I apprised that a bit more aggressive than I would like. But I have seen some analysis out there that I get why it resonates with people but I don't agree with it. Because people are buying into this notion that because specialty and reinsurance are tough places, notably tough, that somehow no one could ever manage to improve a book of business when it's in this condition.", "Just think about the past that faced an underwriter last year and the past the faced that same underwriter this year. Last year, let's say you are coming, you have got two people, one from each company who are running these books of business. We pick the leader between the two. By definition, if it's a Catlin person that's picked, by definition 60% of the book they are looking at they have not seen before and if it's on XL leader, by definition 40% of what they are looking at they haven't seen before.", "I mean crudely put. And so now, you give them the task, keep that book together if you can, remember that we are writing to profit. If someone tries to jam you during this crazy market, let it go and so on. So you have this huge task of learning the book, assembling the book. It is a confusing difficult year, but never did we tell them, keep the book at any price. So they have got a mandate to still find a profitable way through it.", "This year, the books assembled. They have got one job to do, optimize this book. We are now willing to accept that if you have a prejudice against a segment of that book and you are the leader that book, act on it. Last year, we would have told you, why don't you test it out first before you decide that the other guy was dumb. This is a clearer year for every person in our company around the globe. And at the same time, we tell them never give up the hunt for profitable opportunity or the opportunity to innovate, to do something different for the client now that we more information and not that we have more capability.", "So we are excited about what that unleashes into the market that maybe difficult market conditions but we are going to be whistling while we work. This is fun stuff.", "Paul Newsome", "Thanks, Mike.", "David Radulski", "And Rita next to the queue please.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Vinay Misquith from Sterne, Agee. Your line is now open.", "Vinay Misquith", "Hi. Thanks. Good morning. So first is a really simple numbers question and if you could answer this, this would be really helpful. How much of the $300 million in expense saves should flow to earnings in 2016 and 2017? In other words, how much have you already taken versus how much is still left to come in?", "Pete Porrino", "So Vinay, this is Pete. I would say that in 2016, my guess is that $300 million, there would be the majority of it would come in and the rest in 2017.", "Vinay Misquith", "Well, actually my question was, how much have you already taken in 2015? So last quarter, I believe you mentioned you have already taken $75 million of the $215 million to earnings. So how much is further left to flow into earnings?", "Pete Porrino", "So what I had talked about was a run rate, right, of a reasonable amount of money that you can see the savings. The actual amount that came in 2015 would have been certainly less than half of that $300 million. If you would like, give me a couple of minutes and I will come up with a little better quantification of those.", "Vinay Misquith", "Sure. So what we struggle with is, how much further is left to flow through the earnings in 2016 and 2017. So that's -- okay. The second point is, I just wanted to clarify upon the large losses affecting both the reinsurance and the primary insurance. I believe reinsurance had six points of higher large losses and the primary about one point of higher losses? I just wanted to just clarify that.", "Greg Hendrick", "Yes. On the reinsurance, this is Greg, there is 3% from a single loss and there is 3% from a collection of losses in our worldwide agriculture book. So 6% in total.", "Vinay Misquith", "Sure. And on the primary book?", "Pete Porrino", "Yes. And that was the right number, roughly 1% delta as you look at losses about $10 million.", "Vinay Misquith", "Okay. That's helpful. And then Mike, I just wanted to clarify. You mentioned that through remixing of the business, you can alleviate problems with pricing in the large market and in specialty lines. Is that what I heard?", "Mike McGavick", "Yes. We believe we can overcome rate deterioration through remixing and combined ratio improvement through that continued loss ratio improvement and the continued synergy expense savings and also getting down, to some degree, the elevated level of commission. So we have all three levels working.", "Pete Porrino", "So Vinay, this is Pete. So giving you those round numbers on the $300 million, I would say in 2015, there is a little bit over $100 million in there. In 2016, we would expect that number to go up a little bit more, call it $120 million to $130 million range and then the rest would come in 2017.", "Vinay Misquith", "Okay. That's helpful. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. Sir, your line is now open.", "Meyer Shields", "Thanks. Good morning. I appreciate your patience. One quick question just on the increased savings. I don't mean to decry it. Obviously it's good news. But does that mean higher integration expenses in 2016 than at the $250 million run rate?", "Mike McGavick", "First, I will give you two general points and let Pete answer the specific question. Number one, we do expect that at this point, the costs to achieve synergy have peaked and will be coming down from here, number one. Number two, I have always been willing to spend to save as long as the saving is permitted, the spending temporary and as long as the ratio we have described of 1.25:1 holds. At this point, we are beating that ratio, we are raising the level of permanent savings and I would always grab more savings if I thought that it was a permanent restructuring is creating more efficient platform. But we peaked and we expect that to come down and now the expense savings, as Pete described, kind of $100 million-ish already realized this year, add $120 million that will be saved in addition next year. So kind of $220 million by the end of next year. And then the balance of the $300 comes through with great clarity in 2017.", "Pete says I gave the whole answer, sorry.", "Meyer Shields", "No. That's okay. I am happy to get it from either of you. This is a modeling question. So there was a true-up of the Catlin accident year 2015 loss ratio in the fourth quarter. Does that mean that in the first, let's say half of 2016, we shouldn't expect that much year-over-year improvement because the prior year quarters were reported on the basis of this lower initial loss pick?", "Pete Porrino", "Meyer, this is Pete. This gets and I apologize, it's a tad complicated So in the prior year quarters that would be legacy XL only and so they would not have had those true-ups and certainly in the first quarter and for the majority of the second quarter as well. So as you are modeling, you will probably need to take that into account. The accident year loss ratio adjustments obviously were only for the legacy Catlin portfolio.", "Meyer Shields", "Right. Understood. I meant on the numbers that we had for Catlin for the first half of last year.", "Pete Porrino", "For the numbers that you have for legacy Catlin for the first half of last year. Yes, there would be a small change in the accident year loss ratio pick.", "Meyer Shields", "Okay. And then one bigger picture question, if I can, I guess for Mike. How long does it take from the time, obviously AIG is starting to pull back in some lines of business where it's not earning a profit. How long does it take from them notifying people that they are out of certain product lines before XL Catlin starts seeing the opportunities to generate profitable growth?", "Mike McGavick", "It's hard to say exactly what they will do and how they will handle it. So it's not as simple as they announced that and the next day new stuff starts flowing around. You must remember we are in a very difficult pricing environment and while there are some positive signs here and there that there is a different attitude emerging, we are certainly not calling a bottom.", "We can still see competitive behavior. And usually when you start to have players change their positioning in the market, at the initial wave of change, it is not necessary positive. A bunch of underpriced business gets released. That group still thinks we are in a soft market and expects the same or even more attractive pricing. And the rest, when you get a turn coming, is when that starts to happen and people don't do it in the same way.", "They say, well that's interesting, but that's going to cost a lot more to insure. And we aren't to that point. I do not think so. The initial wave of these kinds of movements, I don't think creates some kind of a turn or some kind of a huge growth opportunity. It's a very, very selective process at the beginning. You have got to look for the really good accounts that got thrown out, baby with the bathwater.", "That's what you are hunting for. And those ones you do want to pick up and grow. So our underwriters are going to be on high alert that this is pretty dangerous time and there's lot of underpriced businesses going to flood into the market and you would want to look through that and pick through that and find your spots. And I would say there is a number of companies who are engaged in that process, not just the one you mentioned. And to some extent, we will be.", "We continue to do some underwriting and maybe I will ask Paul to elaborate a little bit but we have been certainly through and been picking and starting to push some stuff out. But I have seen some commentary in the market that, boy, is that going to be a great opportunity for us. I don't think that's quite the right mindset for the underwriters. This is a highly selective moment in time.", "But what you want to be positioned with is, we have gotten our hard work out of the way, you know your underwriter, they are ready to go, you know their quality, you know their capabilities, you know their appetite. You want to be clear in how that is all functioning and we have got that hard work done last year. So that our odds are, we are totally ready for shifts in the market, totally ready to go through this highly intense and very selective process.", "Paul Brand", "Yes. And I think just to reiterate what Mike said, I think the stability that we offer is very attractive potentially to clients and the right, proper clients. So clearly some of the dislocation will create opportunities, but we need to be very thoughtful about how we go about executing on those. Coming back to underwriting actions and clearly hard work that can be undertaken in 2016. But again, just to reiterate what Mike said, we did start as soon as we brought the businesses together, whether it was exiting the ITV motor binder or the emphasis of public entities and some accountants business and professional lines, reunderwriting of the New York Contractors book and I could go on and on about the underwriting actions that we took place early in 2015 and those actions will start to have positive benefits as we earn through in 2016.", "Meyer Shields", "Okay. That was very helpful. Thank you so much.", "Mike McGavick", "I am sorry. I neglected that one point, it's important. The broker conversations aren't changing. When the brokers see some of the more radical actions that others are now being forced to take, they get nervous that their best clients are going to face disruption. And the conversation they have with us as someone who has gotten the hard work behind them and is ready to go and has all that capability at that very global level and the global program, all the risk that's in our toolkit, the conversation doesn't start like it was, say, two years ago or a year ago, hey, let's start with off 10% and go from there. The conversation starts, I have got a gem of a client here. I am nervous about what's going on the market. Show me what you can do for this client. That's a very different conversation than the ones we were having and those have broken out all around the world. So it is not the same. As difficult as we keep describing this market is, it's not the same.", "Meyer Shields", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from Dan Farrell from Piper Jaffray. Sir, your line is now open.", "Dan Farrell", "Thank you and good morning. Just a quick question. Where do you think you stand with regard to your management volatility? There were some large losses in the quarter in the past that some larger loss activity. How far along are you in managing that risk? And how much more of a lever do you think that is going forward, given that you really haven't been a combined company with Catlin for very long? And apologies for the voice.", "Mike McGavick", "No problem. I hope you are feeling well. The number one thing is, if I think about this last half of the year, Dan, while there is some noise in there and we have talked about it, I am still very impressed with the resilience of our profitability. The back half of this year saw a changing that's more than a point on the loss ratio. And many companies threw that in the CAT bucket, we didn't and we were still able to deliver profitability with a -- what is that?", "That's the largest man-made loss in Asia's history and one of the largest Marine losses in history and we were able to absorb that and still deliver profit and have these other smaller losses come through that Paul has described as well and true-up the first half of the year and still deliver a profit. So this book is more resilient and less subject to kind of wild spikiness that you would have seen with those kinds of events going back two, maybe now three years ago, you would have seen wild volatility in our quarterly results. You saw a deterioration, but you didn't see wild spikes that took us out of profitability. That is the book performing better.", "Now is it optimized? Are we really where we would like to be? No. And there is work we can do both on limits management, on understanding the flow of volatility of the book, on that we are doing in reinsurance, all of which are being done with fresh eyes to the whole book. So can it get even better from here? Yes, but would I say this is a quarter that shows wild volatility. I would actually say, it's a quarter that shows a real absorption. And I was kind of pleased with that result, but I will turn the mic to my colleagues in case you want to add something.", "Paul Brand", "Yes, I think the reinsurance points have been interesting. One that clearly, as we go around centralizing and redividing how we purchase the reinsurance program, which was, a little progress was made on one. One of the goals of that is to, both increase the value of the reinsurance program and also to reduce volatility. And that's something that we think we are achieving against.", "Dan Farrell", "That's helpful Thank you.", "Mike McGavick", "That was the question, I listen, I know that this is a very busy day of earnings and many of your racing off to other calls, I hope we have spoken clearly. And I want to be clear about something, our purpose is always to make sure we clearly communicate how we view it. We know that you have difficult judgments to make all the time. But we wanted you to know, particularly given the third and fourth quarter, we want you to know very, very clearly that we are on exactly what we think matters and all the things we said would come about as a result of this transaction, they are coming about. And we have very high confidence in our ability to continue to improve the loss ratio and to continue to improve our combined ratios given the December book that we are looking at so closely. So we are excited about this year and looking forward to showing that in the numbers and not just in our words. Hope you have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you.

[Operator Instructions]. Now I would like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "David Radulski", "Thank you, Lori and welcome to XL Group's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Our call today is being simultaneously webcast at www.xlcatlin.com. We posted to our website several documents, including our press release and quarterly financial supplement. We also refer you to the 8-K referencing Q1 integration costs we posted to our website on March 30, 2016. On our call today, Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, will offer opening remarks. Pete Porrino, XL's Chief Financial Officer, will review our financial results, followed by Paul Brand, our Chief Underwriting Officer and Chair of our Insurance Leadership Team, and Greg Hendrick, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations, will review their segment results and market conditions, then we'll open it up for questions.", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain of the matters we will discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations, all of which involve risk and uncertainty and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them. Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, as well as other documents on file with the SEC, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to information, future developments or otherwise.", "With that, I turn it over to Mike McGavick.", "Mike McGavick", "Good evening and thank you for joining our first quarter 2016 earnings call, a call on which XL Catlin navigated challenging conditions and produced good underlying results, while maintaining our focus on bottom-line underwriting and top-line discipline. It will be no surprise to you that our view is consistent with what you have already been hearing from others during this quarter, that market headwinds are very tough. But as we will discuss tonight, in our results we think you can see many indicators of a well-managed book, and at the same time, a few one-off impacts related to the continuing fine-tuning of some of our processes and underwriting following the Catlin acquisition, particularly now our ceded reprograms.", "So I'm going to walk through our results and a few of these highlights and impacts and then we also want to give you a little bit more help. And in a break with our normal tradition, a little guidance on two specific areas, the insurance acquisition expense ratio and the split between insurance and reinsurance, now that we have nearly 12 months of XL Catlin results to point to. And then, of course, I'll turn it over to Pete for some additional financial information and to Paul and Greg to discuss the segment results in greater detail. Looking at our results from the top of the house, in this quarter we produced a P&C combined ratio of 92.5%, gross premiums written of $4.4 billion and an underwriting profit of $175 million.", "Our operating net income for the quarter of $103 million was impacted by $55 million of transaction-related integration costs and a higher level of cats in the quarter, at $53 million in this first quarter versus $15 million in the first quarter of 2015. We also continue to see impacts from the financial markets in our affiliate income, with $8 million of earnings in this quarter compared with $58 million in the first quarter of 2015. Now, that is a portfolio that has served us really well over time and we think it will do so again in the future. Obviously it is a difficult time for the hedge funds right now. Prior-year releases in the quarter were $43 million versus $48 million in the first quarter of 2015.", "As a reminder, we conduct a full review of our reserves in the second and fourth quarters. In terms of the segments' results, we continue to look for pockets of opportunity amid the tough pricing environment. Reinsurance saw some new business opportunities which Greg will discuss and produced a solid combined ratio of 84.3% and an underwriting profit of $119 million. In insurance, the ongoing fine-tuning and hard work came through once again in the accident quarter ex-cat loss ratio of 61.2%. As you know, this has been an area of focus for us and we're pleased to see this metric continue to improve now for three consecutive quarters. And it again points to the determination to focus on the bottom-line fundamentals amidst all the difficulties of the current market conditions. Paul will have further details regarding the insurance segment in his remarks.", "Now, I said that there were some one-off and unique items impacting these results, particularly in insurance, including higher acquisition costs, due in part to the timing and mix of our ceded Re programs. And here, as I said, for one time I'm going to give you some forward-looking guidance. As these acquisition expenses even out through the rest of the year, we expect that the insurance segment acquisition expense ratio should move back in line with what we saw in the second half of 2015. And then to the second bit of guidance I mentioned.", "We realize that this overall challenging rate environment, as well as the transaction effects themselves, haven't made it easy for you to model certain things like the insurance and reinsurance business split for net earned premium. We have now reported, of course, 11 months as a combined company. When you add in April of last year and include the Catlin results for that period, you have a trailing 12-month split of between 68% and 69% for insurance, with the balance being reinsurance and that would be the gauge I would look to use, looking forward for the full year.", "So, stepping back, how should you think about XL Catlin in this current market? This is a question obviously we've been asking our leaders and broker partners and clients quite a bit, as well. And the challenge of the market means that the actual reception XL Catlin receives from brokers and clients is not yet fully showing up in the numbers. But the fundamentals we intended to deliver through the transaction continued to be very strong.", "First, I've already mentioned our continued loss ratio progress in insurance. Second, we're ahead of the transaction-related synergy savings targets. And as you'll recall in the previous quarter, we increased our expected run rate synergy savings to $300 million. Further, the P&C expense ratio for the quarter decreased to 16.6% in Q1 versus the 19.1% in the prior-year quarter. And that is actually the lowest this metric has been in eight quarters. And as we've said, we're working toward greater efficiency and we're ready to pull the expense level further, if and when it should prove necessary.", "Third, this transaction was based on combining two underwriting-centric cultures and we're insisting on fundamental bottom-line focused behavior. And when you tell underwriters to do what's right for the bottom line in a difficult rate environment like this, you will get less premium. It's that simple. But we like the discipline. We like the focus. And we like what our combined trends have been able to do so far, whether it's in fine-tuning their books and exiting some underperforming lines or simply walking away from new opportunities where we don't see the margins. Yes, we want them out there seeking opportunities and we see an amazing flow of opportunities, just not many that we're willing to write at these prices.", "Fourth, we've maintained the ability to manage our capital. Based on what we told you previously, you should have expected around $700 million in buybacks for the year. Then, seeing our premium trends in this quarter, combined with our comfort in our capital position, led us during the quarter to add $250 million in buybacks to the plan. With this additional $250 million, we got through buying back about $180 million in quarter one. We expect to finish the balance of that additional $250 million in buybacks, as well as the planned amount towards the original $700 million, in the next quarter.", "So to be very clear, as of right now, around $950 million is what you should expect for the year for buybacks. Of course, we will continue to evaluate this as the trends emerge. So all-in, the Company is producing good results and the reaction from clients and brokers continues to be enormously positive. And I certainly know you have good networks to check me out on this. The recent RIMS Conference was simply a resounding success for our firm. We're producing on the new opportunities as we intended, but we will not chase top line. This isn't the market for it. We're only going to write what we see the margin. And we will make the tough decisions to stay disciplined, exit lines where we don't see future potential and plan for these difficult markets to continue, even though, in the end, of course, they are unsustainable. And when there is a turn, we intend to be the best positioned firm in the marketplace. We're seeing that come true and we're looking forward to that inevitable time.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Pete.", "Pete Porrino", "Well, thanks, Mike and good evening. Operating net income for the first quarter was $103 million or $0.35 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to $194 million in 2015 or $0.75 per share. As we previously disclosed, during the first quarter we incurred $55 million in integration costs which have been included in operating income. Our net income attributable to ordinary shareholders for the quarter was $22 million or $0.07 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to $36 million or $0.14 per share for the same quarter in 2015.", "As we have previously noted, our net income numbers are impacted by the mark-to-market movement of the derivatives that transfer the economics of the assets backing our second quarter 2014 Life Reinsurance sale transaction. We continue to show that relationship in the summary consolidated financial data included with the press release. As always, it has no impact on comprehensive income or operating results. Our property and casualty combined ratio for the quarter was 92.5% or 3.6 points higher than the same quarter last year. Our property and casualty combined ratio, excluding private development and the impact of natural catastrophes for the quarter, was 92.1%, 0.7 points higher than the first quarter of 2015.", "Our natural catastrophe losses totaled $53 million or 2.2 loss ratio points for the quarter compared to $15 million or 1.1 loss ratio points in the same quarter of 2015. Prior-year development was a positive $43 million or 1.8 loss ratio points for the quarter compared to net favorable development of $48 million and 3.7 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2015. This reflects a favorable development of $11 million in the insurance segment and favorable development of $32 million in the reinsurance segment. As we have discussed in previous calls, during the first and third quarters, our reserving process is based on our review of actual versus expected losses.", "Our semiannual full actuarial review will be included in our results next quarter and we intend to provide our global loss triangles later this quarter. These will be our first as a combined company. And Paul and Greg will discuss our lending rounding results in further detail. Operating expenses have decreased in the quarter as we have made material progress achieving synergies from the transaction. We continue to view the overall relationship between the one-time cost to achieve integration and the ongoing synergies to be approximately 1.25 to 1. We expect that additional synergies will exceed normal course expense growth to improve our overall operational leverage and this is already coming through our results as our P&C operating expense ratios have decreased by 2.4 points from the first quarter of 2015.", "Total combined operating expenses, excluding integration costs, are already more than 10% lower than at the time of the acquisition. Our first quarter operating tax rate was approximately 11%, with certain taxes on nonoperating mark-to-market items driving the higher tax rate on net income. We still expect our overall operating tax rate to be in the 10% to 12% range. Turning to the investment portfolio, reflecting the addition of the Catlin portfolio, net investment income, excluding the Life fund's withheld assets, was $164 million, up $6 million.", "The gross book yield in the portfolio at the end of March was 2.4%. Given current yields, net investment income will continue to remain under pressure, as we have approximately $3.6 billion of assets with book yields of 2.4% rolling off over the next 12 months. During the quarter, our average new money rate was 1.7%. Total affiliate income was $8 million for the quarter compared to $58 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to our investment fund affiliates, where equity and credit market volatility impacted returns and our hedge fund affiliate portfolio was not immune.", "Despite these disappointing absolute returns, our hedge fund portfolio continues to significantly outperform its benchmark. And we continue to believe that a modest allocation to this asset class improves the risk-adjusted returns we earn on the overall portfolio. Our strategic and other operating affiliates earned $13 million compared to $23 million in the prior-year quarter due primarily to the sale of ARX Holdings in the second quarter of 2015. Net realized losses, excluding derivatives, were $8 million for the quarter, down $13 million from the prior year.", "Our unrealized gain position, including other investments, increased by $417 million during the quarter, driven primarily by rate decreases in our major jurisdictions. Unrealized net gains were $939 million at the end of the quarter, including other investments. On a performance basis, the total return on investments was 1.7% for the quarter, excluding foreign exchange. The duration of the total portfolio was consistent, at 3.2 years. Now with respect to capital management, under the share buyback program approved by our Board of Directors at our August meeting, we purchased just under 10 million shares for $355 million at an average price of $35.69 per share, leaving $348 million available for purchase under our share buyback program.", "As Mike noted, we increased our level of share buybacks in the first quarter with the goal of adding $250 million of additional purchases over our typical pace in the first quarter. Given the combination of the limited time with the open trading window and relatively low volumes of market trading in March, we completed only $180 million through March 31 and we expect to complete these purchases during our next open trading window. We continue to view these buybacks as an efficient capital management tool and will return capital when we believe it appropriate. We also remain focused on ensuring that our overall financial leverage moves towards our target levels over the next few years.", "I'll now turn it over to Paul to discuss our insurance segment results.", "Paul Brand", "Thanks, Pete. This evening, I'll cover the results for the segment, but would firstly like to share some thoughts on current market conditions. The headwinds which strengthened throughout 2015 have continued, with pricing being negative across most lines of business as the overall rate change for the segment was down 2% in the quarter. Overall, our casualty lines were flat and professional businesses were down 1%.", "Our specialty business was down 2%, affecting continued competitive conditions in the aviation and crisis management lines. And our energy, property and construction businesses were down 5%. This negative environment has had an impact on top line. But our underwriters are under clear instruction to preserve margins and sacrifice top line, if terms don't meet our requirements. We have also chosen to execute certain underperforming books which, in aggregate, reduced top line by approximately $70 million in the quarter. Against this backdrop, I'm pleased to report that we have continued our trend of profitable quarters, dating back to quarter-one 2013, with the segment producing a calendar quarter combined ratio of 96.5% compared to 94.1% in quarter-one 2015 and 98.2% last quarter.", "Higher cat experience at $35 million, compared to $15 million in quarter-one 2015, contributed to one-third of the deterioration, with the majority of the balance due to the higher acquisition expenses, largely offset by an improvement in our operating expense and accident year ex-cat loss ratios. Prior-year reserve releases of $11 million or 0.7 points, was consistent with prior-year quarter. On an accident quarter ex-cat basis, the combined ratio was 95% compared to 93.2% in quarter-one 2015 and 95.7% last quarter. For Q1, we reported an acquisition ratio of 14.1% compared to 8.4% in Q1 2015 and 13.9% reported last quarter.", "The majority of this increase is because the legacy Catlin business included a larger share of wholesale specialty business, where the gross acquisition costs are higher and loss ratios are lower than legacy XL business. The remaining business is largely driven by higher quota share sessions in Q1 2015 on the legacy XL book which generated additional ceding commissions, reducing the net acquisition ratio. Looking forward, we expect this ratio to reduce modestly to be more in line with our experience in Q3 and Q4 2015, as changes in our reinsurance strategy are fully implemented. This increase in acquisition ratio is largely offset by a lower Q1 operating expense ratio of 19.7% which was 1.9 points lower than Q1 2015, and by a lower net accident year ex-cat loss ratio of 61.2% which was 2 points lower than Q1 2015.", "Insurance gross premiums written in Q1 increased by 51% or $849 million year-over-year, driven largely from the Catlin acquisition. This growth occurred in all four of our underwriting divisions. When we look at both legacy organizations and normalize for foreign exchange, our actual year-over-year growth was flat in Q1. However, when you also consider the Chilean [ph] activities that started in 2015, whereas mentioned previously decisions were made to exit certain underperforming books, you would see growth in the 3% to 4% range. This underlying growth demonstrates that while the market is difficult, it is not entirely bereft of opportunity.", "And while we consider that the dislocation experienced by some competitors should have a positive impact on rates and terms, we saw little evidence of this in the first quarter. Our underwriters will continue to monitor the market closely. And given our enhanced capabilities and stronger market presence post- the transaction, we're well positioned to execute profitable opportunities when they arise, be that next quarter or next year. This expectation is further underpinned as the market response to XL Catlin continues to be very favorable, as was evidenced repeatedly at this month's 2016 RIMS Conference, as both current and prospective clients were interested in hearing how we could help. For the insurance segment, ceded premiums written in the quarter were $1 billion.", "The ceded premium written line reflects some changes in the way we buy our reinsurance program and the timing of our reinsurance purchasing as we move towards a more integrated, enterprise-wide reinsurance program. In Q1, approximately $100 million of ceded premium written came solely from timing differences. These included consolidation alignment to the grid catastrophe covers at 1-1, bringing forward our Q3 international casualty renewal, and placing the Galileo cat bond which provides cover for three years.", "Adjusting for these timing differences, the insurance segment's spend as a proportion of GPW in Q1 2016 was 35.9%, roughly 4.1% less than for the combination of the individual companies in Q1 2015. While the 35.9% is slightly higher than the 34.3% reported in Q1 2015 for legacy XL, we expect this to reduce as the full year unfolds and we fully transition to our integrated reinsurance program, the benefits of which will continue to deliver better value to our shareholders by sustainably improving the Group's risk/return profile, a strong coordination across our wider capital strategy. As Mike has mentioned, it is essential to react to the top-line challenges by carefully managing expenses and we have developed further plans to improve efficiencies during 2016.", "We began executing these plans in the quarter by selectively exiting 35 positions as we continue to streamline our underwriting capabilities across divisions and regions. While the expense savings from these actions are not reflected in the quarter, they will begin flowing through in subsequent quarters, along with other efficiency initiatives that are currently underway. In summary, we have taken the correct action in response to a difficult market. And we have delivered another quarter of underwriting profitability, continued to grow the book and made significant progress on our efficiency and portfolio management initiatives. And we fully expect this to continue, margin expansion remains our first priority.", "And now to Greg to discuss reinsurance results.", "Greg Hendrick", "Thanks, Paul. Today I'll discuss the results for the quarter and provide a summary of the current market conditions. Beginning with the results, the reinsurance segment produced solid underwriting performance, with a calendar quarter combined ratio of 84.3% and an underwriting profit of $119 million, compared with 74.7% and $90 million, respectively, for the first quarter of last year. Result for the quarter continued to benefit from favorable prior-year development, lower accident year ex-cat loss ratio and modest catastrophe losses, although to a lesser extent than the prior year. ", "Reserve releases in the quarter totaled $32 million compared to $42 million a year ago, lowering the combined ratio by 4.3 and 11.9 points, respectively. In the current quarter, the releases were primarily in the property classes and reflect our harmonized reserve process. Further, our actual versus expected analysis continues to be positive and indicative of a strong reserve position going forward. The reinsurance segment produced an accident quarter ex-cat loss ratio of 52.3% which compares to 54.7% in the first quarter of 2015. The decrease is driven primarily by favorable attritional loss activity in our property treaty business and the impact of a change in business mix resulting from the Catlin acquisition.", "The expense ratio increased 1.9 points to 33.8% in the first quarter compared to 31.9% for the first quarter of 2015. This increase was primarily driven by a purchase accounting adjustment of $7 million or 0.9 points and higher ceding commissions due to the competitive pricing environment, particularly in our short-tail classes. Catastrophe losses totaled $17 million, net of reinstatement premiums, during the quarter, compared to no catastrophe losses in the first quarter of last year. The cat activity during the quarter related to the Taiwan earthquake and impacted our property catastrophe and property treaty lines of business.", "Turning to the top line, gross written premium for the quarter was $1.86 billion, up from $826 million in the first correct 2015, with the increase driven by the Catlin acquisition. We continue to see very little lost business as a result of the transaction, again, running at less than 1%. In fact, brokers and clients have been very supportive of XL Catlin Re and we're seeing significant new business opportunities as we generated $240 million of new business during the first quarter of 2016. This was offset by continued underwriting discipline as we non-renewed $150 million of premium due to unacceptable pricing or terms and conditions.", "On a combined XL Catlin view, after adjusting for foreign exchange, the segment top line was flat in the quarter. Turning to reinsurance market conditions, we found the environment to be challenging, but rate decreases continue to decelerate in most classes and regions. During the quarter, rates for the segment were down approximately 3%. Our global catastrophe portfolio was down 6% and at a lower rate of change than the prior year. On the remainder of the property treaty portfolio, rates were down 3% and ceding commissions on pro rata treaties increased slightly. ", "Our casualty portfolio renewed essentially flat over last year and the remainder of our classes were flat to down low-single-digits. Having just completed the recent April end renewals, rates in Japan were down 7.5% for property catastrophe covers. We observed an increase in client demand and were able to grow our portfolio at this renewal. In summary, the first quarter results were solid for the reinsurance segment. Despite difficult market conditions, our underwriting teams continue to do an excellent job retaining profitable business and finding new opportunities while maintaining underwriting discipline. We're well positioned for continued success as we have the broad support from our clients and brokers.", "I will now turn it back to David.", "David Radulski", "Lori, can you please open the lines for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.", "Kai Pan", "So this first, probably for Mike. Mike, it sounds the tone probably changed a little bit, because last few quarter you talked about more emphasis on the retained business, like a loss base of less than 1%.", "But now it seems like the competitive environment becoming tougher, you actually want to proactively protect the margin. In some cases, you need to shrink the top-line growth. I just wonder, in the current environment, if you look in aggregate, both at the top line probably under a little bit of pressure, as well as pricing probably limit your ability to improve the margin. Is that conceivable, you can still achieve a double-digit ROE in the near future?", "Mike McGavick", "First of all, thank you, Kai. The most important thing that I would emphasize is that we have always emphasized the effects of the transaction in terms of lost business as a discrete category. In other words, where we were focused is, was there a market reaction that took business away from us? In other words, somebody feeling that because there was a Catlin line and an XL line previously, that they couldn't support the combination of lines on an account or someone feeling that, because of the transaction, that we were somehow going to become inwardly focused and therefore not someone they wanted to trade with during a period of consolidation and integration. Those were the kinds of things we were worried about.", "And overwhelmingly -- and we really knew this and have expressed it to you repeatedly -- by the middle of last year we knew that the market reaction was actually quite positive and going to give us more opportunities, not declining opportunities. And we have continued to monitor that, as Greg just mentioned. It's still true that less than 1% of the premiums in reinsurance have any effect because of the transaction, as was just defined. And I think it will go slightly over 1% because of one program that comes off this year, but it will be right around 1% in insurance as well. So, to me, that is a fantastic endorsement by the market of the combination. That is not the same and we've been very specific about this throughout the last half of last year -- it is not the same as saying and we will keep all of the business at any cost. We have continued to focus on bottom-line underwriting.", "And I've mentioned many times that by the middle of last year, we knew very well the book was going to stick together and people were enthusiastic for the combination. And we gave our underwriters, at that point, our usual instruction. The job is to underwrite what we think is a reasonably priced business under appropriate terms and conditions. If we can find it, we won't write it. We also made sure that our underwriters knew they had permission -- as they came to know the books better which they did through the year -- to take larger actions if they felt profitability warranted it.", "So we have come off some program business. For example, we've shuttered some operations that we didn't think had the future earnings potential and that is what you are hearing about when we mention the re-underwriting activities. All of that shows up in the way -- particularly in insurance -- the first quarter net earned premium works out. Although, there, you have to add in the impacts that Paul mentioned about the reinsurance programs being in flight in terms of ceded readjustments.", "So, this quarter overstates those impacts, but those impacts are in there as well. In terms of going forward, having started this re underwriting back in the middle of last year and seeing it now more fully in swing as we went through the planning process and are executing, we in fact believe that that will be a contributor to being able to expand margins because we believe that's exactly the kinds of actions that are necessary to lower the loss ratio. And of course you know, as Pete mentioned, we're well on track -- ahead, in fact, of the timing -- on seeing the expense reductions come through. And with those two categories in decline and with the acquisition ratio increase, that's what we have to solve for to expand margins. Those have to all add up to, in the end, a lower combined and we're still on track to do so.", "In fact, in this quarter, if you took out the one-time noise that was mentioned by Paul on the acquisition ratio, we would have nearly done so just in this quarter alone. Never mind that we know the benefits of those re underwriting actions and the benefits of the expense ratio should show up more prominently in the back half of the year.", "Now, I want to caution, though, on that. We're in a very difficult pricing environment, more difficult certainly than we anticipated. And certainly every call I've listen to or read the transcript of this quarter emphasizes the same realization. That will make it more difficult over time to show the margin expansion we plan, but it doesn't mean that we give up or think it's impossible. We certainly have the expense piece in the right place.", "And this quarter, at least, is a good indicator on the loss ratio as well. So, with all of that said and with capital actions that we've talked about, do I think it means that in the reasonable future we can't deliver a double-digit ROE? No. I still believe that in a reasonable future that we have the tools to get there. These conditions just make it more difficult. But no, by no means have we walked away from that goal or the belief that that is plausible in the reasonable term.", "Kai Pan", "And then the follow-up with Greg on the reinsurance segment. Looks like the core loss ratio improved 240 basis points year-over-year. But if you look at sequentially, it's actually up from like a 50.2% in the fourth quarter. And also you mentioned before that -- in supposedly the third quarter and fourth quarter, you have some unusual large losses, including changing in the third quarter and some large losses, about 6 points, in the fourth quarter. I just wondered, is there any unusual items in the 52.3% or it's a good run rate?", "Greg Hendrick", "I won't comment on whether it's a good run rate. There aren't any unusual losses in that number. That's reflective of what we've just talked about in terms of a competitive environment. And when you have these rate decreases, it will obviously make you pick your non-cat loss ratio higher year-over-year to reflect that slightly deteriorated margin. But there isn't any large loss activity in this quarter.", "Kai Pan", "And lastly, if I may, just do you have any early reads on the second quarter catastrophes, including earthquakes, as well as Texas events?", "Greg Hendrick", "Nothing definitive to report, Kai. I'll say, taking Japan first it's incredibly early in the process. Clearly, we and our clients are just getting going on the loss adjusting process. Japan has an added complexity because of the nature of the policies. The personalized policies respond to a percentage of damage rather than a dollar loss amount. The commercial policies don't have a uniform approach to business interruption.", "And so there's a lot at play there that makes it very difficult to get to a precise number quickly. But certainly as we have looked at the exposure, we're not concerned by what we see on our books in Japan. Ecuador would be much less. It's a lower industry loss and it's a lower penetration for us.", "And I guess the third piece of activity would be on the Texas or Midwest storms that have been going on. They are likely to impact something. But generally on a lot of the covers that are on the large nationals, you are going to see it be well within the retentions of our customers. So, I don't have anything definitive to report, but so far what we see doesn't concern me.", "Kai Pan", "What about on the primary sites, Paul?", "Paul Brand", "Yes, it's very modest cat impact for the first quarter, not really expecting very much from Japan at all. And as Greg said, on the Midwest storms -- yes, we would be surprised if we saw a great deal there.", "Mike McGavick", "And the only caution I would add is we always remember, we have large limits on pinpoint facilities. So we have these kinds of Midwest storms. You can get hit. We don't have anything to report to you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. You may go ahead.", "Jay Gelb", "The first thing I want to come back to is the ROE target. Understanding that the full benefit of expense savings aren't yet reflected, to get that ROE from 4% annualized this quarter, in a somewhat overall light cat quarter, up to 10% -- I'm still trying to figure out the walk to get there.", "Mike McGavick", "As I said, you have to have all of the pieces continue to move in the trend they are moving. In other words, you have to have the one-time stuff back out. You have to have the loss ratio continue to improve. You have to have the expense ratio actually come down in the way that we have forecasted it will and you have to manage your capital. You have to do all of those pieces at the same time.", "Certainly I'm not uncomfortable with sitting here today and telling you that we can see how that takes place. But we have never given a timing forecast on that and I'm not going to tonight. But I continue to be pleased with the way the book is positioned and the progress on the core elements. I think that the market environment has made it more difficult to write business.", "And that has some dampening effect [Technical Difficulty] as you don't write business, you also do what we did this quarter in consideration of a variety of factors, you are able to up your repurchases. So, I haven't at all walked away from what I believe this transaction produces. Not in one bit, Jay.", "Pete Porrino", "And Jay, this is Pete. Let's make sure we back out the integration costs. I heard you go through the synergies and that kind of stuff. But there's also the integration costs that are in there that have a pretty large drag on ROE that are obviously going to disappear.", "Jay Gelb", "And then specifically on the insurance segment, the ceded premium ratio was 40% in the first quarter. And I believe the comment was that directionally that that would improve. Would you be able to give us a sense of what you feel the ceded premium ratio might be for the entire year of 2016?", "Paul Brand", "For the insurance segment, as we say, we think it might improve a little bit. As we normalize for the one-offs, we came down to 34. We may be a high 33 is what our analysis is showing.", "Jay Gelb", "For the full year?", "Paul Brand", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. You may go ahead", "Brian Meredith", "Couple questions here. The first one, was there any impact of changes in retro buying at all on the reinsurance segment in the quarter?", "Greg Hendrick", "Yes. Not in the quarter, but as relative to the prior year, we now buy -- as we've talked about a couple of times -- we now buy no specific retro -- particularly on that property cat book, we buy as part of the overall group strategy that Paul is responsible for. We have a couple of remaining covers that we're looking at harmonizing over the next 6 to 12 months. So we get allocations back, Brian, but we don't have specific covers like we used to.", "Brian Meredith", "Okay, so no one-timers?", "Greg Hendrick", "No one-timers.", "Brian Meredith", "And then just quickly on the insurance side also, you mentioned there was some impact on the earned premium in the quarter from the one-timers. What was the impact in the earned premium?", "Paul Brand", "It's not a huge impact. It's in the sort of $30 million mark on that.", "Brian Meredith", "So, basically, the $100 million will go through the earned over the course of the year. So, it wasn't like a one-time kit to earn in this quarter?", "Paul Brand", "No.", "Brian Meredith", "Okay. All right. Just wanted to understand that. And then one other quick one here. Pete, as far as the rate of expense saves that you all are going to be recognizing here, going forward, it looks like this quarter there was roughly, on a sequential basis, it was about $30 million, $40 million recognized. Is that a good figure to think about your going forward?", "Pete Porrino", "Yes, Brian. I would say, as we -- it's interesting. We keep talking about the synergies. And more and more, we as a Company are managing a total expense [indiscernible] and doing that in a very holistic basis. But to answer your question directly, yes, that is about sequentially. And again, it's hard to use the synergy number, per se, as we move to managing expenses totally. But it's probably 200-ish, I would say, we're into so far, cumulatively.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead", "Josh Shanker", "I just wanted to understand a couple things. In the prepared remarks, Mike, you said that you would expect the acquisition ratio on insurance to be elevated, but revert towards where it was in the back half of 2015 towards the end of the year. That's a correct way to understand what you said?", "Mike McGavick", "I would take it, the back half of the year -- I would take the two quarters and put them together and then look at it.", "Josh Shanker", "Yes, so there is like, a 13.2 and a 13.9. Should we think about 13.5 as a normalized acquisition cost for the combined Company?", "Mike McGavick", "I'm obviously avoiding giving you a specific number, but you've got the right exercise in mind. I'm not talking about the trend over the two quarters. I'm talking about the totality of the two quarters.", "Josh Shanker", "And when you think about -- and no number you don't have to give -- but is that going forward a 17? And that's kind of where the combined acquisition costs will be for these two combined companies, I guess. Is that correct?", "Mike McGavick", "Certainly for this year. Over time, it remains to be seen because we have some impacts that are a exaggerating that a bit right now, because of the way certain sub-segments are impacted by the competitive environment. So, I'll pick an example. Energy is one that's affected in this space because of the way our reinsurance treaties and everything else. And energy has been one of the most affected down markets in terms of premium, so we're writing a fair amount less. Were we writing what we would ordinarily be writing, this would have had less of an effect.", "So, some of it is business mix and there, you just can't predict where the cycles in those sub ones will go which is why I'm not being particularly precise and why I'm not able to forecast beyond the year. As I look at the year, I get a good handle on it. If you get me into next year, depends on what those subcycles are doing and it depends on what we're doing in reaction, because it changes the business mix and drives this number.", "Josh Shanker", "The other question, there's a lot more information than we probably need in the financials associated with the Life business that's now been sold. Is there any lingering income? And I know there is that's associated with the Life Re transaction that you can quickly point out, a quick way that we can figure out what contribution there was from that?", "Mike McGavick", "You mean from what's left?", "Josh Shanker", "From what's left, yes. Is there one number -- it was $4 million.", "Pete Porrino", "Yes, there is a couple of million dollars and I can take you through the financial supplement. You can actually walk through it. It takes a little while to figure out the geography, but you can actually pretty much figure it out. But Josh, I'll be glad to take you through that.", "Josh Shanker", "And then without even pointing -- the number for just as a placeholder for me right now is a couple million, yes?", "Pete Porrino", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt from JPMorgan. You may go ahead", "Sarah DeWitt", "On the investment affiliate earnings, what's the right run rate to think about there? And has that recovered so far in the second quarter?", "Pete Porrino", "So we've talked, in the past, of something like a 6% to 7% over the cycle type of return. That's what I would encourage you to use, assuming we can figure out the cycle of hedge fund returns. So, that's as good as anything I could give you. It has not recovered yet. We report those numbers on a one-month lag. And from what we saw in March, it was not a spectacular month for hedge funds, either.", "Sarah DeWitt", "So, assume another loss for the second quarter or just something lower than the 6% to 7%?", "Pete Porrino", "That will entirely on how the hedge funds do over the next two months. Again, the only thing I would say -- and Mike said it and I said if you look over the last three months, nine months, 12 months, three years, five years or 10 years, we outperformed those indices by hundreds of basis points. And so, we're really proud of that track record. But again, it's a pretty bad tailwind right now. But I can't predict what it's going to do for the rest of the quarter, at least not on the hedge fund affiliates.", "Sarah DeWitt", "And then, secondly, in the insurance segment, I think historically you were targeting a 90% combined ratio, including cats but excluding reserve releases. Can you just talk about where we're in that plan to get there and how long you think it could take?", "Paul Brand", "Clearly, as Mike has said and we're making progress on the loss ratio and I would like to expect that to continue. But we do have headwinds from the market which is slowing the progress down, as you can see. The job is to ensure that as we make that progress on both the expense and the OpEx and the loss ratio, that we're getting closer to that goal.", "Sarah DeWitt", "Okay. Do you still have confidence?", "Mike McGavick", "Sorry, go ahead?", "Sarah DeWitt", "But you still have confidence in that number?", "Mike McGavick", "As an over cycle number, yes. But with our concentration in specialty which we're delighted to have, given the different stat -- a couple things about it. Number one, specialty lines require a lot less accepting of non-variable costs in order to sustain yourself through the cycle. So being in specialty gives us the ability to ride out this cycle, keep our teams together, keep our capabilities intact and go forward strongly into the coming change, whenever it happens.", "So we like being concentrated in businesses like that, where they don't drag a lot of infrastructure in order to maintain your competitive position. But when you are concentrated in those and they are in the toughest pricing environment many of us can remember, you're going to have difficulty getting to your target combined ratio. But that doesn't mean that over time you aren't making progress, as we're right now. And it doesn't mean that you can't get to those in more appropriate markets. But these markets are making it very, very difficult to make progress.", "We believe, as I said, we believe we can. We're continuing to do the things that are necessary. But at the same time, getting to a 90X and then with PYD right now, is just darned tough. We're moving toward it, but it is going to be tough until these markets improve somehow.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead", "Ryan Tunis", "I think my question is going down the same line that Kai, I think, was going down. And just thinking about the overall accident year loss ratio and framing the discussion relative to where we were in 4Q, which was at 4Q, we had the harmonization, we had large losses and I think we even had some true-ups on just the current accident year and we were at a 58.6.", "And this quarter, we're at a 58.4 and I think the message was that overall that would come down. And I'm just trying to understand, was it elevated loss activity? Is there seasonality in there? Or is all of what we're looking at, as Mike said, just tougher market conditions? Thanks.", "Mike McGavick", "So, remember, when you cite the numeric that way, you are including both insurance and reinsurance. Reinsurance is always going to be bumpier. This quarter, we had Taiwan and so on. You're just going to have more noise there. But we focus much more on the insurance accident year loss ratios. That's the one where we keep saying, we think we can continue through mix and re underwriting to expand the margin. And as you saw in this quarter, we're down fully 2 points over a year ago, at the same time.", "So, my view is we're doing that job and we can continue to do the job. I see the progress as meaningful. I do give you the caution that these markets make it much more difficult. But I would encourage -- when you focus just on the loss ratios, one of the metrics that we've got to solve for, I'd break them up and think about them that way. And to be blunt, when you are thinking about reinsurance, you always have to be thinking about it on a cat expected basis or else you are fooling yourself about where the reinsurance book is performing.", "Ryan Tunis", "And just following up then on insurance, I think Paul mentioned the exit from some underperforming books. And I think you said $70 million of premium loss from that. Just looking for maybe a little more color on those underperforming books and also just how we -- to the extent of which we can think about that as a tailwind for the loss ratio on insurance, thinking about the relative profitability of those books versus where you are trying to run in insurance. Thanks.", "Mike McGavick", "Yes, I'll let Paul give a little more color commentary, but let me just pick on the one that's been the recurring challenge. I think, if I'm not mistaken, across something I participated in at CNA when I was there, something I participated in Safeco when I was there and once at XL and once now at XL Catlin, I can't tell you how much I find it uncomfortable to write anything in the New York contracting space.", "So this will be the fourth time I've participated in shutting down New York contracting business. But just as an example, you would have seen -- and it's known in the market -- that XL had taken a run at the surety marketplace over the last five years. We weren't getting the kinds of scale and returns we wanted. We shut down that operation. It was pretty small, but I'll let Paul get into more detail about the characteristics.", "Paul Brand", "Yes and the one I would add to that is insure [indiscernible] which is a UK motor facility. I'd say those would be the major items in our discontinued operations. And clearly those businesses run at higher loss ratios than the balance of the portfolio. So taking them out absolutely should have a good effect on the lost ratio as we go forward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Byrnes from Janney. You may go ahead", "Ryan Byrnes", "Just wanted to see if we could go over the thought process of adding $250 million to the buyback plan for this year. Just want to see what parts of your plan changed for this year. It looks like obviously the increased sessions in the insurance segment, but just wanted to make sure I fully understood that.", "Mike McGavick", "I think it's a several-part analysis, always. The first thing we're thinking about is can we -- what are our plans for a premium and how are they jiving with what is available to write at a reasonable rate? And at the start of the year, when we were back in planning, as you're going back into last year, we were not expecting the level of deterioration and the intensifying of competition that we're seeing. So we would have expected to be able to write a bit more at top line.", "In fact, Paul referenced it well when he talked about the fact that we're seeing a lot of dislocation. It's not much that's coming at us with terms and conditions that we would be interested in writing. Whether that will change or not, it's very hard to say, because we're fairly early in those processes. So, the first thing you realize is we're not going to be able, through our organic writings, to put as much to work of the capital as we had thought, that the first place you go to.", "The second place, then, you go to is, is there any other we could put that money to work for our shareholders? And then finding none, we've always believed that then if we can't put it to good work and it's not necessary for our buffer, then we should do our best to get it back to shareholders. And then of course you also look at the raw economics of such a decision. How do we view where we're trading and what does that tell us about the economics of buybacks? So you take that whole equation together and, as we looked at all those factors, we said this is in fact -- not only does it indicate we will need to hold less capital for the year, relative to our buffers and relative to our planned writings and not only did we find where we were trading attractive relative to our tangible book value, in our book value. Not only all those things where true, but we just said, gee, we should do it in the first part of the year rather than just spreading it across the year and then react to market conditions later.", "So, kind of as a base line, you should forecast four equal installments of the $700 million. But then we decided to the first half of the year that to go after $250 million more, giving you a total for the year of $950 million. And as I said, we will continue to evaluate our needs and market conditions and these trends. And whether we will do more or not, is for future decisions. ", "Pete Porrino", "The only other thing I would add is we had a strategy for a few years here now trying to be consistent around buybacks. And we have signaled those well in advance. I do think that we're looking now at being a little more opportunistic. And so, when it looks like the right time, you will probably see us be a little bit more real-time management than we had in the past.", "Ryan Byrnes", "Okay. And then just one follow-up to that is what -- which metric or which book value do you guys look at most? Is it tangible, ex-AOCI or stated? Is there any one that you guys look at the most?", "Pete Porrino", "Ryan, our math here, we probably have six or seven different metrics that we look like. Both of those would be in there. A lot has to do with our expectation as to what our earnings engine looks like and what we think our returns are going to be and looking and doing that calculation. From what do you look at? Yes, we look at tangible book. We look at stated book. I have historically probably looked at tangible book a little bit more. But these days, there's a lot of conversations going around the value of looking at just plain book value. So, I can't point to any one, per se. I'd say we do, again, five or six. But we really look at it from a return point of view. We do look at an IRR on it.", "Mike McGavick", "And actually let me add, just as a matter of clarity, these are management recommendations to the Board. These decisions are not made solo.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may go ahead", "Jay Cohen", "I'm not sure if you mentioned it yet, but can you talk about your estimate for what the integration expenses are going to be in 2Q?", "Pete Porrino", "Jay, it's Pete. That we haven't done that yet. What we did this quarter, we're planning on doing again next quarter which is sort of at the end of the quarter, we will go and publish a -- I'll call it a hard estimate, rather than giving you a ballpark now and then having to adjust it later on in the quarter.", "Jay Cohen", "Is it reasonable to expect, directionally, that it would go down from the first quarter?", "Mike McGavick", "So that it's in advance of your model running, rather than after.", "Jay Cohen", "I'm sorry, is it reasonable to expect it might go down from the first quarter?", "Pete Porrino", "I would say, at this point, maybe a little.", "Jay Cohen", "Okay.", "Pete Porrino", "Look, it is going to start to trail off.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. You may go ahead", "Meyer Shields", "Mike, you gave some, I think pretty helpful guidance on the acquisition expense ratio. When we look at the dollars of operating expenses in the individual segments, is there any reason that first quarter numbers would be lower than a typical quarterly run rate?", "Mike McGavick", "In terms of the expense run rate?", "Meyer Shields", "The operating expense in each of the two segments.", "Pete Porrino", "What I'd say is -- and I wouldn't look at the individual segments. What we do, we manage expenses overall. Obviously Paul and Greg manage theirs and then we manage the rest of the Corporation, including all the functions. And then we go through a pretty rigorous allocation process.", "What I would say is, in the first quarter, there would be maybe a little bit of benefit that was taken because of some accruals that were up at the end of the year, that ended up not being needed. But they were really around the margins more than anything else. You saw corporate expenses drop pretty precipitously. That probably is a timing more than anything else. It will drop and it will drop significantly, probably not quite to the level that it went down. But nothing specific for insurance or reinsurance.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman from Balyasny. You may go ahead", "Ian Gutterman", "Mike, forgive me if I'm going to be a little argumentative here. But I guess I'm a little surprised that you opened the call saying you thought these were good underlying results when you missed Street significantly. And it wasn't just affiliates or the acquisition costs, the core loss ratio was also below Street and some of the other items as well. ", "And when I look at the 12 months, basically the combined ratio since the deal happened, it's around 93. And that's with low cats. And maybe if I normalize that, it is more of a mid-90s. And to get to a double-digit ROE, you need to get closer to 90. So can you help us understand how we're getting those high points? Because I think the reason this question keeps coming up is a lot of people are struggling to see how the improvement comes, given the pace I think has been slower than people anticipated.", "Mike McGavick", "Ian, first of all, I don't find that argumentative and I appreciate the question. We continue to see the progress coming in. We continue to see the expense ratio dropping and we expect it to continue to drop. We continue to see the loss ratio dropping. And though I've been cautious to note the conditions out there, but we believe and have shown in this quarter, that we can continue to bring it down.", "We think with this quarter, we show, as we've seen a couple of times in recent quarters, some unusual activity that is one-time and related to the way the books are coming together. Whether it's the way we're putting our ceded reprogram together which we believe will be meaningfully beneficial over the course of the year, but it did have some unusual effects in the period.", "So, when we back out those unusual effects and we look at the progress that we're making, we add all that up and say, we believe we can get to the levels of return that we have planned. And there's nothing that has happened, outside of market conditions being more difficult, that has shaken us from that belief. That could change the pace some. It could change how you have to drive it some, but it doesn't change our fundamental belief that we can get this Company to those kinds of results. And I would just point out, across reinsurance and specialty, we're certainly in incredibly difficult conditions.", "And if we're able to produce these results with all that noise in this period, I like our chances as we get further into the year. But a lot of that will depend on things beyond our control. But the things we're controlling, we're very pleased with the job we're doing. So that's what I'm talking about, Ian and that continues to please me. And I'm particularly pleased that our underwriters have kept their wits about them. In an environment like this, where conditions are very difficult, you always worry how underwriters on the frontline will respond to the challenging conditions they face.", "And I'm simply very pleased with the quality of our underwriting behavior and the way in which that will produce results now and well into the future. And we certainly see organizations or underwriters that are not maintaining their discipline. And while that makes it challenging for now, that makes our relative performance position all that much better over time.", "Ian Gutterman", "Just to follow up on that, I understand what you're saying but when you're saying not much has changed as far as where things ultimately come out, I'm looking at it. Your comments earlier about not having given an expectation in the past about the double-digit ROE and using the term in the reasonable future. Mike, I'm looking at the transcript from last May when you guys did the call post-close and you said you expected double-digit ROE, ex-AOCI, in 2016. So, you have said it before and now you're not willing to say it. So it seems like something has changed.", "Mike McGavick", "Well, as I said, market conditions are more difficult, Ian. And I've said that throughout this call and we've been saying that for a couple of quarters. So that piece will affect the pace. But I see double-digit ROEs as plausible, given the progress we're making. Obviously with this start to this year, it would be pretty unlikely for me to forecast it for this year. But I continue to see it -- I've said it, Ian and I believe it.", "Ian Gutterman", "Okay. Just the last thing I would say is, I would just urge you guys to find a way to maybe educate us more on how we get there. Again, I know we've talked about some of the stuff before, at least Pete and I have. But the synergies are really impossible for investors to track. We can't see them in the financial statements, so we don't really know where the progress is. If there were ways you can give more firm numbers around things like mix change and things like that -- it is very hard to model, still, even at year-end and to really be able to sort of assess where you are versus where you started.", "We've seen the expense synergy goal go up which is a positive. But you know what I mean? We can't really see evidence of that in the income statement, per se, because there are so many other adjustments. I know a lot of companies, when they do deals, give disclosures on specifics of where the benefits come from. I think something like that would help a lot.", "Pete Porrino", "If we just spend a minute on the synergy because I did make a comment earlier about how we're managing the Company, so we had, net of integration expenses, $460 million this quarter. And last quarter, we had $490 million. You take those two, you average them, you multiply it by two for a full year, you are at about $1.9 billion. When we were on the call when we first did the deal, we said use $2.3 billion as the starting point.", "Now, we have a little bit of FX benefit there which is way more than offset by what you would have had for expected wage inflation over that period. And so, when I look at it right now, to be honest, we're past the $300 million. And so, we can get more granular on the synergies. Maybe we need another conversation about expense levels and where they can go. But I think that actually might be a more fruitful conversation than a focus on the synergies. When you run the numbers and this is not a surprise to anybody, because of where you all think we're going to come out on the expenses. Everyone has modeled more than $300 million already in there.", "Ian Gutterman", "Right. No, fair enough. I guess that's the thing, right? I mean, I can argue the other side of that, is if the $300 million is already in there, then to get from, say, a normal -- again, I'm spitballing this, but with normal cats at 95, down to a 90 is almost all loss ratio and acquisition ratio from here. So, that makes it look tougher if most of the expense ratio benefit is already in there, the operating expense ratio benefit is already in there. And so that's why I think it would be helpful if we can try to split the pieces out so people don't jump to the wrong conclusions on some of this stuff.", "Pete Porrino", "And I take your comments, as I always do with appreciation, because you are very thoughtful about them. I did not mean to signal that we're done with the -- that we're done with expenses continuing to have the benefit of the transaction. In fact, we said earlier that we expect the ratios to continue to go down and that is in a very difficult insurance market where you're not going to be growing rapidly.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith from Sterne Agee. You may go ahead", "Vinay Misquith", "So just two quick questions. One is on the accident year loss ratio, ex-cat, in the primary insurance business. They were 61.2 this quarter. Curious as to whether the benefits of the reinsurance savings and the claims and management expenses has flown through. And do you expect to have a lower loss ratio in the next few quarters?", "Paul Brand", "We're obviously working to try and move the loss ratio down. And there's a number of actions, largely the re underwriting and tuning actions that we've talked about, but also we would expect some reinsurance benefits with that, too.", "Vinay Misquith", "So, should that raise the loss ratio going forward?", "David Radulski", "Vinay, could you repeat that?", "Vinay Misquith", "So, should that -- really is the loss ratio going forward.", "Paul Brand", "Yes, that is our expectation. Yes.", "Vinay Misquith", "And second, Mike, if you could talk a little bit about moving business from Lloyds' paper onto XL's paper -- what do you think is the opportunity and how soon do you think you could get there?", "Mike McGavick", "We have already had some movements between the two platforms. We've been able to take some business off of Lloyds and put it into our retail operations. That's been a positive, because of course if you can write it on that basis, at the same loss ratios, you are getting an expense uplift.", "We've also seen some business transfer to Lloyds or increase at Lloyds where we've been able to round out, for example, in reinsurance or other programs where we've been able to use the Lloyds platform as a better additive for those clients that wanted more exposure to us, but didn't want it on any one balance sheet. So we've had some ins and some outs on Lloyds. All I can say is we're going to continue to optimize it. And I think there will be more opportunity over time to see a greater shift in the primary book to retail operations.", "Vinay Misquith", "Well, then shouldn't we have seen a benefit on the expense ratio? And we haven't really seen that, so I'm just wondering where the missing numbers are.", "Mike McGavick", "No, the amount of movement wouldn't be great enough that it would be larger an impact that the synergy benefits that you are seeing so pronounced. They'd just be in there somewhere. It wouldn't be a discrete thing that I would think would -- you would locate.", "Vinay Misquith", "Sure. And do you think, in the future, that number will be meaningful for us?", "Mike McGavick", "I think it's too early to tell. We're still driving those two themes and how those two themes play out over time. I would think it's a little early to tell whether that will be a big number or a number that has to be taken in its totality. It's like much of the conversation tonight which I think has been at the right level. It's not how any one of these levers moves, it's how they all move together and that's the job ahead and that's certainly the way we view the job. It's not one lever, it's how the levers cumulatively add up.", "David Radulski", "Any more questions in the queue? If not, then we'll turn it back to Mike for a closing comment.", "Mike McGavick", "Yes, this is Mike. Thank you again. We appreciate, as always, your time and your thoughtfulness. And we don't mind at all -- you've been very kind in your questions and pointed where necessary. We understand what we're hearing, but we also know what we think we can do. And we're going continue to work toward that objective with the kind of ambition that we've always had.", "And in the end, no one company makes a market, markets are big things, but there's a lot we can that is within our control and we're acting on it every day. Thank you very much and we look forward to talking to you again next quarter.", "David Radulski", "And that closes our call and you can disconnect. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you.

[Operator Instructions]. Please be advised this conference is being recorded. I would like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. ", "David Radulski", "Thank you Shirley and welcome the XL Group Limited's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Our call today is being simultaneously webcast at www.XLGroup.com. We posted to our of website several documents, including our earnings press release, this afternoon and a press release this morning regarding our realigned P&C operating model. You'll also find there our quarterly financial supplement and presentation slides we'll refer to in our call. On our call today Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, will offer opening remarks. Pete Porrino, XL's Chief Financial Officer, will review our financial results, followed by Paul Brand, our Chief Underwriting Officer, Chair of our Insurance Leadership Team and Greg Hendrick, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations, who will review their segment results and market conditions. Mike will make some comments on our realigned P&C operating model. Then we'll open it up for questions. ", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain of the matters we discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements, including any estimates on losses resulting from recent natural catastrophes, are based on current plans, estimates and expectations, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. And a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them.", "Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors including those identified in our most recent reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K as well as other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of which they are made. And we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise. ", "Our call today also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations and reconciliations of these measures to the comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings materials posted to our website and in the earnings release included as an exhibit to today's Form 8-K announcing third quarter 2016 results. With that, I'd turn it over to Mike McGavick. ", "Mike McGavick", "Good evening and thank you for joining our call. Tonight I'll share some highlights from the quarterly results. Pete will discuss the financials. And then Paul and Greg will go through the insurance and reinsurance segments respective. And then I'll come back to make a few comments on our realigned P&C operating model and some related role changes which we announced this morning. We will then open it up for questions. ", "As I commented in the results press release, this is the second quarter of solid progress and seeing the power of the business that we're building emerge in the numbers. I see five solid trends that demonstrate how we're doing the right things and especially the right things given the difficult market conditions in which we operate. First, as Paul will detail, our submissions have gone up both in quantity and in the variety of risks we're asked to look at. This means our trading partners like doing business with us and want to do more. This is a reflection of our successful combination. ", "Second, our underwriters are doing the really tough work. And it is hard for them to find adequately priced risk. This quarter our reinsurance book was the driver of some growth in a somewhat bottoming pricing environment. And our insurance book, when you take out the noise created by underwriting actions, also showed modest growth year over year. So our underwriters are doing the right stuff. But you only see modest growth as a result of their efforts and even these greater submissions, because it is so tough to find risk that is appropriately priced. That is exactly what a good underwriting company does in times like these. ", "Third, despite multiple years of pricing deterioration, our loss ratio continues to improve year over year. Now, I know it ticked up a bit in the third quarter relative to the second. But with a book like ours, we do not find this meaningful. Paul can get into that with a little more color. But when you look at it year over year we see significant and sustained improvement. ", "Fourth, our expenses continue to decline, as we have said they would which taken together with our underwriting actions is producing our overall improved combined ratio. And then fifth, we continue to repurchase shares in line with what we told you we would do and I'd say with some opportunistic flair. These are the five things you should be expecting us to do, given market conditions. And our numbers bear it out. ", "So turning to these results. Excluding the Catlin integration costs of $55 million, operating earnings per share for the quarter were $0.64 and operating ROE, excluding unrealized gains and losses, was 6.6% for the quarter. Our P&C combined ratio in the quarter of 93.1% was an improvement of 2.2 points from quarter three a year ago. That's where the expense and loss ratio improvements are coming through.", "Our P&C top-line growth of 2% year over year was largely driven by reinsurance where, as I mentioned, we're finding a few more opportunities. But insurance, when you take out the noise, also showed underlying growth of 2% in the quarter. So we see this as good progress that we can continue. ", "Before I turn it over to Pete, two other items of note. A comment on the recent hurricanes. And a few thoughts on our innovation efforts. First, Hurricane Nicole while not financially significant, obviously was near direct hit to Bermuda. Ad when you are a Bermuda-based Company, this of course makes it very personal. Happily our people fared well and the Company had minimal disruption and the Island and its people once again demonstrated their tremendous resilience.", "With respect to Hurricane Matthew, it is early in the process. To give some meaning the that, you can understand that this is a difficult claims environment with regard to wind versus flood. Moreover for us, it is even more complicated because as a large commercial property underwriter there may well be some pinpoint losses covered by commercial flood insurance added to what we're observing in reinsurance. But with what we've seen so far and with both sources of loss in mind, we'd estimate a range of between $100 million and $2 million of loss -- and $200 million of loss. And although it is early, there is nothing that we've seen that is giving us any surprise. We will make a pre-announcement as things clarify further. ", "Then as to innovation. I want to emphasize this because quite remarkable when you consider all of the other things going on, these difficult and intense operational objectives of ours. First, as we'll talk about later, we had news today about Paul Brand and the new role he will be taking in leading our innovation effort. He'll have a small team, some of which is already recruited, to push us forward faster. I think in retrospect this will be seen as a very important moment in the history of our Company. Second, our XL innovate efforts continue to bear more and more fruit. You'll see more and more announcements about the new innovations we're pushing into the market and new investments we're making. ", "Finally, then there is our relationship with Oxbotica, a leader in autonomous systems and artificial intelligence which has taken off. And we're actively at work with them in some very exciting new projects teaching us about risks in these new autonomous systems, the Internet of Things and how we can think about potentially using dynamic pricing. We see our innovation efforts as maturing, not just in the many citations for productions Introduced which we've always enjoyed, not just in the many new pricing models at work in the Company, but even in these even more fundamental and potentially revolutionary ways.", "We're proud of the way our underwriters are working our way through this market. We're excited about our progress and the way these trends indicate that more progress is at hand. With that, I'll turn it over to Pete. ", "Pete Porrino", "Thanks Mike and good evening. Mike shared with you the improvement in our operating net income per share versus the same quarter last year. We achieved this even with significantly higher catastrophe losses in the third quarter than we had in the same quarter a year ago. Our natural catastrophe losses net of reinstatement premiums for the third quarter totaled $97 million or 4.1 loss ratio points for the quarter compared to $31 million or 1.3 loss ratio points in the same quarter of 2015. The 2.2 point improvement in our P&C combined ratio versus the same quarter last year was driven by improvements in the operating expense ratio. And Paul and Greg will discuss our underwriting results in further detail. ", "As David mentioned, we provided several slides this quarter in addition to our normal materials. These slides are a response to the numerous requests from investors and analysts that we provide further clarity of our view of our ongoing business. Slide 5 details the improvement in the third quarter 2016 earnings per share compared to last year. Slide 6 pictorially shows what we disclosed in our June 8-K on expenses. ", "If you could turn to slide 7, we provide a normalized view of our nine-month operating ROE excluding net unrealized investment gains that includes adjustments to reported results for timing differences and for naturally varying elements of our results. We start with our operating ROE excluding net unrealized investment gains. The first adjustment is to simply exclude integration costs which are nonrecurring. The next adjustment is to annualize our preferred dividends, most of which are incurred in the first and third quarters.", "The next three adjustments use the Street's consensus view at the beginning of 2016 for key areas of volatility. We have chosen to normalize using the Street's consensus view to avoid making qualitative adjustments and to use information produced by the investment community. This is not an endorsement of the Street's consensus views. We simply obtain the Street's consensus for each column for the full year, multiplied it by 75% and then subtracted our actual nine-month result and then tax-affected it. ", "The adjustment to prior-year development has been included to reflect that we conduct in-depth reviews of our reserves only twice each year. And as a result our prior-year development does not emerge equally by quarter. The next two adjustments to our affiliate assets and catastrophes are an attempt to normalize for naturally volatile parts of our operations. With these adjustments, our annualized ROE for the first three quarters of 2016 would be 8.6%. I know this slide has limitations, but I hope you'll find it responsive. ", "Operating expenses improved compared to both the second quarter of this year and the third quarter of 2015 as our ongoing integration and synergy benefits take hold. Our estimates for operating expense levels for the rest of this year and next year remain in line with those provided in our 8-K filed in June, except for an estimated additional $10 million in one-time integration costs in the fourth quarter of this year due to the change in our insurance operating model. As is our normal practice during the first and third quarters our reserving process is based on a review of our actual versus expected losses. Our semiannual full actual review will be included in next quarter's results. ", "Prior-year net development in the third quarter was a favorable $54 million or 2.3 loss ratio points for the quarter, compared to net favorable development of $28 million or 1.1 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2015. This reflects favorable development of $23 million in the insurance segment and $31 million in the reinsurance segment. As detailed in our financial supplement, our estimated operating tax rate exclusive of discrete impacts has declined to 8.5% reflecting the geographic distribution of our underwriting profits. Fully diluted book value per share grew by 1.6% in the third quarter and by 9% in the nine months ended September 30. ", "Turning to the investment portfolio and as usual my comments will exclude the life funds withheld assets. Net investment income was $171 million compared to $179 million for the prior-year third quarter and $176 million in the second quarter which as I mentioned last quarter was somewhat elevated for a few nonrecurring factors. Net investment income will continue to remain under pressure given the current low interest rate environment and from lower cash flow as a result of our share repurchase program.", "We have approximately $3.5 billion of assets with book yields of 2.4% rolling off over the next 12 months. During the third quarter our average new money rate was 1.9%. At the end of September the gross book yield of the fixed income portfolio was 2.3% and the duration of the total investment portfolio remained at 3.3 years. ", "Total affiliate income was $25 million for the quarter compared to $4 million in the prior-year third quarter. All categories of affiliate holdings contributed positive earnings this quarter, although the absolute returns from our hedge fund portfolio remain disappointing. Despite that, we continue to believe that a modest allocation to this asset class improves our overall risk-adjusted returns over time. Unrealized net gains were $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter. The total return on our investments was 0.7% for the quarter in original currency. ", "And with respect to capital management, we continued to execute share buybacks during the third quarter. During the quarter we repurchased 6.6 million shares for $222 million at an average price of $33.61 per share, leaving $594 million available for purchase under our share buyback program. For the nine months we have purchased 26.2 million shares for $905 million at an average price of $34.54. As I've noted before, this rate of buybacks represents the completion of the additional $250 million we discussed in April as well as an acceleration of our 2016 target given current market conditions. We continue to view these buybacks as an efficient capital management tool and expect to continue share buybacks at a more modest rate for the rest of the year.", "Now I'll turn it over to Paul to discuss our insurance segment results. ", "Paul Brand", "Thanks, Pete. This evening I'll cover the results for the segment, provide an update on current market conditions and finish with some comments on premiums and expense management. First the results. The segment produced a calendar quarter combined ratio of 96.3% compared to 97.2% in Q3 2015 and 96.4% last quarter. ", "Higher cat experience of $71 million, of which $28 million is related to prior quarter cats, compared to $7 million in Q3 2015 was more than offset by prior-year reserve releases of $23 million, by material improvements in the underwriting expense ratio of 2 points and a reduction in the accident year ex-cat loss ratio of 1 point. On an accident quarter ex-cat basis the combined ratio was 93.3% compared to 96.3% in Q3 2015. If we look at the first three quarters, we reported an accident year ex-cat combined ratio of 93.6% compared to 95.3% in 2015. ", "For Q3 we reported an acquisition ratio of 13.4% compared to 13.2% in Q3 2015 and 13.7% reported last quarter. This continues to be in line with the guidance we provided in Q1. This slight increase in acquisition ratio is more than offset by a Q3 operating expense ratio of 18.3% which was 2.2 points lower than Q3 2015 and by a net accident year ex-cat loss ratio of 61.7% which was 1 point lower than Q3 2015 and is the result of the reunderwriting work we started last year. Pricing was slightly better at minus 1.3% for the quarter and minus 2.6% for the full year. ", "Our casualty lines were up 1%. Our specialty businesses were largely flat, with the improvement in our accident and health lines offset by continued competitive conditions in the aviation lines. Our professional businesses were down 2%. And our energy, property and construction businesses were down 5%, once again driven by energy and North American property.", "Insurances gross premiums written in Q3 were down by 2% or $47 million on a reported basis year over year. And when we normalize for foreign exchange, down less than 1% in the quarter. However, when you also consider the portfolio of [indiscernible] activities that started in 2015 where decisions were made to exit certain underperforming businesses, we continue to see growth in the 3% range for the business we like on a year-to-date basis. This underlying growth demonstrates that whilst the market remains difficult, our underwriters continue to leverage our enhanced capabilities and stronger market presence post the transaction into finding new profitable opportunities.", "As Mike mentioned, we continue to see plenty of new business opportunities. Our submission flow is up 8% and our quote ratio is up 5% with our top brokers. So we're seeing more business that we like. However, our conversion rates are down nearly 4%, clearly reflecting our underwriting discipline given the market. ", "For the insurance segment, seeded premiums written in the quarter were $538 million compared to $536 million in Q3 2015. This represents 25% of GPW compared to 24.3% in Q3 2015. As mentioned previously, the seeded written premium line reflects some changes in the way we buy our reinsurance program and the timing of our reinsurance purchasing. And as a result, the written session ratios can and will fluctuate from quarter to quarter. ", "As mentioned in the previous quarter, it is essential that we react to top-line challenges by carefully managing expenses. In the quarter we selectively exited another 15 positions for a total of nearly 90 positions so far this year, as we continue to streamline our underwriting capabilities across the segment. While some of the expense savings from these actions are reflected in the quarter, additional savings will continue to flow through in subsequent quarters along with other efficiency initiatives that are currently underway. ", "In summary, we have delivered another quarter of underwriting profitability, despite market conditions and higher cat activity. We continue to grow the underlying book. And made significant progress on our efficiency and portfolio management initiatives. And as we finalize our business plans for 2017, we fully expect this momentum to continue as margin expansion remains our primary focus. ", "And now to Greg to discuss the reinsurance results. ", "Greg Hendrick", "Thanks, Paul. Today I'll discuss the results for the quarter and summarize current market conditions. Beginning with the results. The reinsurance segment produced solid underwriting performance, with a calendar quarter combined ratio of 86.5% compared with 91.2% for the third quarter of last year. The results of the quarter experienced favorable prior-year development, lower accident quarter ex-cat loss ratio and an improved expense ratio. Reserve releases in the quarter totaled $31 million compared to $35 million a year ago.", "As Pete noted, the third quarter is not a full valuation quarter and reserve releases were driven by properties classes of business. In particular, our loss from last year's Tianjin explosion reduced by $7 million. And estimates for a number of small catastrophe events were lower. Further, our actual versus expected analysis was favorable across both legacy portfolios. ", "The reinsurance segment produced an accident quarter ex-cat loss ratio of 54.9% which compares to 56.7% in the third quarter of 2015. The decrease was driven by the Tianjin event last year, offset predominantly by a handful of medium-sized non-cat losses, as well as a smaller impact from a change in mix of business and market conditions.", "Catastrophe losses totaled $26 million net of reinstatement premiums during the quarter compared to 23 in the third quarter of last year. The cat activity during the quarter resulted from a number of small events as well as developments from the Texas hail storms in the second quarter. Offsetting these events, we reduced our estimates of the Fort McMurray fires and Japan earthquake from last quarter. ", "Expense ratio decreased 3.9 points to 32.1% in the third quarter compared to 36% for the third quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by lower operating expenses as the impact of our expense synergies continue to earn through. Further, we saw a 1 point drop in our acquisition expense ratio, as the impact from purchase accounting continues to diminish. ", "Turning to top line. Gross written premium for the quarter was $566 million, up from $459 million in the third quarter of 2015 with the increase driven by new business and share increases. As we have discussed in prior quarters, XL Catlin has received strong support from our clients and brokers. We're pleased to see that support show up in the top line. This growth was offset by continued underwriting discipline as we non-renewed or reduced shares on nearly $60 million of premium due to unacceptable pricing or terms. On a year-to-date basis for the combined portfolio we have grown just over 7% after adjusting for foreign exchange and multiple-year premiums. ", "Shifting to market conditions, we found the pricing environment challenging but rate decreases continue to decelerate in most lines and regions. And as noted last quarter, we appear to be reaching a bottom in many classes of business. During the quarter rates across the segment were down approximately 2%. Our global catastrophe portfolio was down 4% this quarter and 5% for the year to date, significantly less than the 8% decrease we experienced in 2015.", "The remainder of the property security book, rates were down 2.5%. And our casualty business renewed flat over last year. The remainder of our classes were flat to down low single digit. U.S. short-tail and global casualty treaty placements continue to struggle if terms and conditions were aggressively pushed at renewal. ", "In summary, the third quarter results were respectable for the reinsurance segment. As the market reaches a bottom in many classes we're well positioned to succeed, as our underwriting teams continue to do an excellent job growing profitable business and finding new opportunities while maintaining underwriting discipline. I'll now turn it back to Mike. ", "Mike McGavick", "Thanks, Greg. As you saw this morning, we announced a realignment of our P&C operating model. And I want to quickly walk you through this news. If you go back to when we brought the two companies together, we combined XL and Catlin into a classically matrixed insurance organization to take advantage of the best of both prior operating models. And we knew that when the time was right we'd take a step back to adjust for what we were learning about the organization and to be able to even better respond to the marketplace.", "Much of this now announced realignment started with observations from Paul Band and Kelly Lyles earlier this year. And on top of their minds was to have a model that accelerated and deepened our innovation successes and responded better to the market by streamlining decision-making and getting the business as close to the customer as possible. So as to innovation, Paul will be taking on the new role as Director of Accelerate, the new internal innovation team. I'm extraordinarily excited to see what they will produce. ", "Then there are other changes to the operating model itself. The most obvious of which is that we're bringing together insurance and reinsurance into one P&C organization under Greg Hendrick's leadership. We will, of course, maintain all of the appropriate governance and separation required between the insurance and reinsurance operations. But we feel that by working together at a high level under the same span of control we can harness the power of that adjacency for our customers' benefit.", "Solutions are clearly blending. And we want to be in a position to lead these developments on our clients' behalf. Having led insurance and reinsurance and having been instrumental in developing our long-standing strategy, Greg is clearly ideally suited for this new role. ", "Then another key learning for us has been the instrumental role country and territorial leadership plays for us around the world. You'll see that in the new model, our P&C business groups are supported by four key capabilities, one of which is client and country management. And Kelly Lyles, who as you know is currently our Chief Regional Officer for Insurance, will become the Chief Executive Client and Country Management who will be responsible for our global broker relationships and for ensuring that we have strong leadership in our key geographies. Kelly will report directly to me and to Greg and will continue to be a member of our Group Leadership Team. You can find a much more detailed breakdown of the new structure and the names of who will lead within it in what we released this morning. ", "We firmly believe that this realignment will create a more efficient, responsive and profitable business. While the announcement is new, this is something we have been contemplating for some time. Although there are people impacts, they will be very limited among a handful of senior positions. We will still have some people, who we're really excited about, move on as there just aren't as many roles in the new model. We're proud to have worked with these people and we wish them l the very best. ", "One more topic. You would have seen an 8-K this afternoon that I'm going to be selling some shares. And I can understand that this could be misinterpreted in two important ways. First, that I'm somehow less committed to my job. Or second, that I believe this is somehow a good price at which to be selling. The opposite is the case in both respects. More than two years ago I decided with my family that my commitment to XL was open-ended, that this wasn't going to be just some turnaround gig but a mission far greater and longer than that.", "As a result, I made some broader financial plans, the last part of which was to sell some shares. Happily for XL, but not so happily for my personal plans, before I acted on selling, the XL Catlin combination talks heated up. This is the first time since that I have felt comfortable taking this long delayed action. ", "That said, I fully expect to be kicking myself next year over the price I will have to accept. But I am simply past the point where I can wait, given what I put in motion two long years ago. And I want to emphasize that even after these sales, XL shares will remain our family's largest single asset by far, as it should be. With that, I'll turn it back to David for Q&A. ", "David Radulski", "Shirley, can you please open the lines for questions? ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. First question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. ", "Kai Pan", "First, congrats and best wishes to both Paul and Greg for your new roles. My first question is on the core loss ratio in both insurance and reinsurance segments. Could you quantify any sort of large non-cat losses during the quarter? How did they compare year over year? And if you stepping back, where do you want these core loss ratio in your segment going to be in order to achieve like double-digit ROE for the entire organization? And how do you get there? ", "Paul Brand", "This is Paul. Certainly in this quarter we saw slightly higher large losses and that accounts for the slight deterioration in loss ratio as you look sort of quarter to quarter between quarter two and quarter three. Now, we're not overly concerned about that. We're not seeing a pattern. As we look at the sort of underlying development of the book at the more normal losses, that was very favorable. So we're seeing year-on-year improvement, but just a few slightly larger losses this quarter. ", "Greg Hendrick", "And for reinsurance I'd point you back to -- what I wanted to do is share a little data with you from the last five years. When we look back five years, granted it's a mix of XL and then XL Catlin. Because we've talked about, we've put the loss ratios all in the same level for the combined book. I think it's a relevant set of numbers. I think the mix is not that different through that time period. ", "And we'd observe for Q3 anywhere from 49% and 58% for an accident year ex-cat loss ratio with a 54% average, right around 54% and a bit where we're this quarter. So I think we're in line. Those are driven by reinsurances, not a heavily attrition driven loss ratio. It's a number of small, mid and sometimes large losses. I think we had a little bit more this quarter than we would normally expect, but nothing outsized. And I believe strongly that the new portfolio is diversified reinsurance and able to withstand more of that activity. ", "Mike McGavick", "And Kai, first thanks for your gracious comments towards Paul and Greg. I'm really excited about their new roles as well. You also asked sort of taken as a whole, does this mean anything relative to our ambition to be delivering double-digit ROEs and how would you get there. A couple of comments. Number one, I mentioned these five trends. The idea that we're getting more flow from our partners and we're even seeing more business that we'd like to write. But at this point in the market find it difficult to actually write more. So that flow is a very good sign of our position in the marketplace today. ", "The second thing is, we're finding some growth. As I mentioned for this quarter, in essence the overall was 2%. If you then went back and normalized for some of the reunderwriting activities in insurance, we actually had growth there that was positive. And then third, I talked about the fact that the loss ratio year over year, the underlying loss ratio has declined. And while there has been some higher large loss activity in this year which the market's been talking about, we've been talking about, we've been largely, not entirely but largely able to absorb that as we've gone along which is a sign of the greater resilience of this book of business.", "Fourth, I talked about expenses and the fact that we're meeting those aggressive targets that we have laid out to the Street. And we expect to continue to do so. Fifth, of course I talked about capital management which has been very significant in this year. And continues to improve the E against which we work. ", "If I take those five together, that is where some of the progress toward this objective comes from. But there's two additional things that come into play next year that isn't evident this year. Number one, we will have worked most of those larger reunderwriting actions through the book and they will no longer have the same negative impact on our loss ratio that they continues to have today. We're always doing a little bit of reunderwriting, but those actions we took in 2015 were a very significant dimension. And we finally get them largely through the book of business and they won't have that same negative loss ratio drag. ", "Second, we also will be away from the negative top-line drag that those activities have created. And I would hope that then next year we'll actually see the growth that our underwriters are able to find come through into the numbers. Those are two more accelerants that are added to those five trends as we get into 2017. I know you want me to conclude that with some table-pounding forecast. I'm not going to do that.", "Our budget is still in the works. The Board has not yet adopted it. But I like what those trends imply about our ability to continue to expand margins. And as we finalize the budget, I'll have more to say about what that yields in totality. But it's clearly trends that work in favor of what we've said we will do. ", "Kai Pan", "And then follow-up on the capital management. You said in the past that this year would do $950 million at least. You had done more than $900 million which implies only $50 million. Are you going to do only $50 million for the fourth quarter? Looking into 2017, will they fall back to the $175 million per quarter run rate going forward? Thanks. ", "Mike McGavick", "You've hit two of the questions we were most expecting. So well done. First of all, we will likely exceed modestly what we've talked about so far. So it won't just reduce to kind of $50 million. It will moderate, but it will clearly exceed that for the balance of the year. ", "With respect to next year, it's a bit premature, right? We haven't adopted the budget, as I mentioned a moment ago. And that work finalizes in early December in work with the Board. And that's why historically, as you know, we have commented and given some directional intent around both share repurchases and around expenses at that end-of-year call kind of three months from now. That's still when we'll give you more guidance. Now, on expenses, there's no more guidance to give.", "We've already talked about the expense levels we're going to achieve and we're going to achieve them. The only direction that could change is if somehow we forecast a lot lower revenue, then we could probably drive them even lower. I don't at this point expect that. ", "Second, with respect to share repurchases, a couple of thoughts. One, there's nothing going on that would indicate we would do any less than we originally intended to do last year. I would find it very hard to imagine the circumstance where it would be lower than our initial guidance. And obviously we continue to feel that this -- that XL is fundamentally under-priced. And as a result we've been more opportunistic this year as we've had opportunities to do so. I would like to think that somewhere between those two is, I would think, where we might come out. It's a bit premature to say. I'm still bullish on how share repurchases fit into the entire story. We'll give more precise directional observations when it comes to the end-of-year call. ", "Pete Porrino", "Kai, it's Pete. As we think about the actuals for the year, I can tell you that through October we're at $950 million. So from the $905 million to the $950 million was for the month of October. I think that's sort of a reasonable run rate for the rest of the year. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question. ", "Josh Shanker", "So thinking about where things are right now, you talked about that next year there would be no more impact from the reunderwriting. Are there things you can say right now that you know that you could not be doing in this quarter as a standalone Company? That there's evidence today for an investor that this merger has worked? Can you recount in some ways improvements that you can see that are here right now? Is that reasonable? ", "Mike McGavick", "Yes, Josh, let me comment on a couple things. And let me start at the highest level. Given their history and given their scale, there is no way that the expense savings that have been achieved to date and will be achieved by the end of 2017 could possibly have taken place without the combination. And given how the soft market playbook works, as it were, expenses become more and more important as the soft market grinds on. So that is the first and most obvious and tangible benefit to shareholders. ", "Second, we did not expect as this combination was created that the pricing environment would become so dire, especially in specialty lines. That took us off guard. There is, again, no way that the prior separate institutions could have fought through with the success that they're having in creating, again, when you clean out the reunderwriting effects some modest growth. That wouldn't have happened. Each franchise would have been weaker.", "You wouldn't have seen this lift in submissions. The opportunity to see more and to try and pick your way through this market was greatly enhanced by the combination that we have made. And I know and I say this every call, you have lots of contacts in the broker community, the market community, you know that that's true. And we go to all of our meetings and we hear it time and time again.", "A part of how we've been able to achieve that in a way that doesn't lose underwriting control is we've been able to up our relationships with existing clients with proven track records. That couldn't have been possible for each company independently before because it was only through bringing the firms together that we had both the greater capital base and the greater diversified capital base for those counter-parties to trust our continuing growth with them. So in each of those cases, Josh, we're talking about things that were made possible by the combination. ", "Josh Shanker", "Can I interrupt you for one second? There's an irony there, that even if you had anticipated the soft specialty market you still should have done the deal because the combination of the two companies is allowing you to resist the trend. ", "Mike McGavick", "Precisely. ", "Josh Shanker", "Is that right? ", "Mike McGavick", "That's exactly right. ", "Josh Shanker", "Okay. Continue. I just wanted to make sure that I understood your point. ", "Mike McGavick", "Each enterprise separately would have been weaker and more at the mercy of this difficult market had the combination not taken place and would have had more difficult expense challenges with less scale with which to address them. So from my -- you caught me right toward the end.", "By the way, that diversified balance sheet gave rise to a greater opportunity for capital management as well than independently I think you would have seen from either company. Moreover, we're able to better absorb patterns of larger losses, as we have seen this year. In every one of those respects, this firm is performing better than the separate companies would have performed in the same market conditions. We didn't foresee it. We didn't do it because we saw it coming. We did it because we thought it was the right thing to do. Greg has an expression that I quite like. ", "Since this is a largely U.S. audience I can use it. I find it difficult to recreate around the world. From an underwriting talent point of view which was the key objective to aggregate that talent and to put it to work for our clients and for our shareholders, we've really got a lineup like the 1927 Yankees. This is the most powerful collection of the specialty and market-leading thinkers that you could gather, but it's like we've assembled that talent and then there was a players strike, that is the equivalent.", "They can't do everything they could do because the market conditions are what they are. And in the end, maintaining our discipline in this market which the various statistics that Paul walked you through is exactly what they should be doing. And I can't tell you how grateful I am for the work they're doing, because they do it in miserable conditions. Over and over and over you get told, well, we'd love you but you just didn't match this crazy price someone else gave you. And then they've got to go do it again and do it again. It's hard danged work. And they're doing an excellent job of it. Greg, you've got some--. ", "Greg Hendrick", "Josh, because I think at the top you asked for some specific observations. One is, we're seeing opportunity we would not have seen as independent firms in the reinsurance. And I'll let Paul talk to the insurance side. We just wouldn't have seen as large participations with clients that don't go out to the broad market. You see it coming through in our Q3 growth.", "I want to make sure I point out. Remember, reinsurance is a lumpy, lumpy business. So that's not to say that the growth we had in the third quarter is now embedded in there going forward. That's not the case. We do see more and more of that. You'll see that coming through in this quarter. ", "We've gotten more focused on client management. We're seeing more business from the clients we like and know than we used to do in the past when we were perhaps not quite as structured about it as independent firms. I think Mike touched on the diversification point. You don't see it in the fin sub, but If I look just at the other line in reinsurance, in the fin sub, you'll see a pretty good set of growth there. That's because XL wasn't in credit and surety. XL Catlin had built a good business around that. And Catlin wasn't in health reinsurance. And we were in health reinsurance at XL. So as you bring these two books together, they're just a much better, diversified more stable pot of business. ", "Paul Brand", "Just to add on to what Greg said, I think the client proposition is very much stronger together than it would have been separate. And we're really working in that area to build out on that. Another area is we just lead more business. I think being at that top table as you're getting into the difficult conversations about how to retain business and how to win business, we're in a much better position to be able to increase our share on the business that we like than people who are further down, particularly in the subscription markets. So I think it's absolutely clearly created value. ", "Josh Shanker", "As you guys prepare your budgets for the coming year and think about 2018, the industry itself, how much of an ROE headwind is the industry going to face in 2017 versus 2016 and whatnot? Do you have a budget for where you think trends are going? ", "Mike McGavick", "Well, I'd only comment a little bit on the general pricing condition trend, because I think that's the one that we -- when we face two headwinds, all of us together. We face a soft market headwind together. And that can be variable according to any particular mix of business. But that is a common across-the-board theme. And we face this interest rate environment in common together which puts so much more demand on the underwriting result. So both of those, I don't see huge change coming in either one. You never know. But there's nothing that's happened that would forecast that. ", "So let me walk through kind of the pricing environments and our attitude toward it across the two books. In reinsurance, as Greg said, we've seen a bottoming out. If you've been following the news out of [indiscernible] for example, where this a lot of reinsurance contracts being discussed, you're seeing a clear change in attitude from the market side of the equation. And you're seeing a lots more pushback in terms and conditions. You're seeing no more, that's enough. You're just seeing a different attitude in very public display. And I think that's very encouraging and I would carry that further to the large commercial marketplace. ", "We look at global program type business, we even saw one of the leaders of one of the buyer associations in Germany publicly say that the conversation had to become more balanced in the interest of our carriers. When they start saying that, a community that usually is talking you down all the time, that just tells you there's something new and different going on in the marketplace. I don't think it portends a turn, but it is a change that is clearly going to moderate the downward pressure in some areas. ", "Now, there's some like energy, aviation, where it's just hard to understand what's going on. So I do believe that all competitors face that pressure in common. I don't know exactly how to translate that to an ROE headwind because it differs by how the companies respond to it. For us, we've been cutting back writings in those lines where competition has gotten ridiculous. We don't have a broad one size fits all attitude. We have a lot of sophistication in how we do pricing. And we're able to be very clear with our clients kind of where it just becomes something we can't do. So we do that client by client in conversation. ", "But if we look at aviation, if we look at energy, if we look at some of the marine areas, those are clearly areas where we're going to have less writings because our underwriters are at a point where they can't tolerate what's going on. There are other pockets where we can grow. And so I can't make -- I can't translate it to an industry effect. I can tell you what we're doing. And so far, as you see by the improvement in the loss ratio year over year on a sustained basis, we're seeing that strategy play out to our benefit. ", "We're fighting off these headwinds which were present last year and accelerated at the beginning of this year. I feel okay about that. I really can't put myself in the other shoes because I don't know how their mix of activity and repurchasing and all that. I just know what our trends are. I can't speak to theirs. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open. You may ask your question. ", "Brian Meredith", "Mike, a couple questions here for you. First one, with respect to the reorganization that's gone on and some of the displaced people that you mentioned, are they client-facing? Is there a risk that there could potentially be some lost business here as a result of the reorg? ", "Mike McGavick", "No, I see that as very unlikely. Look, in our insurance operations which is where -- if the reinsurance operating model is essentially the same, you take that out, you replace Greg and move on. There's a lot of stability there, a lot of history there. But on the insurance operations which is where the meat of this is, we're really talking about at the very top level a few people and at the next level a couple handfuls. And they aren't -- while they are market-facing in the sense that they have presence in the marketplace, they are not the people conducting daily transactional business. ", "And in fact, one of the primes of why we made this change and how it works is the daily transaction level is practically unaffected. So tomorrow they're working for the same people. They are answering -- it's just -- but what there is, is there's a simplified referral process, in essence. There's less hands with different points of views injecting themselves into that process. That should speed up decision-making and make it simpler, both for our people and for the market to know where to go when there's a little bit of hair on the risk, as it were. And that -- in a soft market that comes up more, frankly.", "So having that simplified should accelerate how we make decisions and should have a positive impact in the eyes of our brokering community and partners. So we're already seeing greater submissions. This could enable us to work faster and better and maybe even see that stimulated more. ", "The final bit is that country management piece. In essence if you stepped back, we had put in a pretty heavy regional structure. This lightens that regional structure some, but it empowers more that country level management, because that's where we saw the real lift. That's where we saw that work with the relationships. And so those people that were -- we were actually seeing some growth because of them. For example, in LatAm, two operations there in Mexico City and in Brazil, I happen to have been in both offices over the last few weeks. They're off a small base, but they're winning awards for their responsiveness in the marketplace.", "And we're seeing kind of 80% type growth rates off those small bases because of this newer local presence. That we've enhanced by this and taken off some of the upstream requirements so we can make decisions faster. So no. I'm sorry for the long answer, but this is really important to us. No, we don't expect that at all. ", "Brian Meredith", "Just a quick kind of numbers question here for Paul. Paul, I think last quarter you said that seeded ratio for the insurance would be 33% to 34%. That would basically imply that you're going to have a pretty high session rate in the fourth quarter. Is that still true? ", "Paul Brand", "I think it's actually likely to come in marginally less than that, I think, for the fourth quarter. ", "Brian Meredith", "Okay. ", "Paul Brand", "It's going to start with 30% but it won't be as low as 33%. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes in Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ", "Jay Cohen", "A couple of questions. You referred to the drag you're seeing this year or the impact you're seeing on the loss ratio because of some of the reunderwriting activities which are still working through the book. I'm wondering if you can put a range around that, how much is it hurting the loss ratio this year? And then secondly, with the restructuring and some of the personnel departures that you'll have, is there sort of an expense benefit that will come through, even if it's modest? ", "Mike McGavick", "So let me start with the last one first. No, these kinds of redesigns were anticipated as we were putting our expenses together. So it was a little bit different than we expected. It was a little bit more top heavy. That's the reason for the $10 million extra in integration cost in the quarter. But in general it was in direction -- in furtherance of our savings objectives. It doesn't add to it.", "The second, with respect to a range on the drag, I'm looking at Susan Cross who is sitting across from me, our Chief Reserving Actuary. I think a proper range for that would be something like a little bit more than 0.5 point, something in that range. ", "Jay Cohen", "And that's for the whole Company or is that just the insurance segment? ", "Mike McGavick", "That would be for the insurance segment. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. You may ask you question. ", "Paul Newsome", "I was hoping you might be able to sort of dumb this down for me and make sure I know how to think about this. This is really a question that refers to Kai's questions about getting to a double-digit ROE. As I look at your Company, it looks like the reinsurance business has a really very good combined ratio. The insurance business is maybe a little bit of improvement, but really dramatically not more -- the low 90%s is really a pretty solid combined ratio for that business.", "So that seems to leave only two more levers. And I'm excluding investment income because it is what it is. That's your corporate expense and the operating levers that you use to get you to an ROE. And it seems like those are the two pieces that if you're actually going to get to a really solid double-digit ROE are what you have to pull to achieve that. Is that right? ", "Mike McGavick", "Paul, I don't know if I -- I certainly would never dumb something down because everybody on this call is damn smart. I walked through those five trends, all of which are meant to address the belief we have, the absolute belief we have, that we can continue to expand margins in our insurance operation. And I mentioned two accelerants that come into play more next year that were not present this year. ", "So we'll get a fuller benefit of the growth that our underwriters are able to create. And we'll get less of a drag, as was just discussed, on the loss ratio due to that reunderwriting activity. So those are meant to directly address that we believe the insurance combined ratio can improve from here and that we can fight our way through the obvious negative effects of the pricing environment. So first that. ", "Second, we have been very aggressive on the E side of things through our share repurchases in this year. As Pete mentioned, we're already at $950 million. And I think the way anyone reasonably listening to him would say and that's going to go up. And as I answered Kai, we see something certainly better than our of initial expectation for this year and perhaps up to what we did do this year. So you're talking about a couple of levers that move things meaningfully in the equation it is you're trying to solve for. And we're starting from what is, as Pete laboriously described in great detail, what is something like a normalized [indiscernible].", "And we'll see what the fourth quarter, ex-Matthew of course, produces. So we see the -- so if you were looking at it from our shoes, if you believed that the combined ratio in insurance could continue to come down, if you believe that overall expenses including corporate expenses would continue to come down at the levels that we have described before and if you believed you could get a modest bit of growth into that more efficient model, you would say to yourself that's within range, exactly how more to describe that. ", "I've told you I'm not going to pound the table today. I haven't finished the budget. Pete's got a couple thoughts to add. But we're getting there. And we're pretty pleased with our progress. I don't know what else to tell you. ", "Paul Newsome", "I guess what the answer it seems to be is that it's about the insurance operation, it's about corporate expenses, but it's not so much about operating leverage to make that-- ", "Pete Porrino", "So Paul, this is Pete. Let me just a couple things. And again, we're not -- this is clearly not going to be walk to a 10% ROE. The numbers that we put out in that slide were for the nine months. And everyone knows that we had not a very good first quarter. And so the run rate of last two quarters are certainly better than the average for the three quarters. ", "The second thing is, I wouldn't just think about the corporate expenses. The way we think about it is, we need to do better on, I will call it, the loss ratio and commission ratio together with the technical ratio. And then we look at the overall expenses, if you look at what we said we were going to do it's about a $70 million improvement year on year. So that's 0.7% right there. And then since our expenses are in essence locked at this point in time, you talk about leverage, it's ultimate leverage.", "So for every $1 of premium, extra premium that we write, one minus the technical ratio falls to the bottom line. So I do think that there are levers there. But again, this is not to try and walk you to a 10%. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Kumar with Macquarie. Your line is open. You may ask your question. ", "Amit Kumar", "Two quick questions, the first question is on the level of reserve releases in the quarter. I noticed that reinsurances was higher than insurance. Could you just add some more sort of thought as to where did that release come from and if there was anything impacting the release numbers this quarter? ", "Greg Hendrick", "It's Greg Hendrick. In the reinsurance the quarter's a very what I would call mechanical process. It's very property driven. It's responding to what we've actually observed on the ground in the quarter. There isn't -- absent any bad news that we would react to quickly on the casualty side, it's really a property driven quarter.", "As I pointed out, there was the take-down on Taijin which we felt was prudent given the way the losses are being paid out. And a handful of other catastrophes that were proving to be -- have more reserves than he needed as losses got paid and we got towards closure. There wasn't -- to me it was same as every quarter I've done for the last 15 or 20 years here at XL with the reinsurance book. ", "Pete Porrino", "And then Amit, this is Pete. The only thing I would add at the beginning of your question, reinsurance is almost always has historically a higher reserve release than insurance. So this again was not a surprise this quarter. ", "Amit Kumar", "The other question I had was just based on the level of, I guess, growth in the reinsurance. And I know you talked about the budget still being in the pipeline. Should we expect, I guess, a different level of outward reinsurance for 2017? How should we think about that? ", "Paul Brand", "We're clearly trying to optimize the reinsurance program, putting a lot of thought into that at the moment as we speak. I would not anticipate a remarkably changed seeded ratio as today. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open. You may ask your question. ", "Meyer Shields", "Pete, one quick question for you. I think today you reiterated your guidance for operating expenses based on the June 8-K. Does that take into account the foreign exchange shift that we saw, I guess, right after the Brexit vote? ", "Pete Porrino", "Right. So just to put that in perspective, it's a great question, Mayer. So the third quarter benefit was slightly under $10 million. So really not much of a number there. It looks like if the exchange rates hold up it will be slightly more than that in the fourth quarter. And if you look at where our expenses are running, you would see if you sort of normalize a fourth quarter, you would probably see us coming at sort of more towards the bottom of that range rather than the midpoint of the range. The difference there would be the FX benefit. ", "Meyer Shields", "Okay. And the same, I assume, would apply in 2017, assuming no changes from here? ", "Pete Porrino", "Yes. ", "Meyer Shields", "Okay. Second question, you've talked a lot about submission activity. And I'm wondering whether, if you look at your business mix now or maybe look forward a year when the reunderwriting is done, is there a greater or lesser exposure to what we call these large losses? ", "Paul Brand", "We're not looking to particularly enhance the exposure to the large losses. If anything, I would imagine that it might marginally reduce. The book is becoming more diversified as we've pushed it together. So yes and I think that we're constantly trying to look at the portfolio and think about how can we, using data and analytics to essentially have better insights on likely places for margins. That's tending to not sort of lead to vast increased lines. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Gutterman with Balyasny. You may ask your question. ", "Ian Gutterman", "I guess to start, an easy one, Pete. You said with the tax rate was in operating for the year. What was it for the quarter? It seemed like it was pretty low. ", "Pete Porrino", "Let me open it up and get that for you. It was a little low. It also had the impact of the discrete items in there as well. Just give me one sec. So the quarter was -- I got that right here. I actually don't have it right in front of me, Ian. I'll get it to you in a minute. ", "Ian Gutterman", "Okay. I guess for Greg. I guess I'm having a little bit of, what's the word, dissonance, I guess, right, about the reinsurance growth rate. On one hand, you guys talk about how tough the market is which obviously makes it a difficult period to grow.", "On the other hand, you talk about the new business model and the opportunity it's giving you to grow. I'm just struggling to understand what's good growth versus what's growth I should be skeptical about. I know you talked about it some earlier. Is there any more detail you can give us about what's driving such strong growth, not just in the quarter, but really for the year? And maybe specific examples or lines of business or as opposed to me just saying, it's big growth in reinsurance, it must be at 100? ", "Greg Hendrick", "Sure, Ian. Look, there isn't one market, first of all. Not everything in the reinsurance market is at a very low return level. You've seen cat experiences in a couple of countries around the year and in last year and you're seeing rates respond to that. You're seeing casualty in general starting to flatten out and really renew same again year over year.", "There isn't one big bad market out there. The general tone of it across it is not great, but there is pockets of opportunities. I would say the folks on the ground have been going really hard at making sure they find those, focusing on the clients that we know because we trade with them already in other areas. I think that's the biggest thing is regards to who we're going after and the business there. ", "The growth rate's going to be lumpy. It was 23% in the quarter on gross written. It's 7% for the year when you adjust for FX and multi-year. So there's just -- it's never -- we're not growing at 23% on a per annum basis. That's not going to happen. ", "But we did have a couple of opportunities. In this quarter, one of them was to expand an existing relationship we had with a credit customer, another couple were around motor or auto covers which have a slightly higher combined ratio but also a lower volatility and less downside to them. They came up, they were offered to us. ", "We believe because of our new presence in the marketplace and we took advantage of them. There may not be any of them in the fourth quarter. We're trying hard to find them all the time and do it the right way. But they don't always come up in that same quarter-to quarter fashion. ", "Ian Gutterman", "Got it. Maybe one follow-up on that part, is obviously the part I struggle and I'm guessing most of us on the call struggle with, is how to model the benefit of that. It's not like it's a short tail so I should improve my accident year because there's a positive mix and because you said some of the stuff is longer. You said less volatility. Should I be able to see the cat lower in in the reinsurance segment come down a little bit? Not that I can see your [indiscernible], but if I could see it, it would be better? If I could see your budget, I guess, where would I see an improvement? Would it be the absolute combined? The cat loads? The capital allocated? What are sort of the metrics, I guess? ", "Greg Hendrick", "As I think about it, Ian, I think you're not seeing a huge amount of improvement in reinsurance. What we're able to do by piecing these opportunities together is we're able to maintain the margin that we have today. That's really how I think about it. In the particular example I gave you, our credit book runs at a -- it's a lower loss ratio business than the average. The motor's a little bit high. When you blend them together, you're coming back to this. That's why I cited the last five years of third quarter accident year ex-cat, you're in that 50% to 58%. We're at 54%. ", "We're basically counteracting kind of what's tough market, some tough pricing by blending in these new pieces. I wouldn't point you to there's going to be a dramatic improvement in accident ex-cat [indiscernible]. If the market turns and we have a lot of opportunity to lift and get that kind of growth in a major way, you would start to see a lower -- I would believe, a lower accident year ex-cat loss ratio -- I'm sorry, accident year ex-cat combined ratio on the expense side. This is really -- it's piece by piece. You don't have my budget. No one's approved it yet. So we're still working on it. ", "Ian Gutterman", "Fair enough Mike, can you just, again, I know you talked about this earlier too. Can you elaborate a little bit more on the innovation initiative? What I mean by that, it's a little bit of a similar question. How do we measure whether that's successful or not? Is it -- what's sort of the tangible deliverable, other than press releases about things you're doing? Is it we're going to -- is it if something comes along that's the next ASI? And is a big win in the portfolio or is it something that translates into better growth and margins in the core underwriting businesses? How do we evaluate whether this initiative is doing well? ", "Mike McGavick", "Let me give you -- to be honest, over time we're going to work on many more metrics around this. So given that it's still, I wouldn't call it early days but relatively early. I think it's -- I think you're right to ask. We need to give more thought to exactly how to present it to you. Let me give you some examples. ", "First of all, yes, to your first question, are we always hunting for more ASIs? Sure. We don't make a lot of those kinds of bets, but in those bets we get a couple of benefits. Number one, we get, we believe, attractively priced reinsurance opportunities. Because of the strategic relationship we're able to negotiate differently on the terms of reinsurance. And we find that a very attractive method to, in this difficult market, add to our reinsurance writings. And then you get the potential.", "That kind of -- that tends to lessen the risk of whatever investment might be associated. And then you get the potential upside if the investment proves wise as well. So we like both of those. We don't take a lot -- we're not a spread shooter. We're very targeted on things that are related to things we have expertise or things that we want to learn about and we get that benefit. ", "The second thing we get is we get eyes on, hands dirty experience with some of these new and potentially disruptive insurance models. We get to learn how the technology works. We get to learn whether it works. We get to learn whether the promised innovation is real. And we get to think about what application that might have for our businesses. And because of the way we negotiate these, in some cases we have even rights to increase our ownership or to use technology. There's different elements of how we negotiate each one of these. So that's a second benefit we get. ", "The third one relates to our pricing insight. We have been actively and I'd say somewhat quietly, building models to gain pricing advantages. We all know that when you are an early adopter in modeling, you get a double lift. You not only get the benefit of your model, assuming it's right and ours have been uncannily effective, but you also get the benefit that those things that you turn away for reasons that others aren't able to analyze can actually lead to some adverse business building for them. So we get a twofer out of that. ", "I'm not ready to talk about it. Others like to talk about this a lot. We actually kind of enjoy the quiet effectiveness. We have a number of these models up, running and adhered to across XL. And over the coming years I think it would be right to put some metrics around that for you to understand better. So there you get loss ratio lift. And we have a meaningful portion of the book now getting that lift from that activity. ", "And then fourth, we also where we innovate, we get to invent markets where we're lonely in our competition which is rare in our space. But I'll give you an explicit example. You heard me talk about it before, but it's worth mentioning. That's new energy risk where we built an MGA MGU, created an entirely new product for it. We're the first to market in it.", "We had much less cost to building that out because the brokers didn't have expertise to contribute. It wound up in a weaker position in the transaction and therefore extracted less fees. And in the end we're now writing about $75 million of that. And at this stage, I'm touching all the wood I can find, there's been no losses on that business. And it is growing. In fact, we're working on some adjacent products that we're hoping shortly to be rolling out. ", "Whenever you're able to do something like that, you do so with less of this crazy competitive environment that we've all been talking about. You're doing it -- you have a lead position. You're able to run ahead. That's where I think what Paul is taking on, what we're doing with Oxbotica, all of that, that fits in that category. XL innovate, a part of what they do is what I talked about first, but a part of what they do is this too, where they are entirely reinventing a business model and leading out with a new product that we think is very hard to imitate. We run with -- obviously people try, but they can't because they haven't spent the several years deep into the science which we do. ", "So that's why the Oxbotica relationship is one I call out specifically because it is teaching us things that we know are coming and that we believe we can lead because of our deep understanding of the science behind it in creating the insurance products that people are going to need. That kind of thing really gives us a differential lift in the marketplace. So yes, you're right. It's tough to measure externally, particularly at this point. I brought it up because it is now at a maturing point.", "And we believe we will need to get in front of you and give much more definition to this, a way for you to think about it. But I think that those who are not -- we aren't the only one doing some of these things. I think we're doing it with a coherence and a practicality that is starting to show up in our numbers. And I'm looking forward to talking about that in greater depth in the future, Ian. ", "Pete Porrino", "Ian, on the first question, again, the operating tax expense for the quarter excluding discretes was 4.7%. ", "Operator", "Thanks. Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. ", "Ryan Tunis", "I just had one that I was hoping you could help us with. I'm not even actually sure if you can. In the reinsurance segment, I guess over the past couple of years there's been that fairly large accident year true-up in the fourth quarter, I guess associated with a lighter catastrophe year.", "Can we say, I guess, when you layer on Matthew and all the cats we've had year to date, I mean, is there any way you can definitively say that we shouldn't expect that true-up at this point, just based on what we've seen year to date? Any help, I guess, just in thinking about the fourth quarter, that would be helpful. Thank you. ", "Greg Hendrick", "I'll do my best. Unfortunately the reality of this is always experience will dictate in the fourth quarter what's going to happen. I go back again over the last five years, we've seen roughly speaking about on average across those five years, an 8 point improvement in the fourth quarter accident year ex-cat combined -- loss ratio relative to the first three quarters. Why am I talking about accident year ex-cat when you're citing cats? It's because as I said last quarter, our non-large cat losses, so those small attritional cats, are recorded as accident year ex-cat in our numbers. ", "Those are to reflect the fact that there's seasonality in the exposures and that as a reinsurer there's a lag in information. We're usually behind as you get these events reported and particularly on your pro rata proportion treaties that you're getting information quite often in arrears. What it will be this quarter, I don't know. Because we'll have to look at what the quarter activity is and see how that exposure goes. But that's what the history has yielded in the past. ", "Ryan Tunis", "I guess just one follow-up would just be on the Hanjin bankruptcy. And I guess anything that you guys know there or in terms of your exposure or how you're thinking about that at this point. Thanks. ", "Paul Brand", "We don't normally give details on specific losses. To be clear, there is some exposure. It is developing. People are talking about some essentially loss of use exposure to containers which have been mislocated. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Randy Binner with FBR. You may ask your question. ", "Randy Binner", "I just had a cleanup question real quick. This kind of goes back to what Meyer was asking. On the integration expense schedule, I guess, that was laid out in the 8-K earlier in the year, you outlined how FX changes could kind of affect how that comes in. But is there anything else that could materially kind of throw that off? We have kind of a level of expense a little bit lower than what we saw in the third quarter and the fourth and the first going into 2017 and then really dropping in the second. What could change, what could accelerate that, what could push it out at this point? Because to me it seems the sum of all these comments, it's kind of in the bag. ", "Pete Porrino", "This is Pete, Randy. The biggest variable there would be variable compensation, other than the FX. We're getting into the fourth quarter and we'll see how that quarter develops. But I would say that is by far the biggest uncertainty that we would have around expenses for the rest of this year. And then that would also hold true for next year as well. ", "Randy Binner", "These integration -- if it's comp based, so that wouldn't affect the first half 2017 expenses as much as it would the fourth quarter, right? ", "Pete Porrino", "Right. So I was talking about fourth quarter. I'm not talking about integration expense. The integration expenses are really independent of that and I thought you were talking about the entire expense load--", "Randy Binner", "No, I'm thinking more of just -- sorry, the Catlin integration expenses because those start to wind down. They kind of go away in 2017. That helps the rest of the earnings profile go higher. I'm just trying to figure out what could throw that off. ", "Pete Porrino", "I'm sorry. I misunderstood the question. There is not a lot, other than if for some reason you did something more intense around people, where you would have people impacts which we're not expecting. Other than that, I don't see a lot of volatility to that number. ", "Randy Binner", "And a bigger people move would probably be in reaction to a revenue change which you're not seeing right now? ", "Mike McGavick", "Right. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question comes from Ryan Byrnes with Janney. You may ask your question. ", "Ryan Byrnes", "Just had one question. If I look at your presentation, one of the biggest kind of deltas from the sell side to actual numbers this year has been affiliate income. And if I look kind of the past six or seven quarters since you guys sold ASI, it's kind of averaged around $20 million. And again, this quarter came in at $25 million. I guess I'm not looking for a run rate going forward, but is this $20 million to $25 million, does that seem right what we've had the last six quarters post ASI? Or is there something else that I'm missing there? ", "Pete Porrino", "I think we did lay out in the slides, we did lay out sort of to give you the last eight quarters which would give you a good average to work on. I think we would hope that we could do a little bit better than the numbers that you threw out. But that really is dependent on -- the biggest variable there are the investment affiliates -- not the investment, the manager affiliates that we have that -- whose returns are really dependent on how they do on performance fees. That will have a lot of variability to it. But we do hope that we will do a little bit better than those numbers. ", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time I'll turn the call back over to the speakers for closing remarks. ", "Mike McGavick", "Great. Just very briefly. Today was an exciting day to announce the changes with respect to Paul and Greg and to start streamlining and making this place work even better. We're really excited about these changes. But I want to put it in a little more context. In a speech I remember from 2012, we talked about innovation and how you go about getting innovation in an existing industry.", "And we emphasized that you had to be willing to take your best minds and take them out of P&L process and put them on innovation or else you weren't going to get there. And the example I used them of a decision we felt very heroic about and very good about was taking Greg Hendrick out of his highly profitable job running our cat book in Bermuda and putting him on the strategy for the Company, the reinvention of this Company. We felt that was a great decision then and it has led to subsequent successes that give us great confidence in his role as the leader of all of P&C. ", "And you see us taking that playbook out again with respect to Paul and the opportunity to take one of the sharpest underwriting minds any of us have ever met and set him loose on bringing these maturing activities to greater impact throughout our book of business and into the future.", "When we have a confident and great set of hands like Greg to lead the resulting P&C operation and a mind like Paul's set loose on innovation, we see this as a day we will remember in future years as one of those moments when XL really took on the next level of opportunity. It's an exciting day for us. We look forward to the future. Thank you very much for the quality of the questions on the call. And good night. ", "Operator", "Thank you.

At this time I'd like to welcome everyone to the XL Group First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised this conference is being recorded.", "I would like to turn the call over to Abbe Goldstein, XL Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Abbe Goldstein", "Thank you, Shirley. And welcome the XL Group Limited's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Our call today is being simultaneously webcast at www.xlgroup.com. We posted to our of website several documents, including our earnings press release, our quarterly financial statement and presentation slides we\u2019ll refer to in our call. On our call today Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, will offer opening remarks. Pete Porrino, XL's Chief Financial Officer, will review our financial results, followed by Greg Hendrick, President of P&C who will review insurance and reinsurance segment results and market conditions. We will then open up the call for questions, which will also include Steve Robb Pete [indiscernible] as our CFO.", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain of the matters we\u2019ll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements, including any estimates on losses resulting from recent natural catastrophes are based on current plans, estimates and expectations, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. And a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them.", "Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors including those identified in our most recent reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K as well as other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of which they are made. And we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise.", "Our call today also includes non-GAAP financial measures including but not limited to operating net income, operating ROE measures that are based on operating net income and fully diluted tangible book value per share. Explanations and reconciliations of these measures to the comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings materials posted to our website and in the earnings release included as an exhibit to today's 8-K announcing our first quarter 2017 results.", "With that I'd like to turn the call over Mike.", "Mike McGavick", "Good evening and thank you for joining our call. Tonight I'll share some highlights of the first quarter and Pete will discuss the financials and Greg who has been in his role as President of P&C since the launch of our operating model at the beginning of the year will cover insurance and reinsurance for the quarter.", "Speaking of Pete, and it is sad for me to remind all of us, this will Pet\u2019s last quarter as CFO before he turns over the reins to Steve Robb and in order to introduce Steve further to you, he is with us here today and will join with us on the Q&A.", "Turning to the quarter itself, we are pleased to report a solid start to 2017. As you know and as we've been saying, we believe that the value proposition of XL Catlin is better and better understood in the insurance and reinsurance marketplaces. And this was why even in these tough conditions we've been able to show growth in the quarter.", "Similarly we've been saying that with our broader book of business we can improve our loss ratio through business mix and continued underwriting actions. Moreover we have observed that our broader diversification would enable us to absorb more significant events and withstand natural catastrophes in the current year.", "And we've said that this is the year when we would start to see the full impact of our expense savings. All of these improved features are present in this quarter. It's been at view combined with our underlying strengths that enabled us to show continued progress and is what has us off to this solid start. Of course, on the other side of the ledger as you're aware. Like many others our prior year development in the quarter was negatively impacted by the UK Ogden rate change.", "Looking at the numbers, our total P&C gross written premiums were $4.6 billion, up 6 % from the prior year quarter. Though in that comparison it is we're sharing with you that processing delays impacted premium in the first quarter of last year, which accounts for about 2 % of that growth.", "Our P&C accident your combined ratio excluding natural catastrophes was 89.5%, a improvement of 2.6 % versus the same quarter last year. On the same basis, insurance produced a 91.2% combined ratio for a 3.3 % improvement over Q1, 2016 and reinsurance was basically flat year-over-year at 86.5%.", "Needless to say we're proud of our underwriters and their ability to leverage our increased relevance and scale to find the right growth opportunities in what continues to be a tough rate environment. Underwriting discipline means picking your spots and working hard to find those opportunities just as much as it means saying no. That's a tricky balance. But when we think our teams are striking really well. Equally as important is our focus on continuous improvement and efficient operations and we saw our operating expenses come down 5.7 % in the quarter, excluding integration costs.", "Since you may not have heard us talk about continuous improvement externally before, think of it as a broad mindset we are driving into our culture, building from what we learned in the integration. We intend to find things little and big that can make every day better and we think this will help us grow our top line more than our expenses.", "By the way, as we approach the two year anniversary of the Catlin acquisition we will be done with integration costs next quarter. We view that process as largely complete and related items from here on will simply be business as usual and improvements in the normally XL Catlin seeking to improve over time. Relatedly, as integration comes to an end. There was a significant piece of recent news regarding Stephen Catlin and his decision to retire from his role as our Deputy Executive Chairman and from our board.", "As we announced, happily Stephen will be with us as an advisor, as an employee through the end of the year and an adviser beyond that, which will give plenty of time for us to recognize his remarkable career and his many contributions to this firm. For now I just want to say thank you to Stephen and note that our integration would never have been so successful if not for his selfless leadership throughout.", "In terms of capital allocation, we repurchased about $200 million in buybacks during the first quarter. At this point we reiterate that we expect to complete not less than $700 million in buybacks for all of 2017. We still view buybacks as one of the better uses of our capital and we'll act accordingly as long as the right conditions persist.", "Lastly on innovation and culture, as we discussed last year, we're very proud of the awards we received in 2016, particularly around product innovation and in the past quarter we introduced seven new products in areas that range from environmental to professional to aviation.", "Also we were very excited about the recent announcement that we'll be joining our partners at Oxbotica, the robotics unit spun out of Oxford University in leading the driven consortium of companies working to deploy a fleet of autonomous vehicles in the UK.", "We're the only insurer participating in that effort and we think it really speaks to our future focus culture and how we're working to understand new technology risk from things like autonomous cars, between these efforts and the investment partnerships we're building through XL innovate we intend to continue to be at the forefront of what our industry introduces.", "So in some, we are pleased to show further progress and we'll work hard to continue to do so. Insurance had a really solid quarter. Our reinsurance team continues to be disciplined and active participants in a tough market and we believe that if we are already benefiting from greater clarity and accountability brought about by OUR improved operating model. As we look at the rest of 2017, although industry headwinds surely remain, we are off to a solid start.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Pete.", "Pete Porrino", "Thanks, Mike. And good evening. It is hard for me to believe that this is my last earnings call as the CFO, but I'll get back to that in a few minutes. Along with Mike, I'm also pleased to report a solid first quarter. Our performance was largely driven by underlying improvement in our key insurance underwriting metrics.", "We had disciplined premium growth, as well as improvement in each of our key ratios, our accident year X cat loss ratio, our acquisition cost ratio and our operating expense ratio. Importantly our insurance accident year ex cat underwriting profit grew 80 % to $144 million.", "We've enhanced our earnings presentation in an effort to be responsive to some investor feedback and to better illustrate and explain our results. Although we will go through every slide on the call, we hope you'll find it useful.", "For example, on pages 6 and 7 you can see the breakdown of our quarterly operating income drivers. Our net income attributable to common shareholders was a $153 million compared to $22 million in the first quarter of last year.", "Operating earnings per share was $0.50 compared to $0.35, a 43 % increase. In addition to our strong insurance results other drivers included a positive increase in operating income, as well as pressure from greater catastrophe losses and adverse prior development attributable to the previously announced impact of the UK Ogden rate change.", "Our ROE was 5.6 for the quarter compared to a 0.7% last year. Our annualized operating ROE excluding ALCI integration cost and the seasonality of our preferred dividends was 7.7%. This annualized 7.7 % illustrated on the bottom left of page 6 includes the adverse Ogden related impact of approximately 260 basis points.", "As we continue to enhance efficiencies throughout the company, our operating expenses continue to improve decreasing 5.7 % compared to the prior year, excluding integration costs. Our integration costs for the quarter were $34 million or $0.13 per fully diluted share. We expect to be complete with integration expenses in the second quarter with an estimate of $30 million to 35 million in that quarter.", "As we said on the last quarterly call, we still expect operating expenses excluding integration cost to be towards the bottom of the range we've previously provided of $1.77 billion to $1.84 billion, assuming FX rates stay roughly as they are today.", "Our natural catastrophe losses net of re-instatement premiums for the first quarter were $96 billion or 3.8 loss ratio points for the quarter compared to $53 million or 2.2 loss ratio points in the same quarter in 2016.", "As indicated on slide 6, US catastrophe's were $33 million mostly related to US storms, international catastrophes were $64 million, it included Cyclone Debbie in Australia, wildfires in Chile and flooding in Peru. And Greg will go into more depth about cats in his remarks.", "As we've discussed in previous calls, during the first and third quarters are reserving processes based on our review of actual versus expected losses. Our semi-annual full actuarial review will be included in our results next quarter and we intend to provide our global loss triangle's in May.", "Prior to that devolvement resulting from the first quarter was an adverse $24 million or 0.9 loss ratio points in the quarter compared the net favourable development of $43 million of 1.8 loss ratio points to the same quarter in 2016. This reflects adverse development of $29 million from the reinsurance segment and $5 million favourable development from the Insurance segment. This quarter was of course affected by the $75 million Ogden charge which we preannounced back on March 1st.", "As you can see in the financial supplement, our operating effective tax rate excluding discrete items was 11.1% for the quarter in line with that rate for the first quarter and full year 2016. Fully diluted book value per share grew by $0.77 in the first quarter or 2 % to $241 and $0.10 resulting from earnings, as well as positive marks for our investment portfolio.", "Turning to the investment portfolio and as usual my comments will exclude the life funds withheld assets. Net investment income rose to $167 million compared to $164 million for the prior year first quarter.", "During the first quarter, our average new money rate was 2.1 % compared to 1.7 % in the first quarter of last year. And at the end of March the gross book yield of the fixed income portfolio was 2.4 % and the duration of the total investment portfolio remained stable at 3.4 years remaining slightly short of our liability duration benchmark. We anticipate the net investment income will continue to remain under pressure given the current interest rate environment.", "Net income from affiliates was $52 million for the quarter compared to net income of $8 million in the prior year first quarter, driven principally by hedge fund affiliates. Relative to the prior year quarter, we also had an increase in performance from our strategic operating affiliates, as well as strong results generated from investments within our value investing team. Unrealized net gains were $0.5 billion at the end of the quarter. The total return on investments was 1 % in the quarter in original currency.", "Lastly turning to our preferred dividends, I'd like you to refer to slide 14 to clarify how these will change in the coming quarters. Starting in the second quarter, the Series E and Catlin preferreds will change from fix to floating and also become callable. The Series D preferreds are already floating and callable. Although all of the preferreds will now be callable, it is not our intention to call any them.", "Also in the second quarter the timing of the declaration for the Series D and Series E preferreds will change to July a month later than their previously scheduled declarations in order to match declaration dates with actual dividend payment dates in the same quarter. The change in declaration is a modest positive earnings impact in the second quarter.", "Now for the hard part, it is with a heavy heart that this is my last earnings call as CFO at XL. The past 6 years have been the highlight of my career. The board leadership team, finance group and the entire XL Catlin family have been absolutely tremendous.", "Mike has been a mentor and will be a lifelong friend. I am both humbled by the experience and also proud of the team's accomplishments. I am glad to be sticking around on a part time basis or working on some key projects that a busy CFO just simply doesn't have time. I wish to focus and speaking of a busy CFO it is with enormous competence and pride that I hand the reins over to Steve Robb who has been my right hand at XL since the day I joined and is the perfect person to lead XL\u2019s finance function going forward.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg to discuss our underwriting results. I look forward to the Q&A at the end of the call, but I do plan on giving all of today's tough questions to Steve. Greg?", "Greg Hendrick", "Thanks, Pete. I'll start with a brief review of our underwriting segments, discuss our diversified portfolio how they are disciplined underwriting and continuous improvement efforts within our underwriting results and finish with an update on current market conditions. ", "Starting with underwriting segments. I'm pleased that we have gotten off to a solid start under our new operating model. The hard work of our colleagues to create XL Catlin over the last two years provide a strong foundation to build on this quarter and into the future.", "As you can see on page 8 of the earnings presentation, we operate property and casualty insurance and reinsurance segments. Our insurance segment roughly 70 % of our gross written premium is focused primarily on large - large corporate and middle market commercial risks across a broad spectrum of products provided globally.", "We operate insurance and three main business groups, Global Lines, International and North America. Our reinsurance segment, the remaining 30 % of our top line provides treaty and facultative reinsurance globally across five regions via 10 main product lines. Through the combination XL Catlin we have created market leading positions in specialty insurance, large corporate insurance and property catastrophe reinsurance.", "Turning to underwriting portfolio and expanding on Mike's observations, with a broad product suite and global reach, we are able to pull numerous levels - levers and remix our book as market conditions allow.", "As a reference page 9 of the earnings presentation contains a split in underwriting results between the two segments. In the insurance segment, gross written premiums increased year-over-year by 8.4 % when normalized for foreign exchange. Although roughly 40 % is growth was the result of premium process timing from the first quarter of last year.", "The underlying growth occurred across a number of our portfolios. We grew our international property and casualty books, as well as our North American construction and global risk management businesses.", "In global lines, we had material growth in fine art and specie, crisis management and political risk portfolios and a common theme across the segment was our ability to win business by being able to provide global program solutions to our multinational customers. These programs carry larger gross written premiums and drove some of the underlying growth.", "Meanwhile, we maintained underwriting discipline with reduced top line in our aerospace, US, E&S casualty and London wholesale businesses, where certain parts of these books have become overly competitive.", "Our net written premiums for the quarter were flat, relative to last year, as we continue to refine our ceded reinsurance strategy. The increase in ceded premiums attributed to almost entirely to the multi-year Galileo cat [ph] bond and the placement of a new casualty aggregate [ph] excess of loss fee. As these are excess of loss protections, the entire ceded written premium was recorded in the quarter.", "Turning to reinsurance, gross revenue in the quarter was up 7 % when normalized for foreign exchange. Roughly 3 % increase is due to the impact of reinstatement premiums and multi-year renewals. In addition, strong new business and increase shares with existing clients was partially offset by over 100 million of cancel business that did not meet our return threshold.", "We also have the ability to shift our book in reinsurance and in the quarter we grew our casualty and property risk free portfolios, while shrinking the property catastrophe book in the face of continued - continued albeit smaller rate decreases.", "Combined, our two segments provide us with a well diversified portfolio that is better able to withstand catastrophe loss activity like we saw this quarter. For the group, we incurred $96 million of cat losses, up from $54 million in the same quarter last year. The largest events in the quarter was Cyclone Debbie at $40 and the numerous US [indiscernible] which totalled thirty $33 million.", "This is an unsurprising amount given our global reach and a relatively active quarter on a global basis with at least $10 billion of global catastrophe losses, well above the first quarter industry median since 2000 of $6.6 billion.", "Shifting to underwriting discipline and continuous improvement. The insurance segment's accident quarter ex-cat combined ratio was 91.2%, compared to 95 % in the first quarter of 2016. This represents our best accident year ex-cat quarter in a decade.", "The segment produces an accident core ex-cat loss ratio of 60.8% which compares to 61.2% in the first quarter of 2016. The decrease is driven by a favourable impact from change and mix of business, as well as earning the benefit from continued underwriting actions executed during 2016. In particular, our continuous 1% loss ratio improvement initiative drove this reduction and we are hard at work on the actions for 2017.", "The expense ratio decreased 3.4 points to 30.4% in the first quarter. Two thirds of this decrease was driven by lower operating expenses and the impact of our expense synergies continue to earn through. The other third was largely due to lower acquisition costs, driven by change in business mix as we earned more in the quarter from businesses with lower acquisition costs.", "In reinsurance, the segment produced acceptable under performance in the calendar quarter combined ratio of 92.6 % compared with 84.3 % last year. The higher combined ratio for the quarter was driven almost entirely by the Ogden reserve charge, leading to overall reserve strength in the quarter of $29 million compared to a $32 million reserve release a year ago.", "As Pete mentioned, the reserve strengthening is due to the preannounced $75 million Ogden rate change impacting our UK Motor, general liability and employer\u2019s liability excess of loss reserves. Reserve releases, primarily in property lines of business offset the Ogden increase. We last strengthen reserves in our reinsurance segment in 2006.", "The reinsurance segment produced accident quarter core ex-cat loss ratio of 53 % which compares to 52.3 % in the first quarter of last year, driven primarily by a change in mix of business.", "The expense ratio decreased 0.4 points to 33.4% in the first quarter. This decrease is driven by lower operating expenses, [indiscernible] of our expense synergies s continue to earn through, was largely offset by two point increase in our acquisition costs. Half of this increase was due to a shift in product mix and half was due to timing of premium in our casualty and credit proportional portfolios.", "Moving on to market conditions, pricing in the insurance segment was down 1.7 % for the quarter, which is directly [ph] 2.8 % decrease for the full year of 2016. Our international business lines were up 1 % for the quarter, as modest rate increases in casualty were offset by modest rate decreases in property.", "Our North American business lines were down 1 % driven by our professional D&O book, which is down 3 %, partially offset by modest price increases in environmental, excess casualty and construction lines. Our global lines businesses continue to be most adversely impacted with rates down 3.5 % driven by continued competitive conditions in the energy, marine and aviation lines.", "And within the reinsurance segment, we continue operating a challenging training environment in most of our classes, but rate decreases continue to decelerate in most lines and regions. For the quarter rates across the segment were down to approximate 1 % and our global catastrophe portfolio was down 3 %, significantly less the 6 % decrease we experienced in 2016. And the remainder of the property treaty book rates were down just under 1 %. Overall our casualty business increased by 1 % and the remainder of our classes were down low single digits.", "In summary, we delivered a solid quarter of underwriting profitability, despite market conditions, slightly higher cat activity and the unfavourable Ogden prior development. We also achieved another quarter of organic growth, as our underwriting teams continue to do an excellent job of growing profitable business and finding new opportunities, while maintaining underwriting discipline.", "I\u2019ll now turn it back to Abbe.", "Abbe Goldstein", "Thanks, Greg. We are now ready to open up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Amit Kumar with Macquarie Capital. You may ask your question.", "Amit Kumar", "Thanks. And good evening and thanks Steve for all your help all these years. Just maybe a couple of questions. The first question goes back to the level of reserve releases in the insurance segment, they seemed a bit lighter than I guess what you\u2019ve seen in the past several quarters and I know that you sort of don't talk about forecasting that number, was there anything unusual this quarter versus the prior quarter in terms of the reserve release number for insurance.", "Greg Hendrick", "Yes, Amit. It\u2019s Greg. There are as you know the first and third quarters for us are A versus E quarters. And so there is \u2013 so very much driven by the short-tail on the business and my numbers are correct, there is about a $5 million dollar release in the quarter, there's nothing to read into that in terms of a trend overall. It's not a deep review quarter for us in the insurance segment or in the reinsurance.", "Amit Kumar", "Got it. That's helpful. I guess the other question was just going back to decide which shows to ROE and the trend line on that. You know, I think one of the questions we've asked and try to get more color on is, if you look at the ROE [indiscernible] I'm curious how should we think about this franchise going forward. I mean, ROE back in terms redeem [indiscernible] double-digit ROE or just based on the broader market challenges that still further away?", "Mike McGavick", "This is Mike. Look I've certainly been educated by our view that pounding the table over in these specific numbers is not all that helpful. But I'll make several points, one our goals are unchanged. And number two, the numbers in the quarter are what they are. But the trajectory is also what the trajectory is and our determination is absolutely unwavering. So we're feeling very good about what this quarter tells us, and very good about the trajectory as well.", "Amit Kumar", "If I could just sneak one more quickly on the capital management, I know last year I think we had a 700 number at the start, but we ended up with one, based on the noise in the Q1 and Ogden. Should we - how should we think about capital management versus earnings? Thanks.", "Mike McGavick", "Yes. This is Mike. So our approach to capital management remains unchanged. The first thing we do is analyze what we might need for future growth. The second thing we do is analyze if there is any opportunities to add anything to who we are that would make any sense, and Assuming the answer to those two are that we don't need the additional capital we've been earning. We look for efficient ways to return it to our shareholders, which as we've said earlier in my comments, buybacks remains our preferred approach.", "So at this point these issues that you've raised have nothing to do with how we think about buybacks for the rest of the year and that's why our indication for the balance of the year is unchanged as the minimum level that we would repurchase.", "Amit Kumar", "Got it. That's helpful. Thanks for the answers. And good luck with that future. And thanks Pete again.", "Pete Porrino", "Thank you, Amit.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question..", "Kai Pan", "Thank you and good evening. First, good luck to Pete and Stephen for your retirement and also congratulations to Steve for the new role. First question is on the cost savings side. Do you feel like you\u2019re down with it given the restructuring cost is finish. Are there additional opportunities you see on cost saving or the expense ratio improvements will be more leverage on your top line growth, rather than sort of saving on the absolute dollar amount?", "Mike McGavick", "Yes. This is Mike. First I'd remind you that the integration costs will feature in the next quarter as well and that'll be the last quarter that we\u2019ll show integration cost separately broken out after that, it will just be business as usual.", "I would say this we certainly believe that we will meet our commitments as we have said on expenses. There is no change in our view of our year's expenses and we've been quite clear about that. And we believe though that one of the things we learned through the integration process is that the harder we challenge ourselves the more we found.", "And as you know we upped the targets for integration savings quite substantially over the course of time. So rather than just come to the end of this process and declare victory and just kind of go back to however it was, our view is to internalize those lessons and challenge ourselves constantly to make it better, to do more best if we can to constantly be thinking in the frame of reference of a customer who expects that every year it's going to get better and every year it will be more fun. That's kind of the worldwide consumer mindset. I don't think insurance should absent itself from that challenge.", "That said, we don't know exactly how that will fall out, but we certainly know and then are willing to commit now that we believe we're able to - going to be able to grow top line far faster than we will grow expenses. Exactly how those targets will work out, we've been working on. We're doing a lot of work in that regard and I'd just say stay tuned. But the philosophy is no we're not stopping here, we're going to continue to constant look for ways to do better.", "Pete Porrino", "Yes. Kai, I believe that our platform is scalable and leverageable and as we grow we wouldn't expect expenses to keep in track and in fact should stay relatively low.", "Kai Pan", "Okay. That's great. Then the second question, we have heard a lot about the rising tension between brokers and then writers, especially in London market, given your one of the biggest players there, Mike, just wonder what's your thought on that?", "Mike McGavick", "Well, number one, we see brokers as providing an essential service in the entire continuum of value creation for our clients. So we have a lot of regard for our brokers and we work closely with them to try and serve our clients together. ", "We certainly observe as everyone does that insurance relative to the ultimate value to the customer, which let's say, the ultimate value of the customer is the pool of claims that are paid. We certainly believe that insurance needs to drive itself to become more efficient around that - say that balancing $0.30, $0.40, $0.50 whatever the line business is.", "That's got to be a drive across the ecosystem from our brokers to ourselves and there we're open to ideas, to try and find ways to lower those benefits - lower those costs and increase the benefits to the ultimate insured. I think that has to be a mindset for everyone. As a leader in London you know I see a lot of commentary out there, I would just say this, I know a lot of the comments have been around facilities. I would just say look, facilities have been around a long time they come in lots of different forms.", "And while we do not think that is likely to change at all. We have noted and are taking advantage of the fact that data and technology have vastly improved the ability of underwriters to judge these facilities better than it used to be the case and even saying that we should turn down more facilities than we right. But anyway look I've heard a lot of conversation about all this in the end. We all are going to have to think about how to add more value to clients.", "Kai Pan", "I appreciate that insight. Kind of squeezing one number question is that, well the sort of net premium declines 3 % is by the gross premiums up 6 % because of the cap on, I just wonder is a one off for this quarter going forward the growth in - growth in that will be more in line with historical?", "Greg Hendrick", "Yes, Kai. It\u2019s Greg. We should get back to a normal relative to last year's session of premium level. These are just two one off January 1 transaction, so we should we should get back to our normal run rate.", "Kai Pan", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.", "Josh Shanker", "Yes. Good evening, everyone. I was noticing in the by-line disclosure that you're shrinking your exposure to professional liability at primary level, but increasing it on a reinsurance level. I wondered if you can talk about the primary - professional liability market a little bit and what opportunities are causing that reallocation?", "Greg Hendrick", "Yes, Josh. It\u2019s Greg. It's not really a re-allocation percent. On the insurance side, it\u2019s a very competitive market as we've observed out there. We are particularly mindful of some of the portfolios that we've had, internationally that have been - that have been strong. So we've been re-underwriting some of our exposures there.", "On the reinsurance assume side there were some opportunities that we were able to surface, that are unrelated to what we do in our core professional book, particularly around smaller risks and a broader geographic scope than we have that in the insurance side. So it wasn't - it wasn't a case of taking down one and increasing the other, it was just - concurrently we saw in some of the large commercial space where we specialize a little less opportunity on the insurance side and in the smaller side of the business on the reinsurance side and a broader geographical scope. We saw an opportunity to write some more.", "Josh Shanker", "And so - I mean, given the \u2013that\u2019s a January 1 type renewal, we shouldn\u2019t expect that to have continued growth throughout the year, I would guess?", "Greg Hendrick", "That's right. Sorry, you shouldn\u2019t read across, those were - everything in reinsurance, there were a series of treaties in there that were one off of one, one. So we might have growth, but it wouldn't be right to read across the growth rate for the rest of the year for reinsurance.", "Josh Shanker", "I just want to know if you could walk through discrete tax items in the quarter and how would you think about going forward?", "Mike McGavick", "Sure. Thanks, Josh. In this quarter the discrete items were predominantly the release of risk provisions based on the conclusion of audits. There aren't any identified discrete items we would expect going forward, but those come about you know, as we close audit's and as we think about the macroeconomic environment going forward. But there's nothing that you should read into the discrete items in the first quarter.", "Josh Shanker", "Thank you. And I wish everyone the best of luck and all these good changes, you are good people and you all deserve the best.", "Mike McGavick", "Thanks, Josh.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open. You may ask your question.", "Meyer Shields", "Thanks. A number of your competitors are talking about increasing, I guess an increasingly adverse trial barn [ ph] I am wondering whether you\u2019re seeing that and whether that\u2019s affecting - whether that\u2019s built into the actual loss ratio for this year?", "Pete Porrino", "We constantly update our picks based on current activity. That's a regular and ordinary routine for us. And well there has been some uptick and you can note, it it's hard to tell whether that is a permanent change in judiciary or whether that is a - or a long-term change related to the cycle of appointees or presidents and all of that or whether we're seeing kind of a cultural shift given the burden that has been experienced by so many people across the country over this post great recession period.", "Either one of those would have some impact. So we factor that in absolutely. We continue to monitor very closely. We are encouraged of course by the - in terms of the business outlook for these kinds of issues by the recent appointment to the Supreme Court and its confirmation. And you know we all go from there. But any time you have a noticeable change we factored in.", "Meyer Shields", "Okay. That's helpful. I apologize for a - phrase the question. A couple of years ago you said that you were or maybe a year ago you said you were cautious about picking up business from AIG that went through its own issues because in the first round that business is likely to be significantly underpriced. So we have a point now where that book of business looks more attractive?", "Mike McGavick", "You know, I have just - generally speaking about any one competitor, but there have been competitors who are going through changes for sure. And when that happens I just observed that I know from my own work and way in the past when I was doing kind of turnaround restructuring kind of stuff, we were always shoving - you know we did things you can make decisions on right away stuff that's fast the enterprise, the best that you\u2019re performing. So by definition if you're not - if your other competitor with an organization going through that kind of change you have to be really, really careful about how you think about what comes on the street.", "That said, it's also true that if one really knows the marketplace and knows the kind of clients they want you can be a very focused and can really have an opportunity to write business that doesn't come into the market very often. So you just have to think very carefully about it. I would not say that for any competitor we would just say automatically because they wrote it [indiscernible] We write these pieces of business individually no question individually. All right, Greg.", "Greg Hendrick", "Yes. Thanks, Mike. I mean, I think, so two different thoughts, one on what's moving around the marketplace. Again like Mike, I don't talk about individual competitors. It's just not - it's just not worth it. We see a lot of commercial auto out in the US moving around. It's not an area where we're beginning right in a couple of spots, particularly in our large corporate risk management business where there's large client, self retention, so it's not a you know, very low retention, low deductible business.", "And we also see in worker's comp, where again, same thing we're not active on a standalone worker's comp basis. So the business that is broadly moving around is areas where we're not as active in a traditional basis.", "And the other thought is and I'm just back from RIMS [ph] and it's just - I would just emphasize, more the positive momentum that we have going in the marketplace. We met with over 500 clients over there and I can tell you in the first quarter our submission counts up from our major brokers.", "So we're getting more business. Our quote ratio is up. So we're getting more of the right business and our hit ratio is down. Now I know normally you'd want to see you hit raise you up in the right kind of market, but I'm very happy to have it down showing that we are just not out there getting business at any price, we're being very disciplined. So lots of support from brokers and clients, more business coming in the door, more of the right business coming in and some good pricing discipline by not hitting on the same here at a lower level than we have in the past.", "Meyer Shields", "Okay. That was very helpful. Thanks so much and Pete best of luck.", "Pete Porrino", "Thanks, Meyer.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. You may ask your question.", "Jay Cohen", "Thank you. Let me just echo Pete, best of luck. You've lived through some very, very interesting times at XL There is little Chinese curse about interesting times. But I think it's been pretty fruitful for everyone having you there. Just a small questions actually, reinsurance acquisition expense ratio did pop up you said, it seems about half of it was due to some timing issues. Is it fair then to look at like a 24 % number is a reasonable number to use going forward given some changes in business mix?", "Pete Porrino", "Yes. Yeah, we should be about a \u2013 we should be up about a point, year-over-year going forward.", "Jay Cohen", "That\u2019s great. And then corporate expense is excluding the integration expenses, did pop down from the run rate, I assume that's just realization of the cost savings. Anything unusual in that number, is that also a good starting point for this year?", "Pete Porrino", "I think it is a good starting point for this year. It is the realization of cost savings and in addition it's the normalization of projects. So as we \u2013 the complete projects and move them into business as usual certain of our projects may become a part of our operating expenses in the segments. So corporate becomes less and that that hopefully will be a trend over time.", "Jay Cohen", "Could that number come down more?", "Pete Porrino", "I think it will be relatively steady for the rest of the year, but we do expect to drive it down over the next several years.", "Jay Cohen", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Next question comes from Ian Gutterman with Balyasny. You may ask your question.", "Ian Gutterman", "Hi. Thank you. First for Pete, I was hoping for your [indiscernible] I apologize for it.", "Pete Porrino", "Well, there's always one in every crowd.", "Ian Gutterman", "First for you Steve, I think there was a mention about strategic affiliates having a strong quarter was that any one affiliate or is that broad based?", "Stephen Robb", "It was more balanced on one affiliate.", "Ian Gutterman", "Okay. I mean, and anything that suggests this wasn't a run rate or is just sort of above normal or?", "Stephen Robb", "I would say was slightly above normal, but nothing all that significant. And the investment - that affiliates would have been sort of below target that would have offset that.", "Ian Gutterman", "Got it. So was terrific, okay. I don't think \u2013 and maybe I missed on the commentary, but the tax rate in the quarter was a little lower is that right?", "Pete Porrino", "This is Pete. As see I mean, there was there was a discrete item in there that took it from the 11.1 down to where it ended up it, but those discrete come and go, the 11.1% is pretty consistent with what it's been for the last year or so. There is nothing that's happened in the quarter that would get us that our previous range of sort of 10% to 12 % is not a reasonable range going forward.", "Ian Gutterman", "Terrific, perfect. And then I think the only other one I had was, one thing I picked up in the 10-K that I probably been asked you about for at least time in a while is you have a very large valuation allowance that's actually grown over time and it's now over $300 million, a more than a dollar a share. That's a lot of potential book value if you can find a way to realize that. Can you talk about plans to work on that and monetize that and bring it into book value?", "Pete Porrino", "Sure. It grew in part in the last couple of years. It's primarily in the UK in relation to operating income in the UK just because of a history of those legal entities having not enough income. But it is - it doesn't expire, we expect to be able to use that over time.", "We also have carry-forwards that we have a provision against for capital losses in the US, that's largely associated with the credit crisis and we look at strategies all the time to try and utilize as much of that as possible.", "Ian Gutterman", "Got it. Are there any sort of specific milestones as far as you need to get to a certain number of years in a row of positive income or something like that that we should look forward to or is it little bit less predictable?", "Pete Porrino", "I think it's less predictable than that and it's specific to a couple of legal entities in the UK.", "Ian Gutterman", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. You may ask your question.", "Brian Meredith", "Hi, thanks. Couple of quick questions here. Just first one, curious Pete, any impact with this accounting change for share base compensation in the quarter and your tax rate or is that something, nothing, you don't have that, will you have that going forward at some point?", "Pete Porrino", "We don't expect that to be a material impact to us.", "Brian Meredith", "Got you. Perfect. Second question, I just want to follow up a little bit on the on the ceded you know in the quarter I understand that there were some cap on transactions. How much of the kind of change was cat bond versus other potential changes in your reinsurance program, this was a pretty substantial number. And what impact would that have had on your kind of expense ratios as well?", "Greg Hendrick", "Sure, Brian. So on the group level, at the group level it's about two thirds the cap on and one third the insurance casualty, excess reinsurance I talked about. In terms of earned impact, I don't think it should be very material around the corner - the cap on is a three year deal. So we're going to earn that premium over three years. I'm afraid I don't have that math in front of me, but...", "Brian Meredith", "That\u2019s fine.", "Pete Porrino", "And then I think Greg just to follow up on, the comment about the expense ratios, these are this is Pete. Those are both without big ceding commissions and so if anything they just increase the overall expense ratios of the company.", "Brian Meredith", "Got you. Excellent. And then just one quick last question, on the reinsurance side, Greg with respect to comments were you know, you said mix shift caused the higher underlying loss ratio, as well as the higher acquisition costs. Is there a strategic shift to go to maybe higher combined ratio, lower volatility type business in the reinsurance or is just happened to happen in the first quarter?", "Greg Hendrick", "What you were observing when I talked about on the call last quarter Brian when we wrote up one particular transaction and its impacted, now starting to earn through. So no it's not a broad strategy to shift the whole reinsurance segment to that kind of a profile, but certainly we did add that one transaction that has exactly what you described which is a lower return, but also very much lower volatility to the downside. So you're seeing that come through and what you see the pickup is on the operating expense going \u2013 operating expense ratio going down.", "Brian Meredith", "Got you. Excellent, And then also Pete, congratulations on your retirement and everything and thanks for all your help over the years. ", "Pete Porrino", "Thank you, Brian.", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Mike McGavick for closing remarks.", "Mike McGavick", "Great. Thank you. I know you all have a lot of work to do, so I'll be brief. First of all to all of our colleagues who are listening in and to those who will read these remarks later. Thank you for everything you've been doing. Let's keep it up. There's a lot more to do. Second, to Steve, not all of you know Steve as well as I do, I've been working with him consistently since I got to XL. He's been in the room for every important decision, I've been a part of around here and it's been central to their effective execution. You will learn over time that we couldn't have been better prepared for a transition that is - that is seamless in most respects. And so Steve welcome.", "And then finally to Pete, the reason it's not seamless in all respects is Pete, and I just want to make it clear that I wish for everyone on this call that they get to work in their lifetime in a close partnership someday as someone as smart, as humble, as fun and as devoted to doing the right thing as Pete is because it's a rare thing. So thanks everyone and have a great evening.", "Operator", "Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. We thank you all for participating.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the XL Group Limited Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. Please be advised, this conference is being recorded.", "I'd now like to turn the call over to Abbe Goldstein of XL's Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Abbe F. Goldstein - XL Group Ltd.", "Thank you. Welcome to the XL Group Limited second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Our call today is being simultaneously webcast at xlgroup.com. We've posted to our website several documents, including our earnings press release, our quarterly financial statement, and presentation slides we will refer to on our call.", "On our call today, Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, will offer opening remarks; Steve Robb, XL's CFO, will review our financial results; followed by Greg Hendrick, President of P&C, who will review the Insurance and Reinsurance segment results and market conditions. We will then open up the call for questions.", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain of the matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements, including any estimates on losses resulting from recent natural catastrophes, are based on current plans, estimates and expectations, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. And a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them.", "Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors including those identified in our most recent reports on Form 10-Q and 10-K, as well as other documents on file with the SEC, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of which they are made, and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statements in response to new information, future developments or otherwise.", "Our call today also includes non-GAAP financial measures including, but not limited to, operating net income, operating ROE measures that are based on operating net income, and fully diluted tangible book value per share. Explanations and reconciliations of these measures to the comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings materials posted to our website, and the earnings release included in an exhibit to today's Form 8-K announcing our second quarter 2000 (sic) [2017] result.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike.", "Michael S. McGavick - XL Group Ltd.", "Thank you, Abbe. Good afternoon and thank you for joining our call. Tonight, I'll share some highlights of the second quarter. Then Steve Robb, who has been in his new role as CFO since May 1, will review the financials. Greg will then cover insurance and reinsurance for the quarter. And we will conclude the call with Q&A.", "Turning to the second quarter, we are pleased to report solid overall results reflecting our continued focus on executing our strategy. All in, our commitment to disciplined underwriting and capturing efficiencies along with positive performance in our investment portfolio generated another quarter of earnings growth. We also took steps to proactively manage our capital.", "Looking at the numbers, our earnings per fully diluted share was $1.14 in the second quarter, compared to $0.15 in the second quarter of last year. And our operating EPS was $0.96 in the quarter, compared to $0.37 in the prior year quarter, representing our highest quarterly operating EPS since the end of 2014. Our total P&C gross written premiums were $3.6 billion, an increase of almost 2%, compared to the second quarter last year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.", "Our underwriting profit increased to $195 million, compared to $101 million in the second quarter of 2016. Our P&C combined ratios and loss ratios both improved, while reinsurance accident year ex-cat loss ratios ticked up in comparison to the same quarter last year, which Greg will discuss in more detail later in the call.", "Throughout the first half of the year, we like the progress we've made and feel good about our ability to continue to execute our strategy. At the same time, significant headwinds remain in the insurance and reinsurance marketplaces, as I'm sure you are all aware. There are inflationary and rising loss cost trends, and we and others are managing them. And as we see continuing rate deterioration broadly while, to be fair, some lines are seeing a flattening or even a slight increase.", "Given these challenges, we will continue to pull the same levers we've been pulling: Underwriting and portfolio management, continued expense and efficiency improvement, capital management and improvement through our strong culture and drive for innovation.", "First, in terms of underwriting and portfolio management. By the nature of our market presence and our continued discipline in picking our spots, insurance submissions are up 5% in the second quarter and 7% year-to-date when we adjust for certain re-underwriting and portfolio-tuning actions taking earlier in the year. Quote ratios remain up nearly 10% in the quarter and year-to-date, while our hit ratios remain around the same at 36%, consistent with the prior year. So, we continue to see more business and we continue to select the business we want, exactly what we had in mind when we created XL Catlin.", "Equally as important is our focus on continuous improvement and efficient operations, and we saw our operating expenses come down approximately 4% in the quarter, excluding integration costs and the benefit of foreign exchange. As we discussed previously, this is a greater degree of expense savings than anticipated post Catlin acquisition, attributable to both our leaders' determination to find every efficiency and the broad program of continuous improvement we've set in motion to remind every colleague that they play a role every day in making XL Catlin better.", "In terms of capital management, we repurchased $250 million of XL's stock during the second quarter. At this point, we reiterate that we expect to complete no less than $700 million in buybacks for all of 2017. We still view buybacks, even in our current stock price, as one of the better uses of our capital and we'll act accordingly as long as the right conditions persist.", "We also took steps in the quarter to enhance our balance sheet by essentially exchanging floating for fixed rate securities, benefiting from transaction economics and diversifying our fixed income investor base in Europe where we have significant operations. Steve will go into the details in his remarks.", "Lastly, on innovation and culture. We continue to push the pace of our ability to introduce new products to the market, while some of what we consider our most mature innovative businesses are hitting important milestones. For example, our North American construction unit introduced in 2010 with a unique vertical approach to its market reached $2 billion in gross written premiums over its seven years of operation and is one of our most profitable businesses. A tremendous achievement. The leader of that unit, Gary Kaplan, and his team deserve strong applause for what they've been able to accomplish. Construction risks are complex, and very few insurance carriers have the ability to address them in a similarly comprehensive way.", "In product innovation, we introduced 12 new products and services in the quarter. Greg will share some of the specific details on these. We have long seen our drive for innovation as it being equally about our reputation and our ability to think about the future on behalf of our clients, as it is a real remixing opportunity, pivoting an increasing percent of our portfolio towards better performing and more relevant businesses. We're seeing this played out now, and we are committed to pushing hard, getting the benefit of the foundation we've been laying this past several years.", "To sum it up, we see this as another solid quarter. We're pulling on the leverage we have, creating opportunities even in tough markets, headwinds persist and we are fully mindful of it, but we remain committed to fully delivering the value of the franchise we have built.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Steve.", "Stephen Robb - XL Group Ltd.", "Thanks, Mike. And good evening, everyone. I'm excited to be on the call with you all tonight in my new role and it's certainly nice to start with a solid quarter. Consistent with the first quarter, we have posted an earnings presentation in our website to accompany our prepared remarks.", "Our net income attributable to commons shareholders was $301.6 million, compared to $43.8 million in the second quarter of last year. Operating earnings per share were $0.96, compared to $0.37 a year ago. Improved earnings were driven by lower capacity losses and higher investment returns, partially offset by accident year underwriting results excluding cats and marginally lower levels of prior year development. Our year-to-date annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI integration costs, was 9% for the quarter and 5.8% for the prior year quarter.", "It's worth noting that our 2017 year-to-date ROE includes the negative impact of approximately 140 basis points from the first quarter Ogden rate change in the UK. Our underwriting profitability improved in the quarter compared to the second quarter of last year. Our P&C combined ratio decreased from 96% to 92.3%. However, excluding catastrophes and prior year development, P&C combined ratio increased by 1.7 points from 90.3% to 92% largely in the Reinsurance segment.", "Greg will discuss our underwriting performance by segment in more detail in a few minutes. But first, I'll provide some high level comments on catastrophe losses and prior year development.", "Our natural catastrophe losses net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums for the second quarter were $92.1 million or 3.7 loss ratio points, compared to $240 million or 9.8 loss ratio points in the same quarter of 2016. The breakdown of catastrophe losses by segment in the quarter was $79.4 million in insurance and $12.8 million in reinsurance.", "The breakdown by geography was $51.2 million of U.S. losses and $40.9 million related to international event. Just over half of the losses resulted from the development on late first quarter catastrophes, including Cyclone Debbie, floods in Peru and certain U.S. storms. It's worth noting that the second quarter of 2016 was significantly impacted by the Fort McMurray wildfire losses of almost $130 million.", "Turning to our prior year development. Our second quarter results reflect a full ground up valuation process and reserves. Prior year net development in the second quarter was a favorable $86.7 million or 3.5 loss ratio points, compared to a favorable development of $98.6 million or 3.9 loss ratio points in the same quarter of 2016. This reflects favorable development of $7 million in the Reinsurance segment and $17 million in the Insurance segment.", "Insurance releases were most significant in North America and were partially offset by strengthening in both Global and International Line. As we continue to enhance efficiencies throughout the Company, our operating expenses decreased by 9.5%, compared to the same quarter last year, which is a decrease of 4% if you exclude the impact of foreign exchange and integration costs.", "Integration costs for the quarter were $39.4 (sic) [$39.1] million, or $0.15 per diluted share. As expected, this will be our last quarter of integration expenses.", "For the full year 2017, we still anticipate operating expenses, excluding integration costs, to be at the bottom of our previous guidance of $1.77 billion to $1.84 billion, assuming FX rates stay roughly where they are today.", "Our operating effective tax rate, excluding discreet tax benefits, was 10.3% in the quarter and 6.4% when adjusted for discrete items. Year-to-date, our operating effective tax rate is 10.6%, excluding discrete tax benefits. And we still expect the full year tax rate to be in the range of 10% to 14%, as we previously discussed.", "Fully diluted book value per share at the end of the second quarter was $42.15, an increase of $1.05 or 2.6% from the end of March. This increase was driven by net income and positive marks on our invested asset.", "Turning to the investment portfolio. My comments will exclude the Life Funds Withheld Assets. Net investment income increased by $1 million to $177.2 million, compared to the prior year quarter, despite a decrease in the fixed income volume. Net investment income increased by $10 million, compared to the first quarter of 2017. These increases are attributable to opportunities in the corporate in structure (13:03) sectors, as well as higher short-term rates.", "During the second quarter, our average new money rate was 2.1%, compared to 1.7% in the second quarter of last year. And at the end of June, our gross book yield fixed income portfolio was unchanged at 2.4%. The duration of the total investment portfolio increased slightly to 3.5, just short of our liability-based duration \u2013 benchmark duration.", "Net income from affiliates was $73.5 million for the quarter, compared to $34.6 million in the prior year second quarter, driven mainly by the sale of one of our investment manager affiliates, as well as positive performance across all categories, in particular, private equity.", "Unrealized net gains were $600 million at the end of the quarter. And the total return from investments was 1% in the quarter in original currency.", "Turning to capital management. As Mike noted, during the quarter we repurchased six million shares of XL stock for $250 million at an average price of $41.87. We have now bought back $450 million in the first six months of the year at an average price of $40.70 and has $650 million remaining available for buybacks under our current repurchase authorization. We reiterate our previous guidance of anticipated repurchases no less than $700 million in 2017, as long as the right conditions remain. We do not seek to grow capital in this current condition.", "Lastly, we are pleased to have taken action to enhance our balance sheet in ways that are both strategically and economically beneficial. Specifically, at the beginning of July, we tendered $420 million of preferred shares across three classes, as well as some of our subordinated debt. To finance this transaction at the end of June, we issued \u20ac500 million of new subordinated debt. These transactions accomplished several key outcomes for us. We reduced our floating rate exposure at a good price, and took advantage of the market conditions in Europe by issuing bonds at 3.25% fixed for 10 years, locking in a natural euro hedge for our European subsidiaries and expanding our European fixed income investor base.", "In the third quarter, we expect to see a book value net gain reported through non-controlling interest as a result of securities purchased below their carrying value. For modeling purposes, we have provided a detailed schedule for you on our remaining preferreds and outstanding debt on slide 17 of our earnings presentation.", "Due to the timing overlap of the new debt issuance at the end of June and the tender offer completion in early July, our GAAP financial leverage of June 30 temporarily picked up as compared to the end of March. This overlap impact will largely self-correct in the third quarter when the impact of the tender is recorded.", "More details of our leverage amounts including pro forma figures can be found on slide 14. As we've indicated in the past, over time, we expect to move our leverage ratio lower towards the industry average. And in the near term, we will evaluate additional capital reliability management activities to address the small amount by which the proceeds from the debt offering exceeded the tender.", "Now, I'll turn it over to Greg to discuss the underwriting results in more detail.", "Gregory S. Hendrick - XL Group Ltd.", "Thanks, Steve.", "This evening I'll start with underlying discipline and portfolio management within our results, provide an update on product innovation, discuss our market presence, and finish with some comments on current market conditions.", "Starting with underwriting discipline and portfolio management, page 11 of the presentation contains our results by segment. The Insurance segment's accident quarter ex-cat combined ratio was 92.9%, compared to 92.6% in the second quarter of 2016; and 92.1% for the first half of 2017, compared to 93.8% for the first half of 2016. In the quarter, a slightly worse loss ratio was partially offset by an improved expense ratio.", "Insurance segment's recent accident quarter ex-cat loss ratio is 61.4% which compares to 60.8% in the second quarter of last year. This slight increase was driven primarily by attritional deterioration and a few lines resulting from our second quarter reserve review offset by a favorable loss experience in certain property lines.", "For the first half of the year, the ratio is 61.1% in line with last year as our loss ratio improvement actions completed during 2016, as well as further actions we're executing on in 2017, helped to offset rate and loss cost trends that Mike noted earlier.", "The underwriting expense ratio decreased 0.3 points in the prior year to 31.5% in the second quarter. We have slight uptick in acquisition costs due to lower profit-based commissions on certain ceded quota share contracts.", "For the first half of 2017, the underwriting expense ratio has decreased 1.8 points to 30.9%. Insurance reserve releases in the quarter totaled $17 million compared to a $33 million reserve release a year ago. These releases are primarily from reserves in our North American professional and excess casualty portfolios, partially offset by strengthening in our international financial lines, London wholesale property, and energy property classes.", "In Reinsurance, the segment produced strong underwriting performance, with the calendar quarter combined ratio of 83.8%, compared with 95.1% last year. The combined ratio improvement for the quarter resulted from higher accident year loss and expense ratios, which were more than offset by lower catastrophe loss activity. The Reinsurance segment produced an accident quarter ex-cat loss ratio of 59%, which compares to the 54.4% in the second quarter of 2016, driven predominantly by mix of business, unfavorable loss experience in short tail lines, and a large loss in our Asia Pacific facultative business.", "On a year-to-date basis, the accident year ex-cat loss ratio increased just 2.6 points to 56%. The underwriting expense ratio increased 0.8 points to 31.4% in the second quarter. This increase is driven by higher acquisition cost as a result of product mix change resulting in more proportional business which carries higher ceding commissions relative to excessive loss reinsurance.", "Reserve releases in the quarter totaled $70 million, compared to a $65 million reserve release a year ago. Reserve releases were primarily in short tail lines and, to a lesser extent, in casualty classes. Combined, our two segments provide us with a well-diversified portfolio that is better able to withstand catastrophe loss activity.", "In the second quarter, our Insurance segment had higher cat activity, partly due to adverse development on late-occurring first quarter events. Reinsurance, on the other hand, had very few catastrophes in the quarter. For the Group, we incurred $92 million of catastrophe losses, net of reinstatement premium, down from $240 million in the same quarter last year. The largest events in the quarter were once again numerous U.S. wind and hail events.", "Shifting to innovation. The second quarter was another strong quarter for new and expanded products and capabilities, as you can see on page 7 of the presentation. Some of the new product launches included an accident and health solution in United Kingdom which includes a wide range of support and response services, a Real Estate Environmental Protection solution in Asia Pacific to help property owners with environmental liabilities, as well as a new mergers and acquisitions insurance coverage, which include a suite of product to support deals in the global transactional risk market. We also increased our terrorism insurance coverage limits from $200 million to $250 million, and extended our global property insurance capacity by 25% to $500 million.", "Turning to our market presence. We have a broad product suite and extensive global reach. We're now fully mature in every line and geography. We are still able to find profitable growth in a difficult market environment, and our accident and health and transactional liability businesses are two good examples of new and growing capabilities.", "Page 12 of the presentation shows our largest growing and contracting businesses for the quarter. In the Insurance segment, gross written premiums, normalized for foreign exchange, increased year-over-year by 4.5% in the second quarter and by 6.5% in the first half of 2017. Our largest growing portfolios in the quarter include Political Risk, Global Risk Management, International Financial Lines, and U.S. Programs. Meanwhile, we maintained underwriting discipline in the most competitive markets, with reduced top line in Energy, Aerospace and London wholesale portfolios.", "Turning to Reinsurance. Gross written premiums for the quarter was down 4%. The decrease is due to a large international casualty quota share treaty in the prior year that did not renew and cancelled business that did not meet our return expectations. Offsetting these factors was our ability to take advantage of new business opportunities and increased shares with existing client. We continue to show the ability to shift our book of business during the quarter. We grew our property risk treaty portfolios while shrinking the property catastrophe book in the face of continued rate decreases, particularly during the June Florida renewal.", "Finally, turning to market conditions. Price in the Insurance segment was down 1.7% on a year-to-date basis. International business lines were up over 2% for the year as mid single-digit rate increases in casualty were offset by modest rate decreases in property. Our North America business lines are down 1.5%, driven by our professional D&O and U.S. program books, partially offset by modest price increases in Global Risk Management and excess casualty lines. Our global lines of businesses continue to be most adversely impacted, with rates down over 3% driven by continued competitive conditions in the Energy and, to a lesser extent, Marine and Aviation lines.", "In the Reinsurance segment, we continue to operate in a challenging trading environment in most of our classes, but rate decreases continue to decelerate in most lines and regions. Year-to-date rates across the segment were down approximately 1%, and our global catastrophe portfolio was down 3%, significantly less than 6% decrease we experienced in 2016. And the remainder of the property treaty book, rates were down under 1%. Our casualty business increased by 1% and the remainder of our classes were down low single-digits.", "In summary, we delivered another solid quarter of P&C underwriting profitability, and while our organic premium growth was slowed in the quarter, reflecting challenging market conditions, our underwriting teams continue to find new profitable opportunities while maintaining underwriting discipline.", "I'll now turn it back to Abbe.", "Abbe F. Goldstein - XL Group Ltd.", "Thanks, Greg. Shelia, we are ready to entertain questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.", "Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thank you, and good afternoon. So, first question is on the core underlying combined ratio on both Insurance and Reinsurance segment. On the insurance side, is there a further room for improvements given the current market condition? And on the reinsurance side, could you quantify the factors you mentioned in your prepared commentary in term of mix and unfavorable development, as well as the back losses in Asia Pacific?", "Michael S. McGavick - XL Group Ltd.", "On the \u2013 this is Mike, Kai. On the insurance side, again, I'd point to the accident year ex-cat loss ratio for the full six months this year versus last year. I mean \u2013 and noting, as Greg shared, that we did in our second quarter review of loss ratios have some upticks in a few lines. The fact that we had negative rate trend and a few lines worsening and came out roughly the same six months this year over six months last year means that the actions we're taking on the portfolio are fighting off that worsening.", "That's a very pleasing sign to us. And so, we don't see any reason to believe that we can't keep fighting. We've already said it won't be quarter-over-quarter but we can't keep fighting off those deleterious effects. And that, of course, allows the expense ratio improvements to expand margin. So, we see no reason to believe we can't continue to do that. It's just \u2013 it's very hard out there, but we're pleased with what we've demonstrated we can do.", "Reinsurance is a more complicated story. And there, I really believe that you should look more at the total result than quarter to quarter accident year ex-cat, which isn't as meaningful a measure as it is for interest. But I'll turn it over to Greg.", "Gregory S. Hendrick - XL Group Ltd.", "Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Kai, I think if you look at the accident year ex-cat, it's up 4.6% in the quarter. But let me step back a little bit and give you three thoughts. One, about how accident year ex-cat intersects with catastrophe in the Reinsurance business, which is what Mike just referred to. Second, look a little bit at this recent history of the accident year ex-cat loss ratio and reinsurance. And then third, directly answer your question and provide some of those drivers in a more quantified fashion.", "So, first, let me step back. Within the Reinsurance segment, exposure to both catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses are often underwritten in the same property treaty. This is particularly true when you're in per risk and quota share treaties in the short tail lines. And as a reminder, reinsurance, we do not record a catastrophe loss until the event is greater than $5 million to the segment.", "This is primarily a given that there's a difficulty identifying smaller cats both from an information lack from our clients and the quality and depth of the information we get on some of our participations. Because of this, we will have some catastrophe losses showing up in our accident year ex-cat loss ratio within the segment.", "In a quarter with relatively low identifiable cat activity, the accident year ex-cat loss ratio will be higher as some part of our loss ratio has not moved over to the catastrophe side. That's partly what you saw here in this quarter.", "A shift to the second part, the history, we went back to the second quarter 2015 and looked at our reinsurance accident year ex-cat loss ratio. We started with that quarter, Kai, because as you know, that's when the XL Catlin transaction closed. The quarters ranged from a low of just under 50% in the fourth quarter of 2016 to the high of 59% this quarter. But I can assure you there's no general trend line to be observed. Roughly, we bounce around between 50% and 57% and back to 50% and up to 55%, and there is no trend line in there. It's always dictated by partial interaction of cat and accident year ex-cat, but also some of the events that happen.", "So, let me give you the context for the quarter now, for the third topic. I refer to three main drivers in my remarks: Mix, unfavorable experience in our property treaty, and a large facultative loss. Each of these three accounted for roughly one quarter of the year-over-year increase. The remaining 25% was a number of small items, the largest of one being the beginning of the end finally of the impact from purchased accounting, which was a detriment this quarter over last quarter.", "So, let me give you a little more color on the three drivers. Mix of business is the only component that is likely to continue into subsequent quarters, and is driven mainly by the large multi-line quota share we wrote at the end of 2016.", "The second piece of unfavorable experience in the property treaty portfolio is mainly driven by a few mid-sized losses in the mid single-digit millions rather than a holistic underlying shift in frequency.", "And the third piece, the property facultative loss in the quarter was a result of fire loss at a pharmaceutical factory and is represented as a type of loss than can occur infrequently in our facultative business. Moreover, that business is one of our most profitable on a combined ratio basis.", "So, I think, Kai, you look at that, it's about a quarter of that increase in the year-over-year that we think is likely to continue into subsequent quarters. Obviously, it's the risk business and things can happen that can change that outlook, but that's what we see at the moment.", "Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "That's very comprehensive. My second question is on the expense side. So, now you completed the integration program. Will there be further expense savings coming down like in \u2013 we'll be looking out for 2018 and 2019?", "Michael S. McGavick - XL Group Ltd.", "We do have continuing plans, as we call it, continuous improvement. To say to ourselves, having unlocked as much benefit as we did through the transaction, we should never allow ourselves to see expenses taken for granted, but rather that we should always be looking for ways to lower our cost. So, I don't think \u2013 first of all, we've said as Steve said that we're going to be at the lower end of the range that we put out in our actual expense saves, so that will take us through this year. And as we begun our planning for next year, we're already insisting on continuing to improve.", "Stephen Robb - XL Group Ltd.", "Yeah, Kai. I mean, I think as we look forward, we're thinking less about the absolute reduction in expenses as an imperative and more about a relative reduction in expenses compared to the growth in earned our premium, such that we're expanding our operating leverage around expenses and still having some room to invest in our business and our future.", "Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "And so, like a top line growth is not as strong as you've expected, given the market conditions. So, do you have lever to actually making the dollar amounts \u2013 absolute dollar amounts of total expenses going down next year?", "Stephen Robb - XL Group Ltd.", "If that were the case, if we were unable to grow and afford growth in our expenses then that would \u2013 we would reduce our expenses, yeah.", "Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Well, thank you so much.", "Stephen Robb - XL Group Ltd.", "You bet, Kai.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.", "Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yeah. Thank you. Just an accounting item. Do you still have (30:36) the investment manager affiliates, does that go through the net income line or through the operating income line, and what's the EPS impact?", "Stephen Robb - XL Group Ltd.", "It's going through the operating income line, and the EPS impact would be \u2013 I'd have to get back to you on that, but the total value of the gain was approximately $27 million, so you can determine it from that.", "Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And I mean, should we expect that XL's currently in the process of harvesting some of the investments that was made for sellers as a one-off sort of a situation for the XL Group complex?", "Stephen Robb - XL Group Ltd.", "Well, I think of that gain certainly not as a run-rate gain. We have been decreasing certain of our affiliate positions over the last few quarters, but I wouldn't think of this as a run-rate or as a policy of selling off some of our manager or affiliate positions overall.", "Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "And tax rate it came in low, is 10% to 12% still an adequate guidance for the longer term?", "Stephen Robb - XL Group Ltd.", "It is, yes.", "Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America. You may ask your question.", "Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yeah. Just a question on the acquisition expense on the Insurance segment. That ticked up. You had given a reason, I wish you can go over that a little bit more. And is this the kind of number we should think going forward? So, this is insurance acquisition expense ratio?", "Gregory S. Hendrick - XL Group Ltd.", "Yeah, Jay. It's Greg. The acquisition ticked up, it's a couple of ceded quota share contracts, one of which covers a large proportion of the book. And at the first quarter results, we thought it would trigger \u2013 we believe it would trigger a profit commission. With the second quarter results, we don't think it will. So, it was a reversal. That's \u2013 I call it a bit of timing, but that's the one piece of it. And in the prior year, we had a profit commission pay on a particular line of business quota share that didn't pay this quarter. So, that's the main driver. I think the acquisition costs are in about the right place, if you look at the year-to-date number.", "Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "That's helpful. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ian Gutterman with Balyasny. Your line is open.", "Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP", "Hi. Thank you. I guess, a few numbers ones for you, Steve. The investment income, the P&C-only investment income, while it wasn't up that much year-over-year, it was up a decent amount sequentially. You did mention new money being up a bit. Is where we are a decent run rate at current new money yields because it sounds like portfolio yields kind of stabilized?", "Stephen Robb - XL Group Ltd.", "There was a little bit of adjustment in this quarter for some funds withheld, but I think in the $175 million to $177 million range is probably about right, maybe a little under $175 million.", "Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP", "Got it, okay. And then, I was going to ask for a little bit more follow-up on the affiliate that was sold. Can you just give us any sense, any color, on sort of what that investment was and maybe what the size of it was? Or just what does $27 million mean? That's sort of \u2013 I'm trying to find some context for it, I guess.", "Stephen Robb - XL Group Ltd.", "(34:00).", "Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP", "Maybe what the book value of the investment was? Is there any other color you can give us?", "Stephen Robb - XL Group Ltd.", "Yeah. The book value that we had was materially less than the second on the sale. It was less than $10 million that we had on our books, so you can triangulate as to where we got to. It was \u2013 so, it wasn't a material portion of our affiliate book and wasn't a material portion of our investment fund manager book either. But we think it was a nice gain and it was an asset that we thought it was the right time to sell.", "Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP", "Got it. That's what I wanted. So, is this one that you held for a long time or is this one of the more recent ones and that's why it was smaller?", "Stephen Robb - XL Group Ltd.", "In relative terms, it's one of the more recent ones. But as you know, we haven't been adding things in this portfolio for quite some time. So, it's a decade old.", "Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP", "Got it, okay. And then, Mike, I was hoping if you can remind me a little bit, or Greg \u2013 either one \u2013 remind me a little bit about how you manage your cyber risk. I believe you have some recent hires area growing, just sort of how you manage limits, tail scenarios, things like that, in that book in light of the RDS-like analysis that (35:18) through recently?", "Michael S. McGavick - XL Group Ltd.", "Right. So, we \u2013 I'll turn it to Greg very quickly, but I would emphasize this. We keep it at very low limits per risk, we manage our sector exposures as well as the individual risks. And this is a very broad and diversified book, and that makes me very comfortable with what we've got going on there. Greg?", "Gregory S. Hendrick - XL Group Ltd.", "Yeah. But we run different but similar RDS scenarios to what you've seen published recently. We run it through the entire book, so the growth you're seeing is in what I would call the more identifiable, more quantifiable pieces of the exposure. It's effectively, as you know, in the United States, in Canada, it's data \u2013 recovery of data. That personal data has been hacked and you're putting people's credit back together and you're monitoring that over a period of time. And so, it's not business interruption, it's not property damage.", "Clearly, as these reports have identified, the bigger pieces of the exposure are more difficult to quantify in our traditional property and liability coverage. We do go to that exercise. As Mike noted, it's not a just a rule of thumb off a bunch of premium. It's looking at the book, looking at limit sizes, looking at the forms where we think we have coverage, where we don't have coverage, and quantifying that across the entirety of the book, insurance and reinsurance.", "Clearly, one of the big discussions after a very large event will be what was excluded and what wasn't. We believe, as we look through these policies, that we have good exclusions on there. Clearly, that will end up being tried in a court of law and there is variability in that outcome where those cases to happen.", "Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP", "That's kind of what I wanted to follow up on. I guess what caught my eye reading it was \u2013 doing this off the top of my head, but I believe it was about a $50 billion economic and only $8 billion insured. And it felt like maybe there's a lot of room for some surprises on, as you say, if that case goes the wrong way. How much could that $8 billion go to $25 billion? And how significant is the potential \u2013 I'm thinking about just what happened obviously in \u2013 with back to 9/11 with terror that we \u2013 terror and things like that. How much worse can that be or did you feel that \u2013 I guess, what I'm trying to ask is did you feel that the report was reasonably consistent with how you guys view it or did you feel that maybe it was underestimating the potential for insured loss?", "Michael S. McGavick - XL Group Ltd.", "A couple of things. First, in one way, your question is impossible to answer because the truth is when the courts interpret coverage to exist when we've never intended it, it's very hard to know exactly in what way they'll do it. Will they do it over time or they do it retroactively? There's so many questions about what they'll do that we would be shooting at a dartboard.", "Our own RDS scenarios, and we have done Black Swan analyses of these exact kinds of events. They clearly indicate, as you've already observed, that the exposures in the court's reinterpreting contracts not so much in what we're writing today, which is one of the reasons why the way we're approaching it gives me such comfort.", "The other thing that gives me comfort is, as the marketplace for standalone cyber increases, it makes clear the explicit nature of the individual contract and our rejection of the idea that is included in the standard contract, which we do not believe it is at the very existence an uptake of the standalone policies, an important element in how this market protects itself against misinterpretation of our historic intent.", "Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP", "Got it. I'm sure \u2013 I have more questions I'm about saving for a time when we have more time to talk. Thank you.", "Michael S. McGavick - XL Group Ltd.", "Sure.", "Abbe F. Goldstein - XL Group Ltd.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Peter Troisi with Barclays. You may ask your question.", "Peter Troisi - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. Thank you. I appreciate the disclosure on capital management in the presentation. And you show on page 14 in there a leverage of 29.5% and you said you anticipate reducing that metric. So, can you just give a sense for what your leverage target is? And then I have a follow-up to that.", "Stephen Robb - XL Group Ltd.", "Yeah. We've said that over the medium term, we'd like to get down to the peer medium leverage level, which is around 25%. That won't happen overnight, but we intend over the next few years to directionally move that way.", "Peter Troisi - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Great. So, 25% measured in the same way that you measure it in the presentation?", "Stephen Robb - XL Group Ltd.", "Yeah.", "Peter Troisi - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Okay. Great. And then just one other. The liability management that, Steve, you referenced. Would you anticipate prioritizing hybrids and preferreds there or is it \u2013 or versus senior? I know you've said it would be small, but I'm just trying to get a sense.", "Stephen Robb - XL Group Ltd.", "No. I don't think we would necessarily look at the hybrids and preferreds ahead. We obviously have the 2018s coming up and we have a number of high coupon seniors. We haven't concluded on what we'll do. And the difference between what we received and what we are able to tender for is only about $100 million. So, we will work on that over the rest of the year. But I wouldn't say that we will necessarily target the hybrid.", "Peter Troisi - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful color. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.", "Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay. Thanks. So, I just had one follow-up. On the 61.4% in the Insurance segment, just looking to drill down on what exactly you found in the reserve review that made that tick up, and what was the order of magnitude on the 61.4% from the reserve review conclusions?", "Gregory S. Hendrick - XL Group Ltd.", "Sure, Ryan. Thanks. It was \u2013 primarily the change in the current accident year pick was in the order of magnitude of around $25 million, primarily in our casualty E&S in North America, our international financial lines and in particular our management liability part of that portfolio, and a little bit in our property book in London wholesale market. Those were the main drivers and that's about the magnitude.", "Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "And the order of magnitude, I guess, over the remainder of the year. The $25 million capture all four quarters, or is that just the first and the second?", "Gregory S. Hendrick - XL Group Ltd.", "That captured the year-to-date. There are activities going on in both those areas \u2013 all three of those areas, that we will see how they play out in terms of improving the underwriting, that may offset some of those increases in the second half of the year. We'll just have to see how they play out and how successful we are predominantly in that management liability line within international bench lines and the ability to get significant rate year-over-year.", "Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Thanks so much.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. You may ask your question.", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Thanks. I'm going to stay in the same realm. (42:54) the impact of first quarter catastrophes that bled into the second quarter insurance accident year ex-cat loss ratio?", "Gregory S. Hendrick - XL Group Ltd.", "In insurance \u2013 this is Greg. In insurance, zero. The only intersection of cat losses of accident year ex-cat is in the Reinsurance segment. And...", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Oh, okay. I'm sorry.", "Gregory S. Hendrick - XL Group Ltd.", "Yeah. In insurance, we capture all of our cats from first off.", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Okay. Let me ask that on reinsurance then.", "Gregory S. Hendrick - XL Group Ltd.", "Sure. On reinsurance, I think it was about $5 million or $7 million roughly.", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Okay. And could we get the run rate of the income, with the annual income from the affiliate that was sold?", "Stephen Robb - XL Group Ltd.", "The affiliate that was sold, the run rate would have been very little, less than $2 million a year.", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Oh, fantastic. Okay. Great. Thanks very much.", "Gregory S. Hendrick - XL Group Ltd.", "And they are \u2013 sorry, but before we move to the next question, it's \u2013 the actual number is $13 million of reinsurance. I was thinking of just for one particular event. The $13 million was the total in the second quarter in reinsurance from cat development from prior quarters.", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Brian Meredith with UBS. You may ask your question.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC", "Yes, thanks. Mike, I'm just curious. Your comments about loss trend and starting to see that escalate a little bit, a little bit concerned. Is that a change kind of from what you've been thinking recently or is there something that kind of triggered that?", "Michael S. McGavick - XL Group Ltd.", "No. I mean, we have \u2013 I think, if you look over the last several years, obviously, loss cost trends have been extraordinarily benign. And our view is that we're starting to see some signs of movement. I don't want to be overly alarmist. Don't get me wrong. But we do see \u2013 we obviously have seen it and I have felt, for example, we've seen it sometimes in the \u2013 in some of the casualty classes, and it's got our attention. But it's too early to say it's going to continue and grow, but we have seen some incipient signs, we've heard comments from others that suggest they are too, and so we're paying closer attention to it as one of the things we have to overcome in this soft part of the market.", "Gregory S. Hendrick - XL Group Ltd.", "This is Greg, Thanks. Brian, if I could just add a little bit. It's a very, very diverse portfolio, right? So, it gives us a bit of a hedge against any one particular area spiking up. And just real quickly to add to what Mike said, on the property side, short tail line side of the business, it's reflected in our premiums in terms of the exposure-based drawings, so view that as kind of a wash in terms of the loss ratio impact.", "In casualty, we're seeing kind of mid single-digits, slightly higher in the U.S., slightly lower outside the U.S. I know a couple of high points that I'll give you and I'll let you ask a follow-on if you want, but we did a lot of press around trends impact in D&O in the U.S. We view a lot of that. There's a lot of noise, a lot more nuisance, less likely to come to fruition claims there. And as Mike just referred to you, on the D&O side here, we do see a little more of a shift there that's more U.S.-style litigation including class action litigation being allowed in by the courts than before. Again, I would stress, it's not a big wave, but certainly something we're watching and paying attention to.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. And just a follow-up. I'm just curious, the big growth in the quarter, it was like the professional lines been kind of highlighted, International Financial, I assume that's where it was coming from. What was that with the attractiveness of that business right now?", "Gregory S. Hendrick - XL Group Ltd.", "Yes. The International Financial Lines is made of up of three major portfolios, professional indemnity which would be lawyers and architects and that kind of business; what's called financial institutions which is banks and related; and then management liability. And so, where we see this impact coming in is particularly on U.S.-listed \u2013 comings of U.S.-listed or U.S. exposures in the management liability line and very, very large accounts management liability line.", "The growth you're seeing is we've been on a drive for a while in that business to reduce our limits that we've been successful at and write a broader spread of risks, which come in that professional indemnity and sometimes in that financial institutions area. And so, you're seeing the growth coming out of those areas as opposed to in the management liability area, which has been the part causing that problem.", "However, underneath that, on the smaller risk of management liability where there are more domestic exposures, we are growing there as well and trying to get that diversification. So, it's one particular part of the book being impacted, but growing the other parts to get better spread.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.", "Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hey, just a quick follow-up. On the share buybacks, you have done $450 million so far. And the $700 million only have like $250 million left, like the remaining. Does it sort of imply that the pace of buyback will be materially slower in the second half?", "Michael S. McGavick - XL Group Ltd.", "Well, all we've got to do is to reiterate the guidance we've given all along. There would be a minimum, a floor if you will, of $700 million, as long as conditions persist as they are. Certainly, we're not \u2013 we don't know exactly what we'll do yet this year, but we're monitoring closely. And that's about as much as we can say.", "Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. The other way to think about it is that your total payout between buyback and dividends, you said you were not looking to grow your capital base at the current marketing environment. Would that imply that potential 100% payout ratio?", "Michael S. McGavick - XL Group Ltd.", "Yes.", "Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Great. Thank you so much.", "Michael S. McGavick - XL Group Ltd.", "No problem.", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Mike McGavick for closing remarks.", "Michael S. McGavick - XL Group Ltd.", "Look, we appreciate the questions and the thoughtfulness of them. We know that because of the stock exchange's requirements, some of the materials got to you a little later compared to the call. We apologize for the way that made you work a little harder. We apologize for that. And I appreciate particularly the ability to dive in on where the loss ratio is going because I think if you look at headlines, it was easy to not understand that the Insurance segment continues to deliver in the way that it should and the reinsurance movements are really kind of unique to its business model and are being handled in a way that doesn't suggest any real trend and in fact is in line with the way we've managed that book as we go along forever, and that's been a very profitable book.", "So, you can take from that, we're very pleased with the way this quarter has ended. We're pleased to be continuing to be able to deliver even in this difficult market, and we're going to keep pulling all those levers as hard as we can.", "Thank you very much for your time.", "Operator", "Thank you.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the XL Group Ltd Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Earnings Call. Please be advised that this conference is being recorded.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Abbe Goldstein of XL's Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Abbe Goldstein", "Thank you. Welcome to XL Group's fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Our call today is being simultaneously webcast at xlgroup.com. We've posted to our Web site several documents, including our earnings press release, our quarterly financial statements and presentation slides we will refer to on the call.", "On our call today, Mike McGavick, XL's CEO, will offer opening remarks; Steve Robb, our CFO, will review our financial results; followed by Greg Hendrick, President of P&C, who will review the Insurance and Reinsurance segment results and market conditions. We will then open-up the call for questions.", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain of the matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements, including any estimates on losses resulting from recent natural catastrophes, are based on current plans, estimates and expectations, all of which involve risk and uncertainty, and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them.", "Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our most recent reports on Form 10-Q and 10-K as well as other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statements in response to new information, future developments or otherwise.", "Our call today also includes non-GAAP financial measures including, but not limited to, operating net income, operating ROE measures that are based on operating net income and fully diluted tangible book value per share. Explanations and reconciliations of these measures to comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings materials posted to our Web site and the earnings release included as an exhibit to today's Form 8-K announcing our fourth quarter 2017 results.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike.", "Michael McGavick", "Good evening, and thank you for joining our call to discuss XL's fourth quarter and full-year 2017. First, I will start by giving you my perspective on the quarter and the year end, and why we feel positive about where we\u2019re going, particularly with the market conditions that we\u2019re seeing. Then Steve will provide more information on the results, and Greg will discuss our P&C operations. And then, of course, we'll take your questions.", "2017 and to a good degree the fourth quarter on its own were obviously characterized by severe natural catastrophes, and our results reflect these severe losses. That said, we feel quite positive about what\u2019s ahead across four important dimensions. First, the fact that we came through these events was surplus capital enabling us to compete forward in the market. Second, what the 2017 ex-cat results say about the future contribution of underwriting income to the operating earnings.", "Third, the many signs of our growing market leadership. And finally, fourth and perhaps most important, what we learn from the market through these events and how it aligns with the strategic journey we have been on especially in terms of the pricing now available in the insurance and reinsurance marketplace.", "First, in terms of capital. Going into 2017, we carried a significant capital buffer, which served this purpose and allowed us to absorb these significant losses. As we start 2018, we continue to have a solid capital position as measured by our internal regulatory and rating agency models. And as we said on our last call, we did pause our buyback program following the third quarter cats.", "We have no immediate plans to resume it, though we will continue to evaluate this as the year and the markets develop. This decision serves several purposes including building and even greater buffer and keeping capital flexibility to respond to the still developing market opportunities.", "Second, the underlying year. On an ex cat basis, we feel good about the otherwise tough year. For example, both the fourth quarter and the full-year insurance accident year ex cat combined ratio and loss ratio were better than in the prior year periods. And their accident year ex cat P&C combined ratio was 90.2% for 2017, just better than we were a year ago in this challenging market. Our reinsurance accident year ex cat combined ratio increased year-over-year in line with planned mix changes as Greg will discuss. Taken together, these are good underlying ex cat results.", "Third, in terms of market relevance, the relationships with our clients and our broker partners have remained steadfast without exception. For the fourth quarter, P&C GWP grew by 18% over fourth quarter 2016. For 2017, our GWP of $14.8 billion is an 8% increase over 2016, and we continue to see more risks and select the risk we want. Forexample, insurance submissions were up 5% across the board in 2017, when adjusting for the underwriting actions we took during the year. At the same time, our bound percentage decreased as we continued to exercise pricing discipline. This trend continued in the fourth quarter and we saw no change to our momentum at January 1.", "There are two other indicators of our stronger market position. We hear consistent feedback that we are at the early and firm edge of pushing for appropriate pricing. Our reputation for technical and non-reactionary pricing serves us very well here. We also think it is a reflection of having a very flat organization with localized leadership deeply expert in their individual markets. This mix -- this makes us respected, knowledgeable, and fast.", "And the second indicator is the continuing awards we are receiving demonstrating our leadership and client excellence and in product development. For example, for the second straight year, highest customer satisfaction among large commercial insurers in North America from J.D. Power, number one in the London market as measured by Gracechurch, and first place in and Advisen's Innovation Index amongst other recognitions.", "Finally, fourth and most importantly, the several aspects regarding the cats and the market's reaction to them. As for our own reinsurance protections, there are always learnings from every active storm season about the effectiveness of one's protections and we've acted wherever we saw opportunities for improvement. We also observed from the market's response to these events how to reshape our earnings engine to the current opportunities.", "The strategic flexibility to do so comes from the long journey we have been on to diversify our earnings both by product and geography. At this point in that journey, it is clear that reducing meaningfully our volatility in the cat space, while maintaining and monetizing in new ways the market position and high-quality customer base we've built these many years is the right thing to do.", "We have been doing this through our ceded programs in both traditional reinsurance and even more so with long-standing alternative capital partners. You'll see from our actions in the fourth quarter and at 1/1 that we\u2019ve made good strides and we're not done. To be blunt, the more efficient cost of capital has allowed us to do so on quite attractive terms.", "At the same time, the rate reaction in the market validates the greater emphasis we have been placing on the primary marketplace and on Lloyd's. While Greg will discuss rate further in a moment, having coming through the first round of renewals, we're seeing more or less what we said we expected would occur in our Q3 call broadly improving conditions of around 3.5% rate gain in insurance and around 5% reinsurance overall with loss affected accounts seeing double-digit strengthening.", "A couple of points on this are worth emphasizing here. First, it\u2019s early in this process. At this point, we've only seen the January renewals which are important, but don't fully reflect current conditions. For example, there were multiyear contracts in place that haven't yet been touched and renewals which occurred early in Q4 before storm effects were fully known. There's still a lot of premium to come, including the bulk of the loss affected accounts which will give us more information and more opportunities.", "Second, as I said, we believe this is the start of the slow turn, while each line will react differently, but the aggregate should continue to point toward more consistent and more sustainable rate levels. This broader market turn across most property, casualty, and specialty classes fit well with our diversified product offering.", "And three, in a market transition like this as mentioned a moment ago, we feel that our flat organizational structure works to our advantage. Our underwriters get the message quickly and that flows directly to our clients and brokers quickly. We've seen evidence that as other organizations underwriting action begin to match their tough words at the top, the market overall strengthens its determination to be paid fairly for the risk that we assume.", "In sum, as regards to rate -- as regards rate, it is early but we like what we are seeing that matches us well and allows us to accelerate our strategic journey as we shift our profit engine into higher gear. So all in, a tough year. We learned a great deal and we're taking action to make changes where we think it's needed. But it was also a year where our colleagues and clients remain steadfast and where we produced a solid underlying result albeit overshadowed by the significant catastrophe losses.", "As we look at our industry, we feel we are very well positioned for what comes next.", "With that, I will turn it over to Steve.", "Stephen Robb", "Thanks, Mike, and good evening. We\u2019ve expanded our earnings presentation again this quarter as part of our ongoing effort to enhance disclosures. Financial results in the fourth quarter and full-year of 2017 were impacted by significant catastrophes. But excluding these events, we are pleased with the further progress we saw in our growing and diversified underlying operations and the continued strength of our balance sheet.", "Net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $29 million compared to $305 million in the same period last year or $0.11 and $1.12 per fully diluted share, respectively. For the same period, operating earnings were $116 million compared to $128 million or $0.45 compared to $0.47 per fully diluted share.", "Earnings in the quarter were primarily driven by fourth quarter net catastrophe losses as previously disclosed. These impacts were partially offset by lower operating expenses and higher net investment income. Net income was also impacted by $101 million one-time tax charge related to the revaluation of our net deferred tax asset as a result of the reduced U.S corporate income tax rate enacted as a part of U.S tax reform.", "Operating ROE, excluding AOCI and integration costs, was negative 4.8% for 2017 compared to positive 6.2% for 2016. While catastrophe losses in the second half of year clearly impacted overall returns we believe that earnings in the first half of the year signaled a growing earnings power we can deliver.", "Turning to the fourth quarter catastrophes. Consistent with our preannouncement, our total pre-tax net catastrophe losses in the fourth quarter were $315 million or 11.5 loss ratio points, resulting primarily from wildfires in California. We\u2019ve provided detailed breakdown of the gross and net cat losses in the fourth quarter and the full-year on Slide 9 in our earnings presentation.", "The breakdown of net cat losses by segment in the quarter was approximately 63% insurance and 37% reinsurance. Overall, for the full-year, our net catastrophe losses were approximately $2 billion stood almost evenly between insurance and reinsurance. And the break down by the year -- break down for the year by geography was approximately 55% related to mainland U.S., 33% in the Caribbean, and 12% related to other international events.", "The fourth quarter is a ground up valuation quarter for us, as it relates to prior year development or PYD. We had favorable PYD of $54 million in the fourth quarter or 2 loss ratio points compared to favorable development of $106 million or 4.3 loss ratio points in the same quarter of 2016. This reflects favorable development of $11 million from the insurance segment and $43 million from the reinsurance segment.", "Development in the quarter was primarily driven by releases in North American insurance and reinsurance casualty, partially offset by additional strengthening in international professional and London wholesale property. For the full-year, development was favorable $148 million, split $42 million from insurance and $106 million from reinsurance or 1.4 loss ratio points compared to $302 million or 3.1 loss ratio points in the prior year. It's worth noting that 2017 includes adverse development related to the Ogden rate change in the U.K.", "As Mike noted, we continue to take a thoughtful look at our overall risk return profile and specifically our ceded reinsurance program. While we remain confident in our general strategy and the programs core components, there are always lessons to be learned and we've taken meaningful steps to enhance our protections which Greg will detail and which reduced our pro forma catastrophe exposures as illustrated on Slides 15 and 16.", "We believe these reductions at exposures are aligned with the market conditions we're seeing in early 2018. Overall, we anticipate lower worldwide aggregate exposures in 2018 compared to '17 on both an absolute basis and relative to our capital position. Throughout the year, we will continue to refine our coverages balancing protection in economics.", "Operating expenses were $407 million in the quarter, a 21% or $110 million favorable comparison to the prior year quarter. The improvement was driven by the absence of integration costs during the current quarter compared to $59 million in the prior year and the reduction to the variable compensation costs associated with the catastrophe losses in the quarter.", "For the full-year of 2017 operating expenses excluding integration costs were $1.68 billion, which were below the low end of our previous guidance due to primarily to the impact of catastrophe losses on variable compensation. For 2018, we expect operating expenses to be in the range of $1.75 million to $1.85 billion. This of course is at normalized variable compensation levels and will not have any integration costs.", "It's expected that any increase in expenses will be a fraction of business growth, thereby continuing to drive operating expense leverage. During the quarter, we recognized income tax charges of $77 million. This charge was largely driven by the $101 million one-time DTA right down I mentioned earlier. Also included in the tax charge was the remaining tax benefit that relates to our third quarter losses.", "As I mentioned in our last earnings call, the net tax benefit associated with the third quarter cat losses must be recognized over the second half of 2017 and not exclusively in the third quarter. Our operating effective tax rate excluding discrete items was negative .5% for the quarter, a negative .7% for the year and those compared to 16.6% in the prior year quarter and 10.7% in the prior year.", "Looking ahead based on our preliminary assessment and consistent with our previous disclosure, we do not currently expect U.S tax reform to have a material impact on our average global effective tax rate.", "Turning to investment portfolio and as usual my comments will exclude the Life Funds Withheld Assets. Net investment income was $186 million compared to $161 million in the prior year fourth quarter. This increase was primarily due to higher reinvestment rates in the quarter, from active sector rotation and portfolio management activities.", "During the fourth quarter, our average new money rate was 2.3% compared to 2% in the fourth quarter of last year and 2.6% in the third quarter of this year. The new money rate continue to be positively influenced by targeted rebalancing of the fixed income portfolio. The gross book yield of fixed income portfolio remain stable quarter-over-quarter at 2.6% and the duration of the total investment portfolio decreased marginally to 3.6 years due to an increase in cash and short-term investments.", "Net income from affiliates was $15 million for the quarter compared to $48 billion for the prior quarter, primarily due to lower hedge fund performance. As we\u2019ve mentioned in the past, our hedge fund portfolio is less correlated to equity markets as we've typically taken while only equity risk. On a more passive basis and other parts of our investment portfolio, the fourth quarter of 2016 also benefited from a one-time rebalancing gain.", "Net unrealized gains were $565 million at the end of the quarter and the total mark-to-market return from the investment portfolio was .5% for the quarter and original currency, and 3.4% for the full-year.", "Turning to capital. On Slides 13 and 14, we described our capital management structure and adequacy. On our last earnings call, we announced that we\u2019ve suspended our share buybacks for the fourth quarter. We continue to have $529 million of common shares available for repurchase under our authorization.", "Mike noted earlier, we do not plans to repurchase shares in the near-term. We will continue to evaluate the levels and uses of our surplus capital as the year and markets develop. Our significant surplus buffering '17 provide a resiliency to our capital position. We continue to manage our risk in alignment with our related capital, so as to be in a position to execute on overall strategy in all markets.", "Overall capital levels are viewed through a number of lenses, some of which are publicly available including recent reports from the rating agencies as well as our group regulatory position with the BMA. Our capital adequacy remain solid and redundant to all of our key external measure and constraints, including rating agencies regulatory and internal capital model levels.", "At December 31, 2017 our debt leverage comprised of our senior debt was a 11.4% and our financial leverage was 32%. The majority of our financial leverage consists of securities with loss absorbency features, such as mandatory or optional coupon deferrals, and all of our financial leverage qualifies as regulatory capital. We have ample flexibility to reduce this leverage during the upcoming year through a combination of operating earnings as well as active asset and liability management.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Greg and look forward to your questions.", "Gregory Hendrick", "Thanks, Steve. So I will start with our underlying results, discuss catastrophe losses, summarize our ceded reinsurance program, touching on our market presence and finish with some comments on market conditions, including some insights on our January 1 renewals.", "Starting with the underlying results, as you can see on Page 8 of our presentation, the insurance segments accident quarter ex cat combined ratio was 91.7% compared to 90.3% in the fourth quarter of last year and 91.6% or 93.3% on a year-to-date basis. Insurance segment produced an accident quarter ex cat loss ratio 61.2% which compares to 61.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016 in line with the full-year comparison/", "For about the quarter and the year, lower large loss activity in 2017, and underwriting actions helped to offset rate decreases and higher loss cost trends in a couple of previously discussed lines. For the quarter, the expense ratio was 30.5% compared to 30.4 in the fourth quarter of 2016 driven by 1.5 point increase in acquisition costs, offset by 1.4 reduction in operating expenses. The increase in acquisition costs is largely related to prior period Commission adjustments and a change in mix of business.", "The reduction in operating expense is attributable to a reduction in annual incentive-based compensation. On a year-to-date basis, the expense ratio decreased 1.3 points to 30.6%. In reinsurance, the segment produced an accident quarter ex cat combined ratio of 85.4% compared with 81.9% last year an 87.7% compared to 85.2% on a year-to-date basis.", "The reinsurance segment produced an accident quarter ex cat loss ratio of 53.9% which compares to 49.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Roughly two-thirds of this increase is driven by change in business mix, resulting in more proportional business which carries a higher accident year ex cat loss ratio and lower loss volatility relative to excess of loss reinsurance. The expense ratio decreased nearly one full point of 31.4% in the fourth quarter. With the decrease driven primarily by the reduction in incentive-based compensation previously mentioned.", "Shifting to the catastrophes. The northern and southern California wildfires, the most noble events in the quarter. And while our aggregate net cat losses from Harvey, Irma, and Maria remains largely unchanged. Our Insurance segment losses increased and we\u2019re almost entirely offset by decreases in our reinsurance segment. Our claims colleagues have done a great job of working with clients and brokers to settle claims as quickly and fairly as possible. And while industry loss estimates do not impact our reserves, we are pleased to see industry loss estimates for these tragic events settle in the range we initially indicated.", "Page 9, of our presentation shows the full-year 2017 cat losses and they told just the $2 billion on a net basis. This was our highest year for net catastrophe basis. This was our highest year for net catastrophe losses in the last 12. On the right side of the Page, we provide a graph of historical cat losses for XL Catlin. A reminder that these losses are as reported and non-adjusted for inflation, exposure change reporting thresholds or ceded reinsurance changes. Over the 12 year period, we've averaged $590 of catastrophe losses, with the median of $505 million.", "Turning to our ceded protections, while our ceded program work largely as intended as we do every year we\u2019ve been mindful of the lessons learned and changing market conditions. Page 15 provides the summary of key outward protections for 2018. The changes made reflect both the current pricing environment and our journey to regain a lean position in the transfer of risk to alternative capital providers. Our underwriting capital management is a dynamic process that we\u2019ve all through the year as we establish inwards risk margins balanced against the lower cost of capital of many of our risk transfer partners.", "I\u2019m going to touch on the catastrophe bond, catastrophe aggregate, specific property catastrophe treaty session, and net property quota share components of underwriting capital management.", "First on the catastrophe bonds, we're one of the first issuers post the third quarter activity and we marginally reduced our total in-force limit, but expanded coverage for U.S Caribbean wind and convective storm. Second, we purchased more worldwide enterprise catastrophe aggregate and reduced insurance and reinsurance segment specific coverages. This structure provides us with the broadest coverage and protects our portfolio of net of any catastrophe bond recoveries.", "Third via our ILS fund manager, New Ocean, we increased the session to an to alternative capital provider through specific proportional session of individual property catastrophe treaties. Fourth, we\u2019ve added a new net property quota share which covers our four core catastrophe exposed lines, property cat treaty, property treaty, large risk property insurance, and London wholesale property insurance classes.", "This combined protection has been placed entirely with alternative capital providers and the initial placement at January 1 is the first of a number of sessions that will be decided as we determine the return profile of inward and outward risk activities. In total, we have in force over $3 billion of catastrophe limit sourced from alternative capital.", "The impact of these changes and others is that we have more cover on a broader basis. Enhanced protection across more frequent parts of our catastrophe exposures and achieved a lower attachment point for nonpeak parallels. On Page 16, you will see our updated PML disclosures including pro forma PMLs as of January 1, 2018. We\u2019ve reduced our exposures across the curve but most meaningfully at lower probabilities where we are down 20% to 30%.", "While these are on an occurrence basis, our worldwide aggregate exposure has decreased by similar amounts. As another perspective with the same events of 2017 to occur again, our net loss would have decreased approximately 20%. We will continue to adjust this position throughout the year.", "Turning to our market presence. In the insurance segment on a year-to-date basis, gross written premiums were up 5% after adjusting for foreign exchange as we continue to be well positioned with our clients and brokers. Further, 2017 was another solid year for new and expanded products and services as we topped advisors annual pacesetter index for the second year in a row. In total, we introduced 26 new or enhanced products and services as innovation remains a key part of our culture and an everyday occurrence at XL Catlin.", "Turning to reinsurance, on a year-to-date basis, gross written premiums increased 18% and by 7% after adjusting for one large quota share treaty, reinstatement premiums and foreign exchange. Finally, turning to market conditions, we're seeing evidence of broad and more sustainable rate improvements. In the insurance segment, pricing was up 1% in the fourth quarter which is the first increase since the fourth quarter of 2014 and down just 1% for the full-year.", "Clearly the short tail lines responded with the largest increases, but more importantly we saw increases in most of our businesses including our Long Tail International Casualty and North American Excess Casualty businesses. In the reinsurance segment, rates were up less than 1% in the quarter and down less than 1% on a year-to-date basis.", "Of more interest we\u2019ve summarized on Page 11 early January 2018 re-observations. In insurance, rate increases are churning in the plus 3% to 4% range across the entire segment. Loss impacted property business are driving the most rate with increases over 15%, followed by non-loss impacted property of 5% to 15%, casualty with rates up in the low single digits, and professional lines that range from flat to plus 2% generally with some larger increases on some of our international business.", "In reinsurance, aggregate rate increases of approximately 4% to 5%, driven by a 6% rate increase in property catastrophe and 5% in property treaty and casualty lines of business. While these rate increases were earned in over time, this broad-based rate change is a clear benefit given our diversified portfolio. XL Catlin continues to be seen is driving change in the market and seeking to achieve appropriate and sustainable rate levels.", "As market dynamics shift, we're grateful for the ongoing support of our clients and brokers as we to continue to see strong submission flow and have won many new accounts at the January 1 renewals. We remain optimistic that we can continue on this positive rate trajectory throughout the remainder of 2018. In summary, as we look at the full-year of 2017 and step back from the impact of the catastrophes, we're proud of our continued progress in the ex cat results. And with clear evidence of a changing market, we're leading this new space as our underwriting teams thought through -- renew their books and find new profitable opportunities by leveraging our broad product suite and global reach.", "I will now turn it back to Abbe.", "Abbe Goldstein", "Thanks, Greg. Gabrielle, we are ready to open-up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Kai Pan", "Thank you and good evening. So my first question is on your capital position. In your slide, you said if 2017 events were to repeat you still have enough capital cushion. Is that a repeat of the 2017? Is that -- is this -- what happened to losses or you consider the reduction of your losses because of the additional reinsurance with retro coverage?", "Michael McGavick", "So what we\u2019ve said was if 2017 were to happen again, our reinsurance structure would result in net losses that were less by 20%. We didn\u2019t say that if it happened again we would have any particular level of buffer thereafter. We do believe we have appropriate capital for the risks that we\u2019re taking on in 2017 so -- 2018, so I do believe that we're appropriately capitalized for the risks that gave rise to those losses. But our commentary around the reduction in overall impact was if the same events happen we would expect a result that was that much better.", "Kai Pan", "Okay. Additional on your capital position, you\u2019re paused buyback for now, but are you considering proactive buying back your debt to reduce your leverage levels?", "Stephen Robb", "We are certainly considering buying back our debt, but as we've said in the past, our surplus capital levels -- first we look at ways to deploying the business and then ways to address other elements, either they would be nonorganic elements, debt, or buying back shares. Certainly reducing overall leverage is something that is high on our priority list as a general sense, but I don't see it as being a necessity at this stage, Kai. ", "Kai Pan", "Okay, great. Then I have another question on the reinsurance segments. The premium rose very strong, almost double the net premiums. And so could you talk a little bit more about where the growth is coming from and specifically you have a -- you mentioned a multiyear, multiline treaty, how much that impact the year-over-year deterioration in core loss ratio in the reinsurance segment?", "Gregory Hendrick", "Sure. Kai, it's Greg. So I look at this on a full-year base. It's right over the quarter, the fourth quarter for reinsurance is a very small, and so on a full-year basis when you take out that large multiline quota share, and you take out reinstatement premiums and you take out foreign exchange, we grew about 7%, and that has generally come from the property treaty and property cat classes with a little bit coming from our Casualty Treaty portfolio. In terms of the impact from [indiscernible] cat loss ratio, it\u2019s about -- it's a little over a point in the year that we would -- that we\u2019ve fell as we indicated back at the beginning of the year, that would be the impact from that large multiline treaty.", "Kai Pan", "Great. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Next we will hear from Joshua Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Joshua Shanker", "Good evening everybody. I\u2019m pleased to see that you reduced your 100 exposure for PML in a major cat event, but I know it's the 1 and 250 exposure isn't really changed and given where pricing is right now and I know you especially go higher, why is this the right tolerance to -- for your equity holders to bear for a major disaster?", "Gregory Hendrick", "Right. Josh, it\u2019s Greg. So I think we thought about this across the entire curve, right. Not just at one single point on how to make these adjustments. As I noted in my comments, that we reduced slightly about 100 million part of 1.8 billion the category bonds, which is the key tail driver. We think our tail position is a reasonable one relative to our overall capital position and is appropriate, and we focused our efforts more on the more probable parts of the curve and use the tools that I\u2019ve already discussed on how to make those reduce in a meaningful way. In a reflection both of our capital change year-over-year which is about 10% and with the market opportunity in terms of the relative returns of inwards and outwards reinsurance. So it's not just a one point. Look at the thing, it is a look across the entire curve.", "Michael McGavick", "And, Josh, this is Mike. I would add it was always our intention to learn from what the market reaction was, how to best stack up our opportunities for risk and reward. We have seen the reaction in reinsurance to be less favorable to the total equation for us than the reaction on the primary side. So we\u2019re more excited to drive more of our opportunity for earnings into what's going on in the primary side and to share more of the risk on our reinsurance side, particularly in the cat affected lines that could be both insurance and reinsurance with alternative capital. So we see that as a furtherance of the strategy we\u2019ve been on for a long time and a particular set of pricing and opportunity conditions that allowed us to accelerate that strategy.", "Joshua Shanker", "If reinsurance cat pricing were to go up helpfully, how much of your equity are you willing to put at risk for a major disaster?", "Michael McGavick", "Again, Josh, each of these different markets that emerge we have a plan for. We had a plan for what would we do if retro pricing became the most attractive economic proposition. We had a plan for every alternative and we -- in this set of conditions have done as we described. We already had very substantial tail protections. We were quite proud of this structure that there had been an early focus in our advances and utilization of alternative capital through the cat bonds that we issued back two years ago. But as we look at the totality of the market reaction to these losses, we felt that taking a little bit off that top and buying more in the meat was going to be the better outcome for our shareholders and that\u2019s why we executed what you think.", "Joshua Shanker", "Okay. Well, good luck in the New Year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.", "Paul Newsome", "I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the capital buffer that you mentioned earlier. And I think you said something along the lines that you are actually thinking about increasing it and just if you could draw some line kind of follow that, that makes sense for you? And what that an impact would be?", "Stephen Robb", "Sure. Well, we maintain our capital obviously against the lenses that are relevant to us and we mentioned them regulatory rating agency, our internal capital models themselves. In addition, we keep as Mike has -- in the past has referred to it, buffered to that buffer. Such that not only are we within the capital compliant, but we have room above that to take losses and still be well above that position. We -- in 2017 took meaningful losses. So that buffer-to-buffer is less than it was before and we will take time during 2018 to rebuild that. The capital we have in place is appropriate and significant and appropriate for the business that we're writing but adding to that buffer-to-buffer so that we can continue with that level of conservatism is important to us. On top of that, as Greg has set and Mike reiterated this market is still developing. So deploying that capital in other ways is something that we look to do as we see what happens. So that's all we are really mentioning is that we\u2019ve paused the share buybacks, we will continue to grow that buffer. We have sufficient capital, we have a buffer to that, but we want that to reach a level that we've historically been comfortable with and we will be comfortable with again.", "Paul Newsome", "Okay. I may have misunderstood you. I was thinking just to make sure I got it right. But it's just rebuilding what you had before as opposed to the view that you need a larger buffer than used to have.", "Stephen Robb", "That\u2019s generally right. I mean we do set our buffer-to-buffer with our Board and on the margin we move it up and down depending on certain factors. But generally, yes, that's right.", "Paul Newsome", "Okay. And then, the second event with the new reinsurance changes, could you talk a little bit about what happened if you have second or third event, given that seems to be the bigger risk nowadays, most of all the events in a year.", "Michael McGavick", "Sure, Paul. The -- so first of all, let me -- I will come down the chain that I described earlier, right. So the coupons, our aggregate nature, some of them are not exhausted entirely in the first event. They -- what was left will be there to be used, the same principal applies to the catastrophe aggregate covers as well. So they would be ready to go, if they had not been exhausted. On our current insurance occurrence cover, in another secondary occurrence cover we bought across the whole enterprise those both have -- sorry, the insurance cover is a one reinstatement so there would be a coverage for a second event. And then the third piece of it would be the pro rata pieces and of course, those don\u2019t have reinstatements. They will continue to cover until the full limit of the contract is exhausted.", "Paul Newsome", "Thank you. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "Our next question will come Amit Kumar with Buckingham Research Group. Your line is open.", "Amit Kumar", "Thanks and good evening. One or two questions. The first question is going back to the discussion on risk management and obviously you gave some color the ceded reinsurance protection. I\u2019m curious, where you stood on I guess the discussion on buying a group-wide aggregate stop-loss cover?", "Michael McGavick", "Sure. First an aside, that was not something that we put into the press. That was something that guide in there from sources not of our own. I\u2019m quite frankly not pleased that it made there. The Reinsurance business has long existed on the principle of confidentiality, and trust and somewhere unfortunately that chain got broken. Having said that, we\u2019ve started to explore that structure of about -- of a notional billion dollar limit. On a cover the entire enterprise on its entire -- on a loss ratio basis. So in aggregate stop-loss ratio cover. We only place 10% of it. It's a cover that like many things we do we start out small make sure we understand the mechanics get reinsurance comfortable with it and then move forward as we potential expand if you like the way the economics work and how responding to certain events. But it's a entire enterprise-wide full cover but we only place 10% of that limit and again I can only stress enough that was not a news item that we saw to put out there.", "Amit Kumar", " Got it. I won't tease further on that point. The second question and I will re-queue, if you look at the rate change discussion and I know there were some caveats associated with the pricing commentary and there are moving parts of it. If I -- if one were to ex out, I guess that the multiyear piece with the revised number would be modestly different or would that be meaningfully different than the numbers you\u2019ve given because they do seem to be lower than some of the other numbers we\u2019ve seen out there.", "Gregory Hendrick", "So I\u2019m going to -- so, I mean, yes, that\u2019s a great point. I will give you one caveat particularly on the insurance numbers, these are still very early days. The data, there is a lot more transactions, it takes a lot longer to pull them together. But directionally, I will start -- we start with reinsurance, that\u2019s where we have the most complete data set. The 5% for the segment would go up just a little bit less than a point. The property cat component of that would increase just over a full point from 6% to just over 7%, if you take away the multiyear accounts that are in there. So it's a small driver, but not a lot. On the insurance side, roughly speaking that 3.5% would increase to about 4%. That\u2019s across property and across a broad swap of business, right. So let me make sure I\u2019m really clear on that. The 3.5% for the segment covers the entire books of business, right. The property is up more if you had to take up -- probably take a way to guess what its up altogether somewhere in that 5% to 10% range would be what we'd be seeing on just the property component of our book.", "Amit Kumar", "Got it. That\u2019s actually very helpful. I will stop here. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future.", "Gregory Hendrick", "Thank you.", "Michael McGavick", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open.", "Meyer Shields", "Thanks. Two, I think reasonably simple questions. First, given the rate increases that you're seeing, I guess, both in insurance and reinsurance, should the margin impact of those rate increases outpace the incremental cost of cat protection?", "Gregory Hendrick", "Meyer, yes, absolutely. We think particularly because if you think about some of the components like the cat bonds, where $1.6 billion and change part of a $1.7 billion and change, we\u2019re already in place. Roughly speaking, and this is all of subjective number but our analysis show that if you look across those major cat protections I described, it's about a 2% to 3% rate increase on just that ceded premium which of course is a fraction of what the entire portfolio. So, yes, we think there's leverage from the inwards rather to the outwards.", "Meyer Shields", "Okay, fantastic. And second, can we dig a little deeper into the reserve release numbers. I know it\u2019s -- we probably unfairly get used to a run rate of reserve releases and it was below that. And I was wondering if you can help us understand how we should think about that going forward?", "Michael McGavick", "Yes, this is Mike. I will start. Basically the most important thing to share is nothing has changed. I mean our processes internally and our belief in prudence especially in long tail lines are desired to have bad news travel faster. These remain fundamental tenets to how we said our reserves now I want to emphasize this quarter and future quarters will be done in the same way. Greg?", "Gregory Hendrick", "Sure. Yes, let me -- I want to share a few kind of detail points to give you some color about how we think about those and how we look at this. So across the group we have a large diversified reserve base and at any given time there are portfolios that needs strengthening, there's portfolios that are releasing and some of the underwritings with a lot of movement that\u2019s going on and obviously we\u2019re monitoring those developments all the time and making adjustments accordingly. If you look at our insurance reserves, let's look at some of the increases and decreases we\u2019ve had over the years. So in '15 we strengthened reserves and surety, our class we're no longer in on the insurance basis. New York contractors and smaller portfolios within our miscellaneous professional book. And there were significant releases in specialty driven by aerospace and political risk. Moving forward to '16, portions of professional miscellaneous and our international financial lines portfolio were strengthened, while property and casualty generally developed favorably. Last year in '17 the one in wholesale property portfolio, that delivered good returns for us for many years experience in that first development on a attritional losses on the 2015 to 2017 underwriting years. Also in the property line large energy loss activity during 2016 contributed some adverse development in 2017. In addition the IFL management portfolio required strengthening related to some large loss activity which we\u2019ve talked -- which is linked to trends we\u2019ve talked about on previous calls with large clients in U.S style litigation entering into Europe. But balancing this out, North American casualty and the other professional businesses contributed favorably in 2017, despite some large loss activity in recent accident years. In total, in insurance, it's really the magnitude of the property strengthening in 2017 that\u2019s driving the reduction in favorable PYD relative to the prior year. Given this development, we don\u2019t view this as a trend. We are watching the trends in international professional that we mentioned previously and re-underwriting our book accordingly. We look at that large loss activity in casualty in recent years as fortuitous rather than a trend at this stage. If I shift to reinsurance, while there is some reduction level of PYD since '15 and '16. The main driver is the casualty line, which is impacted by the Ogden discount rate change early in 2017. The net impact of this during 2017 was $63 million adverse. The casualty cross also impacted by some of the same large loss activity I mentioned earlier and much like our experience -- in the insurance plan, sorry. This serve to dampen the level of PYD overall in '17. So what we believe our reserving, as Mike said, we believe our reserving approach has served us well over the years as demonstrated by a favorable development. That said, it would be unrealistic to expect the same level of favorable development from the most recent accident years as we experienced from the very hard market years of the mid 2000, but we remain comfortable with our overall reserve position. Meyer, I hope that helps a little bit more color.", "Meyer Shields", "That was fantastic. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open.", "Brian Meredith", "Yes. Thank you. A couple of questions here for you. The first one, I appreciate you gave us kind of a 2% to 3% increase in your cat protection. Is there any way you can give us some kind of guidance to this perspective on what the additional cost on your ceded is going to be from kind of lowering the volatility in your business? There is obviously additional costs associated with it?", "Stephen Robb", "Yes, I would -- the rate increase I\u2019ve given you, I would have to think about the ceded premium, I don\u2019t have that number in front, but let me see if I can get that for you, I will then come back to you. You\u2019re talking about the total \u2026", "Brian Meredith", "Yes, the total hour, does that -- so we can kind of measure what the impact on that\u2019s going to be? I imagine it's going to be higher?", "Stephen Robb", "Right. Let me look for that one.", "Brian Meredith", "Great.", "Stephen Robb", "One thing we\u2019ve commented in there as -- probably I have to get back to you another time, but the -- a lot of the reduction in risk is by reshaping as Mike and Greg said, and moving our coverages into the more meat of the portfolio. So the overall cost will be a cost to increase in our exposure will be as significant as you might think.", "Brian Meredith", "Okay, great. And then, a question on kind of book yield. Still -- current interest rate levels, any pressure on book yields still or is it going to be kind of 20 in the other way here on the investment portfolio -- fixed income portfolio?", "Michael McGavick", "Well, we\u2019ve been countering. We still have pressure, our money rate is below our book yield and the market yield on the portfolio. But we\u2019ve been countering that to a small degree by portfolio reallocations, but until the new money rate that I talk about regularly which for right now our market yield is 2.3, I know we give our new money rate, but that includes the rebalancing. Our market yield is about 2.3 and our book yield is about 2.6. We are still 30 basis points adrift of that. So that give you a sense across that line once we get 30 basis points better at roughly a five-year AA minus portfolio.", "Brian Meredith", "Got you. And the last just quick one here. I noticed your alternative funds kind of dropping during the course of the year. Is that something actively that you\u2019re doing reducing your alternative funds or is something else is going on there?", "Michael McGavick", "Yes, it is active. It's not a glass we're getting out of, but we have been shrinking the overall hedge fund portfolio both as a risk-adjusted measure and as you mentioned -- we mentioned in the last quarter as well as last year, a few crystallization of significant gains, and since they happened at times when cash was useful. We haven't redeployed them in the portfolio. So, yes, it's a shift. It's not getting out of that class, but it's a reduction in general.", "Brian Meredith", "Great. Thank you.", "Stephen Robb", "Brian -- yes, Brian before you go, I\u2019ve got -- sorry, I wasn\u2019t able to put my hand on, let me how -- let me just -- a couple of reminders before I give you the punch line. One, as we said - as we\u2019ve all said on this call so far the outwards purchases a dynamic process. We don\u2019t just set in. Regrettably we\u2019re not a mono line company that can set a program in place at 1.1 and let her run and then come back to it again. We are constantly deciding on -- 30 to 40 businesses on the inward side and kind of returns coming there. And then reflecting on what the opportunities are received and try to make sure we make the right decisions on that balance. So this is not a given, that\u2019s what going to happen. But indicatively I would say around a 10% increase in ceded written premium would be an indication. But Brian just to be really quick, there's a lot of caveat to that, given the dynamic nature of what we do.", "Brian Meredith", "I appreciate that. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Jay Cohen", "Thank you. Couple of questions. On the investment income, would you be willing to give us a sense of what you think the quarterly run rate will be on investment income in '18?", "Michael McGavick", "Yes. I mean, I think the run rate we have this quarter is a good reflection of where we believe we are going in 2018.", "Jay Cohen", "Got that\u2019s helpful. And then secondly, with the tax change in order to make sure that the lower U.S tax rate doesn't affect your overall results. Will you have to restructure some of the intercompany reinsurance arrangements or take other actions to make sure that doesn't happen?", "Michael McGavick", "This is Mike. To start to, yes, the short answer in fact. Our group began its work on that immediately with final passage and work throughout the Christmas holidays to go ahead and make some of those changes right away, so that we would be as well positioned to fulfill our commitments as possible.", "Jay Cohen", "Got it. Thanks, Mike.", "Gregory Hendrick", "Yes. And we have changed the U.S risk sharing with offshore entities meaningfully and will continue to evaluate how we shared that risk going forward.", "Jay Cohen", "[Indiscernible].", "Michael McGavick", "Thanks, Jay.", "Operator", "And with that, we will conclude the question-and-answer session. I will hand the conference back over to CEO Michael McGavick for closing remarks.", "Michael McGavick", "This is a -- this was a very important period of time for us. Obviously, with the events last year we felt that there was a lot to learn from them and we also felt that the market that would emerge would be absolutely crucial to how we would go forward and would be able to illustrate the value of the diversified platform we've been building, and our long-standing comfort with alternative capital developments and as it is happened the market that emerged was the one that we feel really matched to both that desire to accelerate, the use alternative capital and let the results from our increased participation on insurance and specialty -- on the primary insurance and specialty lines to really shine through. It seems to me that's exactly the year that\u2019s coming to being. So we\u2019re rather excited to put 2017 behind us and to work forward and it would be awful to end this call without thanking our people who have been doing extraordinary work to get this in place, both the kinds of things that was done by the tax group through the holiday and the kinds of things that we've been doing throughout the firm to position ourselves to fully allow our business model to shine in the market that has -- that is emerging. We are excited about 2018 as I presume you can gather from our comments. Thank you very much for your time tonight and we look forward to seeing you soon.", "Operator", "Thank you.
