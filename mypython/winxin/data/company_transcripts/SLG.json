(NYSE:SLG) Q2 2017 Results Earnings Conference Call July 20, 2017  2:00 PM ET", "Executives", "Marc Holliday - CEO", "Matt DiLiberto - CFO", "Andrew Mathias - President", "Steven Durels - EVP, Leasing and Real Property", "David Schonbraun - Co-Chief Investment Officer", "Analysts", "John Kim - BMO Capital Markets", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank", "Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill", "Manny Korchman - Citi", "Michael Lewis - SunTrust", "Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI", "Craig Mailman - KeyBanc Capital", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital", "Nick Yulico - UBS", "Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley", "Jon Petersen - Jefferies", "John Guinee - Stifel", "Jed Reagan - Green Street Advisors", "Operator", "Thank you everybody for joining us and welcome to SL Green Realty Corp. Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Results Conference Call. This conference call is being recorded.", "At this time, the Company would like to remind listeners that during the call management may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from the forward-looking statements that management may make today. Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the Company\u2019s Form 10-K and other reports filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "Also during today\u2019s conference call, the Company may also discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G, the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure discussed and the reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on the Company\u2019s website at www.slgreen.com, by selecting the press release regarding the Company\u2019s second quarter 2017 earnings.", "Before turning the call over to Marc Holliday, Chief Executive Officer of SL Green Realty Corp., I ask that those of you participating in the Q&A portion of the call, please limit your questions to two per person. Thank you.", "I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. With the second quarter now in the books, I\u2019m pleased to state that we finished up the first half of the year on plan. In certain areas like earnings and mark-to-market on Manhattan leases, we are trending ahead such that we are likely to end the year at the upper end of our guidance ranges. In other areas, like lease termination fees, we are trending behind our annual averages but this is likely a positive as we are nonetheless on track with earnings and implies less tenants looking to buy out of the spaces.", "Each year, we set out for our sales between 16 and 20 fairly robust stretch goals for the Company, as you know. And nearly seven months into the year, I\u2019m confident that we will meet the vast majority of our stated objectives for 2017. Also notable in the quarter is the initiation of stock repurchases at very attractive pricing which we believe represents an exceptionally good opportunity for the Company, given our strong liquidity position and balance sheet.", "Recall, approximately one year ago, the Company authorized up to $1 billion of stock repurchases due to the prolonged disconnect between the stock price and the underlying value of our real estate assets. After executing on approximately $7 billion of asset sales, in 2015 and 2016 we generated nearly $2 billion of net proceeds that we use to retire debt and to build a store house of capacity for opportunities going forward.", "As there continues to be significant investment interest from foreign and domestic capital sources for well-located high quality Manhattan office assets, we developed our own internal convection that repurchasing our stock represents among the most attractive investment opportunities for the Company at this time. SL Green\u2019s Manhattan office portfolio from which we obviously generate the vast majority of our revenues, has been undervalued in the market for quite some time. And back in December, we set forth in detail the financial rational underlying this belief. Over this period of time, we have been quite successful at confirming our net asset values through voluminous sales of assets and the market has also confirmed pricing from many other comparable non-SL Green assets. The debt markets are liquid, competitive and quite stable, and the interest rates continue to hover around levels close to historic lows.", "The New York City economy continues to appear quite strong with a record low 4.3% unemployment rate and an increasing labor force participation rate. Office using employment in New York City, the statistic that we monitor closely, is up at seasonally adjusted 20,000 jobs through May of this year, which is on par with the last several years. And recall that those years were at -- or had set historic highs in terms of office using employment levels and increment to employment base. And this 20,000 jobs through May will likely result in an upward revision to the city\u2019s full year estimates, assuming the Depart of Labor stats that are due out this afternoon, continue to show growth in June. The big five New York City banks also reported earnings up 4.5% Q2 over Q2, although most of the office using job growth is coming from the diversified business services sector and not from the fire sector.", "Also of note is the leasing velocity and leasing volumes in the first half of the year, which amounted to about 2 million square feet of net absorption in Manhattan. And our own leasing pipeline bears out this increasing leasing velocity as our pipeline stands at 1 million square feet, over half of which are represented by leases out to signature or under negotiation that\u2019s obviously up substantially from last quarter.", "The one area of weakness that we see in the market is in the retail sector where demand in some sub markets has slackened and valuations have adjusted accordingly. Fortunately, our retail portfolio is in great shape with almost all of our high street retail holdings leased for term to credit tenants with the only exceptions being 609 Fifth Ave, which we will begin redeveloping next year and 719 Seventh where construction was recently completed. I think good evidence of the strength in our high street retail portfolio was the culmination of the complete re-tenanting of the Aeropostale space in the second quarter with the final piece to the puzzle as it were a lease out to -- a lease that was consummated with Kiko Cosmetics, an Italian cosmetics firm. That brought to bear a full 30% plus in revenues, turning a situation that many had thought would be a negative, into a huge positive for the Company.", "Accordingly, given all of that, we view stock repurchases as a very attractive and viable use of investment capital. And we may continue to make similar investments in our own portfolio, side by side with shareholders, so long as these dynamics persist. As not to say, the stock repurchases will define the sole use of our available capital but rather we believe that stock repurchases have a place alongside a balanced investment strategy that includes asset purchases and potentially special cash distributions. We believe that this balanced approach will enable us to maximize value for shareholders while maintaining an opportunistic approach to growth through asset purchases and dispositions.", "With that I would like to open up the call for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. ", "John Kim", "Marc, in your prepared remarks, you said you were confident in hitting many of your 2017 goals and objectives. A couple of them seem like they would be difficult to achieve including 97% same-store occupancy as well as the greater than 2.5% same-store NOI growth. So, I\u2019m wondering, if those two components in particular, you still feel confident in.", "Marc Holliday", "Yes. I don\u2019t -- I mean, as I said, I think it\u2019s very, very outset. We\u2019re right on plan. With those two metrics in particular, Matt can elaborate more, but I think that we would -- we feel based on the pipeline and second on activity and everything else that we\u2019re going to be right on top of, so we head slightly behind those exact numbers, which is I think what I affirmed at the beginning of the call. But, Matt, do you have any color on that?", "Matt DiLiberto", "Yes. I am just going to add a little color to the same-store NOI number. There is a variable for lease termination income in there. And so, Marc alluded to the fact that we\u2019re behind, for the first half of year, on lease termination income, almost $2 million behind our expectations, and we had some layered into the balance of the year. And if that materializes, we\u2019re good; if it comes up a little shy, we will be at the lower end of our guidance range. But, we will have to let that play out. But our target of 2.5, the midpoint of our guidance range is maintained at this point.", "John Kim", "And my second question is in relation to a clampdown in Chinese institution. I realize, there is a difference between sovereign wealth funds and state-owned enterprises. But, I am wondering if this clampdown impacts you at all in terms of directly or how you feel about how that impacts Manhattan office pricing?", "Andrew Mathias", "It\u2019s Andrew, John. We haven\u2019t seen any direct impact from the clampdown. Obviously, we saw 245 Park trade in the first half of the year to HNA, which is a Chinese company. And we continue to see Chinese investors actively look at both equity and debt opportunities in the market. So, it hasn\u2019t changed from our perspective the appetite from that sector of the world.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.", "Vincent Chao", "Just last quarter, we had a pretty healthy discussion around concessions in the market, and it does look like the free rent and TI per square feet per year were up in the portfolio this quarter. I was just curious, if you could comment on the level of concessions that you are seeing, both in your own portfolio but also across the broader market?", "Marc Holliday", "Before we get to broader market, Matt, do you have those numbers? Let\u2019s just go through the numbers. I think sometimes they are talking little\u2026", "Matt DiLiberto", "Yes. Because we all keep reading that there is something going on in the market with increased concessions, and I won\u2019t address that part of it. But in our numbers, the concessions are up, concessions are up. And I think what gets lost in the stats that are published are not only what properties leases are being done at but more importantly the new and renewal mix. So, we did as we took a look at the last two years and quarter-by-quarter new versus renewal leases to see what the true net effect of rents are. And consistent with what we said last quarter and at the end of the year and with our expectations, net effective rents are up on all, call four metrics. So new and renewal leases, both on a signed and commenced spaces, our net effective rents are up. So, while the stats may give the allusion of concessions being up, you are not appreciating the fact that there may be a higher mix of new leases this year versus renewals last.", "Marc Holliday", "So, that\u2019s with respect to our portfolio where I do believe that robust discussion we had last quarter was mostly around our TIs, our free rent, our concessions, which had been trending somewhere between stable and down year-over-year. And I think through Q2, other than the mix of new to renewal but on a apples to apples basis, new to new, renew to renew, we are Matt, what, stable?", "Matt DiLiberto", "Yes.", "Marc Holliday", "Yes. So, with respect to the markets, Steve, do you want to address that?", "Steven Durels", "I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve changed materially this year. The concept of increased TI in connection with buying up rents, you have seen it in the market driven by couple of landlords in particular. But that was sort of in the market mid last year or maybe even a little bit earlier. Certainly, we have experienced where we have to do turnkey installations for tenants, construction cost rose last year. But I don\u2019t think there has been any noticeable change through the beginning of this year to as we see it today.", "Vincent Chao", "And then, just second question, just on the FFO guidance. I\u2019m just curious, if the fee that we generated this quarter, the 19% total, was that all contemplated in the original range.", "Marc Holliday", "Yes. I saw -- a lot of that -- if you refer to as onetime, I just want to clarify, we have a substantial joint venture management business and from that we generate substantial fees of all natures that are in our guidance every year. And I don\u2019t really understand the one-time nature of that. I think that is -- there will be much more fees coming out of One Vanderbilt investment as a result of our joint venture, as well as countless other joint ventures we have. So, that\u2019s just in our book, JV fee income. I\u2019m not sure, onetime or it relates to there. It could be considered larger project but there are significant fees that this company will experience over the development lease-up, the stabilization of One Vanderbilt bill as well as other projects that we\u2019re working on. So, I think that\u2019s something that you will see in some greater or lesser magnitudes as we continue to go forward.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ", "Jamie Feldman", "Steve, I was hoping you could just give some more color on what you\u2019re seeing in the leasing market. I know you guys referenced good net absorption in the market. But we also know, there has been good activity for some of the new development, especially the Hudson Yards. So, maybe, if you could just talk bigger picture about where the demand is, how it matches up with your portfolio, what you think we may see going forward, and may be tie in the leasing pipeline, the 1 million square-foot pipeline that Marc mentioned.", "Steven Durels", "So, I think there is a sentiment in the market that you can see in the press and some of the mix reports that are out there from the brokerage community, sort of colors the picture and to trace reality a little bit. I think the pipeline that we\u2019ve got, says it all. With 1 million square feet, a pipeline that is growing from first quarter to the second quarter really is representative of the strength of the overall market. Yes, tenants are migrating to new and redeveloped type products. I think that\u2019s a good think. I think Manhattan has been star for new construction for many years, because we even have the benefit of new construction being in the product mix. If we had this discussion a year or three ago, everybody would have been scared about the prospects of filling new construction. But obviously Hudson Yards and downtown, wherever there is new buildings, tenants are migrating to it. That bodes well I think for our prospect at One Vanderbilt.", "And certainly the increased number of tenant presentations and request for proposals that we\u2019re experiencing at One Vanderbilt further evidences the demand for high-quality product. Our pipeline has continuing a mix of types of business, led heavily by financial services interestingly enough of the over 500,000 square feet of leases that we have out, over 200,000 square feet of it all of our financial services related. And then after that it\u2019s a wide variety of different types of businesses. So, like we saw at the beginning of the year or even towards the end of last year, good demand across the broad at all price points and all geographic locations.", "Jamie Feldman", "And how much of that pipeline is for One Vanderbilt?", "Marc Holliday", "I don\u2019t want to break that out. It\u2019s a small -- it\u2019s a relatively small portion of the total million. But the leasing for One Vanderbilt, we have pretty much on track for 2018 second half and beyond. Anything we do ahead of that is kind of good news early stuff. We\u2019re sitting here in the middle of 2017, coming out of the ground, building a lot of enthusiasm. Clearly, we are having a lot of meetings, we are trading some paper for sure on One Vanderbilt, but we are not going to revise what otherwise I think a very conservative but prudent lease-up projection that begins in the second half of 2018, we\u2019re a year away from that. And our focus right now is predominantly and primarily on our portfolio, which comprises the bulk of that 1 million square feet.", "Jamie Feldman", "And that\u2019s mostly stuff you think gets done this year, is that a better way to think about it?", "Marc Holliday", "I hope so. Otherwise, we are not going make our guidance, but I reaffirmed at the beginning. So, I feel pretty confident that we are going to make 1.6 million this year.", "Steven Durels", "I\u2019ll add to that a little bit because some of the analyst reports noticed that second quarter number of leases that we signed this quarter was lower than maybe their expectation was. This quarter could have easily tipped by 100 to 150,000 square feet of additional lease signed. It\u2019s really just a function of documents sitting on tenants\u2019 desk for execution. So, if not for vagaries of a week here or a week there, it\u2019s actually stronger than the numbers suggest.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Marc, can you just -- on the stock buybacks, can you just talk a little bit more about it. The news reports out that you guys are contemplating looking at Worldwide Plaza, there is this potential JV of 1515, so you have proceeds that will be generated. Can you just talk in general how you think about buying assets, presumably at market versus your stock which is at substantive discounts?", "Marc Holiday", "Well, as I said earlier, I think we are taking a balanced approach. There is no all-in approach on stock buyback or investments or do nothing in stockpile equity. I think that\u2019s a bad approach, because any one of those can be the right or wrong approach at a given time. I think a much more prudent way to look at it is that as we generate substantial amounts of liquidity through joint ventures and sales, and at this point internally generated funds from operations because with a mostly leased portfolio we are generating sizable cash flow, how we invest those moneys. And those moneys are being invested in what we think in the aggregate will give us good risk reward returns, be it development or redevelopment of projects, new acquisitions, stock and [indiscernible] debt reduction, although now given where debt levels stand, we don\u2019t foresee further deleveraging but clearly we\u2019ve done extraordinary amount of deleveraging over the past few years.", "And then, there is always a potential depending on the tax situation at a point in time for special dividends. So, I think that balanced approach is what will give our stock and this Company the highest return over time, not taking a point of view on any one of those approaches. But that combined approach, we feel will maximize NAV. I mean, we\u2019re looking to just increase our NAV per share from where it stands today to something significantly higher for the balance of this year into next year. And stock buybacks have a big role to play in that but there are still deals out there that we think we can -- we have a pipeline that we feel we can acquire at attractive pricing, make significant unlevered and levered returns. And in those instances where we do the partnerships, significant fee and promote income which really adds between 300 to 500 basis points of returns to those investments which puts them on par with many other opportunities we have for the money.", "So, I think that\u2019s the approach we\u2019re taking. I think it\u2019s working well and we will continue on that approach for the foreseeable future. ", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay. And then, switching to retail, you mentioned the softness in retail. And I think the two buildings cited, one was the American Girl and the other one was the new signage in the Times Square. So, can you talk, if given the change in retail with your expectations from mark to market on American Girl or your expectations for the signage building have changed? And then, are there any other material retail exposures coming up in the next sort of 12 to 18 months?", "Andrew Mathias", "It\u2019s Andrew, Alex. I don\u2019t think our expectation for mark to market has changed on those assets. I would say our guidance was more in line with our own internal modeling and the market as opposed to may be where the perception was the market was going to go, because people are modeling some pretty explosive growth on those assets. So, we\u2019re still confident in our numbers there. And I don\u2019t think beyond those two. 609, the tenant is still in occupancy until the beginning of next year; and then 719, obviously we just finished construction. Beyond those two, we don\u2019t see any other major retail vacancies coming up in the portfolio.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. ", "Manny Korchman", "And Marc, just as another -- two on the buyback. Was there anything specific that change in your mind, I mean just asking [ph] at a discount for credit while that transaction environment\u2019s probably been frothy but stable. And so was there anything that changed whether that you saw that you\u2019re being incrementally priced out, is that sort of a proper concept of deals or was it -- sort of what made you change your mind from going to be a non-buyer stock with [indiscernible] to actually using that tool. ", "Marc Holliday", "Sorry. Non-buyer stock, what was the rest of that?", "Manny Korchman", "Versus actually using the buyback and actually... ", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I mean, I don\u2019t know if there was a flashpoint. I would say that we wanted to see some real I would say longevity and proof and evidence of the fact that the capital markets in 2017 were still functioning well and asset values were holding and that there was so reasonably high -- the demand for the kind of well-located assets we talked about. And as we were out there talking with all sorts of investors globally and domestically about existing deals, new deals, One Vanderbilt et cetera, it became very evident to us, as there is just a ton of equity out there for private market, direct real estate investment. It\u2019s kind of like the opposite of what seems to exist in this overall REIT sector where I think the flow seem more challenging but in the direct equity space there just seems to be an incredible appetite, desire, demand, again for the best markets, best located assets with great sponsorship. And for those situations, it just appears to us like that. The pricing levels are still very firm, the amount of equity out there is still significant. The debt capital to finance those deals and finance them efficiently is competitive as we have seen. I mean, it\u2019s really quite competitive and it\u2019s competitive at rates that are, as I said earlier, at or near historic lows.", "So, when you take the totality of that kind of environment and appetite for assets and we put it through our own models and get to our evaluations, which as we sell assets, we can prove against our own work the validity and veracity of our internal investments against market. And the more we saw that market holding up, those numbers holding up, the more it became clear and obvious to us that at current trading levels of the stock, it seemed so dislocated and such a glaringly obvious investment opportunity that we wanted to use some of our own capacity in that direction and using that capacity that we had built up quite intentionally from 2015 and 2016. So, I think all things came together. But beyond that I can say there was flipping of the switch.", "Manny Korchman", "Maybe one for Steve. Steve, there has been a little bit more focus on sub lease states in the city recently. Have you seen that and how does that sort of impact whether it\u2019d be your leasing momentum or hitting that 1.6 million square-foot goal by year-end.", "Steven Durels", "Yes. It\u2019s in the statistics. We haven\u2019t experienced in our portfolio and certainly have it, felt it from a competitive element. I can\u2019t say we\u2019ve lost any deals to sub leases. It\u2019s still at a -- on historical basis, on the very low end, as far as the ability goes. So, it popped up; it was driven by a few specifics. It doesn\u2019t seem to be a broad trend and certainly nothing that I can put my finger on, anything to worry about right now.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Lewis with SunTrust.", "Michael Lewis", "You have been asked a little bit about how you could hit guidance and some of the pieces of it. I want to flip that around a little bit because as I look at the numbers, where you did 335 in the first half, even if you exclude the $0.09 promo [ph] and the $0.10 of fees in the second quarter, you still did 159. So, you are running ahead of the upper end of the range. You are going to have a tailwind from the share repurchase in the back half. I don\u2019t know maybe you could comment if you have any more -- if you expect anymore JVs this year. You already said that there may be some lease termination fees. I guess are there some offsets there because just the way the numbers lay out, it actually looks like to me at least that maybe you\u2019re a little ahead?", "Marc Holliday", "Matt will answer it. We may be a little ahead. I don\u2019t know -- I think you are reading too much into it. We certainly feel like we\u2019ll be in the upper end of the range. You get down to a level of pennies, upper end, right on, little above the high. I mean there is still six months to go. So, I have to see how the year plays out. But earnings wise, I think we are doing quite well, which is why it kind of surprised me to read some of the things in the report, filing the earnings release. That particular is amongst our strongest. And I said earlier, I think it will be at the high end of our range. Your point is, could it be a little higher, don\u2019t know, we will see where we end up at year end. But certainly towards the higher end is currently what we\u2019re managing to and trying to achieve through all of our activities between now and end of the year. Matt, do you have anything to add to that?", "Matt DiLiberto", "Yes. And Mike, I\u2019d say the one big variable, I touched on it earlier, you alluded to it, lease termination income for the first half of the year, it was about $2.5 million short of our expectations; and for the balance of the year, we have another $4 million baked in. So, if that doesn\u2019t materialize your 6.5 million -- or $0.065 to the bad. Now that we go into every year modeling that same amount of lease termination income $8 million a year because that is the six year historical average. So, it\u2019s not just pulled out of thin air, but it hasn\u2019t shown up this year, may not show up for the balance of the year. And if you run that out and you come out to the high end of the guidance range, well then you shouldn\u2019t raise guidance. That\u2019s Marc\u2019s point. And move guidance, move it materially and for good reason and with confidence. And so, we like the way it is.", "Michael Lewis", "I don\u2019t want to use my second question on this, but so this is will be part B of the first question.", "Marc Holliday", "No, too much in the pipeline here; we got one more bullet.", "Michael Lewis", "All right, let me shift and I want to ask about the increase in the debt and preferred equity investments, it\u2019s up quite a bit over last year, especially in this quarter. And you know when you talk about your uses of funds, debt capital being available but maybe there are some holes in the capital structure that you guys still fill. How do you kind think of that, could you grow that a little bit more and how is that attractiveness versus the other uses you might have?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I think the book did spike up a bit this quarter because the 2 Herald investment that we made has been well-publicized. That was sort of an extraordinary opportunity that we took advantage of, quick close and was probably outside of our normal sort of projections for the business for the year. So that\u2019s that -- balance is being a little bit higher than we anticipated. However, we had a significant originations model for the second half of the year, which we\u2019re in the process of lining up. So, I think we\u2019re still very comfortable operating around that 10% of total assets level on the structure finance portfolio and continue to see very good both, short trading type opportunities and longer term investment type opportunities in that business.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.", "Steve Sakwa", "Most of my questions have been I guess asked and answered, but just circling back to the pipeline Marc and sort of 1 million feet that needs to be done in the back half of the year. Realizing that you have 1 million square foot pipeline today and I assume that there is some fall out, something won\u2019t happen around or renewal might not happen, a new deal doesn\u2019t happen. What does the sort of shadow, shadow pipeline look like, and what would need to happen to the extent that some of this 1 million feet doesn\u2019t materialize, what sort of the backup plan or what else could happen between now and December to feel that gap?", "Marc Holliday", "So, a couple of things, Steve. We\u2019re setting here July 20th, I guess, right, 20, 21? And remember, I think you\u2019re referencing the June 30. It\u2019s a very dynamic shot, Steve. You sign a lease a day, 250 a year, one every business. I think that\u2019s what Steve Durels likes to tell. So, you should assume we\u2019ve already signed some between now -- between year-end and today. So, the pipeline we are giving you is as of today. We are ahead of 6, maybe closer to 7 or 6, I don\u2019t exactly the numbers, but it\u2019s probably right. And so, for another 900,000 feet, we have over 1 million square feet specified already and there is term sheets for a bunch more. So, we think we will get there and that\u2019s route for us, Steve. That\u2019s -- we usually don\u2019t miss, we usually overachieve. And between July and December, we will have new deals, like new deals that aren\u2019t even yet on our pipeline. It\u2019s still I won\u2019t say early but it\u2019s not late. So, we will have new pipeline like the moment we hang up the phone. So, we are just giving you our best estimate. We have done our reforecast; we have looked at our leasing volumes occupancy for the end of the year. We think we will hit a 1.6 million and I hope we do.", "Steven Durels", "Yes, let me sort of just reaffirm what Marc just said. It\u2019s interesting that how frequently the pipeline number changes, in fact Matt and Marc come to me with regularity saying, can you update the pipeline, and everybody gets surprised because literally in a 10-day period the numbers can change, and frequently to the positive. So, it\u2019s just a function of we\u2019re out there obviously marketing every day. And the numbers that comprise the pipeline or leases out for execution and term sheets that are being negotiated which are those term sheets that we think are highly likely to convert to a lease. There is a whole slew of proposals that are being traded within the leasing departments and the brokerage community on deals that we are fighting to get on the shortlist of a tenant\u2019s prospect.", "So, at time goes by, those will get filtered down, some number of those will convert over to leases out as well. So, it\u2019s a very fluid number.", "Steve Sakwa", "Okay. So, it sounds like between things you\u2019ve done in the last couple of weeks plus the pipeline, you are more than adequate to hit the 1.6 million. So, thank you. I guess just on going back to the DPE book that Michael Lewis asked about. Just sort of what is the market like today? And I know you sort of talked about that book maybe getting up to 2 billion, and it\u2019s pretty much there today. So, at this point anything that\u2019s newly originated does that either get sold down and you only keep a small piece of it, you expect more kind of payoffs or do you think that that book actually grows kind of well beyond the $2 billion figure?", "David Schonbraun", "Hi. It\u2019s David Schonbraun. I think, look, it\u2019s a very fluid market, so we are going to have payoffs along with originations. So, I think we are going to keep the balances in line with what we projected. So, you\u2019ll probably see a couple of loans pay off and new ones be originated. I think it\u2019s an active market. There is a lot of new capital coming in. I think we\u2019ve been able to kind of hold the yields around where we projected, but it\u2019s definitely a lot more competitive. I think in the past couple of months, activity has picked up which gives us a lot more opportunities.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital.", "Craig Mailman", "Thanks, guys. Marc, you talked earlier about maybe doing more in the buyback which I think would be helpful. But assuming maybe that doesn\u2019t move the needle here on closing the gap to NAV, I mean would you guys -- and private market values stay where they are, would you guys consider accelerating asset sales meaningfully to prove the value and potentially the special back to shareholders?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, there\u2019s a couple of different things in that question. I mean first, in terms of the accelerating sales, 7 billion in 24 months, I have to think that\u2019s sector leading. I\u2019m not sure because I don\u2019t have that data in front of me but it feels like it, certainly in the New York City marketplace. So, could we accelerate that even further? We could, but it\u2019s not -- to me, it\u2019s not about acceleration, it\u2019s about selling into a recapping when it\u2019s prudent to do so. I mean, we are in the market right now with 1515 that has nothing to do per se with buybacks. That has to do with having a business plan for the asset which we have achieved -- that which we have yet to achieve because there is still a lot more growth in that asset that we see coming down the pike. And we think it\u2019s just prudent in an asset of that size to bring in a partner right now. And like I said, we will take those moneys and decide how to deploy it, or I think to your question, potentially special dividend it if it\u2019s otherwise not tax protected. And that comes down to a matter of figuring out the mix of what you sell to generate gains and/or losses and comes down to tax structuring.", "But I don\u2019t think there is a notion here that where accelerating the plan per se from what we have for this year, we think it\u2019s a good plan. We are selling some assets this year; we are JVing some assets; we are right on plan; and we will come up with a plan for 2018 shortly and roll out some more assets and also roll in some more acquisitions, maybe some buybacks, maybe some stock dividends. But no, I would say it\u2019s not like -- I don\u2019t think there is a -- I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a swaying in our strategy, the speed at which we are executing.", "The other thing you said is, if it doesn\u2019t close the gap on NAV. It closes the gap on NAV. The issue as to whether the stock price reflects that or not is the separate issue. But, when we buy our stock back at $103 a share average and if we have a underlying valuation on the implied models in December 140 or more, you have created NAV, whether or not the stock reflects that. So, we are focused on creating value. The stock is going to have react the way it should react in a good market, and be reflective of NAV but it may or may not. But at a minimum for investors, we are creating value -- when we make investments, we think we are creating values through these buybacks.", "Jordan Sadler", "Hey Marc, it\u2019s Jordan Sadler. Thanks for that. Now that you\u2019re something of a REIT investor, I have a follow-up. Not long ago, SL Green was the best and really only pure play New York office REIT, and today there is three other at least similar players for investors to choose from. And surely, you guys are among the biggest and well leased, but how is SL Green going to differentiate itself from the rest of the field over the next three to five years, how should we be thinking about that?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I think that we are differentiated. I would like to think others are becoming more like the model we set. But our model is always changing. When we see opportunity in the retail sector, we were big retail buyers; then as the market cooled, we haven\u2019t really invested much in retail, and stabilized that portfolio. We I think are taking a pretty affirmative and leadership role here in getting out there, buying back our stock, a lot of I think our peers out there will also look to their stock as being somewhat dislocated. But, we want to be very affirmative with that. And to do that, you have to be a seller. And I think we sell more than most; I think we sell the most. And I think that\u2019s not something that\u2019s just a 2015, 2016 phenomena, you can go back 20 years. We own 28 million feet. We probably owned and sold over 20 million feet. I mean, we\u2019re a regenerator of capital. We like to eliminate value; we like to deploy that where we think we can make the most money. And for the moment, the stock we repurchase is very attractive. It\u2019s hard to say looking three to five years out, it will depend on a lot of things, with market, with the stock price and what part of the market do we like at the moment in time, office equity, retail, multi, debt and preferred equity, we have a lot of tools that are at disposal. But, first and for most we\u2019re commercial owner. And I would think three to five-year out, we will still be a very significant, if not the largest and hopefully the best commercial owner. But what will be relative sizing, we will see. But whatever it is, I just hope that the stock price is 50% more-higher than where we see it today.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with UBS.", "Nick Yulico", "Just turning back to 1515 Broadway and if you were to do a JV and sale there, what is the likelihood of being able to do something that\u2019s other than a 1031, where you could tax protect some of the proceeds.", "Marc Holliday", "I think one of our goals at 1515 is to structure that transaction in a tax efficient manner. And we have a couple of creative solutions that we\u2019re working on to achieve that goal. So, I would expect that the transaction there will be executed tax efficiently.", "Nick Yulico", "Okay. And then just going back to the guidance on same-store, Matt. Your year to date 1.5% same-store NOI growth, ex lease term income, the goal is still for 2.5% for the year. What are the items that help you in the back half of the year?", "Matt DiLiberto", "Sure. Our guidance was with lease term. So, we\u2019re actually trending even better ex lease term than the goal for 2.5% would indicate. But the back half of the year, you start to see the benefits of last year\u2019s leasing at properties like 919 Third, 280 Park, 711 Third, 125 Park, this is Bloomberg in 919, 280 Park\u2019s been leasing up, it\u2019s going be 1% vacancy by the end of the year, 711 where you saw the vacancy for the second quarter tick up; that leasing that we\u2019ve already done, kicks in, in the second half of the year. So, you\u2019re seeing the 6 to 12-month leasing activity start to flow through in the back half of the year.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.", "Vikram Malhotra", "On the none move-outs that you highlighted, can you just sort of give us an update, where are you in terms of backfilling some of that and can you remind us of any of other larger move-outs over the next 12 months?", "Matt DiLiberto", "Yes. It\u2019s Matt, Vikram. The three properties you\u2019re referencing, we reference in our press release. The 485 Lexington that\u2019s city space that rolled out in the first and second quarter that\u2019s a lease-up plan for late this year, primarily next. The other two spaces are really leased up. It\u2019s vacancy from Omnicom at 220 East 42nd Street, that space\u2019s been leased to VNS, a 300,000 feet. They will be in middle of next year, obviously not in the numbers yet. And 1515 is the Aeropostale space which as Marc just touched on earlier, has been fully leased. Some of that income will start to roll through the back half of this year and be fully in place next.", "Vikram Malhotra", "And on the move-outs, any other larger move-outs for the back half or the next few months?", "Matt DiLiberto", "No.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Okay. And then, just on One Vanderbilt, I guess from your Investor Day or just maybe over the last 12 months, you referenced the leasing pipeline keeps changing, it\u2019s very dynamic. I am just sort of wondering, over the past year, has your thought process in terms of either type of tenants or size of tenants or mix of the building, has that changed at all?", "Marc Holliday", "No, really hasn\u2019t. I mean, we\u2019ve presented to prospective tenants that have been everything from single floor users all the way up to 1 million square-foot users. The predominant profiles of the tenants have been heavily skewed towards financial services, where we have seen some big international corporate headquarters requirements as well. So, we still think that the building will ultimately is likely to be another two, maybe three tenants of size, meaning 150,000 to 200,000 square feet in the size and the balance of the building be single floor users. If we get lucky, we\u2019ll have somebody bigger, that\u2019d be good news, but our expectation is unchanged.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Petersen with Jefferies.", "Jon Petersen", "Great, thanks. I was hoping you could touch a little bit on the suburb. Leasing velocity seems to be picking up there a little bit, occupancy\u2019s been trending higher. And we noticed that market forecasts from CBRE are kind of rosy right for the suburbs which is the first in quite a while. And so, kind of pairing that together with some of the buildings you sold recently, just kind of wondering against that backdrop, are you viewing the improvement in the market as an opportunity to liquidate your suburban assets, do you want to hold on a bit and let NOI trend higher, or will there always be a suburban component for SL Green?", "Marc Holliday", "There is a lot in that question too.", "Jon Petersen", "Yes.", "Marc Holliday", "So, start with the market, I guess, is that suburban\u2026", "Matt DiLiberto", "The market is strong. The market up there again in White Plains and in Stamford in particular has been strong. We have taken advantage of that, the team up there has really been working very, very hard. They have done about two -- about 300,000 square feet of leasing year-to-date. I think we anticipate another couple of hundred thousand feet before the end of the year. And we are actually pretty far ahead. So, that\u2019s been very, very strong. With respect to what we are going to do on a going forward basis with the rest of that portfolio that\u2026", "Marc Holliday", "Right now, I think we had a -- trying to think a goal for this year of about 100, and we have met our eclipsed that already. So, there is one objective, if we can take it to the table. So right now, we have nothing more that we are concerned at the moment. Second half of the year, we will revisit, again going back to the concept of acceleration where -- I mean it\u2019s a very -- that market up there has improved. I think on the margins, we probably will try to identify another asset that we think is somewhat stabilized and/or would meet the margin nicely and try and get some optimum pricing, whether that\u2019s second half of this year or beginning of next year have no idea because that hasn\u2019t -- it\u2019s not what I\u2019ll call the focal part of the strategy for the rest of the year, having got those original sales done. And given the fact that as I said, markets are improving; mark-to-markets are up; occupancies are up. So that\u2019s all very good and really credit to the excellent team we have up there in White Plains, who on a much more limited capital regimen, manage to keep that portfolio really sort of best in class up there in that metro area. So, I think that\u2019s what we can really say about that.", "Jon Petersen", "Well, I mean I guess just to push a little harder on that. I\u2019m just kind of curious; I always viewed the suburban asset as something that you did eventually want to dispose off. So, I guess the question is since things are improving, is now the time to do a portfolio sell or a number of buildings, and I don\u2019t mean maybe in the second half of this year but just over the next couple of years, is that a possibility?", "Marc Holliday", "That may be your feeling or opinion, I\u2019m not sure we have ever. I\u2019d say, it\u2019s never been really us, I say, we have always looked at it as a relatively high yielding portfolio, the cap rates in the suburbs 6, 7, 8%. Since it\u2019s very stable and requires very little capital, and the people out there are doing excellent job, I think we have always tried to strategically pair it down where we think like I said, either book ends, something is highly stabilized or on the other end something where we just don\u2019t think we could make much of it, so smaller deals on the left hand and mature deals on the right hand. But I would say in general -- I know Steve, you just did a couple of deals up there and it\u2019s from Manhattan...", "Steven Durels", "Well, the Manhattan relationships where Omnicom just expanded by 25,000 square feet for that market which is a very -- a large deal with a highly priced tenants. There have been a number of deals that in 16 Court, which is part of the suburban portfolio. That building stabilized at this point and continues to have very good activity. So, I think now more than ever, we have seen the Manhattan portfolio and the suburban portfolio really working in tandem with one another.", "Marc Holliday", "I think it sounds probably less than 5% of revenues at this point, and shrinking each year. So, I hear what you are saying but I would say -- I think the approach we are on right now is the best approach for us, given the way we look at it. But I guess we will always be looking at that to recalibrate our thinking.", "Operator", "We do have our next question from John Guinee with Stifel.", "John Guinee", "I guess, if I was to connect all these dots, assets sales, share repurchase, special dividend, running the DPE book over 2 billion, stock price not appropriately valuing on a NAV basis. The next logical conclusion, I have is that perhaps you guys are no longer going to play by the REIT rule book and lever up to a level that management is comfortable with, rather than what the street might expect. Is that a fair statement to say, it\u2019s appropriate to lever up a bit?", "Marc Holliday", "I think we started the year -- if you measure leverage as debt to EBITDA which has its own flaws in and of itself, which I think everyone recognizes, but we still use it. 6 -- what\u2019s Matt, next 6.6, 6.7? 6.7 we sit -- with all those dots and all those things we have done, I think the 6.7 -- it\u2019s 6.8. So, 6.7 to 6.8 is lever up. I guess it is up a tenth of a turn. But no, I think that -- I do think the industry in general is at a somewhat of a competitive disadvantage in growth, operating at between 30% to 40% debt level depending on whether you\u2019re at low end or high end of the spectrum when you have most of the real estate investment rolled out there, investing closer to call it 50 to 55, maybe 60%. So, I think that\u2019s an issue that the industry faces. I have been pretty vocal about that that -- we are executing within the parameters of I think where REIT shareholders want to see debt levels. But, I think query, whether those debt levels are a reason why the growth levels for certain REITs in many markets for at least for office companies, I\u2019ll speak to them in particular, I can\u2019t speak to other sectors as much but certainly for office companies are not as accurate and not as competitive. Combined with the fact that office companies have acquired so much over the time, a lot of them and us are digesting what we have, leasing up, redeveloping, executing, JVing and the like.", "So, it\u2019s not simply a matter of operating within low leverage levels but clearly when you do go after an opportunity, if you think it\u2019s a good opportunity to stay within these parameters, it does take a little bit more cleverness and ingenuity and resourcefulness to compete with the players out there that are operating in some cases nearly two times the debt levels. So, I would say, no, I think that our debt levels are relatively consistent with where they\u2019ve been. I think our guidance at the beginning of the year was seven or below and that\u2019s where we\u2019re, and I don\u2019t really see that changing now through year end.", "John Guinee", "Great. And then, a second question, this would be more of an education question, Matt. You did the 2 Herald Square, bought the mortgage, the first trust as it appears on page 30 of your DPE book. You obviously quoted the default rate of 11.1%. Can you sort of educate as to how much will you actually collect in current income on a loan investment like this and how much you\u2019d accrue and then how you would unwind that accounting eventually?", "Matt DiLiberto", "Well, I mean the accounting rules tell you, you\u2019re only allowed to book income that you expect to collect. Our expectation is that we will collect the default rate and therefore we\u2019ve accrued at that rate. If we do get repaid and I think the handicap at this point is that we will, we will get paid the default rate from the period of time that we bought it through repayments in cash. And that\u2019s I think likely at some point over the next few months.", "John Guinee", "So, you buy the loan at 2.50 and then you accrue at 11% and you\u2019re able to get paid back at 2.50 plus 11%.", "Matt DiLiberto", "Yes.", "John Guinee", "Or you get hold of the building.", "Marc Holliday", "That\u2019s the ultimate remedy in all loan position, but yes, that\u2019s right. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors.", "Jed Reagan", "It seems like there has been a slowdown in transaction volumes so far this year in Manhattan but you mentioned earlier that there is still lot of equity capital out there and debt capital is still healthy. Curious, how you guys kind of bridge that disconnect. Are you seeing bid [ph] spreads widen out between buyers and sellers in the market, or are you seeing cap rates moving higher for office and street retail this year?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I think part of the -- there\u2019s been a fair amount of volume this year, although it is off from record levels in the last couple of years. The refinancing market is creating a very attractive alternative to sellers that can\u2019t achieve sort of very high expectations of pricing. So, we\u2019re seen several assets sort of tested on the market, if you will, and then the ownership deciding to refinance in lieu of selling at levels that are below their expectations. But, there is also quite a backlog now of deals which we would expect to be consummated in the second half of the year. So, we will definitely expect volumes to be up in the second half of the year. Just there\u2019s been a little bit of a standoff between buyers and sellers out there, and I would say deals are taking a little bit longer to get done.", "Jed Reagan", "And as far as where things are transacting value-wise, any noticeable changes on the office, street retail side?", "Andrew Mathias", "I think we haven\u2019t really seen any changes, positively or negatively. Obviously, every asset\u2019s unique. So, it\u2019s hard to sort of generalize on cap rates. But, I think the -- you are still seeing good office buildings trade, north of a 1,000 a foot sort of across the city.", "Marc Holliday", "I would just add to that, it\u2019s very disciplined equity. It\u2019s a lot of equity, that was my point earlier and I do believe there is a lot of equity out there but it\u2019s disciplined. So, at a price, you can have six offers and 5% higher, there may be none or one. And if you are the seller who is trying, not just to sort of get value but as a seller, a lot of these are irreplaceable assets, you have a tendency to want to push not just for value but value plus, that\u2019s where that standoff may get created, or that\u2019s where that elongation may arrive. I think that is more of the issue with people really trying to sort of get -- you can only sell it once, so you try to get that optimum execution. And if you are what I call realistic transactors like we are, hence we sell and JV and do a lot of deals, because especially in the context of JVs, we want to do well, we want the partners to do well. So, I think that\u2019s why we transact as much. But for sellers who are kind of one and done, they hold out for a high price and it doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s not a lot of equity out there, it just means maybe that gap, that gap maybe solved by concession, or that gap maybe solved through a financing as Andrew said, but it doesn\u2019t mean there is not a lot of participants in these deals.", "Jed Reagan", "That\u2019s helpful. And maybe just a quick one for Steve. Are you seeing any changes in taking rents and Midtown office these days and are there any sub markets where you guys are having to cut rates to track tenants?", "Steven Durels", "No, not the least. I can\u2019t think of an instance where we\u2019ve cut our rents in the past six months, and just the opposite of couple of the buildings, I think the gap between they ask and the take has narrowed a bit.", "Jed Reagan", "And broader brush that kind of feels consistent with the market in terms of rent environment?", "Steven Durels", "Yes. I am not hearing anything from the brokerage community that would be contrary to that.", "Operator", "Thank you.", "Marc Holliday", "That\u2019s it. We are all set?", "Operator", "That is correct.", "Marc Holliday", "Thank you very much everyone and we look forward to speaking again after the summer. Enjoy.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.

Thank you. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead Marc.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay, thank you and good afternoon everyone. I think you\u2019ll all be fairly pleased with our abbreviated format for today\u2019s call which follows our extremely fulsome investor presentation last month. I think that December\u2019s presentation was by far the strongest and most comprehensive one yet and I think that that was affirmed by the extremely positive feedback we got from shareholders and analysts since that date and has reflected not in substantially in the stock price since that time as well.", "So we are still very much on track with a lot of the goal and objectives we put out there about six or seven weeks ago. I think the market is forming up in a way which will still enable us to be right on track with our fairly aggressive goals that we set for ourselves and so I\u2019ll just take this opportunity now to highlight a few items occurring since that time before opening it up for Q&A.", "Last night, and pretty notably we achieved a significant milestone in the One Vanderbilt entitlement process. After lengthy negotiations in numerous meetings with Manhattan Borough President Gail Brewer and her staff the Borough President has recommended approval of the project inclusive of certain improvements we have agreed to make. There continues to be strong community support from groups like the coalition for a Better Grand Central and the straphangers campaign, both of which greatly helped us achieve this important milestone along with many other groups for which we are thankful for their support.", "At the investor conference in December Rob Schiffer explained in some detail that the euro process contains 40 steps the first being the local community board followed by the Manhattan Borough President recommendation yesterday, then onto city planning commission and finally city council.", "Next week we will be presenting the project to the city planning commission the third stop at a hearing where we hope to receive significant support from all of the key stake holders, unions, coalitions and civic groups.", "The Borough President\u2019s approval gives us great momentum as we enter into the final stages of this process and we remain confident that we will achieve our goal of the special permit for One Vanderbilt this coming May which is consistent with the timeline we set out for everybody in December.", "So, turning now towards leasing, we obviously went through a fairly exhaustive amount of information on the portfolio in the market in December and that supported I think our contention that when we would be taking a fairly sizeable step forward this year and into next year over the next 12 to 18 months and I will say right now the market environment is such that it\u2019s forming up in a way that these are meeting or exceeding our expectations. Just since December 8th we\u2019ve signed about 230,000 square feet of leases and 18 different transactions that\u2019s in the Manhattan portfolio and as you saw for the quarter, fourth quarter we were up about 13% or slightly more than that mark-to-market and nearly 15% mark-to-market for the entire year 2014.", "So I would say that that\u2019s still the primary engine on the operating side, the core earning side of what we are looking to and as I go through the pipeline with Steve Durels, I see that \u2013we\u2019ve got on top of that another 1.1 million in the pipeline as we sit here today, that\u2019s as of 28th, which is about 70 somewhat thousand square feet out for signature, half a million square feet of leasing in negotiation and then another half a million square feet that are pipeline deals in their term sheet negotiation.", "So again, anytime that pipeline exceeds or approaches a million square feet, I would call that fairly robust for the kinds of targets we had for the year which, Matt, if my memory serves me right we are about 1.8 million square feet for the year. And that\u2019s something that I think we still feel very good about given the demand that we see out there and the winnowing supply as the absorption in this market continues to accelerate.", "We had a pleasant surprise at the end of the year which I don\u2019t think has been fully \u2013 had not been really communicated in a formal way to the market yet as it relates to the Suburban leasing activity. Since December 8, the investor meeting there was a 185,000 square feet of leasing, since then 122,000 square feet of that representing new leases, total of 19 transactions and true to form, the suburban group signed eight of those deals on December 31, right into New Years eve.", "Eight different transactions, 60,000 feet [ph] which were encompassed in that 185,000 feet which made for quite a \u2013 it put quite exclamation point on the end of the year for in improving suburban market outlook as we see it, and I think you saw some of the metrics relating to mark-to-market and occupancy also trended up in the fourth quarter. So that was good news.", "I think the leasing is also punctuated by two of the recent announcement this morning. The Swarovski deal at 10 East 53rd I think its affirmation of the excellent job, the construction and design team and leasing team have done in reposition and redeveloping that asset in a way to capture these type of high quality profile tenants. Swarovski is our first new office tenant, new office tenant lease post redevelopment and that\u2019s on top of the Equinox deal we announced previously for major fitness center down in that building. So we still are very, very bullish on the prospects for 10 East 53rd this year.", "And on top of that you heard, many of you heard Brett Herschenfeld talk about significant mark-to-market in the retail portfolio back in December and I think one great example of how we\u2019ve now monetized just a small piece, but a significant piece of that mark-to-market was with their announce diesel deal of 625, Madison with many more deals in the pipeline to come from the retail leasing side.", "So that was very strong. And the debt and preferred equity front, our balances remain roughly the same through year end. I think that people saw a slight dip in the average yield reported on fourth quarter activity about 8.3%, that\u2019s actually fairly consistent with our guidance of around 8.5% and it\u2019s still leads a portfolio that\u2019s averaging 10.5% on a $1.4 billion, so I wouldn\u2019t get too overly focus on the quarterly ups and downs. We have some quarters that exceed to 10%, this quarter was 8.3%.", "I would look to the average on the $1.4 billion, 10.5% I think that the best depiction of the earnings power of that portfolio for 2015. And by way of example just already into this year we\u2019ve originated about $111 million of new debt and preferred equity investments which had a yield of just slightly under 10% in the high nine, so again that pipeline is still \u2013 we think extremely strong.", "We have fairly lofty origination goals of adding an incremental $250 million to our net balances by the end of 2015 and that\u2019s an increment that\u2019s on top of whatever the expected pay offs and redemptions are this year. So that could approximate activity certainly in excess of $600 million of gross originations.", "And looking at a pipeline in front of me now, which is about a dozen deals or so that would make a significant dent in that total and its only January. So I think that\u2019s reflective of a market that\u2019s got a very high amount of transaction activity and as a result of that transaction activity it drives financing opportunities and debt and preferred equity investments for people like us.", "Lastly, Andrew Mathias talked about unlocking opportunity in the liability side of the balance sheet and talked about all the opportunities we\u2019ve saw to take higher rate debt and either unsecured certain assets or term it out using lower more efficient and cheaper forms of secured and/or corporate bond financing is available in today\u2019s market.", "And I think one example of where we\u2019ve now monetized or illuminated that since the Investor Meeting in on 3 Columbus where we\u2019ve signed a commitment with the lender for $350 million financing at a interest rate of about 3.6% which is locked for ten years, which is a very \u2013 we think a very good piece of financing in terms of both repatriation of our substantial equity investment into that deal for a long term lock-in of rates that are very advantageous level and there is more of that to come as you remember when you extrapolate that to the whole portfolio, we should you the kinds of interest savings number that could be achieved on a full mark-to-market at today\u2019s rates, and today\u2019s rates are lower than what we projected back in December 8 due to the rise \u2013 recent rise in treasury prices. So all-in-all I think good news to report. It was a very good quarter and as important the prospects for 2015 look to be very much in line with how we hope to execute. ", "And with that, I would turn it over for questions and answers.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James Feldman of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "James Feldman", "Great. Thank you. I guess just starting out for Steve Durels or anyone in general at the investor day you had commented you'd see a premium in 2015 for big blocks of space. Can you give your latest thoughts on what's happening in the big block market today in terms of the lease-to-demand pipeline? And then, also your thoughts on competitive big blocks that will be in the market this year? ", "Steven Durels", "Sure. There\u2019s a great step which I think support that which is fact that the number of the scarcity of big block availabilities in Midtown. There\u2019s only five spaces available in Midtown that are 250,000 square feet or greater compared to ten units from year ago. So from a supply side certainly it\u2019s drying up fast.", "The number of large leases that were signed last year sort of give you trend line was dramatically larger. There were 58 leases signed last year for 100,000 square feet or more compared to 43 leases from the prior year, but more telling was the fact that there were 33 relocations rather than just renewal deals compared to only 17 large leases to prior year and those large block deals were 7.5 million square feet compared to 3.4 square feet. So clearly from the demand side and offset by the lack of supply makes us very bullish as to why this is going to premium on the big block.", "James Feldman", "Okay. And then secondly, on the suburban market, can you just talk more about who is signing leases out there and what kind of assets they\u2019re looking for? Are they rail? Are they transit served or not, just little more color on why there was a pick up in the fourth quarter?", "Isaac Zion", "Sure. This is Isaac. You are clearly seeing more activity in the transit-oriented buildings in White Plains and Stamford. And in terms of tenant types it\u2019s really across the board. You\u2019ve got legal financial services, tech, healthcare; we signed probably three or four leases north of 50,000 square feet. So there are also larger tenants coming back into the market as well and that\u2019s striving both occupancy and mark-to-market both of which have been really, really positive.", "James Feldman", "That\u2019s giving sense.", "Isaac Zion", "So for example we signed up Legal Aid for close to 30,000 square feet. Cummings & Lockwood, which is a law firm, for 55,000 feet, Sony for 53,000 feet. So it\u2019s across \u2013 it\u2019s really across the board. And this is the first time in the last two to three years that we\u2019ve seen positive direction from different tenant types not just healthcare, not just education, so it\u2019s across the entire gamut.", "James Feldman", "And are these tenants coming out of the city, or they are local tenants that are expanding?", "Isaac Zion", "The vast, vast majority are local tenants. They are either moving, they are expanding, both the positive thing here is we have seen them actually getting bigger. So if it was a 20,000 square foot tenant moving from building X to one of ours, they are now taking 22,000, 23, 000 so that\u2019s actually really positive sign.", "Marc Holliday", "Just as a note on our portfolio performance versus the market, our performance is trending towards around 84% which is better than the market. I mean, we are \u2013 I think group, the Reckson group in White Plains and Stamford are doing an excellent job of outperforming the market. So I think what Isaac is telling to you are the types of tenants we\u2019re attracting and we\u2019re wining and we\u2019re doing it on economic terms that are accretive which I think is not necessarily illustrative of the market as a whole which is improving but I don\u2019t think improving is rapidly as our portfolio.", "James Feldman", "Got it. All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Nussbaum of UBS. Your line is open.", "Ross Nussbaum", "Hey, guys. Good afternoon. We saw some market reports that you guys might have made some leasing progress at 280 Park Ave. Can you talk a little bit about where that project stands currently?", "Marc Holliday", "Sure. As we said right now we are \u2013 the only reason we didn\u2019t put a press release out covering because there\u2019s a large deal that we signed in early January with Fiduciary ", "Trust for 126,000 square feet was generally reported in the local papers. So that was deal that we\u2019ve been working on for quite a while. There was for 3.5 base floors of the building at rents that were well within our underwrite numbers, leases with 302,000 square feet of remaining office space left in the building which is about 24% of the office space.", "We have leases out on another 110,000 square feet of that availability. And then we have another close to 80,000 square feet of term sheets that we\u2019re very hopeful we\u2019ll get converted into leases within the next couple of weeks. So we\u2019ve basically completed I\u2019d say 95% of the capital program and as soon as we unveil the lobby and if you been through the building and seen the second half of the lobby that recently opened. It really opened up the floodgates as far as tenant demand.", "And where we were very optimistic and bullish on the project early last year, now it sort of high five because everybody is coming through one right after another and we\u2019re going to -- we close everything that we\u2019re working on. We\u2019ll be down to the only one base floor left in the building and beyond that, a smattering of partial spaces up in the tower.", "So we\u2019ll be \u2013 we should have the building stabilized this year without too much fear. And rents were on rise and as we saw all last it all financial service, nothing but financial services.", "Ross Nussbaum", "Great. Appreciate that. Second question either Andrew or Marc, General Growth did announce the Crown building deal on Fifth and 57th. So I guess it's a two-part question. One is, are you guys looking at \u2013 have an opportunity of putting some mezz on that deal?", "And then number two, I'm guessing you took a hard look at it, if General Growth can hit their 6% stabilized yield target in three years, I'm curious. That doesn't seem like an unreasonable number relative to where our cap rates are in Manhattan. What was it about that deal that you guys didn't see?", "Marc Holliday", "I\u2019ll let Andrew take that one.", "Andrew Mathias", "We are \u2013 I\u2019m going to not comment on the acquisition. I\u2019ll just say, we obviously underwrote the deal carefully. We knew the sellers and we didn\u2019t see that type of earning potential on our plan for the asset. And the mezzanine \u2013 we\u2019re \u2013 I honestly don\u2019t know what GGP is doing in terms of that capital stock there. So it\u2019s not an opportunity that\u2019s crossed our desk. We would certainly look at if it did. But he has generally -- the deals he bought thus far in Manhattan is generally used lower leverage and used some master leases and other structures to get its debt cost very low. So, I don\u2019t if he\u2019ll do the same on Crown or not.", "Ross Nussbaum", "Thank you. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from John Guinee of Stifel. Your line is open.", "John Guinee", "John Guinee, I'm just curious because you've never brought this up before, but One Vanderbilt, I guess you've got about 700,000 or 800,000 square feet in place, up-zoned to about 1.6 million square feet. Can you provide, I guess just on a square foot basis, what you think your land basis is going to be including your building costs, all of your fees, infrastructure cost, demo cost and so people can get a sense for whether your land basis is $200 a foot or $2,000 a buildable foot? And then what you think your total development cost is going to be on One Vanderbilt?", "Marc Holliday", "John, I think what we said in the December, we went through the building program fairly extensively in the design and the entitlement process. We are completely focused on those elements right now and getting through what\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s been a long road of assemblage acquisition, possession and now entitlements over time.", "At the conclusion of that effort when it\u2019s done and we know what we have and we know the total cost in and what we\u2019re \u2013 total envelope of the building and the exact program. I think we\u2019ll go into that in much greater detail, but that\u2019s kind of a \u2013 that\u2019s a later in the year kind of event for us. I know we\u2019ve been saying that for some time now but it\u2019s still is the case because there\u2019s a lot of different moving pieces.", "You saw even yesterday we had to make some modifications to the property that we think were good improvements and certainly good for public benefit and public realm improvement, but until everything sort of \u2013 until we have everything isolate and identified, it would be premature to going through numbers. But you can certainly look back and see what our acquisition cost are for the assemblage and that\u2019s the bulk of cost but then obviously there\u2019s all the public realm improvements, we\u2019ve been pretty specific on $210 million of cost associated with public realm improvement. And then obviously a lot of predevelopment possession cost on top of that which like I said when it\u2019s all settled we\u2019ll be able to give it better picture of.", "John Guinee", "Just intellectual curiosity, when you are taking down 800,000 square feet brick by brick, have you got any preliminary demo costs on that yet?", "Andrew Mathias", "Yes.", "John Guinee", "Okay.", "Andrew Mathias", "In line with, I mean, we do a lot of demolition in the city. This isn\u2019t the first and I would say it\u2019s certainly not the most material of items on the budget and consistent with \u2013 the kind of demolition cost we experience throughout the city. We do annually enormous volumes of demolition of space and occasionally structures.", "John Guinee", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Bilerman of Citi. Your line is open.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hey, guys, [indiscernible] Michael. Just wonder if you can comment on any changes you\u2019re seeing to the investment landscape in Manhattan and maybe if you could focus on any changing trends you\u2019re seeing from foreign buyers?", "Andrew Mathias", "I think we went through specifically at Investor Day that the trends emerging in terms of a lot of Chinese capital coming into the market. Canadian capital continuing to play a dominate role. I\u2019d say since Investor Day we\u2019ve seen Japanese capital with Mitsui Fudosan making a large investment in to Hudson Yards with related. So there\u2019s a lot of Japanese capital circulating around \u2013 there is just continued demand from all different points on the globe and in all different property types that are driving the market.", "I think you\u2019re seeing that at a trophy level and you\u2019re also seeing it a very deep level of demand for properties like 315 Park Avenue South which traded within the last quarter. And other sort of side-street and less high profile glass and steel building, which are trading at record levels throughout the city.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Have you seen any impacts from just drop in crude prices more recently or has that really not trickle down to the buyer pool yet?", "Andrew Mathias", "Hasn\u2019t trickle down to the buyer pool quite yet. I read about it as having more direct impact on condo buyers, individuals but not on the commercial land at all.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Brendan Maiorana of Well Fargo. Your line is open.", "Brendan Maiorana", "Thanks. Good afternoon. The retail disclosure that you guys provided it\u2019s helpful, I think you talked about that at the Investor Day when you gave the outlook on the significant amount of rent growth. I think there was $165 million of rent growth over the next several years. If we look stabilized retail asset either kind of retail at the base of an office building or standalone retail, how do you think the valuation of those cap rate basis stabilized retail would compare to stabilize office in the city?", "Marc Holliday", "Yes. I think it\u2019s similar, I mean, I think stabilized retail is getting slightly more aggressive bids than stabilized office. So stabilized office is sort of 4 caps stabilized retail would be 3.5, 3, 3.25 cap on prime areas. But it\u2019s hard to generalize because every property has its own market issue or opportunities that play a role in cap rates.", "Brendan Maiorana", "Okay, understood. That's helpful. And then just maybe second one for Steve Durels. So you gave very helpful color on 280 Park. You did the Swarovski deal at 10 East 53rd, and I think you are targeting stabilization or leasing of that asset more in 2016 than 2015. But can you give us a sense of how the pipeline shapes up at 10 East 53rd?", "Steve Durels", "Yes. Remember we sign the Swarovski deal for two floors that was right on the tail of signing the two floor lease with Equinox. We have another lease out right now that we just went to documents with yesterday. The capital program is pretty well advanced. If you went over there today you\u2019d see probably 80% of the lobby work is complete, still a construction zone but when you walk in there you clearly get a sense of the scale of what\u2019s happening at the ground floor and how impactful that\u2019s going to be that to reposition this building. The windows have all been replace. The fa\u00e7ade has been recolored. A lot of infrastructure works been done.", "And we\u2019ve got very strong tour activity from a mix of type of tenants. I\u2019d say for two-third of the space on the floors that are the 9,000 footers, its primarily financial services and international companies. And then ground stairs on the few floors that are little bit larger 16,000 foot floors those are more general service businesses.", "We\u2019ve got four or five proposals out there we\u2019re trading with tenant. Most of them for the top third of the building and rents in that part of the building are anywhere from 95 to 115 a foot as far as the term sheet numbers that we\u2019re going back in forth with [indiscernible] so we\u2019re feeling like we\u2019re right on plan for that.", "Brendan Maiorana", "Okay. Great. And just Steve, quickly, at the base of the building, the rent differential between that sort of 100 to 110 at the top?", "Steve Durels", "So, it\u2019s a tale of two cities in that building. The bottom nine floors, two of which have already is lease, so it\u2019s only some floors left of space to worry about. Our 16,000 feet there, they don\u2019t have the big open views of Central Park we have upstairs. But that still sort of low 70s rents, which are right in line with underwriting and put it in a very good place far as been competitive in the market.", "Brendan Maiorana", "Great. Thanks for the time.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Goldfarb of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open.", "Alex Goldfarb", "Yes. Good afternoon, thanks. Two questions here. One, Marc, on the One Vanderbilt approvals from last night, I think you said the Manhattan Borough President, she approved it. What about Dan Garodnick [indiscernible] his name, but Dan the local district councilmember, is he also signed off on it now?", "Marc Holliday", "Yes. The city \u2013 the project comes before city council as I guess what we will call the last stop or the fourth prong of what I describe earlier. So Dan Garodnick is the local councilman who is been sort of intimately involved and knowledgeable with the project. I mean the entire city council will act on this. And so, Dan and rest of council are extremely important in terms of obtaining final approval. But that comes later on in April and May.", "Alex Goldfarb", "Okay. So the Borough President, she signed off on it. Now the next political hurdle is going to the Council as a whole. But presumably Dan is on board if the Borough\u2026", "Marc Holliday", "The Borough President gave his recommend, gave her recommendation yesterday last night. And that goes now before the City Planning Commission, because there\u2019s a lot of \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of technical features to this project that have to go first before the City Administration Planning. And then with hopefully with their support and informative vote it then goes to the city council for final vote.", "Alex Goldfarb", "Okay, cool. Second question \u2013 and Matt, again, thank you for the enhanced retail disclosure. Just curious, the vacancy when you look in the columns, obviously you show the current in-place rent versus what you think the mark to market would be. And then there's the vacancy where obviously there's nothing in place, but there's the market rent of that vacant space. And all of that vacant space is materially higher than what you had in place as far as what the mark to market is on the in-place. So is this stuff that you \u2013 is this vacancy that you've acquired, or this is stuff that you're holding vacant off market waiting to obviously hit those numbers?", "Matthew Diliberto", "No. this is more vacancy that we\u2019ve acquired recently if you think particularly about what we\u2019ve acquired in 2014. We acquired a lot of things with that were either vacant or were anticipated to be vacant so we could re-tenant them. So those are more recent vantage than the occupied space.", "Alex Goldfarb", "Okay. And just for sense markup can you sort of what the old rents that used to be on this spaces were?", "Matthew Diliberto", "It did vary by property, but it\u2019s measured not in percentages, it\u2019s measured in multiples.", "Alex Goldfarb", "Okay. That\u2019s cool. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jed Reagan of Green Street Advisors.", "Your line is open.", "Jed Reagan", "Hi, guys. Its look like on the concession side, tenant improvement dollars came in a little bit last quarter but free rents on the higher side. Just wondering if you can talk broadly about trends you\u2019re seeing with concessions and when you expect those might start to improve in a meaningful way?", "Marc Holliday", "The number in any one quarter are so widely driven by whether or not we\u2019re doing large deals or small deals and how many of the deals we\u2019re doing are renewals is oppose to new transactions on space that\u2019s completely raw and needs a full concession package. So I don\u2019t know that you can glean a lot from the number from one quarter to the next. I\u2019ll tell you that broadly speaking there\u2019s seem to be greater willingness on tenants to absorb rent increases as oppose to reduction of concessions, concessions are slowly coming down a little bit, certainly by comparison two years ago they\u2019re down materially.", "But I think construction cost for tenants are going up not only because commodity prices are up and labors up, but also because how much tenants have to spend as they densify their office. Their build-out, their needs are greater, more infrastructure, more furniture, more telecom. Everything that just goes into putting a lot of people in same piece of space, and therefore that explains why the tenants are willing to pay more rent but resistant to really knocking down the concession. So I think it\u2019s going to be a slower reduction in concessions over the year where we\u2019ll see alternatively a bigger pop in rents as the years go forward.", "Jed Reagan", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then with the U.S. dollars strengthening recent, I just curious if you\u2019re seeing any evidence of impact in your retail portfolio just in terms of fall off in tourist traffic or weaker sales, and does that strong dollar change your growth strategy for Manhattan Street or New York Street retail at all?", "Steve Durels", "No, I mean to the contrary we\u2019re busy on the leasing in the retail portfolio as evidence by the diesel lease and haven\u2019t seen any \u2013 seen any reported changes or certainly haven\u2019t felt throughout the portfolio.", "Jed Reagan", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And actually any color you can offer on the diesel lease in terms of economics?", "Steve Durels", "It was an 83 increase from the prior rent which was a Baccarat space in a very strong deal and there\u2019s lot of demand on Madison.", "Jed Reagan", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Wiseman of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Ian Wiseman", "Thank you. Just a quick follow-up on the diesel deal, what was a motivating factor behind their move, I think they\u2019ve only been in that location for five years?", "Marc Holliday", "You are referring to the Fifth Avenue location", "Ian Wiseman", "Yes. Assuming they are leaving there?", "Marc Holliday", "Somebody paid them a fortune to leave.", "Ian Wiseman", "Let me ask you this question. What would be the rent differential between space in that for space on the Fifth Avenue location today versus what you\u2019re getting?", "Marc Holliday", "Probably 50%.", "Ian Wiseman", "50% higher. Okay.", "Marc Holliday", "No. Double, so the rent on Fifth Avenue was more than twice the rent on Madison.", "Ian Wiseman", "Got you. And moment they\u2019re lease up, it wasn\u2019t. How much term did they have left?", "Marc Holliday", "I think that that was sub lease I think they had through 18, but I\u2019m not positive.", "Ian Wiseman", "Okay. All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Burke of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Brad Burke", "Hi. Thank you. Good afternoon. I had a follow-up to Manny\u2019s question on investment trends, I wanted to know as you have been talking to source as a capital over the past month, do you have a sense of how their allocations are trending this year versus what they were allocating last year?", "Marc Holliday", "Allocations to\u2026", "Brad Burke", "Allocations to new investments in New York office specifically.", "Marc Holliday", "So allocations specifically Manhattan office.", "Brad Burke", "Right.", "Marc Holliday", "I don\u2019t know if we had that data, that\u2019s hard to sell with the relative allocation is \u2013 I would say that anyone who is investing domestically and in the commercial sectors here one, I mean Manhattan is generally at the top of the list in terms of desire to allocate. It\u2019s hard to say what percentage either of the whole portfolio or vis-a-vis other markets.", "But I think the \u2013 I can\u2019t say the desire is increased, I think it\u2019s always there as their primary goal we get calls daily. And that\u2019s not an exaggeration or embellishment, I mean everyday multiple, multiple calls from foreign domestic institutional, non-institutional people who either want to buy a joint venture.", "So it\u2019s hard to put that into a percentage allocation. It\u2019s just a \u2013 it\u2019s a very, very deep demand I think for every asset we have it\u2019s really a matter of price. I mean if demand is almost always there it\u2019s a question of terms and price, which is I think you see what\u2019s driving this market and driving these values to in many cases new peak levels over the prior peak in \u201906 and \u201907. But I think if you don\u2019t have any sense specifically of percentage outlook.", "Unidentified Company Speaker", "No I don\u2019t, but I think what you are saying, maybe it\u2019s still very strong, it\u2019s not maybe a little bit higher because you are seeing some foreign investors looking at different product type, not just the trophy, glass and steel they are looking at more of your B building, side street product type like, Joeva [ph] which is a Japanese group buying 449 and 24, and 28 west 25 and 40 west 25. I think historically you wouldn\u2019t have seen that, so clearly appetite is strong because those are the assets that are available.", "Brad Burke", "Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe moving out of the city to the suburbs. Obviously you've had some leasing momentum there, and I know you wanted to sell more in the suburbs. Can you give us a sense of what you're seeing in cap rate momentum? And do you also have a sense whether there are buyers that are getting sticker shock in the city and are looking to allocate more to suburban property?", "Marc Holliday", "There still haven\u2019t been enough trades to see exactly where our cap rates are actually going. And every building they are so unique in terms of tripling their leases, all the buildings are 50% leased but we have seen some transactions in Connecticut and in Northern Jersey that are basically been people who have owned lands or building some Brooklyn, Queens the city and they are 10 30 [ph] running out of those assets into the old same Connecticut and Westchester. So we are seeing that as a little bit of a trend.", "Unidentified Company Speaker", "I think the sequence is generally the market first and I think we\u2019re seeing market improvement, then the financing, the finance ability of these assets and we are seeing decent bids out there from lenders and securitized and non-securitized lenders, willing to lend at attractive rates up in some of these metro markets outside of New York city proper. And I think the last piece of that is then the investor demand driving cap rates to compress which I would think that\u2019s probably will be happening this year.", "Yes just based on the first two province being in place, can\u2019t say that we can give you evidence or specifics to that effect, but you always don\u2019t want to be looking in the rear view mirror, so if you want to go out on the [Indiscernible] make a bit of forecast, I would say you will start to see those cap rates compress this year.", "Brad Burke", "Okay. That\u2019s interesting, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jordan Saddler, Keybanc Markets. Your line is open", "Jordan Saddler", "Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow up a little bit I think tangent ally [ph] to the last question. And I appreciate the update since the investor day in early December. I can't help but notice that interest rates are down a full 50 basis points as you pointed out. So it increases the opportunity on the liability side of the balance sheet as you talked about. But what are you guys thinking on the asset side of the balance sheet given this pretty material shift?", "Marc Holliday", "So I think that on the asset side, there is really two things. It enhances our strategy of selectively disposing of assets. We did a substantial amount of dispositions in 2014 that was kind of punctuated by the almost $0.5 billion of sales, 180 Maiden lane which just closed, I think this month. So that\u2019s a fairly significant deal right on the heels of 2 Herald which I think also closed there in the fourth quarter of December.", "So we will continue to sell into that market. I don\u2019t think the 50 basis points means we\u2019ll sell more or less. I mean we had a plan, we\u2019re on plan maybe it means on the margins we are going to get some higher pricing. I don\u2019t think the 50 basis points of treasury is necessarily basis point or basis point equal to reduction and financing rates because when you get below 3.5% for 10 year money, I think it starts to get a bit sticky in terms of what the absolute rate will be for 10 year, I owe money.", "But clearly the financing rates have come in and we\u2019ll take advantage of that on the liability side as Andrew talked about, it should add incrementally to the sales and obviously on our acquisitions we are underwriting lower rates right now, so either higher levered returns or it could drive pricing a bit further. But we tend to model on our underwriting everything is towards stabilized markets, so we are never just taking the spot market cap rate, the spot market financing rate on acquisitions, we are always modeling the curve, we often \u2013 on like where we\u2019ve modeled the curve plus a 50 basis point cushion which I think many of you, some of you may not.", "We hold our exit cap rates pretty stable at levels far in excess of where the spot market, the cap rates are today and I think that hurts us a bit on cap rate, but it certainly protects us in the future against any kind of cap rate increase and we keep our absolute level of returns pretty consistent looking to stabilize at 6% or more current cash returns and 8% to 10% levered returns and that probably translates into 6.5% to 8% returns.", "So that I think is not varying greatly because of the interest rate decline, but on the margin it certainly is up.", "Jordan Saddler", "Thanks for the color. And a follow up for Steve on the demand for space from financial services specifically I\u2019m kind of curious, you guys had mentioned that in December and it sounds like its materializing. What\u2019s the nature of it and how deep is it?", "Steven Durels", "I would say it\u2019s the largest user group in our portfolio as far as prospects right now. Total number of transactions in the pipeline, total square footage, part of that is reflective of the inventory that we currently have available so I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a barometer, gives you the inside as to the overall market color but based upon the kinds of buildings, the kinds of floors in other price points that we currently have availability 10 East 53rd Street Tower 46 280 Park Avenue being best examples. Based on \u2013 all geared towards financial service industry tenants. Behind that we\u2019ve got some pretty good pipeline with the TAMI industry information services in particular, where we\u2019ve got high hopes that we are going to converse some of that over to some significant transactions.", "Jordan Saddler", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question comes from Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Vance Edelson", "Terrific, thanks. I\u2019ll just start with another Suburban question, would you describe your sentiment around the Suburbs is flexible at all not just on cap rates and financing rates, but given all the leasing sign at the end of December and that you are winning in the market with these assets, what\u2019s your appetite for curtailing dispositions or is it less a cyclical decision in more a secular feel for where you want to focus long term?", "Steven Durels", "Our Suburban portfolio has I think serves an important function in terms of it\u2019s fairly consistent cash flow. I mean, it\u2019s fairly low, it\u2019s a low consumer on the capital end of things as compared to the Manhattan portfolio so that\u2019s certainly a great attraction to the portfolio on why I think it\u2019s always play the key role for us is that it\u2019s a relatively unencumbered portfolio, its maintained occupancy in the low eighties, I think since we acquired it, sort of at a very tough period of time in 2007, 2008. The capital budget for that portfolio is very manageable and the market is picking up, so it\u2019s a contributor to the bottom line.", "So we like that portfolio, it was pruned down from a much larger portfolio at the time we originally closed on the western transaction and we kept what we felt were the best properties and the best markets and I think that proved to be true during the downturn and we had the team of about 30 people up there that run this portfolio in White Plains and Stanford that are I think best in class.", "And so everything we do there is no wholesale decision to hold, there is no wholesale decision to sell, I think everything is we look at is fairly opportunistic and if we can bring properties to stabilizations and a very strong bid comes back in the market and we have redeployment opportunities then I think you will see us execute on that program as we have in the past, but I don\u2019t see current conditions driving that significantly in one direction or the other, I think we are just going to continue with\u2026", "Vance Edelson", "Okay that's helpful. Then back on the tenant strength by vertical, so it's pretty widespread in the suburbs, and you also mentioned 280 Park being all financial services so to speak. And financial services representing the biggest user group now. If you had to compare the traditional verticals to TAMI though, can you just give us a feel -- do the traditional still pale in comparison to tech and so forth when it comes to growth and your feel for future growth, or is it really becoming a more balanced market?", "Steven Durels", "Well I think I think we\u2019ve been saying for the past couple of years quite frankly that the good news is that Manhattan is not as dependent upon financial services is what everybody felt years ago, because of one, the emergence of TAMI as being a big driver in the market place. So now it\u2019s TAMI legal and financial services and then followed by general business services. So you\u2019ve got really four big groups providing diversification as far as tenant demand goes.", "On the financial service side, I think it\u2019s mostly the same as what we\u2019ve seen for the past year, year and a half which is the profile of that group has been asset management, hedge funds, private equity the commercial banking. You haven\u2019t yet seen the really big banks and the investment banks active in the market, although I think there is a couple of requirements kicking around today that weren\u2019t there a year, year and a half ago.", "And part of that\u2019s driven on the investment banking requirements either by consolidations or lease expirations that are coming up. And one of the brokers that I speak to and now I think generally have a shared view which is that the banks are hopefully past understanding the regulations, they are new world environment, they are short on space nobody is sitting on a lot of excess inventory and they are sort of primed [ph] to start to come back into the market as they figure out how they can grow their businesses. So we think that\u2019s going to be a big tribute in the period to come.", "Vance Edelson", "Okay. That\u2019s good color. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. I\u2019m not showing any further questions in queue. I would like to turn the call back over to management for any further remarks.", "Marc Holliday", "Nothing further. We brought it in under an hour, so we thank all of you for listening in and look forward to the next time.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference.

This conference call is being recorded. At this time, the company would like to remind the listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements.", "Actual results may differ from predictions that management may make today. Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the company\u2019s Form 10-K and the other reports filed with the SEC. Also during today\u2019s conference call, the company may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC Regulation G.", "The GAAP financial measures most difficulty compare to each non-GAAP financial measures discussed and the reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found at the company\u2019s website at www.slgreen.com, by selecting the press release regarding the company\u2019s fourth quarter year end earnings.", "In December executive management provided substantial commentary at its Investor Conference,  addressing those past performance as well as detailing the estimates for 2010. Therefore for today\u2019s call we will be utilizing an abbreviated format from that of quarter\u2019s past. ", "Initial commentary will come only from Chief Executive Officer, Marc Holliday. Then we will turn the call over immediately to Q&A. As a reminder for the Q&A section, please limit your questions to two per person. ", "Thank you, I will now turn the call over Marc Holliday.", "Marc Holliday", "Thank you Heidi, and as Heidi just mentioned we had last month our Investor Conference which turned out to be very successful and very well attended event and appreciation to all who attended and participated.", "At the conference we discussed in detail numerous topics impacting the SLG portfolio and set out near-term goals and objectives. The year has just begun but we are well on the way to accomplishing many of the goals and objectives that we set out in December and I think many of those accomplishments can be seen either in the fourth quarter results or in the leasing release that we put out there this morning for some recent events.", "I\u2019d like to review with you some of the goals and objectives for 2010, talk about how the recent activity is pointing us in the right direction and then we\u2019ll open it up for some Q&A. ", "First goal and objective was to sign greater than 1.5 million square feet of Manhattan leasing. We made great strides towards that as you saw this morning with the recent renewal of BMW at 555 West 57th Street in a transaction for 228,000 square feet. Those conversations were ongoing for quite some time but I\u2019m happy to report that we and BMW were able to agree and get the lease done and I think in part the sentiments towards a bottomed market that is about to rise again helped spur those discussions towards a conclusion.", "And if you look how that lease plays into some other of our totals. We now have reduced expirations in 2010, 2011, and 2012 by 388,000 square feet in total against what you see in the fourth quarter supplemental. So, there was substantial inroads we made into future leasing just in this recent quarter and I think that really is illustrative of a market that we started talking about as being recovering on the last call and certainly in our December Investor meeting. ", "Overall Manhattan vacancies stayed level at around 11.25%. Midtown vacancy is right around 12% with nine direct three sublet and basically even fourth quarter over third quarter in that regard. In December market-wide there was in Midtown 1.6 million square feet of leasing which resulted in positive absorption in December, the second month in a row, and currently we have 30 leases out being negotiated covering 650,000 square feet. So certainly as it relates to the market and our leasing goals, I think we\u2019re on track. ", "Second one to note was the sourcing of $250 million of new investment opportunities just days after having the Investor Conference we announced the acquisition of a first mortgage position with $189 million of funded outstanding balance on 510 Madison Avenue. And while we are limited and I\u2019ll be limited as to what we can discuss regarding this investment in the Q&A, I can tell you that we think it\u2019s a terrific asset, very well located and we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re going to meet or exceed our investment objective with respect to this asset. ", "Moving onto 1515 Broadway, we set out multiple goals. One was the repositioning of the retail and with the signing and announcement this morning of the Aeropostale lease at 1515 Broadway for 17,000 square feet of space which some of which was taken back from an existing tenant and some of which was recaptured from Viacom, when we did our early lease renewal. I\u2019m thinking about almost two years ago now, the combination of those events puts us very far along to complete retail repositioning that we had announced to people and the value added component of the space take back is now largely completed with this lease. ", "Also we were able to refinance the maturing debt on 1515 Broadway, you will recall there was $625 million maturing in 2010. And we announced just within the past few weeks the successful closing of that transaction with a new $475 million five year mortgage loan which basically puts that building\u2019s capital structure to bed for the intermediate term. ", "So the combination of the Viacom early lease renewal with the retail repositioning, the refinancing of the indebtedness, and the completion of the redevelopment which was completed on January 1 and on time, this asset is largely repositioned, recapitalized, and for the time being put to bed for us. ", "There was also goals with respect to completing the foreclosure and commencing the repositioning on 100 Church Street, there again within the past few days or weeks, we announced the successful completion of the foreclosure, consolidation of ownership and extension and modification of underlying indebtedness on 100 Church Street, all of which is now behind us, we will be able to successfully move forward with an aggressive marketing campaign that as I said in December, we hope to at a minimum have 150,000 to 200,000 square feet of tenants identified and under lease in 2010.", "All of this activity in part used cash and with our goal of maintaining floor liquidity of $350 million of unrestricted cash, we found an opportunity in the market to issue $125 million of preferred equity at terms we believe were attractive for the company, continues our goal and overwriting objective of deleveraging which we\u2019ve been doing now for 18 months, that we made substantial strides in that regard. ", "So much so that we\u2019ve partially obtained another one of our goals which was the upgrading of the rating on the RECs and bonds where Moody\u2019s just recently came out and raised the rating on the outlook to stable on RECs and bonds. So we were happy to be able to get all of that done on the balance sheet side and lastly, while it doesn\u2019t fit into any of the specific goals and objectives we posted in December, we did complete the successful restructuring and modification of the indebtedness at [6 26th] Avenue, that was something that I think had been reported as in foreclosure.", "But since that time we\u2019ve been able to come to agreement with the borrowing groups who have invested new cash equity on a subordinated basis into the property and as such we will be returning that asset to performing status. ", "So I would say all in all, that was not only a very successful quarter but quite a busy and very satisfying six or seven weeks since the Investor meeting and we wanted to give you that as an update because its more than we frankly had expected. All these things we felt were likely to occur just not as rapidly as they wound up occurring. ", "We\u2019re happy that they did and it really just sets us up that much better for 2010. Here we are still just the middle of January and I think we\u2019re in great shape towards finishing off all the other goals and objectives that we have remaining for the year. So, with that I\u2019d like to open this up for Q&A. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of John Guinee - Stifel Nicolaus", "John Guinee - Stifel Nicolaus", "A lot of activity, good, okay. ", "Marc Holliday ", "Its all in perspective, I read this morning not a lot, so its all a matter of perspective. ", "John Guinee - Stifel Nicolaus", "Good point, can you just clarify for us on both 510 Madison and 100 Church, what your investment is to date, how much more money you expect to put in for the base building, your TI lease commission budget, your OpEx carry budget, and then your imputed cost of capital through till stabilization in just sort of round numbers. ", "Marc Holliday ", "I think the first part is, I don\u2019t know that we really can do that. We don\u2019t punt on questions, but this one, its in the structured finance book. The note amount I mentioned earlier was $189 million plus or minus that\u2019s been funded. There are facilities for future funding but that the borrower may or may not be eligible for as time permits and its very hard to say at this time what will ultimately be expended by us on the project not knowing exactly the outcome of the indebtedness.", "So I think we have to just take a pass on that one and fortunately maybe give you more color in the future as it comes to pass.", "John Guinee - Stifel Nicolaus", "And how about 100 Church. ", "Marc Holliday ", "There with respect to 100 Church, just so I get it, what exactly is the question. ", "John Guinee - Stifel Nicolaus", "What your investment is to date, additional budget for base building capital, TI and leasing commission budget, other imputed costs until you get to stabilization so that people can figure out what your expected basis will be in the asset.", "Andrew Mathias ", "Our basis today is around $55 million in terms of cash and with the transaction we did with Gramercy Capital and the participation we would peg that today net of cash reserves at the loan level, at around $150.00 a square foot. And we would anticipate to be stabilizing the asset, obviously it\u2019s a function of the time it takes to lease it up and the type of concessions we have to do to tenancy on top of that, but we do have 600,000 square feet or so to lease of the building and we\u2019re encouraged by the activity we\u2019ve experienced thus far. ", "Marc Holliday ", "But its safe to say the bulk of the TI and leasing is sitting in cash with the lender at this point, available for draw. ", "Andrew Mathias ", "Yes, that will be additive to basis that I gave, but yes.", "John Guinee - Stifel Nicolaus", "And your basis right now is roughly $150.00 a foot on the loan and another $55 million in equity. ", "Andrew Mathias ", "The $150.00 includes the $55 million of equity. [inaudible] because there\u2019s no more loans, it was foreclosed so we have $55 million of cash invested in our basis and the asset has run $150.00 per square foot but that\u2019s net of cash reserves held at the loan level so I guess Marc\u2019s point is you shouldn\u2019t expect to see our cash basis increase significantly because we\u2019ll be spending reserves from the loan level and you\u2019ll see the basis rise but you won\u2019t see our cash investment go up significantly from $55 million, we don\u2019t project. ", "Marc Holliday ", "Right and the total per foot we think on a fully funded basis is somewhere between $200.00 and $225.00 a foot. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ian Weissman - ISI Group", "Ian Weissman - ISI Group", "Can you just talk a little bit about the acquisition market, you tested the market late last year with 45 Lex, we hear there\u2019s a lot of capital out there, just not a lot of product, do you see yourselves coming back to market with additional assets this year. ", "Marc Holliday ", "I think you should expect us to come back. Its really going to be a question of whether we come back with something larger along the lines of a 485 Lex or whether the market will be open to properties that we\u2019ve sold in the past which have typically represented our non-core product where we don\u2019t think we can get enough value added return and pare down sort of the lower 10% to 15% of the portfolio and sell that.", "I think that would be our preference because that\u2019s consistent with our business strategy over many years. The market for that was not there last year because people were limited capital there was, was only focusing on pure well located Class A assets but I think as capital on the sidelines realizes that it can\u2019t necessary meet its yield objectives for what they were hoping to get higher returns on Midtown assets that they\u2019ll reach further into other asset classes that we may be able to sell properties into for our own business purposes. ", "So I think the answer is you\u2019ll definitely see us continue to be an asset recycler in 2010 but we are reconsidering which assets to bring back to market and at what price levels. ", "Ian Weissman - ISI Group", "Just as a follow-up to that, what are the return hurdles that the capital on the sidelines today is looking for. ", "Marc Holliday ", "Well I think it depends on which assets. There are people that I think would love to own Midtown assets at unlevered returns, nine to 10 and levered returns of low to mid teens for dead on Class A assets. Those are very hard to come by so I think you need to be very creative and you\u2019ve got to be pretty flexible in structuring in order to achieve those kinds of results. ", "But I would say that\u2019s where we\u2019ve targeted, set our sights at kind of 8% to 10% unlevered and 12% to low teens kind of levered returns for good core product. So I think that\u2019s where capital should be. People are probably looking for returns that are even higher than that, at least on a levered basis. But I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see any transactions because there\u2019s just nothing available at numbers north of that, that would fit the, what I would call good, well located Midtown assets. ", "Ian Weissman - ISI Group", "Would you put a dollar value out there today on what you think you could sell this year, or not ready to do that. ", "Marc Holliday ", "No, I think we should hold off because its not going to be, this will be driven more by how much capital we can generate as opposed to the nominal headline amount of volume so it could be a smaller unencumbered asset that\u2019s, where we get all equity or it could be a levered asset where it may have a bigger headline price but a much smaller amount of equity. ", "I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve set any targets in that regard. We put out an acquisition goal of $250 million. I think that we\u2019ll wait and see on the sales but I can almost be certain that we\u2019ll be delivering product into the market and none of what we hold today is small product. ", "Unspecified Company Representative", "And that will obviously be influenced by the amount of investment opportunity we see as well. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors ", "Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors ", "Can you provide any update that there may be on Aqueduct.", "Marc Holliday ", "There\u2019s really no update that I have on Aqueduct over and above what we reported back in December. Unfortunately its still a decision that is reportedly imminent and I think everybody seems to be anxious for a conclusion to the process, us included. ", "But I can\u2019t really tell you that there\u2019s any series advancement one way or the other since the Investor meeting where we covered Aqueduct in some level of detail. What I would tell you is we\u2019re certainly hopeful that the decision makers will reach a consensus as early as this week and hopefully we\u2019ll be selected given what I think we\u2019ve proposed as the best in class team and the best proposal for the state. ", "But we\u2019ve had that proposal out there for some time now and we\u2019re just actually awaiting the conclusion. ", "Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors ", "And then on the Graybar Building, it looked like there was a noticeable decline in occupancy this quarter, I\u2019m just curious if that took you by surprise and then also I think that you have historically thought of that as at least indicative of the small tenant market, any conclusions there on what happened at that building or any comment. ", "Unspecified Company Representative", "No, we took a couple of pieces of space back that were part of our restructuring, some tenants that got into trouble. Those discussions sort of were in the middle of the year and then by the time we worked ourselves through it and took it back it was, it came into the fourth quarter. But the volume of transactions as we sit here today in Graybar is still pretty healthy. ", "I don\u2019t really see, I\u2019ll give you just a quick edit. We\u2019re doing a deal right now for 12,000 square feet and leases are pretty well advanced in discussions and it looks like that deal may get knocked out by somebody who wants to do a deal for twice as much square footage so we still have good activity and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a huge, anything you should read into it. ", "It just happens to be that this year and next year, are big lease rollover years for this building and so we\u2019re going to see a little bit of erosion in occupancy because of that but I still think the leasing activity is going to hold up. ", "Unspecified Company Representative", "And I think that was contemplated in kind of where we forecasted the occupancy to end up. You saw it drops there, you also saw it drops over $13.50 that we\u2019re kind of also expected, and so you\u2019ll see rebounds here in the first half of the year but that was contemplated as part of where we thought we\u2019d end the year up.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman \u2013 B of A Merrill Lynch ", "Jamie Feldman \u2013 B of A Merrill Lynch ", "I was just wanting to get a little bit color about how you\u2019re thinking about TI and rents in the early stages of a recovering or bottoming market. ", "Unspecified Company Representative", "I think the general consensus amongst owners and certainly from our perspective is that we\u2019re going to see concessions tighten up this year. I haven\u2019t seen a material increase in the concessions that we\u2019re giving tenants or even in tenant proposals in the past, I\u2019ll call it six months. And I think the general feeling is that as the year goes on you\u2019re going to see the first thing that will happen in an improving market is the concessions will tighten up, security deposits will increase, the length of leases will increase, and we\u2019re already starting to get [signs] for that. ", "Having said that, there\u2019s still a big demand from tenants out there who are looking to preserve their capital and are looking for built spaces but what they\u2019re finding when they go into the market are fewer less willingness by landlords to actually spend a full ticket to do a complete build out on spaces and they\u2019re finding sublease spaces that are of high quality becoming fewer opportunities. ", "So I think that combination is going to drive concessions to reduce throughout the year. ", "Marc Holliday ", "I would just add you should expect that in the first and second quarters next year that you\u2019re going to see it back at the levels that we saw in the second and third quarter this year, the fourth quarter we came in on average of 14 because we were able to do a great renewal with BMW that had very, very limited capital and that\u2019s why the average ticked down to just 14 for the quarter so a great kind of as is deal. ", "But they will be to the first half of next year, a little bit fuller than that, first half of 2010. ", "Jamie Feldman \u2013 B of A Merrill Lynch ", "And then do these kind of market fundamentals also extend to the suburban portfolio. ", "Marc Holliday ", "I think that has its own set of dynamics in the suburban portfolio. There again there was a substantial amount of leasing that was done in the fourth quarter. There was some rental erosion which showed up on a percentage basis on the dollar basis. Its modest because the rents were fairly loaded to begin with and there I think we\u2019re competing on the basis of concessions still but its just the dollars are so much less as compared to what we are confronted with here in Manhattan that we don\u2019t think its going to have a significant impact on cash flow or the way we look at it in those terms. ", "But its clearly something that we have to competitive with and the TI terms there are still, the markets there is not as advanced as it is in Manhattan. ", "Unspecified Company Representative", "I would just add to that you did see a big uptick in the suburbs on [free] rent and portfolio this quarter where it averaged 7.8 months, but that was really attributable to a single 11 year deal that we did where we ended up giving a year free so that was a longer than usual term, so long-term lease there so you did see higher than normal free rent on, for the quarter out there. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "I\u2019m not sure I recall from the Investor Day but could you just update us on the structured finance. You\u2019ve got I guess close to $400 million that matures in 2010, are you expecting any cash I guess on the balance sheet from those transactions or I guess what needs to take place in order for that to realize, to get your cash back. ", "Unspecified Company Representative", "Included in that number is the 510 funding that we just did. So that money just went out the door. I think its reasonable at this point to expect, we need to see where 510 is going to fall out on the balance of those we would expect at this point minimal repayments and are kind of working through some restructuring there. ", "Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "And just to be clear on 510 there\u2019s virtually, does that sit almost 100% vacant today. ", "Andrew Mathias ", "Yes, the construction is not completed yet, so its scheduled to be completed around May, between March and May and there are two leases signed at the property, but nobody is in occupancy now. ", "Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "But in terms of what\u2019s been leased to date\u2014", "Marc Holliday ", "The two leases that Andrew just referred to. ", "Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "And as a percentage is that 10% of the building or\u2014", "Marc Holliday ", "A small percentage of the building. The building, I don\u2019t know how aggressively its been marketed until its gotten closer to its completion date. ", "Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "And I guess, the decision to issue the preferred, I know you obviously just got the upgrade on the RECs and bonds, but would you consider issuing unsecureds and I guess at what rate, does that make sense. ", "Unspecified Company Representative", "I think the decision to issue the, if you look back when we [inaudible] our equity offering it hadn\u2019t contemplated really many new investments so making the sizable investment that we did at 510 we thought it important to get some additional equity into the company. We got some indications from some folks that were interested in putting money out in those type of securities and so we went ahead and [upsided] that deal at pricing that would really suggest that it was an investment grade credit. ", "We are as Marc alluded to spending time with the agencies trying to get an upgrade as to where we\u2019re rated there and so think if you look in other instances I think its reasonable to think that unsecured notes could trade anywhere between 25 and 75 basis points, kind of inside where pref equity trades with subordinate. ", "So that deal went off at 8 1/8 so that kind of spread is inside of there is I think the right way to think about it. ", "Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "You had mentioned the 650,000 square feet of potential leasing, how much has that changed in the last say 30 to 60 days, is that pool growing or\u2014", "Marc Holliday ", "We had a big [queue] going into December and January which we just, the results of which you\u2019ve just seen in the various releases. So I would say its growing for sure over what we\u2019ve had in the second half of the year and its grown considerably over what we had in the first half of the year. So its headed in the right direction.", "It\u2019s a large amount of space that we\u2019re working on and I think that [queue] will grow as the market continues to improve. ", "Unspecified Company Representative", "The other thing to remember is we posted a slide at the Investor Conference that showed leases that had been closed to date and then kind of deals that were out for signature that were going to bring it up and I think that number was roughly 500 to 600,000 square feet of deals that were out. So we closed the DE Shaw, BMW and a couple of others and in the last 30 days have replenished that 350,000-plus square feet of deals that we\u2019ve already closed. So the good news is it wasn\u2019t just sort of like a pop in activity in December. It was a pop that seems to be carrying forward as we go into 2010.", "Marc Holliday ", "I would just add that when you\u2019re looking at potential for job growth, the securities industry has lost something like 28,000 jobs since the recent peak in January, 2008. And in December the securities industry added modestly, but added more jobs than it has since the summer of 2008 and that I think is very telling because as the financials begin to improve and the overall job outlook continues to stabilize we would expect that to translate directly into leasing activity and that queue will get larger.", "But clearly when we look at statistics like temporary employment stats which have leveled off, securities industry employment stats, which have gotten modestly positive after many, many months of dropping 1,000 to 2,000 a month, we\u2019re [emboldened] by that. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc", "Could you provide some color on the reserves that were taken this quarter. What were they surrounding and maybe the magnitude seemed a little bit higher than you had anticipated a few weeks ago, so maybe just discuss what came about. ", "Unspecified Company Representative", "Its principally related to two positions, one\u2019s on a mortgage position out in New Jersey where we had been working closely with the senior lender there and we\u2019re hopeful of getting a restructuring done. Its unclear that that\u2019s going to come to pass so we took the opportunity to go ahead and reserve that position. ", "And then the other position is a mezzanine piece where the borrower has a pay in kind option and elected on their semi annual payment to go for paying in kind and actually not pay there in December so given that which was not entirely expected, we went ahead and took a reserve against that position until we get greater color as to what\u2019s going to transpire there on a very sizable corporate position. ", "We\u2019re a small piece of it but it\u2019s a sizable restructure. Those are the two positions that kind of drove the lion share of that reserve. ", "Jordan Sadler \u2013 KeyBanc", "Did you say that was in New York property.", "Marc Holliday ", "The first one was a New Jersey property where we think that just given values, what happened there, its highly impaired and the second one is a Mountain New York corporate credit where we reserved essentially half the investment. ", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc", "And then just as a follow-up maybe you could walk us through, I know you\u2019re limited in terms of what you can discuss on 510 Madison, but what is sort of the opportunity set in that 510 Madison type investment as you see it here. I mean, making more investments through the structured finance book. ", "Marc Holliday ", "Not to base it on 510, I mean we have had and continue to have an active structured finance book in Manhattan. The Manhattan book as we\u2019ve said in the past is we perform much, much better until the return, than we have in the non-New York book. And its created I guess at this point five good pipeline investments for us so I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s not a new door that\u2019s opening for us, its just a continuation of a program that\u2019s been very profitable in the past over $250 million of aggregate profits, five pipeline buildings, and a book of assets in New York whether its already on book which we think is a good solid book of assets in New York or an ability to add to that with some new origination opportunities, acquisition opportunities.", "We are seeing more and more of that and I think within our sweet spot in New York we\u2019re continuing to be active. Generally on a smaller scale than 510 but 510 was somewhat in our eyes a unique opportunity. ", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc", "Is it safe to assume that you\u2019d expect something else to unfold there and we shouldn\u2019t expect that the 2.9% return you highlighted in the supplemental is sort of the end all. ", "Andrew Mathias ", "The loan matures in March, so there\u2019s several scenarios, obviously that can play out in March but that return won\u2019t hold beyond then. ", "Unspecified Company Representative", "If you look at the footnote in the supplemental, that return excludes the discount so the related amortization, so I think whether the loan gets paid off or something else happens, that it would meet the requisite return requirements that Marc had highlighted earlier in the call. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Josh Attie - Citi", "Josh Attie - Citi", "You noted in the press release that tenants are coming to you and asking for early extensions, what would you need to see fundamentally for you to be less inclined to renew leases today that may expire in 2011 and beyond. ", "Marc Holliday ", "I think we\u2019re always pretty desirous of doing that and we\u2019ve talked about that a lot as part of our strategy. I mean the only way we wouldn\u2019t do it is if we just think that the terms being requested today are out of market with what I would call, not the future leasing market, but the market today over the next year or two. ", "So I think we\u2019re looking for a reasonable balance. A lot of tenants are willing to commit to transactions on that basis and we\u2019ve evidenced that with 1.5 million square feet of leasing in 2009 where the contractual expirations I think were under 800,000. So clearly the balance of that leasing is all future activity and we think that basically acts as a stabilizing force in the portfolio and gives us negotiating strength with other tenants as well. ", "So I think we\u2019re pretty desirous, the only thing I would point to is if somebody comes out with some unreasonable expectations particularly on concessions. If its an existing tenant who\u2019s looking for unreasonable concessions then we just won\u2019t do it. ", "Josh Attie - Citi", "So we shouldn\u2019t interpret that as that you don\u2019t necessarily think that its going to be a much better leasing environment in 2011 and 2012. ", "Marc Holliday ", "So you shouldn\u2019t interpret\u2014", "Unspecified Company Representative", "Even at the height of the market you\u2019ll recall that we had the same philosophy. We never took the position of holding vacancy simply to ride the market. Recognizing that we have 900 to 1.5 million square feet of roll every single year, it would be imprudent to let that number get too big simply because we thought the market was going to fall in our favor. ", "It\u2019s a much more conservative approach towards managing our rent roll. ", "", "Marc Holliday ", "Other landlords do, we don\u2019t and its not market timing, we just don\u2019t do that as a corporate policy. We blend and extend at, market or reasonably foreseeable market for players and we\u2019re not going to whether we thought the market was going up dramatically or not, we\u2019ve got space maturing in future years that will deliver into that increased market. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Wells Fargo ", "Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Wells Fargo ", "You talked about the return requirements and expectations for the Class A or core properties, can you give us a sense of where the returns are, the return threshold for some of the non-core or smaller assets and how narrow does that spread need to get before you\u2019d look to sell some of your smaller or non-trophy type assets relative to monetizing gains in some of the core or trophy assets. ", "Andrew Mathias ", "I think in the smaller non-core assets, you\u2019re likely looking at sort of 200 to 400 basis points premium to the returns that Marc cited. There\u2019s still not a lot of trading in those assets as well and generally where they\u2019re stabilized they\u2019re getting a lot of bids. Where they\u2019re not stabilized and where there\u2019s large vacancies you\u2019re seeing people try to demand more opportunistic returns. ", "I think the dynamic we saw in 2005, 2006, and 2007 where that gap narrowed to call it zero to 100 basis points where the B\u2019s were trading right on top of the A\u2019s, was a time when we took advantage of selling a lot of Class B assets and we look for similar types of conditions or particular opportunities within some of the smaller non-core buildings in order to make a decision to sell. ", "Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Wells Fargo ", "And then do you think there has been a change or more aggressive underwriting assumptions in terms of forward expectations of occupancy rates concessions on the part of buyers to drive their return requirements. ", "Andrew Mathias ", "Yes, and I think certainly the assets that are being marketed and the buyers who are buying are putting in increasing rents in their models. At today\u2019s rent and today\u2019s concession packages, it would be very difficult to achieve the type of prices we\u2019ve seen when assets, the few assets that have sold have traded.", "I think generally people are modeling rental growth, concession tightening this year, rental growth starting in 2011 and the return to a more normal market as vacancy declines a bit. ", "Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Wells Fargo ", "And have you gotten more aggressive in terms of your forward expectations in the past six months or so. ", "Andrew Mathias ", "Certainly within the past six months with the pickup of leasing that Steve Durels discussed I think we\u2019ve, its really just refining timing. I think we\u2019ve always been bullish on a recovery given the lack of supply and the same dynamics that we\u2019ve been talking about in Manhattan but in terms of timing with the job losses in New York not being as bad as the city itself had projected, and a pickup in activity we\u2019ve taken a little bit more bullish stance and I think you\u2019ve heard us say we expect to try to tighten up concessions this year. ", "And we hope to return to some level of rental growth in 2011 and beyond. ", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Vincent Chow \u2013 Deutsche Bank  ", "Vincent Chow \u2013 Deutsche Bank  ", "Just want to follow-up on the unsecured question from earlier, did I hear, did the preferred offering preclude you from thinking about a non-secured offering later in the year and how are you thinking about the convert that\u2019s [playable] later in the year. ", "Unspecified Company Representative", "I don\u2019t think it precludes it at all. It was just opportunistic and gave us a chance to get in some equity. We\u2019re continuing to look at the unsecured market. We have the cash on hand as we talked about before to retire the unsecured obligation that come due in 2010 and 2011 including the converts, they\u2019re putable in June of this year.", "But certainly the unsecured market, it continues to tighten, it would be an efficient option for us and then would make that cash that we have on hand available for external purposes because we could use a new unsecured issuance which was not originally contemplated to kind of refinance and turn out those 2010 and 2011 obligations that we have coming due. ", "Vincent Chow \u2013 Deutsche Bank  ", "Can you also just comment on the [Vivendi] lease that\u2019s coming due in 2010.", "Unspecified Company Representative", "They renewed for a couple of floors over there and if you recall we don\u2019t manage that building but we have an investment in it. But they renewed for a couple of floors, a big chunk of the space had been subleased out to a variety of tenants and there\u2019s been a substantial amount of leasing that\u2019s been completed in the past 60 days. ", "We can provide some additional specific color on that but it would have to follow this call. ", "Operator", "There are no additional questions at this time; I would like to turn it back over to management for any additional or closing comments. ", "Marc Holliday ", "Thank you, hopefully that was, we were able to add some clarifications to a lot of things that happened over year end and look forward to speaking with everyone again in three months.

This conference call is being recorded.  At this time, the company would like to remind the listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements.  Actual results may differ from predictions that management may make today.

Thank you, go ahead Mr. Holliday.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay, thank you and good afternoon everyone, welcome to SL Green\u2019s Third Quarter Earnings Call.  We\u2019re pleased you have chosen to join us today to hear our commentary on the outlook for the Manhattan Commercial Property markets and SL Green\u2019s portfolio performance.", "When we last spoke in July, I discussed the tumultuous credit market environment and the potential effects on Manhattan\u2019s real estate market as it was too early then to provide any clear guidance.", "During the last three months, many of the country\u2019s largest commercial vendors and finance dealers have announced multi-billion dollar write-downs in the carrying values of their investment portfolios making new credit hard to obtain and the cost of such credit more expensive where obtainable.", "In this volatile market environment, we recognize that our primary responsibility to SL Green shareholders is to protect portfolio value and to protect our earnings.  However, we also recognize that this economic climate will provide investment opportunities and enable SL Green to further differentiate itself by increasing its market share, increasing its velocity of earnings growth and increasing net asset value.", "We have made subtle and not so subtle changes to our business strategy in recent months that we believe will enable us to accomplish all of our objectives and the first evidence of that can be seen in SL Green\u2019s Third Quarter Earnings results.", "Andrew, Greg and I will take you through this quarter\u2019s achievements and discuss with you the current market dynamics as we see them.", "The most significant highlight from the quarter\u2019s results is the continuing earnings increases underscored by strong organic growth in SL Green\u2019s revenues and margins.", "An average of 60% mark-to-market on new leases signed in the third quarter is quite simply an outstanding statistic especially when noting that the mark-to-market is not the result of one or two outliers or aberrations, but rather, the aggregate result of 62 separate leasing transactions executed in the third quarter for approximately 350,000 square feet.", "To best convey the enormity of this achievement, I will give you several data points to put it in context.", "Two leases signed at the Graybar  Building including the early renewal of the bank totalling over 62,000 square feet with rents averaging in excess of $50.00 per square foot representing a 47% mark-to-market.", "Two new leases at 461 Fifth Avenue totalling over 18,000 square feet with average rents of $90.00 per square foot resulting in a 54% average mark-to-market.  An early renewal at 1185 Avenue to Americus totalling 34,000 square feet starting at $80.00 per square foot representing 110% mark-to-market.  At 100 Park Avenue, we signed two leases with new tenants totalling over 13,000 feet with the top rent averaging $105.00 per square foot and mark-to-market in excess averaging upto 100% and the previously announced new lease with a National Retailer for 46,000 square feet at 1372 Broadway for $50.00 per square foot average representing a 75% mark-to-market.", "While market participants were searching for indicators as to the health of the leasing market in New York, SL Green was busy signing 350,000 square feet of new and renewal leases at unprecedented levels for this company.", "More impressive than these statistics is the leasing activity completed by SL Green during the first three weeks of the month of October.  Leasing activity not included in the statistics that we released last night and the ones that I did not just go through, but for which I will update you now include the following:   A new lease with the real estate services firm at 100 Park Avenue for an additional 11,000 square feet at $81.00 per square foot net effective, no TI, no free rent and in addition, we are on active negotiations on over a 100,000 square feet of leasing of that property.", "A full floor lease for the entire 33rd floor at 810 Seventh Avenue for approximately 17,000 square feet with $86.00 rent and $90.00 per square foot average.  A new signing this week with the company that is a hedge fund who is leasing the entire 37th floor at 810 Seventh Avenue at a rental rate of $92.00 per square foot and $101.00 per square foot.  And on a related note, we just signed a lease with a law firm at 150 Grand   Street in White   Plains for approximately 11,000 square feet at an average rent of $31.00 per square foot for ten years.  You may ask what the law firm lease in White Plains has to do with the hedge fund lease at 810   Seventh Avenue.  Good question, but the connection is quite simple.", "Both leases represent the first of what we hope will be many developed synergies between the suburban portfolio in Westchester and Stanford with SL Green\u2019s midtown Manhattan portfolio.  The hedge fund is an existing tenant of SL Green\u2019s at 1 Landmark   Square in Stanford and through that relationship, we were able to make the 17,000 square foot company expansion in to our Manhattan portfolio.  Likewise, the law firm was a tenant at 28 West 44 Street, an SL Green building and we were able to relocate them to the newly acquired 150 Grand Street in White Plains once it became evident that the law firm wanted to move its business.", "We early terminated the law firm space at 28 West 44 Street thereby unlocking a new leasing opportunity with the 45% potential mark-to-market that we hope to achieve in future quarters.  We spoke of these potential synergies back in February of this year when we closed the Rexon deal, and now we have the transactions to support our thesis.", "Additionally, great news as of last night, we have settled an FMV renewal with one of the country\u2019s largest hedge funds for ten years at a new rent of $76.00 per square foot on an as is, no concession basis, the deal is for 71,450 square feet that includes growth in the square footage to reflect today\u2019s market dynamics and represents a 54% mark-to-market over the previous in place escalated rents.", "I am giving you more granular detail on SL Green\u2019s leasing achievements than I normally do simply because this seems to account for half of the questions if not more than we get these days, and this data frames our view of the market.", "We recognize that financial services firms account for approximately 35% of office space users in Manhattan and comprise 25% of the overall payroll taxes for New York   City workers.  The coupling of significant layoffs with material amounts of sublet space being thrown back onto the market would obviously have a deleterious effect on the leasing market.  However, we are now five months into the current credit crunch and the amount of layoffs so far has been modest and the appearance of sublet space is so far to minimum.  Even if there are ultimately 10,000 layoffs between now and some time in 2008, this would add only approximately 1% to the vacancy rate in Manhattan.  The fact is, no one knows how protracted the current credit climate will be, nor how much of a pull back we will actually experience in the financial services sector, but it is fair to say that we have only seen a modest amount of layoffs to date and very little in the way of new sublet space competing with the primary direct space of owners.", "In making assessments for the near term, we look at our current leasing velocity and performance which I just covered and try to estimate the size and depth of supply of future demand.  Along those lines, we have assembled a comprehensive list of tenants for 333 West 34 Street, the building we acquired earlier this year from CitiGroup which will provide us with full building leasing opportunity in 2009.", "We have already begun advanced marketing this property while still fully tenanted by CitiGroup and now have an exhaustive list of tenants in the market seeking 100,000 square foot or more for occupancy within the next 24 months.", "This list totals 64 different tenants, totalling in excess of 13,000 square feet of demand.  While this demand is divided into both relocation space and expansion space and not all of it will obviously materialize the sheer scale of the potential demand outstrips the availability of contiguous blocks in Manhattan can accommodate such space and even if a significant portion of that demand attenuates, we believe there will still be healthy balance of supply and demand which will mitigate any material erosion in rents.", "In an optimistic scenario, landlords will hold rents or experience amount of things which may or may not be offset by slightly widening concession packages to attract tenants.", "In a conservative scenario, net effect of rents could be down 10%, however, in either of those two scenarios, the mark-to-market in SL Green\u2019s portfolio will be substantial.  Results like these do not happen by accident.  We have continuously stressed at our acquisition redevelopment, operational and leasing strategy was targeted toward creating long-term pipeline of embedded rental growth.", "SL Green also finds itself in the envy of all position of having approximately $1.25 billion of immediately available funds on its line of credit.  Greg will take you through the steps of how we were able to amass such enormous capacity while being such active investors in 2006 and 2007 including the acquisition of Rexon and SL Green\u2019s continued investment and Gramercy Capital Corp.", "The bottom line is that we now enjoy record capacity going into a market that we believe will yield better opportunities than we have seen in the recent past.  We categorize these baskets of opportunities in a different manner than we have previously.  First we have been active in buying back our own stock and have deployed over $100 million at levels we believe represent a sizeable discount to SL Green\u2019s underlying net asset value.", "Second, we are always plying the market for new opportunities and there is no reason to expect that SL Green won\u2019t be an acquirer of significant Manhattan assets as we have been in the past.", "While earnings growth, return on equity in any of the expansion are all primary goals, we also understand that SL Green is considered to be in many respects a proxy on the New York City office market and as such, we would continue to expect to be net acquirers over time increasing our already dominant market share beyond the current 24 million square feet.", "Third, we expect to be investing opportunistically in and around our core market as we have always done in the past in order to make shorter term capital gains by bringing intellectual capital to bear on transitional situations and being rewarded with outside returns and incentive fees while mitigating the amount of monetary capital allocated to this opportunistic bucket.", "Based on our established track record, I believe the company will be able to successfully execute this business plan and create a pipeline of opportunities for external growth, capital gains and organic mark-to market.", "Lastly, as the external manager of Gramercy Capital Corp. we spent time in the third quarter assuring of Gramercy\u2019s balance sheet and creating a record amount of liquidity in that company as well while generating record earnings for Gramercy that was announced last week.", "Gramercy\u2019s earnings guidance was increased for a third consecutive quarter to a range of $3.00 to $3.05 per share which when combined with all the other accomplishments during the quarter enable SL Green to increase its earnings guidance to $5.75 per share, a full 25% ahead of 2006 FFO.", "While I\u2019ve covered the near-term market dynamics that I see affecting the company, I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention the positive longer term prospects for the New York City economy that we see.", "We are confident that Manhattan will maintain its leadership position among all commercial office markets in the country.  People want to be here, it\u2019s exciting, it\u2019s an intellectual capital, as well as a financial capital.  It was voted the safest big city for a second year in a row with crime rates continue to be reduced.  There were 34 million visitors to the city in 2006, and this number is projected to increase to 50 million visitors by 2015.  The population is also projected to increase by one million people over the next ten to 15 years. These are all great statistics for housing, retail, the lodging industry, in addition to the commercial office market.", "A constantly improving quality of life and work place assures us that our continued investment in Manhattan\u2019s real estate will produce most attractive absolute relative and risk adjusted returns in the industry.", "Now let me turn the call over to Andrew Mathias.", "Andrew Mathias", "Thank you, Marc. With our announcement of the sale of 470 Park Avenue South this morning, consensus seems to be that the logjam in the Manhattan sales market has been broken.  An institutional all cash buyer stepping up to purchase a class-B asset at north of $600.00 per square foot and a 4.5% cap rate should set a more positive tone for many more pending deals.", "As always in the deep Manhattan market has one class of buyer, in this case, highly levered entrepreneurs fall off the playing field and other groups steps in aggressively.", " With a couple of exceptions, August and September essentially featured a standstill with sellers waiting out the usual summer slowdown and the credit crunch before testing the market and buyers speculating about where the lack of financing would push cap rates.", "We continue to believe this answer is not more than 50 basis points of cap rate widening.  The market is now packed with offerings to clear out this backlog with everything from class-A towers to corporate headquarters dispositions to class-B assets to desperation re-caps of over leveraged capital structures from those heady days of spring of 2007.", "We\u2019re back to burning the midnight oil evaluating all of these situations and trying to pick our spot as always, but those who predict that a collapse in values or across the board distress selling have thus far been proven sorely mistaken.  Bidding on assets is robust and there is still a lot of money to be put to work out there.  That coupled with continued strength in the leasing market which Marc discussed is making for a competitive acquisition environment. It was against this backdrop that we completed our slate of new, previously announced transactions on both the acquisitions and dispositions fronts.", "Included in this group is the acquisition of 16 Court and joint venture with the City Investment Fund.  Early returns are very positive in Brooklyn and we haven\u2019t even kicked off our capital improvement and retail repositioning programs. With the right JV capital structure in place and great acquisition financing closed, we feel very confident in this investment.", "In two notable additional acquisitions, we continued our innovative fee acquisition program in purchasing 55% of a newly created land position we originated with Gramercy Capital Corp. under the Lipstick building.  The class-A architecturally renowned trophy asset on the booming Third Avenue corridor in midtown.", "Given the capital markets environment, we were able to drive even more attractive economics than our prior fee positions giving us a highly protected stable and secure stream of cash flows for the foreseeable future.", "Additionally, we closed on our acquisition of 180 Broadway downtown, a notable new addition to our retail program with Jeff Sutton.  We have another site in the immediate vicinity under contract and look forward to sharing more details about this exciting development opportunity at our investor meeting in December.", "On the disposition front, we closed on the previously announced sales of 85% of 1372 Broadway and 100% of 292 Madison   Avenue.  More importantly, as I mentioned earlier, we just announced the contract to sell 470 Park Avenue South.  The proceeds from this sale will be reinvested on a tax-free basis into our purchase of Gramercy\u2019s tenancy and common interest at One Madison Avenue that we closed in July.", "It is not hard to see how selling 470 Park   Avenue South at 4.5% cap rate and over $600.00 per square foot and re-investing in Credit Suisse\u2019s corporate headquarters, an institutional class-A asset at 5.5% cap rate makes good business sense.  We will continue to avail ourselves of this quality arbitrage aggressively so long as they exist in our market.", "On the structured finance front, the primary thrust of our activities continues to be through our Gramercy Capital Corp. affiliate.  The additions to our balances where mostly deals originated in partnership with Gramercy where GKK\u2019s board determined that investment size or profile was not appropriate for 100% investment on their balance sheet and we would up JV-ing the positions with them.", "As the capital markets continue to shake out with spreads riding the rollercoaster and widening out again at the end of last week, we continue to see major opportunities for SL Green derivatively through GKK and from co-investment in some of the evolving situations in the financing markets.", "And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Greg Hughes to take you through the numbers.", "Greg Hughes", "Great, thanks, Andrew.  Good afternoon everybody.  The third quarter was chockfull of positive activity and results at SL Green.  Many of these results directly answered questions and concerns that investors have expressed over the last three months and we believe the answers are resoundingly positive.", "Gramercy is very much in business, liquid and well-positioned to take advantage of an opportunistic environment and with the closing of a new CDO and a recently completed $125 million equity raise, not only had feed from GKK sustainable, but should continue to grow.", "This morning\u2019s announcement of the sale of 470   Park Avenue South which Andrew referenced provided new data point to where the private market is valuing Manhattan Real Estate.", "Interestingly enough, the $602.00 per foot sales price we achieved was right on top of the published value used for 470 by two analysts in deriving their company-wide NAV. These NAVs were in excess of $156.00 per share.  We believe that our current stock price, the implicit price per foot for the entire portfolio is below what we just achieved on the sale of an original IPO asset.", "Given these metrics, it should come as no surprise that we continue to be active buyers of our stock during the quarter.  Purchases under our $300 million buy-back program now we see $100 million with buy-back since July 1st having an average purchase price of $116.00.  We regularly evaluate stock re-purchases versus other opportunities in the marketplace and as a function of our available liquidity.  Given our price and given our liquidity position, one should expect to see more stock purchases going forward.", "Additional property sales plus the recent expansion of our credit facility to $1.5 billion find us in a very liquid position.  With pending sales, we expect to finish 2007 with close to full availability on our credit facilities.   At a current interest rate of LIBOR plus 80, we would expect to be able to put this money to work equitably in 2008.  The expansion of our credit facility in some very shabby capital markets is a testament to the company\u2019s lenders and the strong following we enjoy in the capital markets.", "Even with a 25% drop in our stock price and the consolidation of One Madison Avenue onto our balance sheet during the quarter, our consolidated debt to market capital vision sits at just 41%.  Contrast this with the second quarter of 2005 when OMA was originally purchased.  Had we acquired a 100% of OMA at that time, our consolidated debt to mortgage capitalization would have increased by 10%.  In short, even with the assumption of this additional debt, the balance sheet continues to be liquid and strong.", "Our combined fixed charge coverages for the quarter did tick down principally as a result of the leverage associated with Two Herald and 885 Third which totals approximately $252 million and carry significant amortization.", "While these are highly leveraged transactions, they carry little to no risk as the positions are term financed for ten years, secured by the underlying land and have claims that are senior to over $565 million of leasehold improvements.", "Other items of note on the balance sheet include the following:  Other assets include a bridge loan to the 16 core joint venture which was re-paid during October with proceeds from a permanent mortgage. The 55% interest in 885 Third Avenue is accounted for an investment in JV.  The third revenue includes approximately $291 million of gain which is being deferred as a result of a purchase option we retained under our JV arrangement.  The gain will be recognized upon the termination of that option.", "Treasury stock at 9/30 was $94 million.  The balance of the aforementioned $100 million in repurchases settled during October.", "Turning to the P&L, we had a very strong quarter which prompted the increase in guidance to $5.75.  If we are successful in meeting this guidance, we will have generated a 25% year-over-year growth in FFO per share.  This explosive growth has received limited recognition with a focus instead on the sustainability of these earnings and how we will replace the incentive fees earned on One Park Avenue and the Clock Tower sale.", "This quarter\u2019s results helped demonstrate why believe these earnings levels are sustainable and have further room to grow.  Our optimism in this regard stems from the strength of our core real estate operations.  Our consolidated same store NOI grew by a strong 9% during the quarter.  Growth of this magnitude contributes approximately $0.25 per share of annual incremental FFO.  It is worth noting that the benefits of leases signed during the quarter often do not make their way to our bottom line for three to six months after signing.  This bodes very well for future NOI growth when one reviews the mark-to-market trend over the last five quarters.", "Starting at 25.8% a year ago, we have seen it grow to 28.7% followed by 37% then to 40.5% and finally 59.5% in the most recent quarter.  The delayed benefits of our leasing activity can be seen in this quarter as rental revenues increase from $176 million last quarter to $190 million this quarter as OMA was consolidated and revenue recognition commenced on several major leases.", "There is more where this came from.  At the quarter end, there were leases that have been signed whose annual rent totalled approximately $9 million where income recognition has yet to commence.", "Property level margins for the quarter were 55% of significantly from a year ago when they were 48%.  These margins reflect the benefits of strong same store NOI growth coupled with a transformation of our portfolio to a high quality more profitable set of buildings.", "Occupancy for the quarter dipped slightly to 97% with scheduled lease expirations at 810 Seventh, 1185 Sixth and 711 Third, being the principal contributors to the decline.", "Marc has already taken you through this significant activity that we see at these properties during the fourth quarter and would expect to see a rebound at these properties at the end of the fourth quarter.", "While leasing activity was down compared to last quarter, it is worth remembering that the last quarter included over $300,000.00 early renewals.  True to form, the 1.5 million square feet of leasing that we have announced year-to-date has exceeded the scheduled expirations that we began the year with by over 800,000 square feet of leasing.", "A couple of points to embellish the leases that Marc mentioned, the new leases at 100 Park enabled that building to be the first building south of Grand Central to get rents over $100.00 a foot and shattered the proforma rents that we had originally established in the mid to upper fifties when we decided to embark upon the redevelopment of that building.", "Similarly, the lease that was signed over to 1185   Sixth Avenue was achieved with just $18.00 of TI work easily beating on net effective rents that we had underwritten in connection with the acquisition of Rexon.", "Our structured finance income for the quarter was approximately $21.8 million realizing a weighted average coupon of roughly 10.5% on the $715 million of outstanding investments.", "Other income for the quarter was $15 million, 65% of which represented fees from GKK.", "GKK fees were up approximately $600,000.00 over the prior quarter.  Other income included $1 million of lease cancellation income and included no other incentive fees or promotes except for the $3.9 million incentive fee realized from Gramercy.", "The company also received a $19 million incentive fee related to GKK\u2019s gain on its sale of One Madison Avenue, but did not recognize this fee as income.  The accounting literature specifically provides for gains related to the asset to be recorded as a reduction in the acquirer\u2019s basis, this pronouncement was also applied to the portion of the incentive fee attributable to the gain.", "MG&A for the quarter was down compared to last quarter as a result of the decline in cost for certain stock base, compensation, combined interest for the quarter increased over the last quarter as a result of the new debt associated with One Madison and the 885 Third acquisitions as well as a full quarter of interest associated with JV investments at 1745 Broadway and Two Herald.  ", "We look forward to seeing everybody at our Investor Day on December 3rd where we would anticipate providing a detailed guidance for 2008 earnings and establishing the company\u2019s new quarterly dividend level.", "And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Marc for some closing comments.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay, thank you.  We\u2019re going to take some questions in just a moment.  As Andrew and Greg both alluded to, we are holding our Annual Investor Conference in New York City on Monday, December 3rd, first Monday in December.", "Every year this event has grown in attendance.  It has grown in importance and we work very hard at the end of November to make sure that the time with our investors and analysts and bankers is well spent by providing insight into the market and our strategies that simply cannot be condensed into an abbreviated earnings call such as this.", "So we certainly encourage everyone to come.  It will be joint SL Green and Gramercy Capital Corp investor day, much in the same format as we did last year.  I\u2019m told we promised to feed you somewhat better than we did last year as we, I think had Carmines\u2019 catering the event for us, so come hungry, come ready and we promise that it will be worthwhile if you could make it work on your calendars.", "With that, let\u2019s open up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions)", "And the first question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citigroup.  Please proceed.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "Good afternoon, guys.  Marc, in your opening comments you talked about the city space and actively trying to market that now, and you did talk about the 64 tenants over 100,000 square feet or more and in totality it was a pretty big number of square footage.  How much of that, when you sort of develop that list, is net absorption versus just people moving chairs.", "Marc Holliday", "I can\u2019t really give you an answer because the requirements are not always so specific themselves.  Tenants don\u2019t come and tell you exactly what their plans are, the brokerage will say, \u201cI\u2019m representing X tenant and we\u2019re looking for X amount of square feet.\u201d  I can\u2019t even hazard to guess.  I mean, I\u2019m looking at the list right now, everyone has a story. I would say, at least half of that expansion or tenants first moving into the city from outside locations.  It could easily would have been more than half, but that\u2019s like the best I can do.", "Sometimes we\u2019re not even told who the tenant is.  Sometimes it is just represented.  These requirements change over time.  The user groups don\u2019t always know, but I would say for lack of a better answer, at least half probably more is expansion or relocation in the map.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "And then as a follow up, you talked about rental levels, obviously, with a lot of the detail you provided, remain very strong in the city, and I think you said, your expectation at the most conservative level you could see a 10% decrease in net effect of rents, and you also said that you\u2019re remaining active on the position side on being opportunistic, how are you underwriting your deals today in terms of where rental levels are going?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I assume you\u2019re talking about core Manhattan products.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "Yes.", "Marc Holliday", "So when you ask where we\u2019re underwriting, Andrew why don\u2019t you run through with our working assumption is today for most of the deals we\u2019re looking at.", "Andrew Mathias", "I think, we we\u2019re never one to underwrite large rental spikes.  A lot of the properties that were sold on the early portion of this year had very aggressive sort of 10% growth for many the next year or two than 5% and then moderating to a more inflation adjusted level going forward.  I think today, our general outlook for underwriting is probably flat for the next 12 months or so and then going through more of that inflation-adjusted growth rate.  We don\u2019t foresee any spikes.  We never really underwrote any spikes on any of our acquisitions and we think that\u2019s turning out to be an accurate assumption.  We see today\u2019s levels holding which is how we are underwriting it.", "Michael Bilerman -Citigroup", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "And the next question from the line of Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors.  Please proceed.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors ", "Hey guys, Marc or Andrew, I am just curious if you can walk us through sort of what you\u2019ve learned from the sales process of 470 Park Avenue South as you go to bed on some of these other projects in the market.", "Marc Holliday", "I think it was a little bit pioneering on our part.  We put this out for market in August before Labor Day, we were advised against it because, if nothing else, it was the summer and summer is not typically a good time to market and to compound on that problem, it always was a very choppy month.   But in retrospect, we think we made the absolute right call because we were out there early with product, when really nobody else had product out there.  We marketed through the month of September.", "I would say, initially the first week or two, we had a lot of showings but it was uncertain where it was going to price because if nothing else, people were uncertain where they were going to get the debt to buy it and then I would say by the end of September or early October, debt quotes started appearing.  I think they were multiple debt quotes at very good levels probably not as good as they were in the previous six to nine months but still very good debt level by traditional standards and that enabled for multiple bids.  We went round one, round two at multiple parties to choose from different structures, different pricing, ultimately went with the institutional or cash paid quick loads.", "We probably could\u2019ve held out for more pricing if we wanted too, but felt that the incremental million dollars or so, or what if cut against our desire to get it closed quickly, efficiently and ensure that we could reinvest those proceeds in a 1031 basis, into One Madison Avenue, which has a ticking clock.  That\u2019s not an indefinite time period that we can do that, s0 we accelerated that process.  We will invest those proceeds tax free into One Madison Avenue.  We are very happy with the outcome.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors ", "Any thoughts on what type of un-levered return buyers in today\u2019s market might be either expecting or what maybe a realistic expectation is.", "Andrew Mathias", "My guess would be 7.5% to 8% un-levered return..", "Marc Holiday", "With sort of 4.5 ish going in cap.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors ", "Okay and then, my last question, if I may, is just any comments on 449th, which is we believe is for sale and then also the Suburban Westchester portfolio.", "Marc Holiday", "449th we are marketing, the early expectations there is that pricing will be in line with our expectations if they are, then we will transact, if they are not we won\u2019t.  But we\u2019re not in a fire sale over here.  We are trying to do this in a pretty prudent approach of selling, recycling and reinvesting, so I would say that we\u2019ll know within the next two to four weeks what direction we are going to take on 440, but at this moment, we\u2019re as optimistic as we were on 470 a few weeks ago.", "And as to Western  Westchester, it\u2019s more complicated.  We went out with portfolio properties to give people different options to think about, look at.  There again, I would say if we get our pricing, we\u2019ll transact on at least a subset of the properties.  I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll transact on the whole portfolio more than we really intend to.", "But, so far to date, I would say, the response we\u2019re getting in Westchester for the assets that we are contemplating are in line with what we expected going out.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors ", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Jay Habermann with Goldman Sachs.  Please proceed.", "Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "Hey good afternoon, here with Sloan Boan as well.  I guess, Greg or Marc.  Can you walk through the increase in guidance for the full year?  I guess, was that all due to the one time fee from Gramercy and just sort of walk through the components of that increase.", "Marc Holliday", "The fee that was realized from Gramercy was really consistent with what we saw last quarter.  The fee related to the gain has been excluded and so, it is really principally a function of the strong operating results, from the assets themselves.  So it\u2019s really the NOI growth that we\u2019re seeing at the assets.  I mean Gramercy did exceed earnings estimate last week by $0.10 so that\u2019s a benefit as well, but it\u2019s principally driven by the strong mark to market on the leases, the strong NOI growth and the property income being well ahead of where we expected it to be.", "Greg Hughes", "Just to reiterate, the $90 million incentive fee on Gramercy was excluded from FFO.  It doesn\u2019t account for any of that increase.", "Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, there is no other fee anticipated going forward in terms of Q4.", "Marc Holliday", "That is right.", "Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and then I guess, you know Marc in your comments you mentioned perhaps some distress opportunities in continuing to make significant acquisitions in Manhattan.  Can you just give a sense of the current market today and just what is out there and what you\u2019re looking at?", "Marc Holliday", "Yes, I do not want to mince words, I think I talked about opportunistic, not necessarily distressed.   If I did say distressed, I would say that\u2019s an overstatement.  I think as Andrew pointed out, in Manhattan, I think that the opportunities will come more in a structured financing structured equity side as in terms of equity, it still seems to be plentiful and available in the city.", "It\u2019s the debt that\u2019s not available.  So the only thing that is creating the stress in the system is the lack of financing and GKK on the debt side, Green on the structured equity side, we\u2019re perfectly adept to fill that void for other core Manhattan properties, for people who are, let\u2019s call it mis-capitalized for the current market or improperly capitalized for the current market.", "In and around Manhattan, as we have shown in the past our ability to buy opportunistically, either non-core Manhattan product or outside of Manhattan product, that\u2019s where I think you\u2019ll see a little more pressure, markets that are more dependent on residential housing for business and retail activity or probably the markets where you\u2019re going to see the most weakness in housing and retail and office.  That\u2019s not really the case of Manhattan.  Manhattan is not very much residential housing dependent.", "In terms of obviously single for sales per housing and the condo coop and rental market in Manhattan is actually, holding a very well relative to other markets.  So, I think it would be outside Manhattan that you would see the more opportunistic opportunities coming to light.", "We have done in the past and continue to do those kinds of deals at the margins, don\u2019t devote a lot of capital to those situations, but tend to make a lot of money on those situations we hope.  We can replicate that going forward, generally taking minority interest by getting big incentive fees in those situations.", "Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "And the slight decline at JBNY.  Is that something that gets amended next quarter with the lease off of the assets you mentioned?", "Marc Holliday", "It is, actually if you dial out some of the lease cancellation.  It primarily was included in the third quarter last year, it was actually moderately positive and remember, 100 Park is included in that which is under redevelopment.  So, I guess a case can be made for us to dial 100 Park out of that.  We leave it in and 100 Park is actually down year over year.  I would expect to see a good movement in the JV numbers, if not in the fourth quarter then certainly in earlier \u201808.", "Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "That\u2019s helpful.  Thank you.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with Keybanc Capital Markets.  Please proceed.", "Jordan Sadler - Keybanc Capital Markets ", "Hey guys, you did a good job on quantifying demand and talking about what you guys are seeing in terms of new leasing activities so far in the fourth quarter.  Could you give us a little bit of sense of what you are seeing in terms of availability?  Maybe, talk about the big blocks of space that remain available outside of maybe what is in your portfolio.  I think you guys have 100 Park, and some space in 1185, a little bit there today, but anything else.", "Marc Holiday", "Yeah, you know what Jordan.  Steve Durels is with us, let him best address that because he has got it all right at the tip of his fingers.", "Steve Durels", "The bigger picture in Manhattan is still is a big blocked constrained market.  True of our portfolio, true of the market in general, our biggest blocks that we\u2019ve got right now, we\u2019re marketing future vacancy at 100 Park Avenue and we have very strong demand and some very sizeable ongoing lease negotiations for that space.  Other than that, it is just sort of a couple of pockets and space in our portfolio.  We\u2019ve got three floors at 1185, we were earlier in the year marketing five floors and at 810 Seventh, we\u2019ve been able to knock off two of those floors.  We\u2019ve got leases out on some of the remaining space, and then there\u2019s the future of big blocks that are really two years out at 333 West 34 Street which we\u2019re showing that probably almost everyday to prospective tenants and getting surprisingly good interest for what is a long term future availability, and then sort of to knock off some of our future block with space going into \u201908.  I mean, we\u2019ve already completed about a 160,000 square feet of transactions for next year, and are really not confronted with any noticeable future big blocks other than those spaces that we\u2019re already focused on at 810 and at 100 Park Avenue and 1185.", "Jordan Sadler - Keybanc Capital Markets ", "Okay, great.", "Steve Durels", "And then, outside of that, the rest of the market, each of the submarkets from Penn Station, Grand Central parts are very tight.  There\u2019s more demand than there is for availability of big block spaces right now.", "Jordan Sadler - Keybanc Capital Markets ", "Could you maybe also just clarify from second quarter to the third quarter looking at the mark-to-market schedule that you guys provide in the supplement?  It looks like the mark-to-market estimate in the consolidated portfolio went from 45% last quarter to 40% this quarter.  I would imagine some of that decline was a function of capturing some of that gain, but maybe could you flush that out a little bit.", "Marc Holliday", "That\u2019s right, I think, embedded in what you saw this quarter where you saw the 59% mark-to-market coming through, one of those leases came out of that computation, you saw a slight drop off in the overall portfolio.", "Jordan Sadler - Keybanc Capital Markets ", "That makes sense, the base goes up, and then just clarifying, the guidance, it excludes a FAS 141 adjustment for Rexon?", "Marc Holliday", "It includes some nominal 141 adjustment that you\u2019ll see coming through in the fourth quarter to address this out there, but you won\u2019t see the preponderance of that coming through until next year.", "So nothing has been booked today and a little bit of the fourth quarter, but you\u2019ll see it materializing next year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with UBS.  Please proceed.", "Jamie Feldman \u2013 UBS", "Thank you very much and good afternoon.  Can you talk a little bit about the buyers?  You guys certainly pointed out that there\u2019s a lot of those properties coming back on the market, but I\u2019m just curious as to characterization, is it foreign money, is it domestic money?  Just kind of more color on that?", "Andrew Mathias", "As I said, I think, it\u2019s really across all spectrums; I mean everybody is speculating there\u2019s going to be a lot of foreign capital looking to get into Manhattan because of the weakness of the dollar. We\u2019re seeing a lot of those buyers.  This buyer on 470 Park Avenue was a pension fund.  Somebody who has not purchased a building in Manhattan prior to the last ten years and is now reentering the market, there are still entrepreneurial buyers on every deal, actually 3211 West 44 Street traded to an entrepreneurial buyer with a 1031 requirement, so there\u2019s still a great cross section of buyers for every piece of property, certainly the highly-levered guys who are sort of borrowing 95% of acquisition from the banks, those guys are not bidding today, they\u2019re more working out their problems from the fall, but there\u2019s opportunity funds, foreign buyers, pension funds, you see it really across the spectrum.", "Jamie Feldman \u2013 UBS", "Okay, and then where do you see occupancy ending the year, if you\u2019d picked on a little bit, that\u2019s just a matter of timing of leases or this 60 basis points down?", "Andrew Mathias", "Well, I think a lot of that 60 dips was probably programmed, we took out some space, examples like the law firms, situation in 19 West.", "Steve Durels", "We\u2019ve got a couple of blocks that we\u2019ve known all along that tenants had previously had it vacated, but their expiration,  didn\u2019t pay the rent, an expiration schedule either for October 1st or between now and the end of the year, so I think, it\u2019ll be a timing issue.  We\u2019ve actually taken, as Marc was alluding to, we\u2019ve taken some space back proactively because we\u2019ve got confidence in the market specifically at 100 Park   Avenue where we just took half a floor back at a space that had 12 years left to go at it, and we think it\u2019s a good $30.00 to $40.00 below the market.  We\u2019ve got a piece of space at 711 Third Avenue which is 32,000 square feet, just came back to us already in negotiation with a perspective tenant for it.", "It takes some time to close out this transactions but we\u2019re still feeling pretty bullish about it because of the level of demand we\u2019ve got for tenants knocking on our door.", "Marc Holiday", "Jamie, I think we would say that 97% is a very full number, so that plus or minus 50 basis points around that, just depending on the timing of when people actually saw in is where you\u2019ll probably end up the quarter.", "Jamie Feldman \u2013 UBS", "No, I agree with you, I was just curious.  Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of David Todie with Lehman Brothers.  Please proceed.", "David Todie - Lehman Brothers", "Good afternoon, guys.  My first question relates to some of the new investments that you originated in the structured finance portfolio and you mentioned that they were not appropriate for Gramercy and I wondered if you could just describe the differences and what led you to the decision to include them on your balance sheet directly?", "Marc Holliday", "The ones that we did close were closed in partnership with Gramercy.  I said, the investment size was not appropriate.  So Gramercy\u2019s board generally tries to limit its investment size between $35 and $50 million and a lot of the positions we\u2019ve been considering are larger positions, where they\u2019ll look to take on a partner, so when they take on a partner, obviously SL Green is first call, given our relationship because of the obvious synegies there, so we have co-originated several investments with Gramercy or we\u2019ll take 50%, they\u2019ll take 50%.  It\u2019s the same kind of relationship we have with Gramercy on the credit tenant lease program where for example, One Madison or these fee positions we\u2019ve been taking on.  They\u2019re a little bit large and concentrated for our self, Green\u2019s balance sheet, so brought in Gramercy as a JV partner and that fairly synergistic relationship two-way flow of business there.", "David Todie-Lehman Brothers", "Great, and then my second question relates to the area rights at One Madison, is there any update in terms of what is happening at that project.", "Marc Holliday", "It\u2019s still a very long-term project where we\u2019re doing a lot of preliminary feasibility studies and planning and nothing really is updated at this time.  It\u2019s an asset of the company.  We\u2019re obviously looking to continue to figure out and take best advantage of.", "David Todie-Lehman Brothers", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line Anthony Paolone with J.P. Morgan.  Please proceed.", "Anthony Paolone - J.P. Morgan", "Thanks, Greg.  The $9 million of annual revenues, I think you noted that we\u2019re on the sidelines not having commenced yet, was that incremental to what was in like the third quarter run rate or is that just the total for those leases?", "Greg Hughes", "Incremental.", "Anthony Paolone - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, and then Andrew, if you look back over the last 12 months or so at the deals you bid on and didn\u2019t win, what do you think your pricing would be today for those transactions, would they be the same or has underwriting of yours changed such that you might be higher or lower and what might those changes have been?", "Andrew Mathias", "I think, typically the transactions that we are bidding in the beginning part of this year, we were losing by anywhere between 20% and 30% of purchase price.  So we\u2019ve looked at a lot of transactions that traded and transacted in the 3 to 3.5 or 4% cap rate range and we were typically far, far off in terms of valuation.  I\u2019m not sure our valuations today are much different than our bids were, it\u2019s just we were not winning a lot of marketed deals.  We saw every large transaction in the market and generally came up with a price and a bid for it, it\u2019s just we we\u2019re nowhere close to being competitive in a lot of those situations, but as I said, I think market clearing cap rates are probably backed up 50 basis points, and those 3.5 cap rate transactions of yesteryear are now 4% or so today.", "Anthony Paolone - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Kristine Brownwith of Deutsche Bank.  Please proceed.", "Kristine Brownwithe- Deutsche Bank", "This question is for Andrew, I was just wondering if you could reconcile your outlook on price, what do you think cap rates can hold up even if that is for statewide?", "Andrew Mathias", "Well, I mean, the only reconcile we\u2019ve back there is rents and mark-to-market, so clearly, a stable market if you had debt ranging in the sixes and equity rates in the sevens or whatever you want to apply on leverage you could not justify 4.5% or 4% cap rates, but for the dramatic, mark-to-market that are embedded in many of the properties that come to market.", "So, with the kind of supernormal growth that you get typically over a three to seven year period, a lot of these proformas that we see and are with our full conservative assumptions, you can see your way towards doubling in a line, in five, seven, ten years typically more, and that is what people are paying up for in cap rate is the embedded growth.  I mean I think that\u2019s it, if it wasn\u2019t for that, extraordinary growth that people expect to achieve once they own the property, they could not pay those kinds of capitals, given the cost of capital structure that we have and that our competitors have.", "Kristine Brownwithe- Deutsche Bank", "Okay, and then Greg, I was just wondering if you could clarify all the impact of the FAS 141 adjustments for next year for Roxen?", "Greg Hughes", "Again we are in the process of finalizing that but I think we thought and talked about being in number on the order of $10 to $15 million on an annual basis.", "Kristine Brownwithe- Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And come from the line of John Stewart with Credit Suisse.", "John Stewart \u2013 Credit Suisse ", "Thank you.  Marc, I appreciate the granularity on the mark-to-market during the quarter, but given the big role you\u2019ve got coming at 1515 Broadway can you show us what the rent was on a 27,000 square feet you leased at 1515 Broadway?", "Marc Holliday", "It was a $75.00 rent, up from in place of $38.00 and that was done by the way with no work. So an as is deal of $75.00, so, up close to 100% which is, we think, the great news is, as the word will start to kick in next year.", "Steven Durels ", "That was just missed.", "John Stewart \u2013 Credit Suisse ", "Anyway that is helpful, and Greg while I have got you, so obviously you got $10 to $15 million from the FAS 141 and then the $9 million run rate from the lease contributions that haven\u2019t picked up yet, and I realize you\u2019re not going to give \u201908 until the investor day, but you guys have typically targeted a 10% growth in earnings and I guess the question is, what will be the base that you are going to use?  Or are you going to exclude the One Park promote or are you going to grow up the 575.", "Greg Hughes", "I think we\u2019ll just prefer to wait until December, but we are going to report 575 for the year.  So, that will clearly be the base and just everyone needs to b congnizant of the fact that its up 25% from last year.", "John Stewart \u2013 Credit Suisse ", "Okay fair enough, thank you.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Chris Halley with Wachovia Securities.", "Brandon Meyer \u2013 Wachovia Securities", "Good afternoon guys, it is Brandon Meyer on now with Chris.  Greg, along that same line, if you can give us a sense of what the head winds are in terms of the accounting impact change for a convertible debt going into 2008.", "Greg Hughes", "Well, I mean, really what it does is it takes the benefit out of it.  The straight economics are still very beneficial because you still benefit from a low coupon, what\u2019s being proposed, I do not think it\u2019s been finalized yet, is that the option value associated with the conversion would have to be advertised and as part of interest as well which would basically take away some of the benefit.", "Now, I don\u2019t think that they\u2019ve rendered yet the option on our particular issuance in so far out of the money at this point in time, that it\u2019s unclear at this point that it would have any impact.  But that is kind of what\u2019s being frozen payable debt is that you would add in to the interest charge the cost of derivative, derivative associated with the conversion feature.", "Brandon Meyer \u2013Wachovia Securities", "Okay.  I appreciate that color.  And just quickly in terms of the G&A, looks like it went down a little bit sequentially, is that fully attributable to a decline in equity based compensation or something else going down there?", "Greg Hughes", "Yes, there\u2019s some competition that\u2019s affected, so the stock price being down.  You saw a corresponding reduction in the small piece that\u2019s kind of variable there.", "Brandon Meyer \u2013Wachovia Securities", "Okay, great, thanks.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Mitchell Germain with Banc of America.  Please proceed.", "Mitchell Germain - Banc of America Securities", "Andrew, I appreciate the comments on the compositions of buyers and the changes.  Any changes in the number of bidders at 470 or any other deals you\u2019re working on?", "Andrew Mathias", "I would say modestly less people actually bidding only because there was a subset of people who were reliant on getting caught 80% plus leverage which is just not obtainable today even on a first and mezzanine basis.", "So, I think the universe of bidders is smaller and the guys who actually bid smaller, we had at least 10 credible bids on 470, that maybe down from 15 six months ago, but it\u2019s still time credible bidders and more than enough to get the transaction done on a no due diligence contract.", "Mitchell Germain - Banc of America Securities", "Great.  Thank you guys.", "Marc Holliday", "Any more questions, operator?", "Operator", "And at this time, I would like to turn it back to Mr. Holliday for closing remarks.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay.  Well, I\u2019ll keep it short.  We appreciate everyone\u2019s time.  It was a nice, quick, efficient call and hopefully we were able to give a little bit more clarity than we were on the last call on how things are shaping up in the market.  Obviously, we will be watching yearend as closely as everybody else will be, to train and gain further color on the direction of the markets in 2008, but rest assured, we\u2019re doing everything we possibly can on our end to be both prudent and opportunistic at the same time and we really look forward to seeing you everyone in December at the Investor Meeting where we can go through a lot of the topics we sort of touched upon today in greatest depth and by then we\u2019ll certainly have another month and a half under our belts of visibility, so we\u2019ll be able to share information on what we have gleaned over that period of time.", "And that is it, goodbye and we will see you on December.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this thus conclude the presentation.

This conference call is being recorded. At this time, the company would like to remind the listeners that during the call management may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from predictions that management may make today. Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the company's Form 10-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "Also during today's conference call, the company may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure discussed in the reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found on the company's website at www.slgreen.com, by selecting the press release regarding the company's fourth quarter earnings.", "Before turning the call over to Mr. Marc Holliday, Chief Executive Officer of SL Green Realty Corp., we would to ask those of you participating in the Q&A portion of the call to please limit your questions to two per person.", "Thank you. Go ahead, Mr. Holliday.", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Thank you, and thanks everyone for dialing in today. You wouldn't think that much would have transpired in just six weeks since our Annual Investor Conference that we held on December 3rd, but that clearly is not the case. We have quite a bit of news to report to you on the fourth quarter performance, and achievements that we were not in a position to discus on December 3rd, but can now, almost all of which is quite positive. And also there has been on the sort of the converse side of things a continued downward trend that's accelerated in over those six weeks that one can argue as the market behaving as you would expect it to behave, given the current conditions of the credit markets, but clearly warrants some more time and attention on this call as a follow-up to December 3rd.", "So, just again take a moment to thank the over 400 people, who either attended or dialed into that call in presentation back in December. We covered an hour and a half at ground. Hopefully, people found it very productive. The feedback was good. All of that still stands today, but for whatever we modify on the call, given all these tweaking our strategies in light of current market conditions. So with that, we'll sort of jump into things and take some questions at the end. I already see the queue was buzzing with about 10 or so people with questions lined up, which is interesting, because we haven't got into the meet of the call yet. But let me sort of dive in.", "Clearly the fourth quarter results were, I thought especially satisfying, and we were really proud, not just of what we achieved or what we achieved in a market environment, that's very, very tough. It's tough for you guys, it's tough for us, tough for everyone. But with that said, we continued our motivation throughout the year to try and put even more performance on the table on top of everything we went through on December 3rd. And I think hopefully those results are obvious too when you read through the release.", "Occupancy held relatively steady at around 96.6%, while new lease rents replacing, inspiring, rents had a 43% mark-to-market. We sold two buildings for gains aggregating $225 million while also acquiring the $1.6 billion assets located at 388 and 390 Greenwich Street from City Corp. on terms that we believe are reflective of today's current credit crisis, and Andrew will discuss a little more about that later on. We also received a record amount of fees, dividends from SL Green's investment in Gramercy Capital Corp., and that's even before factoring in Gramercy special dividend payment, which was paid out to Gramercy shareholders and therefore received by SL Green among others in January, and SL Green share to One Madison Avenue incentive fee, which we did receive throughout the year, but accounted for in a different fashion as Greg will tell you and not included in the fees and dividends.", "We also signed three major retail leases during the quarter; one of which was awarded happily to report the most expensive retail deal ever by the New York Post, and Andrew has little bit more to say on that. Adding the fact that we increased our structured finance portfolio by almost $120 million net and increased our quarterly common dividend by 12.5% and you have the makings of what I would call an exceptionally good quarter to capital off what was an exceptionally good year.", "However there were no champagne course popping at the end of the year due primarily to the fact that in the phase of all that we accomplished in Q4 and on top of that full years worth of achievements outlined in December or stock price was down considerably along with the rest of the REIT sector as investors seem to be looking past all of this performance and instead are using SL Green's currency, which many consider a proxy on the health of the New York real estate market, commercial real estate market to make directional debts, our New York City rental rates and Manhattan office prices. Therefore I will take a moment to discuss more fully these two areas and try to contrast the current market conditions that we see now at the beginning of 2008 with the last U.S. recession in 2001 and on into 2002.", "Turning our attention to leasing first, you will recall it since June 2007, we have been sounding cautionary signals on our earnings calls regarding what we believe would be a gradual slowing in the leasing market as a result of the anticipated pullback and space requirements form the financial services sector. This a fairly logical conclusion, so we didn't go on a limb, I don't think certainly not in hindsight to reach these conclusions given a negative event surrounding financial services firms and clearly many market participants shareholders, investors have gone far beyond our cautionary signals as it is currently reflected in our stock price. To our surprise and pleasure, the leasing market held up well during the second half of 2007 with SL Green leasing over 620,000 square feet space during that period of time at an average mark-to-market of approximately 51%.", "More broadly during the last 75 days, I guess beginning some time around beginning to middle of November looking at all properties, all leases in Manhattan, we are aware of 18 new and renewal transactions totaling 4.1 million square feet that have been closed comprised the blocks of space of 100,000 square feet on up. Whether new or renewal leases almost in every instance, these leases included not only existing needs, but growth and expansion over and above what existed before the leasing. The 18 tenants are made up almost exclusively of law firms, advertising and PR firms, and government users with only a handful of financial service sector tenants.", "This demonstrates one of Manhattan's greatest strengths, which is the diversity of its businesses and the ability for one sector to fill in the void when another is in decline. While we can't forecast whether Q1 leasing activity will be consistent with the past 75 days, we are aware of a number of transactions that are close to signing as we speak, and we do believe that in general the Q1 leasing stats will continue to look reasonably good, especially when you adjust it in the light of current conditions that was surprisingly good, we believe.", "While these leasing statistics appear strong, there are other visible signs that the momentum is slowing. And those signs are clearly the absence of the financial service users with their large requirements that had not just absorbed inventory, but really drove rents to their current levels. While rental increases have abated, nominal rents have not yet begun to decline, nor would we expect nominal rents to decline before landlords begin to expand their concession packages.", "So I think, keeping your eye on concession packages first, because that would be the first indicator that there is something structurally pulling the net effective rents in the different direction. We didn't really have materially different concession packages in Q4, nor do we expect to in Q1. So again, we are not seeing this yet occurring in the market, but clearly that's what you would look for and what we would anticipate to happen, if the demand were to subside.", "In shaping our projections of where we see leasing performance, not looking back over 75 or 180 days, but looking forward over 2008, and contrasting that against where we were in January of 2002, I think there is a lot of interesting comparators to make. At each point in time today versus January of '02, we were approximately nine months into an economic downturn that eventually became a full fledged recession.", "However, you should note the following. First, we are starting off in a much better position now than '01 and '02. We have a 6% total vacancy rate versus 9% then in midtown and downtown. We are currently at a 7% vacancy rate as contrasted against approximately 12% at that time. So we are starting off, obviously, from a much better position with much less inventory. That probably is meaningful statistic as anything.", "The other one that, I would say ranks number two is that the component of total availability represented by sublet space is almost negligible. In each case, it is only about 1% of the total vacancy that consists of sublet space. So for midtown, which has a 6% total vacancy, approximately...I want to get this number exact here, approximately little over 1% is sublet space and for downtown it's actually 0.9% of the 7% I spoke of earlier. So why is that so important? Direct landlords, who have strengths, have capacity, are in a much better position to market, hold rents, work the leasing markets in a way that sublet tenants do not. Sublet tenants will put it on the market; they will often put on fully built space. They will cut their rents to move and move quickly, and it's not a driving economic consideration what they get for the space. With us, our business line is the renting of space; we are highly focused on it.", "And us along with our peers, I believe are most focused on not cannibalizing ourselves in the market and having an approach, where we know that direct...lots of direct space or still hard to come by in this market. We are going to hold out for the right deals at the right rents without being reckless in terms of letting good opportunities go by. But I don't think you are going to see panic leasing: one, because the vacancy rates don't warrant it; and two, because most of that space is in the hands of the landlords not the sublet holders. Another interesting statistic is that new construction today is much scarcer than it was back in '01, '02, '03 when there was about 10 million square feet of space delivered to the market. Today it is only 6.5 million square feet slated for a completion in '08 and '09, and of that amount only about 25% is currently available with no new starts scheduled to start beyond. So much less overhang, even though the overhang...even the 10 million feet on the market decides it's not that significant, 6.5 is even less, so in a 1.5 million available is almost negligible.", "Financial service firms are much a leaner than they were back in '01, '02. I think that the combination of them getting much smarter about their space uses and being able to double up and triple up bodies along with a knowledge that if they were to give back space in size today to try and go out and replicate getting that space back in two or three or four years could be very, very expensive and also very hard to locate within one building. We have not seen significant sublet space coming back from these financial service tenants. There were security issues that are more heightened today and then I think they were back in the beginning of 2000. And I think is a result, you'll...it's not to say, everyone is not bottom line focus and you will see space being put on the market, simply think it will be much less volume than you saw back in the beginning of 2000.", "Foreign demand in general because of the dollar and just because of the way the economy has been transforming itself most evidently, I think Manhattan at least for domestic cities. There is still a lot of demand coming from foreign tenants, foreign companies. Some are in size, some are not in size, but there has been several leases that we have seen that have gotten signed on that basis. And we would hope that not just demand for commercial office space, but also just the economic support in the resi market and the retail markets from these companies and these, in certain cases the tourists, who come to us for vacation here, spend money here, and buy second homes here, has clearly had a buffering effect on our economy.", "In our portfolio in general, is now what I would call much more of a fortunes portfolio than we had in early 2000 with very strong credits on average and the absence of some of the smaller non-core less creditworthy space users this that portfolio was evidenced by back then. So for all of these reasons, we are more optimistic on the outlook for the New York City leasing market than clearly some of our investors appear to be. While a 10% to 15% decline in net effective rents over the next 12 to 18 months is possible, we would hope and expect to maintain not less than a 25% mark-to-market on renewals, which would continue to drive organic earnings for the company and maintain our status as a growth stock during a period of time when not many sectors into our companies will have that amount of embedded growth on a market adjusted basis that we believe we will have.", "Turning to the investment market before turning it over to Andrew; while our leasing management construction groups certainly will have their end of the bargain to hold up by leasing and retaining our tenants, the investment group is also working diligently at finding ways to deploy our $1 billion cash availability in ways that will continue to drive external growth. There seems to be prevailing views that asset values must have decreased sizably along with the credit market dislocation to the contrary in the past six months there have been 19 buildings that have traded hands for a total aggregate purchase price of around $7.5 billion, representing roughly $860 per square foot at an average cap rate under 4%.", "We are aggressively looking for growth opportunities, and had combed each of these situations, often concluding that we should either pass or making proposals that were below the prices ultimately achieved by sellers. In some cases that pricing that we put on was around 15% below the ultimate accepted asking price. That's why when we cease the point in opportunity like the Citigroup properties on Greenwich Street, we were able to act quickly and decisively for something we thought fit our current and long-term growth profile, and gave us an opportunity to select what we think was the best of these opportunities, only one out of 19 by number, but about 20% by size of opportunities. So obviously, we made efficient use of our time and effort by striking on something that was of a scale opportunity, where we also think we have very, very good returns.", "Once again as in 2002, I would expect the effect of reducing debt cost to have a sustaining effect on property values, even if there is mitigation in the net effect of rental rates that we get. Recall that in '01, '02, '03, rents were down as much as 25% to 30%, although in conditions that I think were measurably different than today and I just went through those specific reasons, where I think there were differences. However, as a result of falling LIBOR, which briefly hit 1% in the 10 year treasury, which floored flowed with 3%, asset values then held steady, and in certain cases increased over what was then a pretty difficult period of time.", "In its simplest form, the cap rate is nothing more than the blended cost of funds minus expected growth in NOI. Cleary, a declining rental market should result in higher cap rates, unless offset partially or completely by a reduced cost of funds. While we are not necessarily projecting that rate reductions will be sufficient to inflate values, we clearly see the rate reductions is a stabilizing effect to mitigate any potential or forecasted rental rate decline, which in and of itself we would view with a temporary phenomenon for one to two years, until the market recovers and strong tenant demand returns to New York City, which we still think is the best, deepest, most diverse, and most attractive all for CBD and the country.", "This would be...this view that we hold would be entirely consistent with 2001, 2002 and 2003, and also consistent with what we have seen so far in 2007, and the first quarter of 2008. Obviously, current market conditions are no secret, and yet as I stated earlier, 19 deals, $7.5 billion are a very aggressive cap rates. All those people are sophisticated buyers looking at the same metrics, we all look at, and they have decide that with falling cost of funds and with more equity requirement still getting the prices that are very, very healthy asset prices, notwithstanding I think everyone's recognition that the leasing market will be tougher in '08 and '09.", "While the 10 year rate is approaching level last seen in '02, the shorter-term rates consisting of two year treasury, the 90 day LIBOR have long way to run. As the case in point, the longer-term forward curve for LIBOR would predict a LIBOR rate below 2.5%, down from 5.5% when the current credit crisis began, will be at now I guess roughly 3.7%. We would hope to see LIBOR follow suite with U.S. treasury rates, short-term rates, once into bank lending policies losing throughout the year, which I think one would expect to happen if their banks have written down their debt inventories.", "So given all of that, our basic conclusion for '08 is that it is going to be a very tough year, where we have to shape, I guess rollup our sleeves and work very hard to keep harvest thing, the embedded growth that we have, and to find new opportunities that will once again be accretive out of the blocks, or near term as opposed to having to wait for that accretion over a longer period of time, and we have a fortress portfolio and a balance sheet that we put together over the last 10 years that was really designed for this moment in time.", "We are guardedly optimistic that we will demonstrate to the market, how our evolving strategies have come to put us in a position, where we were able to maintain market leading embedded growth rates with sufficient capital to take advantage of new opportunities, and to keep recycling, our mature properties and some new growth opportunities that will generate external growth at a time, where we have falling interest costs. And nobody is more focused on rebuilding our stock price back to prior levels than myself, Steve, Andrew, Greg, and the rest of the management team and employees at SL Green. We will do everything possible to recover and exceed those prior levels.", "With that, I would like to turn it over to Andrew Mathias.", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "Thanks, Mark. As we mentioned at the Investor Conference, we continue to see strength in the Manhattan investment sales market at pricing consistent with fall of 2007 levels. On the investment front, we finished up 2007 with an exciting fourth quarter capped off by our purchase 388, 390 Greenwich Street from Citigroup. This deal represented the most compelling economics we have seen in a New York City transaction in several years, economics that thus far look like they were a result of tenacious deal making rather than indicative of a dramatically softening investment sales market. At a 6.3% going in return with a 13 year non-cancelable lease with CPI escalators and just as importantly at a per square foot basis of $600 per square foot were less than 50% of replacement costs for these properties. We believe this investment will pay enormous dividends to our shareholders both on a current and residual basis.", "Later on an innovative financing structure giving a 68.5% leverage at 5.19% and our joint venture with our long time partners at SITQ and we think the transaction is really on all fronts an out and out winner. The transaction also presents our partnership within the opportunity to reverse exchange into the deal. A strategy we actively deployed on the Reckson acquisition and the strategy will continue...consider employing here depending on the bidding level for 1250 Broadway and asset in a venture with SITQ, which we are currently considering selling. Our sales program continue to be very active in the fourth quarter as well with the closing of the 470 Park Avenue South sale and the hard contract for 449th Avenue, which we expect to close in the coming weeks. As we indicated our December Investor Conference, strong interest in these properties gave us renewed conference in sales market.", "In our retail program, we had our strongest quarter ever. The American Eagle lease we announced on the heels of our investor conference was the highlight as we found the credit anchor tenant we've been searching for to Howard Johnson's site in Times Square. The site will be improved to the spectacular retail store and cutting edge signage installation. When completed in 2009, this will be the third goalpost in the heart of Times Square. In other news we completed the leasing of the remaining 50 feet of our 34 street side signing Aldo and Geox to long-term leases at very compelling economics. Demolition on the site has begun and this additional leasing completes an economic home run for the company and our partner Jeff Sutton. Jeff's tenacity in completing this leasing was truly extraordinary with some strong assistance and back up from SLG's investments and construction operations teams, great job to everybody involved there. The power of this partnership was on full view with our results in the fourth quarter.", "Finally on the structured finance front, we continue to take advantage of market dislocation primarily through co-investments with our Gramercy Capital Corp. affiliate. The investing environment improved with some year end specials notably from dealers, who needed to get assets off their books by year end and needed to hurry to close deals. Gramercy and SL Green's team was ready and took full advantage of these opportunities. We continue to discover the landscape for additional investment opportunities and see a fairly active 2008 on a structured finance front, where new opportunities seem to be presenting themselves daily.", "And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Greg to take you to the numbers.", "Gregory F. Hughes - Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer", "Great, thanks Andrew. I guess probably the biggest change since the investor conference is the fact that the credit crunch has intensified and that the New Year did not bring with it the relief to that that many had predicted. And as a result of this, you are seeing out in the marketplace continued scrutiny and focus on company's balance sheet.", "We have the good fortune of monitoring this closely in any market, including when there is abundance of capital. And so there should be no surprise that we finished the year with a very strong and liquid balance sheet, benefiting from the active asset sales and capital raising efforts that we undertook during 2007.", "We finished the year with $750 million of availability under our credit facilities and this amount will increase to approximately $900 million upon the sale of 449th Avenue scheduled for the end of this month. Our debt carries a weighted average maturity for approximately six years, having termed out the lion's share of our debt as we transform the balance sheet during the year.", "Our debt at 1250 Broadway and 1515 Broadway, which had initial 2008 maturities, both carry as of rate extensions, which could take those maturities out to 2009 and 2010 respectively. Of course, we currently expect the debt on 1250 will be a repaid from the sale of that asset. Accordingly, the only meaningful near term maturity that needs to be addressed is at 717 Fifth Avenue. Discussions for this are already underway, and we expect that our recent deal with Armani should make this a fairly straight forward exercise.", "So as you can see, we have no near-term maturities to be concerned with and we remain very liquid. As we have often talked about, this liquidity enables us to be opportunistic on the investment front. This liquidity helped us close quickly on the Citigroup acquisition and the structured finance opportunities that we alluded to in December, started to take shape with the $120 million of investments that Andrew referenced, all of which closed principally during the last two weeks of December.", "Last, but not least, this liquidity enables us to buyback our stocks at levels, which we think are veryattractive. In addition to being accretive to us on an NAV basis as we outlined during our December meeting, it is also very now accretive on an earnings basis, given that our stock trades at an FFO yield of approximately 7.5%. Today we have bought back $188 million of stock under the $300 million plan, which has been authorized by the Board, and had an implicit cap rate of 6.5% and a price per foot of approximately $460 a foot, we would expect to be continued buyers.", "Other items that have known in the balance sheet include the following. Our investment in Citigroup's headquarter building shows up as a $535 million investment in joint venture along with a $277 million of consolidated debt, reflecting a partnership loan from SITQ. So our $818 million gross investment for the 50.6% interest in that building was funded with $258 million of cash, a $277 million partnership loan from SITQ, and $283 million of mortgage financing, representing our share as the venture's underlying first orders. This attractive acquisition with an innovative capital structure provides us with an initial cash return on equity of 8.6%.", "As we have discussed throughout the year, we completed our 141 analysis with respect to our 2007 acquisitions, most notably the Reckson assets. The recording of this adjustment is the primary contributor to the increase in building and other assets for the quarter, as well as the deferred revenues you have seen recorded during the quarter. As we mentioned in December, we expect the amortization of these deferred revenues related to the Reckson acquisition to contribute approximately $15 million of incremental revenue in 2008.", "As we leave the balance sheet, we feel comfortable that we remain liquid, flexible, and modestly levered. With all these metrics have received lesser attention given the ample capital that was...has been available over the last four years. They will become more important as we move forward, and we believe in this area we stack up very favorably.", "Turning to the P&L; the quarter provided a strong finish to an extraordinary year in which the company posted sector leading FFO growth of 25.4%. Leasing remained healthy with a mark-to-market of 42.7% on the close to 300,000 square feet of office space signed during the quarter. These leases were achieved with TI packages that averaged just $15 and free rent of just 1.4 months, so the concessions on these leases remained modest in response to and as people think about the concession commentary that market provided. These leases carried an average rental rate of $65.68, the highest quarterly average in the company's history, a testament to the rental growth that we have seen, as well as the transformation of the property portfolio to a higher quality portfolio that carries higher average rents and higher operating margins.", "Portfolio finished at 96.6% occupancy even with the scheduled occupancy declines at 420 Lexington Avenue, 317 Madison, and 711 Third Avenue. The occupancy numbers also include a 100 Park Avenue at just 74% occupancy and 1221 Avenue Americas at 93% occupancy. The vacancy at 100 Park represents the assemblage of a large part of space, which should have been under negotiation for seven months, but which has not been consummated to-date. The vacancy at 1221 is a result of holding a plot to space there available at very high rents.", "Vacancies at 42317, 711, 100 park and 1221 contributed to the modest same store NOI growth that we saw during the first quarter. We expect that the same store NOI numbers will revamp during the first quarter of 2008, although the occupancy at 317 will likely continue to lag as that property is managed with and eye towards future redevelopment and income recognition on the vacant spaces at 100 Park will likely not occur until the fourth quarter of 2008 at the earliest.", "The company's other income for the quarter included approximately $5 million of lease cancellation income from one of our properties in Connecticut. This was in addition to realizing...excuse me, this was realized and then we were subsequently able to release a substantial portion of this face to a major financial institution, which was at Realco [ph] and one of the reasons why so good economics coming out of the suburban portfolio for the fourth quarter.", "Our other income also included approximately $10.4 million in fees from Gramercy. The incentive fee from Gramercy was down modestly for the quarter as GKK focused on building its liquidity and preparing for its merger with AFR. However you can see that the GKK contributions remained substantial and should continue to grow following the merger. As Mark noted, these metrics exclude over $30 million that SLG received related to its incentive fee on one Madison and special dividend that was paid out by the Gramercy in January.", "A structure finance investments provided $20.8 million of interest income for the quarter, but reflect little to no benefits from the current quarters investments, since the majority of those investments were made at the end of the quarter. Interest expense was higher principally as a result of having the One Madison Avenue that consolidated for a full quarter. In addition during the quarter, we stopped capitalizing interest on certain projects, and we also recorded a $1.6 million mark on an interest rate hedge, accelerating the reorganization of interest expanse, which otherwise would have been realized in 2008.", "In closing, we remain confident about our ability to meet the guidance set forth at our December investor meeting, and are optimistic that our strong liquidity will enable us to capitalize on investment opportunities. As people continue to ask whether the Manhattan market is headed for a repeat of 2001 and 2002, it is worth remembering in those years that the company was able to generate average FFO per share growth of 11.5% during that timeframe.", "And with that, I would like to turn it back over to Marc.", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Thank you, Greg. Before we open up for Q&A, two things I'd like to come back and address, spend a lot of time talking about the Manhattan metrics. And I think it's important, and we also acknowledged the great efforts this year of our management team up in White Plains, who oversee the suburban portfolio. They did an excellent job this year.", "$4.3 million square feet portfolio in Westchester and Connecticut to remind listeners. We exceeded NOI projections for the 11 months of ownership by 14%, and also in terms of new and renewal leasing there was about 500,000 feet of leasing that this group did, broken down almost equally between new and renewal leases. And in the aggregate, those leases were 19.5% above plan. So, excellent leasing stats in markets that don't quite have the same dynamics as we enjoy in Manhattan, so hard it to pull those results together.", "Occupancy is slightly above 90% in markets that are roughly 85% to 86% leased on average in Westchester and Connecticut, respectively. And we had over a 10% mark-to-market on that leasing activity, again across Connecticut and Westchester. Greg mentioned a lease termination that we received over at Rye Brook two when MCI terminated; and within two months of termination, there were leases signed with a major financial services company and another advisory company for over 39,000 square feet at rent substantially higher than MCI was paying. So the pay blend and extent is not limited only to Manhattan, and these guys pulled it off twice up in Westchester. And I want to congratulate them on that.", "We are strategically ramping up our cross selling efforts. Diamondback came to New York City this year. is 200,000 feet Chesapeake and Brown [ph] we exported to White Plains or they chose to export themselves to White Plains, and we helped that was 10,000 square feet. We have four projects currently underway, total capital budget around $10 million that we are sprucing up to obtain higher rents, two in White Plains one in Rye Brook and...sorry, one in White Plains, one in Rye Brook, one in Greenwich and one in New Jersey. So we look forward to those capital dollars bearing some fruit in '09, and across the portfolio, we have very strong credit tendencies. Only one tenant on the watch list that's about the 25,000 square foot home builder; other than that, we feel very good about the credit in that suburban portfolio. So I wanted to bring you up to speed on that.", "Lastly, we mentioned one of the big projects for us this year on a value-add basis. We talked about investments and leasing, but also on a redevelopment side, 1515 Broadway, we expect to kick that redevelopment off some time mid year. That will be probably one and an a half to two year full swing, but that's going to be the most ambitious redevelopment project we've undertaken to-date. And we look forward to giving you more details about how that unfolds on the next conference call.", "With that, we thank you for your time, and open it up for questions.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of John Stewart with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.", "John Stewart - Credit Suisse", "Thank you. Marc, I was hoping I could get you to amplify on your comment that financial service firms are much leaner today than they were going until the last downturn. Just hoping if I could get you to kind of quantify that a bit and address how much you think that we'll see come out of the market of sublease space?", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "I would have to work to quantify for you. I can only do it at this moment by feel Citigroup, J.P. Morgan were big downsizers back in '01, '02. Buildings like 522 Fifth...the one that when full build into...", "Unidentified Company Representative", "522 Fifth, 245 Park.", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "Andrew, the other one is that chase downsize out of it...", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "1166 Avenue of Americas and 245 Park...", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "Right, also...or Schmack had a big block of space, they've sublet some of that. I can serve them financial services. There was a block at 450 or 33rd, so again there was much more identifiable big blocks, where I can just rattle off on the top of my head, JP Morgan Chase, City, Schmack [ph]...", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "Goldman Sachs, Goldman Sachs of One Liberty had...I think two to three floors of technology, group ready space, I immediately downtown the sublet market in 2002, so...", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "So when you add that all up that is quite that several million square feet of space that just that overhang doesn't exist now, just because as I said, they got very lean, they grew; space got expensive, so they probably didn't grow. There were a lot more requirements on the table in '07 that will ultimately get done now as a result of the credit situation, but that space demand was a result of the fact that they had gotten very lean, they had very...5, 6 successful years back to back, and were they are tight.", "So now there will be less tight, but they are still not going to be at a point, where I think you are going to see big blocks come back from what we've heard from our tenants is that the space seems to be more Swiss cheese, if you use that terminology, but that's what it is with little pockets of space throughout the building, the cost to restack, create the contiguous space then the course to sublet only to then have the pay for growth again in 2, 3, 4 years. I think a lot of these folks are deciding, is going to be too prohibitive and they are not ready yet to make that kind of wholesale judgment.", "Without names, I will give you an example of one tenant we called recently; we thought it was no-brainer, because we heard there was some downsizing. We said, hey, we will take back some space for you, because we have a requirement we can fill it with and uptick it for ourselves. And the response was: we have nowhere to put them, thank you very much, which was surprising, but maybe that will change. But right now they didn't take us on our offer to take that, fairly sizable chunk of space. So that's the best thing to do here right now, we can maybe try and get you harder statistics after the call. But clearly, I can make that statement confidently that they are leaner.", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "Yes, Marc, we have heard that from two our two largest financial services tenants have both told us they do not have excess space and we are not interested in giving back any space as part of those conversations.", "John Stewart - Credit Suisse", "That's helpful, thank you. My second question would be obviously another strong leasing quarter and the fourth quarter with respect some of that activity, where was deals that would have been negotiated previously. So my question is when you look at net effective rents on deals that are being negotiated today, what's your sense for the change from a year ago?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Not radically different. The deals that we are doing today a little bit more concession we think, where it's going to a trend it to a little bit more concession. The fourth quarter transactions that we did were a combination of deals that were started sort of mid year and also a number of deals that were commenced and executed on a very fast track basis. The things that we have in the pipeline right now, pretty consistent with what we saw in the fourth quarter, but I will say that the sense is that we are going to...we like a lot of our owners are going to be a little more defensive. We are going to do a few more pre-builds in advance. If we have to stretch for an extra 5 bucks in TI or an extra month of free rent it's going to happen. But more I think as what as the market settles and as demand settles down, because you've got to take it in the context of all of last year was still massive rent increases. And as the economy softens and demand slows down, there has got to be an impact on net effective rents and even on the asking rents, because we are coming off from such a high.", "John Stewart - Credit Suisse", "And do you have the sense for what that changes today?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "I don't think you really quantified it yet, because the stats clearly are trailing reality. If you looked at the end of '07, rents across the board in Manhattan were still up 25% to 27%. If you can bear that over two years rents are up over 50% over the last 24 months. So I think right now you are going to see a kind of a flat line for a bit of time and it would be more on the net effective that you see rents trail off a bit.", "John Stewart - Credit Suisse", "Okay, thanks guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kristin Brown with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "Kristin Brown - Deutsche Bank", "Hi, good afternoon. I just wanted to ask if you are starting to see any opportunities from the private sellers in the market.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Andrew?", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "Sure, not really. There are couple of notable debt maturities this year, which I am sure you have seen in the press, which have put some assets in to play. None of those I would call distressed or sort of got to raise cash, so willing to take any price type opportunities, they are more professionally marketed processes. And beside from those couple of situations, the sellers in the market are generally patient and running broker processes, where as Marc mentioned in his section, we are continuing to see incredibly strong per foot prices and cap rates expenses.", "Kristin Brown - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then my second question is just as to the timing of the FAS 144 adjustment; is that evenly spread through the year or what's the timing?", "Gregory F. Hughes - Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer", "Yes, it should be evenly spread, kind of through 2008.", "Kristin Brown - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, please as a reminder, please remember to limit questions to two per person. Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Paolone with JP Morgan. Please proceed.", "Anthony Paolone, C.F.A. - JP Morgan Securities, Inc.", "Okay, thank you. Greg, last quarter you talked about $9 million, I think annualized FFO or NOI that was kind of on the side lines until leases actually commenced, running numbers. And I was just wondering if you could update that number, give us a sense as to if any of that came in the fourth quarter?", "Gregory F. Hughes - Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer", "I would say that the contribution to fourth quarter from those was modest, maybe $1 million to $2 million of the nine actually making it through and you should really love to see that coming through in the first quarter of 2008.", "Anthony Paolone, C.F.A. - JP Morgan Securities, Inc.", "Okay, thanks. And my second question is, I was wondering if you can...maybe for Andrew. Give us a little sense as to something like the GM building, which is reportedly up for sale, how SL Green might go about underwriting an asset like that in terms of IRRs, where you think market rents are cap rates residual cap rates, just anything along how you are thinking would go an underwriting right now?", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "Sure; obviously, it's a unique property and one which is fairly unlikely will be competitive for that type of property. It's not been our bread and butter, fully auction process for that type of thing. But I think the buyer there and who CB Richard Ellis is hoping to find is going to be somebody who work under our rents between a $150 to $200 per square foot and from low to high in a building. And I think that type of buyer will be a 7.5% to 8% IRR type player, looking to experience significant rent growth in that asset, although the growth really comes between years 10 and 12 with relatively little. Until then there are some notable below market leases which will roll in about 10 or 12 years out.", "Anthony Paolone, C.F.A. - JP Morgan Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Thank you. Marc or maybe Andrew, could you just give us a little bit of flavor for how the investor market is shaping up sort of real time? I know you did talk about cap rates over the last six months... transactions over the last six months. But what are we seeing sort of in last 30 to 60 days or investors are still clamoring and has the mix of people changed it all?", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "It continued strength... no, unlike leasing where Steve Durels gave an answer earlier was a little bit of a... we'll have to wait and see. Here's what could happen. Here's what we're seeing now. We can tell you real-time data the appetite from Manhattan office buildings is strong. I'll let Andrew discuss the mix, but as a matter of fact I had on the sheet. We can discuss the mix in a moment. There's clearly a lot of foreign buys, but there are a lot of domestic buyers. Cap rates not appreciably higher than they were over the past six months, and that's just based on our testing in the market now with some current offerings, and some other properties that we are aware of, that are out there. And available, all sort of confirming or reaffirming the comments we made earlier about the 19 trade that had gotten done. So --", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "Yes, I mean Marc, I think the mix of buyers has been very consistent with our investor conference slide where you're still seeing a good diversity of buyers, foreign players, local... very wealthy local players who are not deterred by the fact that generally they're levering these buildings at 60% to 65%, maybe 70% as opposed to 80% or 85% before the credit crisis.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay. That's helpful. And my follow up is having listened to Gramercy's call last week, I guess one of the themes I took away from there is that they're hoarding liquidity. And I was curious to know if that thought process had led over into SL Green a little bit, and maybe if you could sort of comment on what your current liquidity is today.", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I think we had... on Gramercy, we had raised money there. We do have a $3.5 billion acquisition over there that's scheduled to close at the end of March. And the opportunities particularly in the mezzanine and preferred positions that we were seeking out didn't really start to present themselves in large fashion till the end of December. So that was very much by design there, and we are very focused on closing a foreign transaction. At Green, I think I went kind of through the numbers as we think about it with 440 Times scheduled to close here in a couple of weeks who basically have $900 million of liquidity available under our line at L plus 90. So kind of at those levels you can easily put it out into kind of any investments, then it'd be very accretive. But we are naturally being selective. There's no urgency to put money out. We think we can meet our earnings expectations with kind of what we have on the play currently. And so we have the luxury of being able to be patient and wait for things to shape lose.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jay Habermann with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs and Company", "Hi. Good afternoon. I guess Marc or perhaps or Steve, but Marc, in your comments you mentioned that you could perhaps see a 10% to 15% drop in the net effective rent. I know you touched on it earlier. But can you just give us a sense of what you need to see in the market for that to take place? What level of lay-offs or where do you think vacancy needs to go?", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "You need to see in sublets space. I mean lay-off unto themselves is not going to drive it. I know you're asking, how do the lay-offs translate to the sublets space? You can't just... I couldn't tell you that. I don't know if Steve can either. There are people who make attempts at it. But it really relates back to my prior comments of how under capacity were these folks to begin with and then of these lay-offs how many are really lay-offs? What sort of natural attrition? How much is New York, and just non-New York? When is it going to occur? And if these institutions wind up with space, is it going to be continuous such that it can be a sublet or is it Swizz Cheese in which case, they're going to be much more low to do it.", "So, I think you're going to have to see a pretty high volume of lay-offs. And by high I would mean something in the range of 25,000 to 50,000 folks that are rising purely New York city in the primary space, that otherwise wasn't slated to be garnered replaced or moved, and that are replaced with new people, sometimes people are laid off and others will be higher, this is switching, caught fire and not laying off. And also you have to recognize that those 25,000 to 50,000 people, they get jobs. Some of the great... a lot of these financial boutique firms and hedge funds today that are occupying a lot of space and paying the big rents in Manhattan, a lot of them came out of the '01, '02, '03 decline. So it's not like, they're going and gone forever.", "So it's got... I can only say it's got to be a big number, I'd say 25,000 to 50,000 people which start to make an impact. It certainly... I don't think that would account for 3 to 4 points of vacancy because you need about 3 points or a 9% total vacancy rate to get back to a level that where tenants would have the... would be in the driver seat again. But it's a little bit of speculation. I think you better serve really just watching the sub-rent availabilities because that will directly impact the direct space.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs and Company", "Okay, thanks. And also in terms of acquisition opportunities, I guess, how far are you willing to push leverage in this environment? I know Greg, you mentioned, obviously the higher scrutiny on the balance sheet. But I am just curious, I mean, would you look more structured finance and how far would you move that area? And number two, what sort of leverage level are you comfortable at?", "Gregory F. Hughes - Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer", "Well I think structured finance, I think Andrew went through in the December investor conference. We very much expect that that's going to generate a lot of opportunity in 2008. In terms of how high could we yield with our leverage, a lot of our assets are with credit long term leases. So a lot of people would argue that they should be higher levered to begin with. So would you take that comfortably up to 60%? Yes, that's a possibility. Again we're going to continue with the investment demand being very hard to sell assets as a source of capital which is our reserve to help delever we are in the market with 1250 currently. But I mean if you had to circle could we go up to 50%? I think that's certainly a level we would be comfortable with.", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "And by that I mean Greg is referring to our value. So we have our own independent view of value. I think on that basis we are below 50% today. So that's a lot of debt capacity. If we were so inclined I think if you look back historically we've never really been much above 50 or low 50's.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs and Company", "That's great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citi. Please proceed.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "Yes good afternoon. Greg you talked about 610-620 as reiteration of guidance. Can you just clarify? My understanding was at the 388-390 Greenwich was not in those numbers before, and I think you took some write-offs in this quarter that you said were part of '08. So I'm just trying to understand why guidance is not up.", "Gregory F. Hughes - Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer", "Well no, I think we had talked about in December that the guidance included some acquisitions. So I would say that, that would count towards that. And I mentioned that we're expecting some delay in the leasing over at a 100 Park. So that would be going in the other direction. So net, net, and giving the uncertainties in the market as we said today we are reaffirming where we got it six weeks ago.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "And where is your sense of acquisitions in terms of the FFO impact? It looked like this 388-390 is probably north of $0.10 on an annualized basis. What other... what offers in your guidance for acquisitions both in terms of on the structured finance or on just straight property that's embedded in your guidance?", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "Not much in the way of additional acquisitions, and we probably have a couple of hundred million dollars more source of finance, sort of embedded. But I mean things changed throughout, so we may exceed those levels which would be more accretive. There may be other areas that we would look to take our time on harvesting.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "And we have been active sellers as well.", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "So remember, everything we do, it could be one of two things Michael, either accelerate earnings or it can accelerate our ability to harvest create more what I call free capital, since it's not dilutive on share basis and then redeploy for future use. So our goal is always 10% a year. I think our compounded to date is over 11% per year. We were up 25% last year. I think our guidance for this year is around 6%. And we may do things that would cause us to go above that. This year I hope we do. But then we may use that as opportunities to be more patient in other areas to try and create as much positive momentum to '09 and '10 as possible. So last year we took the same approach but there was so much guffling [ph] on we were not very successful in trying to keep a measured pace there and obviously we were up 25%. Maybe we will be this year too but that's not our objective.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "And just remind me on 1250 which you are looking to sell. When you guys refinanced, you sort of took to promote and got a higher interest in the asset. I guess when you look to sell at the levels you are looking today is there any promote that will flow into FFO?", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "There could be yes.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "And is that included in the guidance right now or not?", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "Yes, I think if you look back to the slide we presented it's actually contemplated that there would be absolutely some promote income flowing through. I think we mentioned it might come from 1250, it might come from 55 Corporate and... but we gave you a whole list without being very specific as to where it's going to come from.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "Okay. Thank you.", "Gregory F. Hughes - Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer", "Thanks Mike.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed.", "John Guinee - Stifel Nicolaus", "Hi, one quick question. I have never in all the years I have been in the business seen so much negative expectations on a 6% vacant market with virtually no new product delivered in the next couple of years. Can you kind of walk through just real four or five quick sound bites as to the bull case for the Midtown market?", "Steven M. Durels - Executive Vice President, Director of Leasing", "Well, I mean if you want... the bull case is Libor drops to one. Treasury has dropped to 3, rental declines are modest 10%, 15% or less. And therefore the cost of funds decline has a much more pronounced impact than the rental decline or no or even rents flat. Foreign demand is unabated, and we are selling assets recycling, putting it into deals that are accretive out of the blocks. And you take the accretion that we can create internally and externally, and we could be seeing supercharge growth rates. I mean Greg said it before I assume, I would repeat I think was that important '01, '02, '03.", "Gregory F. Hughes - Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer", "'01 and '02 which are the...", "Steven M. Durels - Executive Vice President, Director of Leasing", "'01 and '02 our FFO was up 11.5% compounded I guess in two years. So that's pretty damn good. I mean I don't know there is not a lot of platforms out there that can take advantage of their markets and keep churning out 10%, 11% a year. Year after year we've been doing it for a decade now and hope to carry that forward. And there is a case where we take our billion dollars. We are kind... can lay the tracks for the next 2 to 4 years on what could be explosive capital gains like we saw over the past 2 to 4 years. Rents that don't really drift down that much and they are following cost of funds that's... that'd be a pretty bull scenario.", "John Guinee - Stifel Nicolaus", "Thank you very much. Great.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Haley with Wachovia. Please proceed.", "Brandon Meyer - Wachovia Securities, LLC", "Hi good morning. It's good afternoon. It's Brandon Meyer and not Chris. Marc or Greg just to follow up on that comment. In terms of the company and the position for growth now relative to 6 to 7 years ago how do you feel SL Green is positioned for that type of FFO per share growth going forward?", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "Make sure I understand the question. Are we as well positioned now as we were in '05 '06 for that kind of growth?", "Brandon Meyer - Wachovia Securities, LLC", "Well more in '01 to '02 timeframe when there was another down market or similar down market?", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "Well I mean look our properties are better. We have got an equivalent amount of embedded rents. So I can't say more or less we are 40% plus embedded today. We were 40% plus embedded then, so that 40% kind of disappeared down to like five if you recall and that was because of all the factors that I went through earlier, I don't see the same factors here. So if we are more in the 20's than in the single-digits which I think I'm going to call it worst case because I am not making that kind of market call, let's call it a reasonable case. Then in that sense we should have a better organic growth. We didn't have a billion of liquidity relative to our total size then as we do now. So our ability to grow externally is much better.", "So, I'd have to say at least, I feel sort of equally as good. I don't know better because look it's... if we are a $13 billion company today and it's... I guess that's market cap is close around... the equity cap is around 6.5 or 7. And that is just a much tougher and bigger not to make those kind of earnings on. But we do, do it and we have a game plan where we see capital gains, incentive fees, retail opportunities, embedded growth in our rents, Gramercy suburban platform which I think is market here [ph], there will be some gains in that portfolio down the road. There's a lot of good things to point to and I think we'll be able to keep it up.", "Brandon Meyer - Wachovia Securities, LLC", "Great, thanks for the color on that. And then the last question in terms of relative opportunities between the structured finance opportunities and direct property investments. I mean how would you guys price the risk reward ratio between those two investments on current pricing, and just where more of the opportunities lie? It sounds like it's more in the structured finance side. But--", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "Yes structured finance... yes it comes and goes. There were times we've been big, big property partners. And last year until the credit sort of dislocated we were doing very little structured and we were doing kind of real estate. Now put aside Gramercy Greenwich [ph] itself was a massive investment. But in terms of the opportunities set out there risk adjusted basis to do mez, pref secondary market buys along with Gramercy for deals that are just too big in a market with scale dictate attention. So lot of people who can write $25 million to $50 million checks is not a lot you can write $250 million checks for debt today. And the combination of Green Gramercy can we get preferred pricing. If you listen to Gramercy's call we got a lot of product at the end of December that went either entirely for the benefit of Gramercy or in some cases it was participated that's our agreement. So, Andrew once you are way in, but I think clearly I think the opportunity today was--", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "Yes, I would agree a shifting back a bit towards structured finance although look as I said I think 388 Greenwich was the most compelling real estate opportunity we have seen in several years.", "Brandon Meyer - Wachovia Securities, LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with UBS. Please proceed.", "James Feldman - UBS", "Thank you very much. Can you just talk a little bit about your credit watch list in terms both the structured finance portfolio and any changes to their core portfolio?", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "Any changes to the core portfolio meaning the real estate?", "James Feldman - UBS", "Yes, I mean tenant, physical tenants.", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "Let's take it reverse order Steve, tenant delinquency types etcetera. We haven't seen it, we moderate it very closely. We have every 30 days, we have a large group that assembles to go through every single tenant in the portfolio, anybody who is trailing behind payments. We haven't seen an any material erosion on that. We've had a couple of small tenants who have come to us and said, hey I need to work with the space but I am going to downsize or get rid of my space. We have actually converted each and every one of those into an opportunity to replace the tenancy with higher rent paying tenants. But just to quantify that it's a handful of deals we see fairly modest amount of space.", "So we haven't seen any real shift on the ageing of arrears or those tenants coming to us expressing concerns we are sort of getting out in front of a problem I think that's testimony to a couple of things. One is it's a different dynamics today than it was in the last market downturn. We had to check rack in the telecom guys who were in industries that were weak and going out of business. Today the majority of tenants are much healthier businesses. And certainly the tenants within our portfolio given the quality of the buildings, the quality of the tenants and the extensive amount of efforts that we have put into over the last couple of years to bet out the credit of our tenants upon leasing space I think pulls out that we are in pretty good. Steve right now", "Steven M. Durels - Executive Vice President, Director of Leasing", "I guess so that's on the tenant side. On the structured finance side I would say anything directly originated by us or in Gramercy, I should say Gramercy then participated through us. I think we have nothing in the way of any kind of credit exposure, and Andrew can confirm... Andrew is that accurate?", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "Yes in the structured finance portfolio.", "Steven M. Durels - Executive Vice President, Director of Leasing", "Yes, and then Wheel, Reckson which we inherited to smallish kind of positions but we inherited them. And one of them I think is Glen Cove Long Islands, how big is that position Andrew?", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "I'd have to come back John [ph] I think it's about $15 million or less.", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "It is a $10 million position we have. There may be small amount of exposure. I mean this is immaterial in the grand scheme but just for, because you asked the question, I think we are somewhere between covered or this is a de minimis exposure we may have in the $10 million investment. And the other one is this RSVP situation which we kind of stepped into when we bought the New York asset and suburban platform, that we have a... it's a quasi-passive position there which we're going to start to focus on more intently. Again not a big position, I think it's okay but again it's... I feel better about the stuff we originated and the stuff we've taken over. And those are the only two areas that we'd even call soft spots in the entire structured finance portfolio which today stands at $800 million. So we're pretty proud of that record.", "James Feldman - UBS", "Okay, thanks. And then in terms of the guidance, what does it assume for same store growth for both the consolidated in the JV portfolios?", "Gregory F. Hughes - Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer", "Around 6%.", "James Feldman - UBS", "6% blended.", "Gregory F. Hughes - Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer", "Yes.", "James Feldman - UBS", "So I guess there was a 4% decline in JV this quarter, that should turn or do you think that stays negative for--", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "Yes I think, well I think the number is a little misleading. On one of the properties we had substantial lease cancellation income in the fourth quarter last year. I think you'll see a significant turn coming out at 1221 Avenue the Americas and likely an uptick from 100 Park which was under redevelopment for the balance of 2007.", "James Feldman - UBS", "Do youthink they both end up around fix or are you still consolidated much higher?", "Gregory F. Hughes - Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer", "I think it's probably... those ones is not quite as high as that, but they will be picked up by some of the other assets in the portfolio.", "James Feldman - UBS", "Okay. And then year end occupancy, what is guidance assumed?", "Gregory F. Hughes - Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer", "I think I got to check for you, I think it's around 96%.", "James Feldman - UBS", "It's pretty much flat from where we are?", "Gregory F. Hughes - Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer", "Yes.", "James Feldman - UBS", "And then total square feet lease, I think you guys were at 282 this quarter, that's some kind of low for... I mean do you think you rents up or is this kind of the new world?", "Gregory F. Hughes - Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer", "I think, we have kind of three quarters of a million square feet of scheduled lease expirations next ext year. And we've always been... we have always exceeded the scheduled lease expirations, but those have been in up markets. So, we'll have to wait and see how 2008 unfold to see whether we are more aggressive or just being with the scheduled expirations.", "Steven M. Durels - Executive Vice President, Director of Leasing", "Yes, remember that our scheduled explorations for '08 were a 1,200,000 square feet. We knocked off at the end of '07 over almost a 0.25 million square feet of that, 20% of our '08 roll was already to bid before we started the year. So as a year, this is a fairly light year of leasing. So, I think we'll still do a lot of production for the year, and I think we'll also see a good deal of opportunities come our way that are outside of world, where we take space back and convert it into on selected basis into opportunities for upticks. Because at the end of the day we still have massive mark-to-market to harvest.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors. Please receive.", "Michael Knott, C.F.A. - Green Street Advisors, Inc.", "Hey guys. I may be the only one left by now.", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "We're all with you Michael.", "Michael Knott, C.F.A. - Green Street Advisors, Inc.", "Okay. A couple of quick questions. I think that you told me before that the Graybar Building is a good barometer for smaller tenants. And I have noticed that over the past several quarters you've lost about 400 basis points of occupancy there. Can you just talk about that particular building for a moment?", "Steven M. Durels - Executive Vice President, Director of Leasing", "It's more timing than anything else. Graybar actually is a very light year. Our biggest tenant that was scheduled to roll this year was Bank Leumi. We renewed them last year that was over 50,000 square feet. They upticked their rent, they did it early. We are in negotiation with our second biggest tenant to renew them right now of about 25,000 square feet. After that the largest piece of space that rolls in the building, I think it's about 8,000 square feet this year. So, we are sitting on a couple of points of vacancy in the building. I think we will... and I think it will be pretty stable throughout the year. We're stilling seeing tenants come to the building with modest expansion needs, still starting new businesses. I think it remains a very good barometer. We haven't seen material subleases coming on to the market through this particular building. So, a year where we got ahead of it and really took care of business last year, and I think we are in a very good shape for the balance of the year.", "Michael Knott, C.F.A. - Green Street Advisors, Inc.", "Yes, Steve, it's Michael. The building is not yet about 1.4 million rentable, I think plus or minus 7 points of vacancy would be about 100,000 square feet. Steve does that sound... what would comprise the biggest component of the hundreds or is there a lot of little spaces?", "Steven M. Durels - Executive Vice President, Director of Leasing", "It's a lot of little spaces there. Right now, we have got about 45,000 feet of current vacancy. We've got another 27,000 feet of space that is just rolling over the next month or so and then another 72,000 feet through the end of the year. So not a lot to talk about the biggest piece of space that we've got to knock it off. And I'll correct one thing is that we move the tenants from Graybar over to 485 Lexington Avenue late last year. Konica Minolta, here we needed to expand, so we moved them within the portfolio. And therefore we have got their 20,000 feet back that was...", "Michael Knott, C.F.A. - Green Street Advisors, Inc.", "On top of the 45,000.", "Steven M. Durels - Executive Vice President, Director of Leasing", "Yes, that was scheduled to roll before... out of the couple of years of remaining term on it but still very solid demand, rents popped into this building second half of last year where the average deals that we are doing today are in the high 50's to low 60's per square foot. And to add a little bit color on Andrew asked me or maybe it was last July or August where I never thought this building would be a $60 building. I said yes, you never see it, and two months later I was proven wrong. And those rents are still holding as we speak.", "Michael Knott, C.F.A. - Green Street Advisors, Inc.", "Okay. And then my last question is can you just talk a little bit about some of the deals in the structured finance portfolio that were added this quarter? It looked like the financing senior to your investments almost doubled to about $20 billion. Can you just talk a little bit about that?", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "Andrew.", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "Financing senior I am not sure we are at $20 billion.", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "What do you mean $20 billion, Mike can you just expand on that?", "Michael Knott, C.F.A. - Green Street Advisors, Inc.", "On page 31 of the supplemental.", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Michael Knott, C.F.A. - Green Street Advisors, Inc.", "Just curious it looks like may be the riskiness of that pool increased significantly if I am reading that page right.", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "I don't know... I think from the Gramercy call I mean we've actually decreased, lowered our last dollar LTV inflection point on our deals, because we are generally buying more senior mezzanine interest per yields that the most junior mezzanine used to carry. So most of the positions we've taken have been second, third or fourth losses as opposed to first losses. So it surprises me, I don't think it's--", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "Andrew I think we have extended stay.", "Steven M. Durels - Executive Vice President, Director of Leasing", "It's probably one that is a more... that's a very much--", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "That's just a more of a piece.", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "That's a very large trade. A lot of senior financial would have very small, relatively small piece of that.", "Michael Knott, C.F.A. - Green Street Advisors, Inc.", "It's a very small position in a very large financing. So you have that I guess aggregating on top.", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "Right. I would say by and large Michael you'll see us in... I am looking about 5 to 6 deals we did in the quarter. They were generally down the capital stack in terms of riskiness, that was one monster financing. I wouldn't imply that $7 billion of underlying debt, in any way sort of cross structured finance portfolio, I think it is limited to that investment. But it would otherwise skew how much is subordinate if you are looking at in the aggregate, so does it make sense?", "Michael Knott, C.F.A. - Green Street Advisors, Inc.", "Right.", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "So I think you got almost carved that one deal out and looked at it. Without that you have $13 billion relative to all the balance and then I think if anything we'd be the same or less on an exposure basis.", "Michael Knott, C.F.A. - Green Street Advisors, Inc.", "Okay, thanks.", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "All right. Operator that's all the time we have for questions. Thank you for whoever has been with us for hour and a half. We appreciate seeing you in December and rejoining us today to give you a commentary on the market. And we look forward to speaking to you again in three months.

This conference call is being recorded.", "At this time, the company would like to remind the listeners that during the call management may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from predictions that management may make today. Actual results may differ from predictions that management may make today. Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the company's Form 10-Q and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "Also during today's conference call, the company may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure discussed in the reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found on the company's website at www.slgreen.com by selecting the press release regarding the company's first quarter earnings.", "Before turning the call over to Marc Holliday, Chief Executive Officer of SL Green Realty Corp, we would like to ask those of you participating in the Q&A portion of the call to please limit your questions to two per person.", "Thank you. You can go ahead, Marc.", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. As is our custom, we would like to take the next hour or so and review with you the quarter's activities and results and provide some market commentary, after which we'll take some questions at the end.", "Our earnings results released last night followed by the announcement of the signing of a significant lease at 1185 Sixth Avenue are indicators that the company's performance is proceeding in a manner that we anticipated in December at our Investment Conference and have reiterated several times since then. The company's performance was very good in the first quarter, especially when viewed against the backdrop of challenging economic environment and continuing illiquidity in the credit markets.", "Back in December, we said that 2008 was going to be largely an internal growth story. And in fact, that is what is proving to be the case with over 0.5 million square feet of leasing completed by SL Green in the first quarter alone of 44% mark to market achieved on that leasing while concessions on those leases held relatively steady.", "These rental increases in turn helped drive double-digit same-store growth and drove FFO ahead of where we have forecasted for the quarter. While interest rate declined helped, we had forecasted lower rates of interest in the first quarter and the bulk of the upside for the quarter was stronger than anticipated revenues.", "Our focus continues to be the on the leasing market in the New York City economy in general where we are tracking current demand and sublet availabilities in order to project how we will be able to realize the embedded growth within our portfolio throughout the remainder of the year.", "In the face of mounting layoffs in the financial services firms, leasing activity is slowing but continuing at levels that are better than we experienced in 2001, 2002 and 2003. Primary reasons that the latent demand has been able to continue to keep pace with direct and rising sublet availabilities is because we enter this downturn with a very strong starting position of 5% vacancy at the peak now stands at around 6%.", "Competitive sublet space still being relatively scarce, there is about 2 million to 2.5 million square feet of identifiable sublet space from the financial service firms that have come online throughout 2007, the first quarter of '08, but that represents less than 0.5% of total inventory from midtown and downtown.", "Thirdly, financial service companies are more efficiently stacked now than they were going into the 2001 downturn where there was lots of excess capacity and availability to begin with. Fourth, bankruptcies are not as prevalent now as they were back then, particularly because the sector that's feeling the biggest strain right now is actually one of the most creditworthy sectors, the financial service firms, not the technology firms that mark the downturn of '01.", "And lastly, new construction projects have been largely deferred with negligible overhang from construction and process. We had pointed this out as one of the silent mitigants to a slackening of demand in the financial services sector was the 5 or 6 million square feet that were slated to be built in 2008, 2009, 2010 have all been largely shelved except for whatever was sort of too far down the road or topping out in '07, and we are pleased to be able to report that.", "We have no projects right now that we've undertaken or intend to undertake or had to defer as a result of the slowdown. The only notable development deal in our pipeline is 317 Madison Avenue which right now is still fairly fully leased as we were taking our time on the development process and had always called it a next cycle opportunity, not thinking the timing was right for this cycle. I think that was a decision that in retrospect was a good decision.", "The reasons that I just reviewed explain why major deals were signed in and around the first quarter, with the UN signing at 380 MAD, Ogilvy at 630, 611, Colgate at 300 Park, Grey Advertising at 205th, Gibson Dunn, 250 West 55th, and then SL Green had wait-in with four significant leases in the quarter, Segal, Cranes, Omnicom renewal over at 220 East 42nd Second Street and the News America deal that we announced this morning that being a deal that Steve Durels and Howard Tenenbaum have been working on very actively for the past few months. We're able to see that to fruition in the past few days or week, and we're pleased to be able to report that deal today, substantial deal or growth, big mark to market bringing that 1185 building down to 99% occupancy.", "Notably, not one of those companies I just listed is a financial services firm, showing that the diversity of the Manhattan economy can mitigate volatility in the financial service markets, which account for approximately 35% of all office space in Manhattan. As it relates specifically to SL Green's portfolio, we have remaining lease explorations over the next nine months of approximately 600,000 square feet or 2.5% of our portfolio. These rollovers have an average in place escalated rent of $46 per foot, and that should enable us, on average, to greatly exceed the expiring rents as and when we re-tenant or renew those spaces.", "We do, however, stand by our previous statement that we believe the leasing market will soften as a result of the lack of financial service firms' participation in the leasing market and net effective rents could drop by 10% to 15% from their peak level. I think that when a third of your user base has basically pulled back from the market, the other major New York firms could do so much to sop up the space, but obviously, we all await the next a year or two for these firms to regain their footing, get past the write-offs, enjoy the benefit of the low interest rates to replenish their coffers, and then get back into a maintaining growth mode, which they're clearly not in now.", "But that said, they've been in this mode now for almost 15 months being sort of pulling back or out of the market. And with that said, I think the New York City market has held up surprisingly well and satisfyingly very well.", "With 40% of the embedded growth in the portfolio on a mark to market basis, we do not expect these potential reductions that I just talked about to materially impede our ability to grow our revenues and our same-store income for the balance of the year. This was the primary consideration that led us to increase the midpoint of our earnings guidance by $7.5 per share last evening.", "The leasing strategies we'll employ in this type of market will be a larger amount of pre-build units to minimize downtime and maximize rental income, and while those pre-builds will come at a higher TI cost, we should be able to amortize a fair amount of that in the higher than average rents that you'll get for the pre-builds. There is also an expected widening by a couple of months of free rent in order to give some tenants relief from sticker shock that they are facing when they roll off of old rents in toady's current market.", "We are, however, successful at maintaining our loss factors. We are almost universally getting the increased loss factors even in this market. And on a capitalized basis, that's the most valuable of the components to drive.", "The suburbs, while many suburban markets, including our Tri-State area, have been suffering from the general economic decline that is being experienced elsewhere in the country, I'm happy to say the suburbs definitely showed up, pulled their weight in New York, New Jersey, White Plains, Stamford, Connecticut. There was 165,000 square feet of leasing in 20 separate deals, resulting in a 17.5% mark to market, with the strongest performance being in New Jersey and Stamford. Westchester was pretty flat.", "And as we project forward for the balance of the year, we think our Greenwich property and the Stamford properties will continue to experience mark to market gains and, at least, maintain its already high level of occupancy, possibly even move forward, which is a real achievement given the difficulties of doing business in the suburban markets.", "Regarding our investments, Andrew will fill you in on the state of the capital markets and its impact on sales and pricing and velocity. I would say in advance that I'm very pleased with our investment strategy over the years, and particularly since our agreement to acquire Reckson in 2006.", "I believe we maneuvered through the investment traps and often took advantage of good buying opportunities, which were frequently enhanced with private JV equity, while avoiding the top of market mistakes, and selling aggressively into a declining market, while sheltering gains tax efficiently and paying down debt to increase our investment capacity and liquidity.", "That capacity, which stands today at over $800 million, continues to be deployed in ways that we set forth in December, notably buying back our stock, which we believe continues to be among the most attractive buying opportunities in the market right now, redevelopment projects like 1515 Broadway and 521 Fifth Avenue, structured finance and structured equity opportunities, which become more opportunistic as the market softens, we're starting to see that, and the occasional one-off deal like 388, 390 Greenwich in December, which has turned out to be a very, very attractive and good platform investment for the company, with increases coming annually through the term of that deal, and as structured with our partner SITQ turned out to be an excellent deal.", "So, all in all, we think it was a very solid quarter. We continue to maintain our defensive posture that we've been espousing since last summer. We are pleased and surprised at the level with which the leasing has held up, and we hope to continue to enjoy that, that growth and momentum, as far as we can into '08. And as things are stacking up right now for the second quarter on the leasing front, we still believe we are in a very good position, again, all of that driving us towards the decision of increase in the guidance.", "So with that, I'd like to turn it over to Andrew who'll talk to you a little bit more about the state of the sales in investment market.", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "Thank you, Marc. The transaction volume have been slowed significantly this quarter as a standoff developed between buyers and sellers and a lack of financing continued to make getting deals done difficult. Exacerbating the standoff now is the overhang of the entire Macklowe portfolio being in play, including the entire ELP portfolio, which has now been deeded back to the lenders and GM and the balance of the Macklowe organization assets.", "There are several assets being offered for sale generally being quietly marketed, but there has been little contracted volume. Notable exceptions were our sale of 1250 Broadway, which we announced in March, and the sale of 650 Madison Avenue by Hiro, which demonstrated the continued willingness of buyers to still pay sub 5% going in cap rates for quality assets that still have a strong mark to market story.", "In each of those cases, buyers invested significant equity checks and there were several lenders bidding on the senior financing, as with strong sponsorship and fresh equity the appetite for financing prime Manhattan buildings is still fairly strong albeit considerably more expensive than before the credit crunch.", "We will look for the Macklowe situation to resolve itself over the next several months as it appears Deutsche Bank will be providing seller financing on the majority of the ELP assets and the balance of the Macklowe restructuring seems to be running its course.", "We've been cautious in approaching this market, as Marc said, sticking to our investment philosophy we have elaborated to you at Investor Day namely that at this point in the cycle structured finance and credit lease-type investments are where we want to focus. To this end, we expect to start to take advantage of some new opportunities on the structured finance front and have completely rescrubbed our existing portfolio in light of current market condition.", "We remain very pleased with our underwriting and the credit performance of our portfolio, approximately 30 assets and $800 million of outstanding principal balance strong, with the exception of two small assets, which we discussed on the last conference call which we acquired as part of the Reckson acquisition and which we expected to be problematic when we purchased that portfolio.", "We may choose to exit a couple of other positions where we don't think the risk-reward ratio is in balance in this market. But on the whole, the portfolio is performing quite nicely. We intentionally avoided any Macklowe paper having seen first hand their \"underwriting\" when the Macklowe led team jumped blindly into the Reckson fray.", "We believe we're starting to see hints of market dislocation, which should give rise to opportunistic structure opportunities in the balance of the year, and with our aggressive sales program, we've positioned our balance sheet to take advantage of these situations.", "For more on our balance sheet and earnings, here is Greg Hughes.", "Gregory F. Hughes - Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Principal Accounting Officer", "Great. Thanks very much, Andrew. For those of you that felt that the investment activity and capital raising efforts during 2007 made our financial information too difficult to follow or too difficult to model, the first quarter of 2008 provides a very transparent view of the company, now that the dust has settled, and I'm pleased to report that the results are very compelling.", "Our balance sheet for the quarter reflects only modest changes from where it stood at yearend. Our net real estate assets increased just $37 million, principally as a result of our acquisition of 182 Broadway, a joint venture with Jeff Sutton, which is consolidated on our books.", "Our restricted cash was up approximately $50 million, reflecting the escrowed moneys for the loan participation that Green made to Gramercy to help fund the AFR transaction, which closed on April 1.", "Treasury stock was up by approximately $50 million, reflecting our continued buyback program, repurchases during the quarter averaging $83.89 per share. Capitalized interest continued to decline with just $840,000 worth of interest being capitalized for the quarter and assets held for sale declined with the successful closing of 449th Avenue.", "We continue to remain very liquid with $742 million of full availability under our credit facility at quarter end, which will increase by an additional $160 million with the closing of 1250 Broadway scheduled for the second quarter. This will leave us with $858 million of available liquidity in addition to the substantial cash flow generated from our portfolio as the current quarter's FFO payout ratio was just 55%.", "In addition to our strong liquidity position, we have limited near-term maturates and our coverage ratios have improved significantly during the quarter as a result of our strong operating performance, coupled with declines in LIBOR during the quarter.", "Turning to the P&L, it was a very strong quarter for operating activity with earnings exceeding guidance and increasing over 16% from the fourth quarter of 2007. As we mentioned during Investor Day, we were confident that the strong leasing for 2007 coupled with the significant acquisition activity would generate very meaningful core portfolio growth. We're seeing that on clear display here during the first quarter of 2008 as core results have exceeded our original expectations.", "The full impact of the leasing activity for 2007, which included an average mark to market for the year of 44.6%, is now making its way to our bottomline. This is the reason you are seeing some of the strongest NOI growth, we have ever posted, which seems that our NOI gain is coming in well in excess of our December estimates. The strong leasing activity for this quarter, which included a 43.9% mark to market, coupled with a 40.2% mark to market remaining in the overall portfolio, bode well for future earnings as well.", "As forecasted in December, this quarter's results benefit from a significant NOI increases at 1185, 485, 1350, 919 Third, 717 Fifth, and 810 Seventh, all of which helped generate record operating margins for the company of 60.6%. It is important to note that these results were achieved notwithstanding two of our largest buildings having significant vacancy with 100 Parks quarter end occupancy of 69% and 1185 finishing the quarter at just 90% occupancy.", "We expect to make significant progress on these building over the balance of 2008, which should be evident from this morning's announcement of News Corp lease at 1185 Sixth Avenue. These results were also achieved with modest change concessions at TI packages averaged just $11.45 per square foot for the quarter and free rent was less than a month. These compared very favorably to 2007 where TI packages averaged $16.90 and free rent averaged 1.9 months. On to Manhattan, leases were signed during that period.", "Our net effective rents for the first quarter of 2008 actually exceeded the net effective rents on the leases signed during 2007. Our suburban portfolio did see an increase in concessions with TIs growing to 24 hours and $0.23 on average and free rent growing to 4.9 months. However, this was more of a function of two long-term leases that were signed during the quarter, a 10-year deal at 680 Washington and a 16-year deal at the Meadows. These long-term deals compare to an average lease term of approximately 5.2 years for the suburban leases signed during 2007.", "SLG's share of FFO from Gramercy was up 8% for the first quarter compared to the first quarter of last year and down slightly from the fourth quarter of last year as the company hoarded liquidity in anticipation of closing the AFR transaction. Our FFO results do not include the special dividend we received from GKK, which went towards reducing our investment basis in GKK.", "With a book balance of just $159 million, the fees and regular dividends we received from GKK provided cash on cash return in excess of 30% on SLG's investment on an annual basis. Our structured finance portfolio remained relatively consistent generating $21.3 million of FFO. This number is net of a $1.25 million reserve that we recorded in connection with a position that we may seek to sell in order to deploy that capital and to better risk adjusted investments.", "Other income for the quarter totaled $18.4 million consisting of $9.7 million of fees from Gramercy, $1.7 million of leased buyout income and the balance from asset management fees, leasing and construction related fees. G&A was $27.9 million for the quarter, slightly above the quarterly average for 2007. Approximately $1 million of this increase is related to GKK, and our first quarter has historically tended to be higher than the remaining three quarters.", "Combined interest for the quarter was up over the last quarter, reflecting the quarterly impact of interest costs associated with the 388 acquisition, which closed in December of 2007. Our combined weighted average interest rate is a very favorable 5.25%, down from an average of 5.74% during 2007, which reflects the benefits of numerous refinancings achieved in 2007, as well as the overall decline of LIBOR. Our line of credit currently bears interest at LIBOR plus 90 basis points or approximately 3.8%, giving us one of the most efficient sources of capital with which to pursue investments.", "Finally, while we prefer not to revise earnings estimates from quarter-to-quarter, especially this early in the year, we felt it was appropriate to increase guidance now as a result of our strong core portfolio performance, good visibility as to the source of the current year incentive fee, with the pending sale of 1250 Broadway, and good prospects for additional accretive structure finance investments.", "And with that, I'd like to turn it back to Marc for some closing thoughts.", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "Well, why don't we just go right to the questions, because I see by the queue there are several or many. So to try and get through it as quickly as possible, we'll go right to it. Operator?", "QUESTION AND ANSWER", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "And your first question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. You may proceed.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Thank you. Good afternoon. I guess this first one probably for Andrew. Regarding the 650 Madison transaction, did you say the cap rate was about 5% and maybe if you could just give us some context in terms of where you think that transaction was relative to where it would have been, maybe at the height of things?", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "Both of the deals fields I mentioned were soft 5%. 650 Madison actually was very low 4% or on 4.1% going in. That transaction maybe was off 10% in terms of value from the peak. It was still a very aggressive price, and obviously, very aggressive cap rate in the very low floors. There was some immediately available vacant space. There were a couple of floors of vacancy. And it did have a retail component, which was very attractive to the buyers, but that was purchased by Carlisle, big opportunity fund there. They think that they will be able to redo, mark some of the leases to market in relatively short orders, three to five-year holding period, bring the rent roll up enough to make the kind of returns that Carlisle looks for.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay. It's helpful. And then just moving over toward the Macklowe portfolio or the ELP portfolio, you mentioned Deutsche potentially providing seller financing. If Deutsche is providing seller financing, I am not sure what the terms are, if it's I/O or what the term is or rate. But with the pricing on those assets, would you expect to be representative of market in the financing market and then with the pricing B market?", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "I think pricing will likely be market. I think the scale would be difficult to place in today's market. In other words, to come up with whatever aligned to being $3.5 billion to $4 billion of financing for the entire ELP portfolio in the aggregate would be very difficult to source, and you probably have to go to many different lenders. I don't think there is another single lender out there today that would provide that amount of fresh financing. But the terms that they've been talking about are pretty much market terms. They haven't formalized anything on any of the offerings. To-date, they've just softly indicated what they consider.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Is interest-only money available?", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "Yes. 10-year interest-only money, difficult to impossible, five-year floating rate interest-only money definitely available.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay, thanks. I'll get back in the queue.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Mitch Germain of Banc of America. You may proceed.", "Mitchell Germain - Banc of America", "Good afternoon. Andrew, its seems like foreign investor's appetite for office products appears to be kicking up, but it doesn't seem to be the level that was originally anticipated. Are they still kind of thinking that the assets are someone overvalued?", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "Tough to speculate. I think the trade that were done, I mean our trade 1250 is actually going to wind up being purchased by a US operator with actually a German partner on the equity side. So that's a quasi foreign investment. The Carlisle trade was a pure domestic trade on 650 Madison.", "There are still a wide variety of people looking at every building that's for sale; pension funds, foreigners, opportunity funds and still private individuals. We had never really espoused the philosophy of this tidal wave of foreign demand, which was going to sop up buildings sort of indiscriminately. I think they look, and I think if a building meets their particular risk return parameters, they'll bid aggressively as they always do. I'm not sure the cheap dollars necessarily, the category killer, the \"be all, end all\" in terms of the investment sales market.", "Mitchell Germain - Banc of America", "Great, thanks.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman. You may proceed.", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "Michael, are you there\u2026 Mike Bilerman. Operator, why don't you go to the next question?", "Operator", "And the next question from the line of Ian Wiseman of Merrill Lynch. You may proceed.", "Ian Wiseman - Merrill Lynch", "Yes. Good afternoon. Not to beat a dead horse on this Macklowe issue, but it seems like there is a lot of product being forced on to the market obviously by Macklowe. I mean, what are the implications for pricing in your opinion? I mean, is there enough capital to soak up all that demand, or at least all that product rather?", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "I think depending on the pricing level, there is absolutely easily enough capital, Ian. And I think that as, I mentioned, the Deutsche seller financing will certainly help. It depends on where the pricing level shakes on. I mean, these assets were bought at a value that's turned out to be dramatically over their market value. So, looking at the bases versus the value, it's going to be a precipitous drop, but I think there is still healthy demand for these assets and there is a lot of people looking at them.", "Ian Wiseman - Merrill Lynch", "Do you care to throw out a number there where you think the price per pound will come out on these deals?", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "Depending on the asset, we'd except it to average between $800 and $1000 a foot.", "Ian Wiseman - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And second question, Marc, you just touched on briefly on the redevelopment afford of 1515, you want to maybe expand a little bit more on what Viacom's plans are and what your idea is of a redevelopment of that property?", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "We've got a pretty aggressive redevelopment plan for the property. It has not been redeveloped almost since its initial construction back in the '70s. So, this is a pretty full fa\u00e7ade, lobbies infrastructure completely changed out and a sprucing up of non-tenanted spaces, the non-Viacom tenanted spaces.", "The thought behind it is simply it's the appropriate time to do it in order to capture rents in the Time Square area that are dramatically higher than our average employee's escalated rent is currently. And we would likely expect that the taker of that space will be Viacom. That's our expectation, just given the timing of when the lease exploration is and given the size of their presence in the building, but there is no formal commitment on their part yet to do so. And we've structured the redevelopment and programmed it in a way that it's got utility to Viacom or a replacement tenant.", "So, the bulk of their lease does not expire until sometime in 2010, and there is lots of early notice provisions and we feel that with a 50ish, 51ish escalated in place rent, it's continued to be a win-win situation and it's just enhanced by the development. So we'll be able to get higher rents as a result either on a renewal in the market or in arbitration.", "Ian Wiseman - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thank you for that update.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman of Citi. You May Proceed.", "Irwin Guzman - Citi", "Hi, it's Irwin Guzman. Sorry for that before. I noticed you did a lot more early renewal this quarter than you've been averaging over the last year. How much more aggressively are you being in terms of approaching tenants that expire over the next couple of years to try to shore up your lease role?", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "I don't think we've really changed our approach. I'd have to look back at the statistics. I mean, a 0.5 million feet per quarter, I guess sometimes it's as low as 3, and change, it's been as high as 5, 6. If it's ahead, it's ahead by a couple, and I think if anything you will see in a market like this tenants who may have wanted to move around a bit more may think twice about incurring the disruption and the moving cost in this kind of market. We've seen some tenants who initially wanted to look at other spaces in our portfolio, as well as outside the portfolio, have then made a decision to stay put.", "So, I think it's too early to say there is a direct relationship there. We'll have to look and see. But clearly, we did have several tenants, several big renewals and early renewals. But the approach that we take is pretty consistent. We're out in front of these tenants 12, 18, 24 months ahead of a renewal aggressively trying to either relocate them within the portfolio where we up them. And we have the advantage of the time remaining on the lease that one to two-year period is kind of a magic period where it's too early for them to go to another building. So there is that value to play with as part of a renewal.", "So Steve, I don't know if you want\u2026 Steve Durels is here\u2026 want to add anything to that?", "Steven M. Durels - Executive Vice President and Director of Leasing", "No, I think that's on point. The only other worthy comment is such that as time gets closer to what is a large role in the overall markets true of our portfolio and a lot of other owners, 2010 in particular, 2011 everybody is focused. We've been focused for the past several years trying to lock down as many of those tenants as early as possible. And I think time will work in our side and you'll see more renewals come through the door because we're getting closer to the expiration date of those leases.", "Irwin Guzman - Citi", "And how much of your current vacancy is already leased, but hasn't been occupied yet?", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "Current vacancy that's leased but not occupied, Matt, would you have a stab at that?", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "It's probably less than 1%.", "Matthew Leonardi - Property Assistant", "Yes.", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "But we'll come back to you with that.", "Matthew Leonardi - Property Assistant", "There is a good amount of square footage that's been pre-leased, but would still be occupied by another tenant. So whether that's an early renewal or a replacement deal starting at the expiration of the lease in place, the perfect example of that is the lease we signed at 333 West 34 Street with Segal Company that was a 160,000 square foot, lease starts in 2009, Citibank's in place until the new Segal lease commences. So, there are plenty of examples like that.", "Irwin Guzman - Citi", "Okay. Just one last question, you mentioned the 10% to 15% dip in rents over the next 12 months. Sort of the implied impact to your mark to market is that it would go from 40% to 20% to 25%, is that--?", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it's really 10 to 15 of net effectives. So I don't know if you're going to see that in nominal rents. But everything we look at, we look at it on a net effective basis. So, if you've giving up free rent or you're adding another $10 of TI concession, we look at it, it's all dollars, it's all fungible.", "Irwin Guzman - Citi", "Are you seeing more of that come in already because it looked like in the first quarter your concessions and everything were actually lower than last year?", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "No, as I tried to layout, the first quarter I think was a very strong quarter. I'm really just projecting forward what I think the impact will be from 2 million, 2.5 million square feet of financial service from sublet space is that creeps into the market, that's an extra point of vacancy, not enough to knock it out of the landlord favorable side of the line of the intersection. About 9% we think is equilibrium. So right now about 6%, so if 6 goes to 7, you'll see a slight softening, but still you would consider it a very, very good market.", "I think you just have to watch layoffs and sublets. And what I've said in the past, if you see that number get to 6 million, 8 million square feet that's where you'd start to see a real impact in rents. But, if it stays in kind of the 2.5 million, 3 million square feet level\u2026 that's downtown to midtown by the way, that's combined\u2026 that we don't think is going to have a material decline in our mark to market.", "Irwin Guzman - Citi", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Anthony Paolone of JP Morgan. You may proceed.", "Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan", "Thank you. Do you have a sense as to how much sublease space is up in your portfolio at the moment, and to the extent your tenants do put some of their space into the sublease market, would you all participate in any higher rents that they get?", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "There is not a lot of sublease space in out portfolio on the market. There is couple of pockets of 5,000 or 10,000 or 15,000 foot pockets, nothing really big. And absolutely, we participate in a variety of different ways, not only whether it's as simple as a profit share with the sublease that comes through out door, but more frequently than not you're seeing us convert those deals over to direct deals, and the building that's really paid off in space for us over the last couple of months and keeps paying off with deals that we're working on today is 461 Fifth Avenue.", "Its perfect example where we've taken tenants who have wanted to either downsize, that no longer had a use for the space, wanted to outgrow the space for a variety of different reasons, came through a door. They were paying us $50, $55 dollar a foot. We've converted each and every one of those deals over to new direct deals generally in the $90 plus price points. So, you're seeing massive mark to market opportunities and we're capitalizing on a lot of them.", "Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan", "Okay. And I have a question on GKK fee income for Greg. I think in your Investor Day\u2026 so I get $20 million for 2008 of other fee income outside of the base management fee. And it seem like, I think it was $4.2 million in the first quarter, and it would seem like that would ramp up given the AFR deal, just wondering if that $20 million is still valid or does that go up in your guidance or what?", "Gregory F. Hughes - Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Principal Accounting Officer", "I think we had talked about promotes of $15 million to $20 million. And so the 1250 transaction with the incentive fee that we would get there would kind of cover that for the year.", "Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan", "I think this is just on the GKK slide, I think it was $20 million for just the GKK stuff.", "Gregory F. Hughes - Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Principal Accounting Officer", "$20 million being the\u2026", "Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan", "The other fee income outside off the base management.", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. That was outsourced in servicing as well.", "Gregory F. Hughes - Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Principal Accounting Officer", "That's still a good number.", "Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of David Toti of Lehman Brothers. You may proceed.", "David Toti - Lehman Brothers", "Good afternoon, everyone. A quick question. Can you just provide some color and some numbers around your total budgeted capital expenditures for '08 and '09 relative to repositioning and redevelopment projects?", "Gregory F. Hughes - Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Principal Accounting Officer", "I think the right way to think about it is we'll probably spend $60 million to $75 million of capital away from, what I'll call, separate projects being the completion of a 100 Park, the completion or the redevelopment of 1551, and the redevelopment of 1515. So, $60 million to $75 million away from those three projects. Those three projects, that means 1551 is kind of a $160 million development, but you're going to see a fraction of that this year.", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "We're 70% of that JV as well.", "Gregory F. Hughes - Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Principal Accounting Officer", "A, it's a JV, and B, you're not going to see all of that this year. 100 Park probably has around $10 million to $15 million left for the overall completion of that deal that we had originally talked about. And 1551, we'd want to come back to you with that number because we're finalizing exactly the structure that's being built there based upon the signage that's actually going in place. And again, that's a joint venture, so it'll be a piece of that.", "David Toti - Lehman Brothers", "Great, thank you. And then, my second question and I might have missed this, did you provide any color on the tenant concession packages in the suburban portfolio? They were sort of aberrationally high this quarter?", "Gregory F. Hughes - Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Principal Accounting Officer", "Yes, I think I had mention there were two deals. So, the average suburban deals in 2007 were five years roughly in duration. We had two big deals, one 16-year deal in one of the New Jersey properties and a 10-year deal in one of the Stamford properties. And so, those two deals garner excess TI packages because of the duration. If you took those out, it would be comparable to kind of what you saw last year.", "David Toti - Lehman Brothers", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Chris Haley of Wachovia. You may proceed.", "Chris Haley - Wachovia", "Good afternoon.", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Chris.", "Chris Haley - Wachovia", "Mark, Andrew, and Greg, maybe you could help me out as an outsider. Understand kind of that time allocation and considerations about how much human capital is being spent with regard to Gramercy and the closing of AFR relative to SL Green parent, I wanted to call it that, just give us some color as to whether or not this is\u2026 whether the last couple of months have been tolling, and given the management change at Gramercy and the closing of the AFR transaction, congratulations. What can we expect over the next three to six months?", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. We will talk about our prospects.", "Chris Haley - Wachovia", "Sure.", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "Our pat answer on this is generally from like 7 in the morning till around 7 in the evening, its Green, and then 7 in the evening till 7 in morning, its Gramercy, and then we switch off and reverse it. So, it was an avalanche of work in the first quarter to produce the results at Green and Gramercy, and I think in large part that was because of the AFR closing.", "So that's behind us, which is good, and we're kind of getting back to business as usual within Gramercy now that the sheer effort of getting that deal closed in behind us and we used that as the opportunity to bring in a lot of full-time dedicated staffers into Gramercy. Some we brought along from AFR, some we hired from the outside, notably a new Chief Financial Officer named John Roche who joined us last week, which enabled Bob Foley to move over to COO. And we've complimented those folks with two dedicated General Counsels, one for Gramercy Realty, one for Gramercy Finance. We are hiring a Head of Investments on the realty side. We have hired a Head of Real Estate on the leasing and operations side.", "On the desk side, guys like Sean Townsend, Mike Kavourias and Joe Romano are full-time and really carrying a lot of weight on the asset management new origination side. Andrew Falk is full-time along with Bob Wirth on the servicing side. And I'm positive I'm leaving out a few more folks who are full-time dedicated when you compare that to what we've had over the past several years, it dwarfs the amount of resources that we've had in the past. So there was a lot of senior management heavy lifting on the part of myself, Andrew, Greg, Andy Levine, Dave Schonbraun in getting the deal closed.", "But I'm happy to say it did close. It was a Herculean feat in this market. With the additional staffing, new procedures in place, bigger platform, Gramercy is very energized, and I think over the next six to nine months it's going to act a lot more autonomously and independently than it has just given that Gramercy no longer has 25 employees, now has 125 employees, and there's lots of people to do work on the IR side. Laura Godfrey was just promoted to head up an Investor Relations position over at Gramercy on a full time basis. And now we have HR, technology and a finance function. So it's pretty complete right now.", "Chris Haley - Wachovia", "Okay. Thank you for that. Is there any change or do you expect any change between the delineation of investments probably that GKK will target versus SL Green will target on their structured portfolio?", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I mean Gramercy's origination efforts right now are really\u2026 whatever optimizes the existing CDOs that it has and its $3.1 billion of CDOs, keeping those full is a prime objective of Gramercy. And we've been doing that with a lot of first mortgage business and a lot of high grade AAA supported AAA CMBS business. So there is not a lot of overlap there with Green's very Manhattan-centric mezzanine/pref equity/convertible equity orientation. Where the deals warrant it, we'll share in those types of deals. But I would say at this point there is not in the pipeline nor in the first quarter, where there was a lot of overlap. I don't think there were any co-originations in the first quarter, were there?", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "No.", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "No. So there were none in the first quarter and I don't think there is any in the pipe right now. So, there is always the opportunity in the future, and where we've done it, it's worked out. It's been a win-win for both companies. But at this point, there seems to be just two different investment objectives.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Michael Knott. You may proceed.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors", "Hi, guys. I'm wondering if you can just step back and give us some color on the sales processes that you undertook on the three assets over the past several months and where that leaves you in terms of what you may look to sell going forward, just any comments you can share as you went through those processes?", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "You are refereeing the 1250 Broadway 449 and 470 Park South in terms of three assets or--?", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors", "Right.", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "We're always creative in our sales efforts, and we're generally\u2026 for assets that are out there, often times we're trying to work preempts. We're a lot of time trying to put together different capital providers, different debt providers into these situations we sell. And then, we generally retain the services of professional\u2026 one of the major brokerage arms on each sale that we do.", "So I don't think we see changing that process going forward. I mean, obviously, the more help we can get, the more interested debt guys we can bring to the table, and the more pairing off of operating capital partners we can do, we think it leads to a better execution for us. And we have a history of doing that going back to our ground lease transactions, occasionally some mezz we've given on assets we sell its\u2026 we're generally doing our best to try to get the most efficient execution.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors", "And as you went through those three that you see fewer buyers towards the end on the third sale, did you see buyers having a tougher time getting financing, say, for the 1250 Broadway, how do you finance a 4.5 cap in today's debt market?", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "You borrow a lot less is the short answer. They are borrowing about 60% loan to value on their first mortgage. And at that level they had lots of willing lenders, so that they were able to put together type of capital structure with a low leverage first mortgage, some mezzanine financing and the equity is a JV, as I said, a German fund and a local operator.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors", "And so, are there any assets or any suburban portfolio assets that you're going to look to sell over the balance of '08 or is that kind of put on the shelf for now?", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "I would say likely no suburban assets as we're really focused on active asset management out there. And in the city where we're always evaluating new assets to put on the market and evaluating our tax decisions, so I definitely wouldn't rule out additional asset sales in that.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors", "Then I have a last quick question for Greg. Greg, when you guys reported the fourth quarter supplemental, the cash balance then declined significantly when you filed the 10-K. Was that an unusual circumstance, have the cash balance changed that dramatically from the supplemental to the SEC filing?", "Gregory F. Hughes - Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Principal Accounting Officer", "I think if you looked at it, Michael, it was just a kind of a reclassification within the balance sheet. So the total assets liabilities were not being changed and you just had a top side reclassification between the two. But I would describe it as\u2026 it doesn't usually happen. It was part of closing at the final purchase price allocation with respect to the Reckson transaction.", "Recall that the fourth quarter of 2007 was the first time that we actually booked the initial piece of the 140 adjustment. So you're just seeing a couple of last minute re-classes there in between filing. But I would say, pretty unusual and just Reckson-specific in that instance.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors", "Thank you", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "Operator, before you go on, just in response to Chris Haley's question earlier, on pipeline opportunity between Green and Gramercy, I was reminded there is one mezzanine opportunity not yet act or committed. But in the pipeline that's pretty sizeable New York mezzanine opportunity that could be or could not be a joint opportunity. So there is a potential for one, too premature at this point to go into any detail about it.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Kristin Brown of Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.", "Kristin Brown - Deutsche Bank", "Hi. Good afternoon, guys. I just wanted to ask on the guidance increase. Could you clarify how much was due to sort of better core performance, how much was due to the incentive fee, and if 1250 was included in your previous guidance at all?", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "Yes. I would say it is principally core performance. On the incentive fee, I think, as we talked about in December, we're never sure exactly where it's going to come from, when it's going to show up. Now that we have 1250 on contract and I think you might have seen in our press release, we said we were going to record we think at least a $15 million incentive fee from 1250 that we have perfect color into what it's going to look like for this year. So, with the benefit of that and really the strong core performance, that's what kind of drove it.", "Kristin Brown - Deutsche Bank", "And was the entire $15 million included in previous guidance?", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "$15 million was in previous guidance. I mentioned before, we had talked about $15 million to $20 million roughly in our December Investor Conference.", "Kristin Brown - Deutsche Bank", "Then I just wanted to ask about\u2026 in terms of your time base, are you having more conversations with tenants looking to terminate their leases?", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "No, I mean we've had a number of tenants who have come to us and wanted to downsize some excess space. But nobody is of any real notice just come to us and said that I want to terminate because I'm having a difficult time of my business. And as I said earlier, we've converted many of those sublease opportunities over to direct new deals at higher rents.", "But we are certainly on the outlook for any trouble on horizon. There is no denying that as the economy softens, we got to be vigilant about making certain\u2026 we're ahead of the game as far as identifying any tenants that may get into trouble, knock on the door and wanting to terminate their lease, and we spend a lot of time and effort to stay on top of that.", "Kristin Brown - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of John Guinee of Stifel Nicolaus. You may proceed.", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, John.", "John Guinee - Stifel Nicolaus", "Did the Pope stop by to see you guys or blessed any of your buildings?", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "Every one of them.", "John Guinee - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Just a real quick one. When you are looking at 40%, 45% mark to market on a gross basis, have you ever done a back of the envelope to see what that is on a net basis?", "Gregory F. Hughes - Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Principal Accounting Officer", "Net meaning net effective or--?", "John Guinee - Stifel Nicolaus", "Yes, net rents and net effective. For example, if you have $21, $22 expense stop, does the math work out that the net rent increase is really more like 70%, 80%.", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "Well, you're measuring off of a wholly estimated rent.", "Gregory F. Hughes - Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Principal Accounting Officer", "Right. So if we have a $20 to $30 base rent, that's $35 escalated, and we rent that for $38.50, that's a 10% mark. So we measure it off of escalated. So that number is the number that we think is embedded.", "John Guinee - Stifel Nicolaus", "But is it on a net rent basis, more or like a $22 net rent jumping to a $40 net rent.", "Gregory F. Hughes - Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Principal Accounting Officer", "Yes, right. Yes, the answer is yes. If you just look at it net to net, it's going to be\u2026 in that same example of a $35 escalated rent is\u2026 call it $15 net, so you've got $20 of expenses, versus it goes to $38.50, then you are down to $18.50. So $18.50 on $15 is a higher percentage of, I think it probably is, it has to be. It's $3.5 on a smaller number. So, it is. Okay, so the answer is yes. On a net basis, it's a larger percentage increase, not absolute increase, but it's a larger percentage increase if you look at it net to net, yes.", "John Guinee - Stifel Nicolaus", "Got you. That's it. Thanks.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Sloan Bolen [ph] of Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.", "Sloan Bolen - Goldman Sachs", "Just real quick one for Greg. Have you guys repurchased any shares subsequent to the quarter, and when, if at all, would you look to expand your share repurchase program?", "Gregory F. Hughes - Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Principal Accounting Officer", "Yes, the answer is we have purchased some at the quarter end. My counsel is waving to me saying we can't really comment on what we will do. But I think as we've talked about before, we had a $300 million plan in place and we continue to think the stock is a good investment opportunity. So, shouldn't be surprise to see us fill out the balance of that plan.", "Sloan Bolen - Goldman Sachs", "All right. Thank you, guys.", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "Is that it, operator?", "Operator", "And your last question comes from line of James Feldman of UBS. You may proceed.", "James Feldman - UBS", "That was a quite a wait. The NOI margins\u2026", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "Hang in there.", "James Feldman - UBS", "Exactly. The NOI margins seem pretty high in the quarter, is that the fact that 388 is more of a net lease or is that just seasonality or what?", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "I think it's a combination of a number of things. The portfolio was really transformed last year when you look at what we sold and what we bought. We're generally starting out with much more profitable buildings. The bigger buildings are operating more profitably. If you look at the expenses both first versus first and first versus fourth, there's actually a pretty favorable trend. We've historically seen the first quarter and the third quarter to be higher. We're seeing the first quarter of this year be lower than the fourth quarter.", "So, I would say very, very strong revenue mark to markets coming through with good expense control, and then just a higher quality, higher margin building composition portfolio.", "James Feldman - UBS", "I think last quarter you said 6% same store growth for the year, looking at your guidance you had 12% in the first quarter, and where do you think it can go?", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "I think if you look back at our December presentation we said 7% NOI growth for the year. So, 12% in the first quarter, as I said, is ahead of where we expected to be\u2026..", "James Feldman - UBS", "Okay. But I'm saying for the remainder of the year you think it trails down?", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "I'm not sure we would say we're going to maintain 12%. But we certainly feel better than the 7% for the year that we advertised in December.", "James Feldman - UBS", "Okay. And then, finally, and then I'll talk to your guys offline, what do you think in terms of appetite for buildings like 388, those kind of deals right now?", "Andrew W. Mathias - President and Chief Investment Officer", "We've haven't really seen a comparable offering. Most of the buildings that are traded have been more mark\u2026 lower cap rate, mark to market stories. But, certainly I would tell you from where I sit, I mean I think a 6.3% going in with contractual annual increases and 10-year financing in place trades at a premium to what we paid for it. So, I think that's a great asset for us right now.", "James Feldman - UBS", "Okay, fine thank you.", "Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Thank you everyone for joining in today. For those of you that have remained on till the end, we appreciate it. Questions were good and we look forward to speaking to you again in three months time. Bye-bye.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation.

(Operator Instructions).  Thank you everybody for joining us and welcome to SL Green Realty Corp's third quarter 2008 earnings results conference call.  This conference call is being recorded.  ", "At this time, the company would like to remind the listeners that during the call management may make forward-looking statements.  Actual results may differ from predictions that management may make today.  Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the company's Form 10-Q and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  ", "Also during today's conference call, the company may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G.  The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure discussed and the reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found on the company's website at www.slgreen.com by selecting the press release regarding the company's third quarter earnings.  ", "Before turning the call over to Marc Holliday, Chief Executive Officer of SL Green Realty Corp, we would like to ask that those of you participating in the Q&A portion of the call to please limit your questions to two per person.  Thank you and please go ahead Mr. Holliday.  ", "Marc Holliday", "Thank you, good afternoon and thank you for joining us today.  I think we should just get right into it as events of the past three months since our last call has raised a number of questions and concerns from shareholders and analysts.  ", "The basic theme seems to be questions regarding Gramercy, our structured finance portfolio, core New York City office metrics, and our balance sheet.  We are keenly aware of investor uncertainty relating to these core items and I believe we will be able to clarify much of it on this call and leave plenty of time for questions.  ", "Effective yesterday evening, I resigned my position of CEO and President of Gramercy Capital Corp.  I have done so in the belief that Roger Cozzi, Gramercy's new CEO, will be able to lead the company forward and tackle the significant challenges that the finance industry faces in the current economic climate.  ", "Roger has many years of experience in the finance business and is considered to be an expert in the area of structure debt and equity investments.  In addition to his successful track record, Roger brings significant energy and a fresh outlook to a company that is operating in a very difficult credit environment.  ", "Also announced this morning were the resignations of Andrew Mathias and Greg Hughes from their roles as Executive Officers of Gramercy.  One or more of these positions are likely to be filled by new hires that I expect Roger will undertake in the future.  ", "To further underscore Gramercy's efforts to reposition itself, SL Green has agreed to reduce or eliminate a number of fees which will improve Gramercy's operating performance and cash flow by approximately $20 million per annum.  A significant reduction in the non-renewal fee also paves the way for a complete internalization of the manager and all of its employees in the future.  ", "Greg, why don't you give some more color on the earnings impact that these modifications to SL Green third and for the future quarters?", "Gregory F. Hughes", "I think as we've talked about previously our earnings contribution from Gramercy really comes from two sources.  One is the net management fee income and reimbursements that we receive pursuant to our management agreements, and the second is from our pro rata share of their FFO resulting from our 15.8% interest that we own in that company.  ", "The net management income in reimbursements from GKK are summarized on page 20 of our supplemental and they had been running around $4 to $5 million per quarter.   These amounts will be substantially reduced with the elimination of the outsource fee, the collateral manager fee, and the reduction of the base management fee to 1.5%.  You will note for the third quarter that the decline is already occurring since the contribution is only around $2.3 million resulting from the CDO collateral manager fees and the incentive fees being waived for the third quarter.  ", "For the quarter we estimate that our pro rata share of GKK's FFO will be approximately $4.9 million.  We expect GKK to finalize its earnings in the next couple of days.   Prospective contributions from SLG's stock investment in GKK will depend on future operating results of GKK.  However, it is worth noting that GKK's total contribution to SLG for the quarter was approximately $0.12 per share or just 8% of our quarterly FFO of $1.45 which we reported today.  ", "At 9:30 our stock investment in GKK has a book carrying value of approximately $142 million.  While Gramercy's book value is currently in excess of the carrying value of our investment, if GKK stock continues to trade at levels significantly below our carrying value, we will likely be required under GAAP to reduce the carrying value of this investment in future periods.  ", "Marc Holliday", "SL Green made these concessions in an attempt to help Gramercy succeed in stabilizing its financial condition in the near term while poising it for future growth when the credit markets unthaw.  ", "In the short-term, SL Green will be foregoing significant fees, however, we believe that these steps being undertaken to benefit Gramercy will result in long-term value for Green's holdings in the company.  ", "While Green has provided additional support to the company in the form of overhead reduction, there is no intention of SL Green acquiring additional stock or making loans to the company.  The only possibility under consideration right now would be a selective asset purchase or purchases of positions that are already co-owned by SL Green, but even if this were to occur the approximate amount under consideration would not exceed about $75 million.  ", "Today's announcements should dispel any false rumors that SL Green may acquire or that there are any crossover financial obligations or commitments of Green to Gramercy of which there are none.  ", "In addition to our investment in Gramercy, we have received a number of questions regarding Green's structured finance portfolio.  While most financial assets have decreased in value, SL Green's portfolio is unique in one very important respect and that is that almost 70% of our total structured investment portfolio is secured by interests in Manhattan properties.  ", "I believe that the Manhattan centric composition of Green's structured finance program will prove to be a benefit, not a detriment as being viewed by some.  The fact is New York is relatively more liquid than other U.S. office EBDs due to the presence of international capital, albeit temporarily sidelined, and a deep and diverse tenant base not withstanding the retrenchment within the financial services industry.  ", "A number of these investments have substantial sponsor cash equity that was invested at the time of origination and in some cases subordinate financing that acts as a cushion to buffer declining values of properties securing Green's portfolio.  It is noteworthy that of our 17 debt positions secured by interests in Manhattan office properties totaling $519 million, all are performing.  Except in one instance and we have an average last dollar exposure in this subset of $500 per square foot, a level we are generally comfortable with.  ", "While this doesn't mean we are immune from losses in this segment of the portfolio if credit remains frozen for an additional and protracted period of time.  We do believe that the severity of loss will be less than what is occurring in diversified portfolios across the country and certain of such investments may turn into future opportunities to acquire New York commercial properties at greatly reduced levels.  ", "As to the $190 million or $200 million or so represented in the non New York portfolio, this is clearly a higher level than we would prefer to have in today's market environment and one in which we are attempting to reduce in order to minimize potential future losses.  ", "We hope to be successful in ultimately collecting, restructuring or selling portions of this portfolio, but losses in certain positions are possible and we have already taken I believe about $14 million of reserves against this non-New York portfolio and that's in total since this quarter and prior quarters.  ", "I'd like to take a moment now and have Andrew expand on some of these comments and discuss some of our top exposures listed in the supplemental for the first time with you now.  ", "", "Andrew W. Mathias", "Our structured finance portfolio sits at an $855 million balance today after [power] repayments of $71.2 million since quarter end.  No asset on the portfolio is directly financed and thus there are no term or mark-to-market issues associated with liabilities on this portfolio.", "In our supplemental this quarter we provided further disclosure with respect to our ten largest positions representing 75% of the entire outstanding balance of the portfolio.  We took a $9 million reserve this quarter against our non-New York City structured finance positions, as Marc indicated, and those positions aggregate approximately 22% of our current outstandings.  ", "Eight-five percent of the top ten positions are secured by New York City properties.  The top ten of aggregate subordinate cash equity invested of over $2.1 billion.  Many of these positions are fixed rate providing sponsors with enormous incentives to perform and enjoy the benefit of what is today below market financing.  Although liquidity of these positions in today's market is strained, we view these investments as ultimately liquid and also in a downside case continue to view these properties as potential pipeline for the company.  ", "The only meaningful new activity during the quarter was our mezzanine investment in the retail condominium at 666 5th Avenue.  This deal was committed in June and closed in July and the investment thesis is our long-term belief in prime 5th Avenue retail space.  Jeff Sudden who is partners with us in our retail business also co-invested in this transaction with us.  ", "The deal features $233 million of new subordinate cash equity from Carlisle Group and their partners, and returns on the position are over 15% with fees amortized.  This position shows up as the second position on the top ten lists.  ", "Marc Holliday", "While we spend time talking about Gramercy and structured finance which clearly these items seem to overshadow what I would consider the most important component of our company, which is the core fundamentals of the New York real estate portfolio which is ultimately paramount to the success of this company.  I think that that goes without saying.  Buildings in our portfolio remain well leased at 96.5% with an expectation of a modest uptick as opposed to downtick in the fourth quarter.  We continue to chip away at our near-term exposure.  ", "Our leasing in 2008, as in prior years, far exceeds contractual expiration during the year and by doing this our singular focus is on chipping away at '09 and '10 exposure which we've done throughout the year.  We continue to do it in the month of October as you may have seen this morning with our additional post 9/30 leasing achievements that we announced.  And additionally we have to our benefit buildings that are very well positioned to retain tenants due to our superior management and well maintained infrastructure which is primarily attributable to our portfolio repositioning that we executed over the years.  ", "We can be aggressive if we want to retain tenants, which we do in this market for sure, by leasing to levels that others can't since we have generally low basis and low leverage in our predominantly Class A portfolio.  ", "We also enjoy the benefits of a very favorable starting point, if you will, with deeply embedded rental mark-to-market and I think the advantages of that are clearly evidenced in today's release.  You saw the kind of mark-to-market we had in the third quarter as in the first nine months of the year and we were able to achieve that even in today's worsening leasing market.  ", "Recall that we clearly forecasted rental declines back in December and acted accordingly and defensively even though market rental decline won't begin to be more fully visible and evidenced until 2009.  We clearly have been operating in this defensive posture for all of 2008 and some of 2007.  ", "So, with some more detail on our leasing achievements in the third quarter and today's announcement from this morning, I'd like to have Steve Durrels run you through some of those data points.  ", "Steve Durrels", "There were a number of notable third quarter leases starting obviously with DDO's lease covering 121,000 square feet for three base floors at 100 Park Avenue.  This is a transaction we started working on in April.  DDO will anchor our building and redevelopment at 100 Park Avenue which won the 2007/2008 BOMA award for best renovated building of the year.  ", "The rent averaged $81 a square foot over 15-year term and the lease is in addition to several recent partial tower floor leases where we're pre-building space and starting rents have averaged $96 a square foot.  ", "At 750 Third Avenue we leased the entire ninth and part tenth floors to Regent Business Centers, 52,000 square feet.  Regent replaced RSM McGladrey who we relocated into a 27,500 square foot extension at 1185 Avenue of the Americas after negotiating a buyout of an existing tenant to create the expansion opportunity.  ", "At 810 Seventh Avenue we leased 26,000 square feet to ION Media Networks, who is moving from 1330 Avenue of the Americas.  They're the entire 30th and part 31st floors at an average length of $83 a square foot.  A big driver of their attraction to 810 is the ongoing capital program which should be complete during the first quarter of 2009.", "Additionally, we continued with strong leasing of 461 5th Avenue, where we closed four leases covering 31,000 square feet, and that averaged rent around $94 a square foot.  Taking into account the leases already signed in the fourth quarter, we've closed leases with a combined square footage that exceeds our total 2007 production.", "Leases signed in the past 30 days post-Lehman Brother's bankruptcy include Work Environment at 1515 Broadway, for approximately 65,000 square feet.  Rent averaged $83 a square foot over 10 years, which is almost 89% above the previously escalated rent.  ", "There's American Standard, about 54,000 square feet, at 1185 Avenue of the Americas, after we bought out the remaining term of an existing tenant and helped that tenant secure a sublease in a nearby building.  The new rent is 83% greater than the prior tenant's rent.  It's deals like that which show the difference between creating value using a strong in-house leasing team versus simply filling space through third-party brokers.", "On another front [Eisner LOT] standard by 34,000 square feet at 750 Third Avenue, where they're taking space previously scheduled to be vacant in June 2009.  New rent is 33% above the existing in place rent.  Also at 750 Third, the Permanent Mission of Poland is a new tenant leasing the entire 30th and 29th floors.  In this case we're cancelling an existing lease that was scheduled to expire in 2009.  The rent is 47% above the current in place rent.", "Finally, I believe yesterday, we secured an extension of WPIX's lease covering 104,000 square feet at 220 East 42nd Street, which takes that term out to March 2012.  That can cover our current leasing within the portfolio.  I'm sure you'll have some questions, but before that Andrew will provide some detail on the investment landscape.", "Andrew Mathias", "Thanks, Steve.  Not withstanding strong and active leasing performance, the investment activity in the market has flowed to a trickle with the debt markets frozen and investor capital on the sidelines in a game of wait and see for expected new pricing levels.  Despite this freeze we completed three sub [sift] transactions since our last call, all on the sales side.", "Last week we closed on the previous announced sale of 1372 Broadway.  The final price is $274 million, representing a 4.6% Cap rate on net operating income, and $539 per square foot.  The buyer in this transaction assumed our loan on the building.  Recall that we owned a 15% interest in this building, having sold 85% of the property at a $335 million valuation last year.", "Also this period we closed on the sale of 1120 White Plains Road in Westchester, which was held in a joint venture with [teachers].  The sale price there was $48 million, representing a 6.25 Cap rate and $227 per square foot.

With expected fees on this transaction we will have earned a 40% IRR on our capital after payment of Jeff's promote.  Whole dollar profits on this deal should be in excess of $23 million.  We retained a 10% un-promoted interest in the property, and if you've been to the heart of Times Square lately you've seen steel rising at the site at a rapid clip.  We expect to turn the building over to American Eagle early next year.", "Marc Holliday", "", "Okay, with that Greg is going to finish up with a discussion of Q3 operations, and also a discussion about the current balance sheet position of the company.  And I think this will enable us to finish up with strength because Q3 was, I thought, a very, very good quarter, especially on a relative basis given all the challenges in today's market.  We were obviously quite pleased to be able to have achieved on an operating basis what we were able to achieve in the third quarter.", "And also, when looking at our balance sheet, Greg is going to run you through a lot of different metrics, but the conclusion will be we've got a substantial amount of cash on hand.  That cash, most importantly in my mind, does exceed our recourse maturities over the next three years.  That's balance of '08, all of '09, all of '10, all of '11.

Obviously we've been very quiet on the new investment front, and I think that's what you just heard from Andrew, but why don't I turn it over to Greg and take us through those pieces quick.", "Gregory Hughes", "Sure, thanks, Marc.  I'm going to go ahead and jump right into the liquidity section of the presentation, which I think is kind of paramount in everybody's mind given what's happening in the credit markets today.  And I think we have a fairly good story here to tell.", "At 9/30 we had $711 million of cash on hand, which has increased subsequent to quarter end to over $800 million.  Additionally, we have $48 million of availability remaining on our credit facility.  ", "During the quarter on our line participants failed to fund it's obligation under our credit facility, and this coupled with the turmoil in the financial markets led to the proactive decision to draw down on approximately 97% of our credit facility.  In response to numerous inquiries that we have received, we have expanded our disclosures on page 26 of our supplemental to summarize the significant covenants which governed this facility.  ", "A review of these covenants finds that our total debt-to-assets for the quarter at 49% compared to the 60% that's required.  Our fixed charge coverage at 2.01 times compared to the requirement of 1.5 and our secured debt-to-total assets, a ratio that has plagued a number of our repeaters, at just 22% compared to the 50% requirement.

Our maturity profile looks manageable.  We have no remaining maturities for the balance of 2008, having recently completed two financings in September.

We also financed 28 West 44th Street, obtaining $125 million of financing of an average spread to LIBOR of 201 basis points.", "In addition to buttoning up any remaining maturities we had for 2008, these financings demonstrate that even in extremely turbulent times, quality New York assets can be financed.  As we look out to 2009 and 2010, we have approximately $279 million in maturities in 2009, including $200 million of unsecured notes; assume the connection with these Reckson acquisition.", "For 2010 we have approximately $550 million of scheduled maturities.  In 2010 there is also the potential for $220 million of convertible notes to be put to us.  Note that this amount reflects the reduction to this obligation of approximately $60 million from notes that we have recently redeemed subsequent to quarter end.  Based on our current liquidity position and our projected operations we believe we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our near-term debt obligations even if we don't see a thawing in the financial markets.", "One final note on liquidity, at 9/30 we had $105 million of restricted cash.  Approximately two-thirds of this money is available for capital projects and the payment of operating expenses including taxes and insurance.  The balance of this amount represents security deposits, which of course are generally not available for corporate purposes.", "Before I leave the balance sheet, I would offer the following observation related to our receivable balance, which is naturally something that we monitor closely during tough financial times.  And are happy to announce that we've experienced no change in our collections and we have had virtually no credit loss, which is a testament to the quality of our assets and the credit profile of our tenants.", "Turning to the core performance of our portfolio and the related operations, as Marc pointed out, our core portfolio continues to perform exceptionally well.  Occupancy was down slightly quarter-over-quarter due to scheduled lease expirations at 750 Third and 1515and Broadway.", "As you can see from this mornings leasing news we have already addressed these vacancies and would expect to finish up the year just shy of 97% occupancy.  While there are signs of weakness in the market we once again had a very strong leasing quarter with 359,000 square feet of space leased at an average rent of $66, with a mark-to-market of 55%.", "Note that once again, the actual rent achieved in the third quarter succeeded those that we have previously advertised as market rents in our lease expiration schedule.  It is also interesting to note that as of 9/30 the average rent on in-place rents for our Midtown Manhattan portfolio is just $53 per foot; a very favorable price point as people try to evaluate where rents are headed from here.", "We did see an uptake during the quarter in TIs and free rent, which was principally a result of a number of large long-term leases signed during the quarter, which Steve made mention of.  On a 15-year deal that we signed at 100 Park, we provided a $50 work letter and 12 months of free rent.", "Excluding this deal, TIs and free rent for the quarter would have been $23 in 2.9 months, much more inline with what we had experienced for the first 6 months of this year.  Our same store NLI for the quarter increase by approximately 9%, continuing to reflect the benefits of the strong leasing activity we have enjoyed over the last 24 months.", "As we have discussed before, NOI growth generally trails the leasing activity by a number of quarters, ending the consummation of revenue recognition.  As a result, the benefit to the strong leasing activity this year will not be solved until 2009.  This is one of the reasons we believe you will still good NOI growth from our portfolio in 2009, which we will detail in greater specifics during our investor conference.", "As expected, there were seasonal expense increases in the third quarter similar to what we had historically experienced.  This represents the principal reason for some quarter-over-quarter decline you see when comparing this quarter's operating results to the second quarter of this year.", "We have taken advantage of recent declines in energy prices to sign up a number of fixed contracts.  We're certain of our utilities, which should provide meaningful expense savings in 2009.  ", "Our structured finance income from the quarter was approximately $23 million.  This number includes some contingent interests which we were able to recognize during the quarter, and is also net of approximately $9 million of reserves during the quarter, which we took against certain of our non-New York positions.  This number also includes the benefits of the newly originated structure finance assessment at 666 5th Avenue, that Andrew had alluded to.", "Other income for the quarter was approximately $13.5 million.  This amount excludes the GKK in Tennessee, and GKK CEO collateral manager fee, which were waived for the quarter.  Of the $13.5 million of other income, $8 million represents fees from GKK and during the quarter we recognized just $188,000 of lease buy-out income.", "MG&A for the quarter was down $5.0 million from last quarter, which included certain one time expenditures related to the GKK AFR personnel addition, and is also down as a result of lower incentive-based compensation expense for the quarter.  Note that this G&A number does include approximately $5.7 million of personnel costs related to Gramercy Capital.  Combined interest for the quarter was roughly the same as it was last quarter.  ", "And then in conclusion in terms of guidance of what we see for the balance of the year, we're going to go ahead and reaffirm our guidance of 620 to 625, which would require that we post roughly $1.35 of FFO for the fourth quarter.  There are a number of significant variables that could impact the fourth quarter results, and I'm just going to tick them off quickly here for everybody.", "We're obviously going to maintain our sizeable cash position which we think is prudent in this environment and there is some negative carry associated with that.

LIBOR for the third quarter average, 2.62% and it now sits at approximately 3.2%.   ", "The Westchester property sales and the structure finance redemptions that Andrew referenced will reduce some of the earnings from those investments because they\u2019re no longer out.  We do have a $5.1 million incentive fee that we had recognized for the first half of the year on Gramercy this amount is subject to call back depending upon Gramercy\u2019s performance over the balance of the year.  ", "As I had mentioned earlier, the carrying value of our investment in Gramercy may be required to be written down and that could result in a fourth quarter charge.  So we\u2019ll have to continue to monitor that situation.  ", "And lastly we have done some early extinguishment of debt and there will be some gains recognized from that exercise as well.  So a number of variables in the fourth quarter but we feel okay going ahead and reaffirming our original guidance at this point in time.  And so with that I\u2019m going to turn it back to Marc for some closing comments.", "Marc Holliday", "", "I think we tried to shorten as best we could that portion of the call so we could get right into questions.  There are \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of people on the phone today so we\u2019re obviously going to just try to get to as many as we can.   So I\u2019d ask people to really try and limit the questions as best you can so that everyone, or most, people have the chance to get on the phone and ask what they want to ask about it, and with that operator I would say let\u2019s get the questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions).

I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have more information on the GKK call separately, but for SL Green\u2019s benefit or detriment, can you offer any color on any potential claw backs.   Or any other puts or issues that we should know about related to some of the investments at Gramercy?  And whether or not SL Green has any potential liability regarding some of those investments?  Just want to make sure that you have the opportunity on this conference call to clarify any issues related to that.", "Greg Hughes ", "", "I alluded to the $5.1 million incentive fees recognized in 630 which could be subject to claw back.  And I think that Marc made pretty clear there is no recourse obligations, there\u2019s no contractual obligations, there\u2019s no loans forthcoming.  There, by the way, we do have crossover in investments with that company which is, some time in the future may or may not make sense to consolidate those positions, but there\u2019s no contractual obligations to do so.", "Chris Hayley \u2013 Wachovia", "", "The magnitude of those crossovers?", "Marc Holliday", "", "We may have it right here.  This tally goes up but again this, first of all there is no indication that Gramercy is necessarily selling, a seller of those positions.  We have several positions we\u2019ve done with Gramercy over the years.  Typical have been I would hazard to say 50, 50 arrangements but that can vary from time to time.   But I think Greg\u2019s point was if any of those positions are openly deemed as quantity liquidated by Gramercy future.   We could be a natural buyer but we have no obligation to.  And we would assess that as we would any other investment.  I think that\u2019s the main point to your question.", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from Jonathan Habermann \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Jonathan Habermann \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Just sticking with the structured finance I guess on balance sheets.  Can you just give us a little bit more detail?   I know you went into a lot of specifics but loan-to-value and sort of where debt service covers exist today.  And then as well you talked about the reserves the $14 million you\u2019ve taken to date.  Can you give us a sense of how you arrived at those values?  I mean are you looking strictly at Cap rate changes or is it really a function of changes in occupancy and debt service coverage?", "Marc Holliday", "", "Why don\u2019t we hit the reserves first because I think you need to understand the nature of the reserve we took in this quarter which may be different than you\u2019re looking at it, and Greg, why don\u2019t you do that and then we maybe have some of these others mention it, too.", "Greg Hughes", "", "Yes on the reserves I mean we looked to, we do detailed discounted cash flow valuations of the underlying collateral to come up with those.  So we\u2019re looking directly at what we think the real estate is worth and I think it\u2019s noteworthy, I mean, so we\u2019ve gone ahead and set up those reserves.  Virtually all of those loans where we have reserves are still performing in accordance with their original terms.  So we\u2019ve tried to be proactive there and it\u2019s based upon a range of cash flows that we\u2019ve developed for the underlying collateral.

I don\u2019t think we have that right here, I mean obviously \u2013", "Jonathan Habermann \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Well is it 15% ,20% just a ball park?", "", "Marc Holliday", "", "Well it's different Andrew do you have sort of a feel by either product type or market that you could generally, I mean, everyone is different.", "Andrew Mathias", "", "I mean really it varies by asset and a lot of our loans are on transitional assets whether lease open at various stages.  So I would say typically to your first question we were originating at loan-to-cost or loan-to-value in our determination of between 60% and 80%.  ", "Most of the, all of the positions in the top ten obviously are either B note mezzanine loan or preferred equity.  We did not do much whole loan business in SL Green.  And I would say the debt yield in those positions, meaning the NOI at the property over the last dollar exposure of our debt, obviously aggregated up for any senior debt, stands today at about 6.2%.  ", "Now that\u2019s skewed by many properties in that pool that are as I said in various stages of lease up so if they have large vacancies they'll obviously show at a very low debt yield.  And also in our positions in residential where it is stabilized rent controlled assets where they\u2019re in the process of decontrolling tenancy and some other factors.  But to give you a sense on the average the debt yield is 6.2%.", "Jonathan Habermann \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Second question can you just comment broadly on the New York City office market?  What\u2019s the update on sublet space, just vacancy trends and also can you give us a sense of where you think Cap rates are trending.  I know you mentioned transactions are pretty much at a trickle.", "Marc Holliday", "", "Well let\u2019s, Cap rates I don\u2019t even know.  It would be very hard to assess that because no one has raised to sell at New York at whatever pricing that might be relevant in a market where there\u2019s just no debt.  So I think rather than try and predict a Cap rate you just have basically buyers and sellers realizing this is not a good market to sell in.

And where they\u2019re going to settle I don\u2019t think people necessarily know, but I don\u2019t, when we run our numbers, and you can settle them at different Cap rates.  Four five six, six-and -a-half seven eight, you can do that whole matrix; we still get to levels that we think are still very representative of making us view our stocks as a good buy and as you saw we still continue to buy stock in.

I would not have guessed sitting here in October we would be, \u2013 had the ability to make an announcement like we did this morning.  So that\u2019s been a surprise to the upside clearly there is a lot of sublet space that is somewhere between rumors and in the market, [Steve] I think if you can sort of target, rumored, it\u2019s just you just don\u2019t know.  Why don\u2019t you go with what is in the market or very close to being in the market.", "Steven Durells", "", "Well it\u2019s helpful to understand that if you watch the official stats depending on who is producing them as far as sub lease space availability goes, it\u2019s clearly increased over the past six to 12 months.  A year ago we were roughly at half a point of the availability with sub lease space.  Today it\u2019s officially at 1.7%.  ", "That doesn\u2019t tell the whole story though.  The reality is over the past, I\u2019m going to guess four or five months, anybody who is monitoring the market closely has run kind of a parallel list; there's that amount of square footage which is officially listed for sub lease.  ", "And then there is the shadow space that\u2019s out there which, always kind of run a list on that, assuming that, whether it was a piece of Lehman Brothers space or some other banking space or other kind of space.  That we either expect it to come on market or could be made available for market if there was a tenant ready to grab it.

So that\u2019s what\u2019s driven that increase in the availably rate of sub lease space to half a point to 1.7%.  And secondly I can\u2019t think of a major piece of new sub lease space that\u2019s been added to the shadow list.  ", "Kind of interesting to see that it\u2019s fairly stabilized in sort of a global overview, but we are expecting with the anticipation of some additional layoffs that there will have to be some additional sub lease spaces that come into the market.

It varies between longer term fixed rate and shorter term floating rates, but in every case we\u2019re matched up with the senior debt.", "Louis Taylor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "So then roughly or can you give a rough profile in terms of he holders of that debt, CMBS or life company, bank debt, etc?", "Andrew Mathias", "", "I think for the most part the majority is CMBS.  There are also some syndicated bank groups, but for the most part its CMBS and the senior debt.", "Louis Taylor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "And last question just in terms of the internalization of the GKK manager I guess what track is that on?  I mean is that something expected to do year end.  Do you think it\u2019s going to drag into next year; just what\u2019s the status of the process?", "Marc Holliday", "", "I think the main part of the process has been culminated and announced as of last night or this morning.  There\u2019s really just one of two outcomes; there\u2019s \u2013 the contract matures at the end of \u201909.   And part of the revision we\u2019re structured to make a renewal or non-renewal of that contract at the end of \u201909 much more feasible and executable for Gramercy than the terms that were previously in place. Or if there is reason to want to accelerate that into the next couple of quarters, we have the flexibility to that now. ", "But I would say that a lot of what the special committees wanted to accomplish in terms of reorganization, senior management changes, on both sides, Green and Gramercy. Fee reduction and making that back end portion of the contract nonrenewal fee something that was within parameters that Gramercy would be much more comfortable with.  That will occur and I would say that\u2019s substantively a lot of what special committees wanted to accomplish.", "", "Louis Taylor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "So for, just our purposes so we just assume that the contract will run its course through next year?", "Marc Holliday", "", "You can certainly assume that as your base case and if it internalizes earlier it will, but I would look at the two events as not having much economical differential at this point because of the fee concessions.", "Operator", "", "Your next question on the line comes James Feldman - UBS Securities", "James Feldman - UBS Securities, LLC", "Can you give a little bit more color on the whole Gramercy negotiation process?  And I had a lot questions from people just wondering about kind of the arm's length nature on it and could you add some color on that?", "Marc Holliday", "Well I think it was as arm's length as you would want in this situation, which was completely arm's length; two special committees; each committee made up of independents. So Steve and I were recused on each of those committee meetings. ", "They met separately. They hired their own advisors. ", "In the case of Green, they were advised by Citigroup and in the case of Gramercy they were advised by Golden Sachs.  Two separate sets of attorneys, neither of which was our common corporate counsel, [Clifford Shant], so in the case of Green in was [Frey and Frank]. In the case of Gramercy, it was [Hogan and Horten].", "And each committee ran numbers, decided I guess, what was in each company\u2019s best interest.  There was pretty protracted negotiations as it turned out this process was started, I seem to think three or four months ago.  Certainly on the last conference call I had highlighted it and really just culminated over the last several days. So, that was the process.  I think it was looking back both at the reaction from both Green and Gramercy shareholders as we've heard it today, we think it was a win-win for both companies given these economic conditions. ", "I mean everything that is done is done in the backdrop of an extraordinarily challenging operating environment. So I think each company tried to do the best that it could do.  I think we\u2019ve done that. And I think there\u2019s a lot of optimism now that this is a first step towards really advancing Gramercy to be able to really turn things around for itself by giving it at its core substantial reduction in G&A.  And therefore a better operating performance, that in itself is a huge benefit for Gramercy. And for Green and our 16% investment in the company is a huge benefit for Green. So that\u2019s basically how the process seems to be.", "James Feldman - UBS Securities, LLC", "Yeah, Steve could you just talk a little about where you think normalized market TIs are right now.  It sounds like the 100 Park deal is a little bit higher than average.", "", "Steven Durells ", "", "We had said, I think consistently over the last several months certainly made the point at the last conference call that TIs for vacant space has been increasing. I think by and large, where we\u2019re doing deals for raw space, and again it always depends on the price point of the building you\u2019re dealing in, so if it\u2019s a kind of $50 plus rent type deal, then I think by and large TIs are in the $45 and $50 a foot range. I think free rent has been edging up and we said that last time as well, that it\u2019s been going up an extra month or two. ", "And to some extent we were leading the charge in order to close out leases so if I had to I'd give the extra five bucks or I had to give the extra month of free rent. We were doing it in order to lock down our leases. So I think broadly speaking in the market right now $50 a foot is probably the most common TI for vacant space.", "It would be less if we\u2019re doing renewals. It would be less if we were doing a deals on space that already that has installation that's salvageable. And I think free rent runs anywhere between six and eight months. Although there are plenty of comps out there that are both dramatically lower and dramatically higher, but I think those are good sort of general comps.", "Marc Holliday", "One point that was made to me is that the concession packages will widen and we\u2019re going to have to meet the market in order to meet those deals.  I think Steve was telling you that we are doing that.  But I would also just point out ,which is somewhat of a subtlety, is that we have the capital to do it and many of our contenders in today\u2019s market do not. ", "As Greg said earlier there are a 105 million restricted two-thirds of that for making capital and some other reserves. So, that\u2019s available specifically and solely for these kind of deals where those reserves exist. And then we've got a sizeable cash balance that enables us to be able to do those kinds of transactions, where others right now who are high-basis, high leverage, cash strapped, maybe the early maturing debt, they can\u2019t do that. So on one hand concessions are rising.  We've said that now consistently now \u2013 it\u2019s just that now you\u2019re seeing it.

Where that\u2019s headed I think maybe we will have a better handle on that in the next three to six months as we see how much of the shadow space that Steve was referring to actually converts into direct sublet space and we\u2019ll see.

How we look at it?", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Smith Barney, Inc.", "And then specifically on the $60 million convert where was the pricing that you were able to obtain.", "Marc Holliday", "", "I\u2019m sorry, let me just \u2013 let me address my question, my interpretation of the question first because look there are, if we do intend to buy anywhere within that stack, I\u2019d say as a company we\u2019re slightly better served by not necessarily broadcasting specifically where we would intend to buy.  You would want us to buy at the best possible levels and certainly we do.  So, and I actually, when you say $50 million in converts we have several offerings that would show.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Smith Barney, Inc.", "No, I\u2019m saying the $60 million that you purchased in the quarter.", "Marc Holliday", "", "Oh in the quarter.  OK, so what we\u2019ve done already.  In terms of how we look at it, we think putting aside, whether stock is ultimately the higher return analysis, I guess if money was not an issue, we wouldn't want to buy all of the stock up right?  I mean, let\u2019s just call it what it is.  ", "If we had instead of whatever is on the that several million plus or minus, if we had $3.8 billion instead of $80 million, we'd just buy all the stock back because we would look at that in the long run and in the long term as being the absolute best use of our cash if we had it.  But we don\u2019t, so when you have, when you\u2019re constrained I think retirement of debt takes on a whole higher level and more attractive feel to it than retiring your permanent with it and that\u2019s simply a result of the uncertainty.  ", "If we knew in 2012 or 2013 markets would be back, we\u2019d be able to refinance at levels that we\u2019re accustomed to or anything close to it, so if you had that certainty you might still say let's use it all to buy back the stock and we\u2019ll just meet our debt maturity requirements in those years when you can, but nobody knows that.  Everybody hopes and thinks that but nobody knows that and if you don\u2019t know that it sort of pushes you towards devoting that cash more towards retiring debt than equity, even if you think the equity\u2019s a better buy.  ", "So again, just on a pure heads up price-per-pound return basis, we\u2019d probably love to continue buying the equity but I think due to the uncertainty until we see better where credit markets are headed and will ultimately settle out, then I think you have to keep as much capacity on the balance sheet as you can and just deal with your near term maturities.  ", "Near term debt means, well you can sort of create your own interpretation of what near term is, but near term to us certainly less than four or five years.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Smith Barney, Inc.", "", "I mean specifically on buying back $60 million of the convertible note that\u2019s due in 2010, I mean what price do you buy that back at?", "Andrew Mathias", "", "Well look, it doesn\u2019t make sense to share the pricing at this point in time.  You can safely assume it\u2019s a high teens plus type return which we see as being attractive as anything else we\u2019re seeing in the market and having the added benefit of delevering the company in an environment where companies that are over-levered are slowly being punished in the stock market.  So it has the benefit of being a very, very attractive return in de-levering the company and so it's an argue, a win-win.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Smith Barney, Inc.", "", "But you\u2019ll effectively mark the difference into earnings next quarter.", "Marc Holliday", "Yes, that is one of the last variables that I had mentioned for the fourth quarter earnings, that there would be gains from those, yes.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Smith Barney, Inc.", "But they convert to trade is like $0.50 to $0.60 on the dollar at this point.  I'm just trying to understand.", "Marc Holliday", "There's different classes out there so that.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Smith Barney, Inc.", "And just going back to the structured finance book, you have about $200 million maturing in each of the next, in 2009 and 2010.  What specific loans are coming due and given the higher leverage levels and some of the leasing requirements in some of the cases?  Can you just talk about the potential of refinancing and maturities of those pieces?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I think those are initial maturities on the maturity profile.  I think a lot of the loans as I mentioned had extension options as their rights.  They were often structured as two-years loans with two or three one-year extension options, mostly for Cap purposes to try and lessen the burden of the cost of interest rate management products.  But we expect most of those positions given the current refinancing environment to exercise those extension options.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Smith Barney, Inc.", "And how much, is there, I guess from a LIBOR perspective, Greg, you talked about having a lot of floating rate date; I see you having $900 million of LIBOR- based finances.  There's losses there.", "Greg Hughes", "", "Should I just finish out, Michael, my last one, because we're trying to get everybody in here.", "Marc Holliday", "We didn't hear that one, Michael.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Anthony Parlone \u2013 JP Morgan.", "Anthony Parlone  \u2013 JP Morgan", "Thank you.  With respect to leasing in your supplemental, you showed asking rents for the portfolio down just a little bit sequentially maybe less than two bucks.  And I\u2019m just wondering if that, how reflective that may be of the market and how that may, and how that percentage change or debt may look if you threw in what free rent looks like in TI?  So how effective rents have really changed on lease economics.", "Marc Holliday", "The question is how close are those asking rents TI or how close is the reduction in asking to reduction taking, I'm just not sure I understand.", "Anthony Parlone  \u2013 JP Morgan", "I\u2019m just trying to get a sense as to how lease economics have pulled back thus far because looking at your supplemental just the change in what you show as the ask is pretty modest so far.", "Greg Hughes", "", "Well, and as I mentioned, Tony, for the third quarter the asking rents that we had published in June, the actual leasing activity for the third quarter exceeded what those published rents are and Steve actually goes through a very detailed review of each of the properties that are rolled up into this, which he can walk you through and make modifications.", "Greg Hughes", "", "I think it\u2019s important to understand that with regards to the asking rent in the first place, we\u2019ve always been very conservative as to the asking rents that we publish.  Consequently, where we have seen reduction in the net effective taking rents, the need to address, to reduce our asking rent really isn\u2019t as great as you might otherwise think.  ", "Each of the buildings, at the end of every quarter I go through and assign an asking rent, an average asking rent to every one of the buildings and I think the numbers that we\u2019re using right now are very realistic as to where our expectations are as far as an ask, assuming that there\u2019s, again, it depends on where you are in the building and space by space, but generally the taking rents are within 5% or so, 5, 10% of the asking rent.", "Anthony Parlone  \u2013 JP Morgan", "I\u2019ll maybe ask this a little bit different.  Steve, in the last few leases that you\u2019ve actually signed, if you were to do those deals or look at those same deals a year ago, how far off are the economics on the deals you just signed versus what they would have been at say on the peak on a percentage basis?", "Marc Holliday", "", "Tony, they\u2019re probably down 10% on the nominal rent with a slightly bigger concession package than we would have offered a year ago.  So I think squarely within the 10 to15 that we\u2019ve been referencing in the past; some less, not many more on a net effective basis.  It\u2019s very hard, we do dozens and dozens of lease per quarter but if you had to generalize, I think it\u2019s safe to say that we\u2019ve taken most of those taking rents down, would you say by 10%?", "Steve Durrels", "Yes, I think we were one of the industry leaders to recognize a change in the market.  I remember a year ago last summer, or a year ago this past summer being on investor tours and at that point we were signaling the world is changing, the leasing market is changing.  ", "We were ahead of it.  We recognized it.  We already started to adjust our asking rents.  We started to adjust out transactions at that point in time.  I think that's one of the reasons we've been successful at really keeping the portfolio full and still realizing deal volume where maybe it's contrary to what you see in the rest of the market.", "Marc Holliday", "", "Yes, but someone raised the issue earlier on the call.  And you're right the concessions for the past quarter were higher.  And, I think that's just the function of the market.  So, you don't think it's not surprising to us in terms of the incremental dollars we have to put on the table to close the deal.  But they are higher than they were a year ago for sure and I think the range that I gave you is a good range for where we see the market right now.  ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors.", "Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors", "", "It sounds like you're addressing the near term debt maturities with the cash you drew done from the line, but can you talk about the 11 and 12 maturities and particularly the exchangeable debt that comes due?  Or, can be put back to you in 12?  What would be your current plan even though it's a little ways off now, to address that.", "Marc Holliday", "", "We have a plan for that.  Greg you want to talk about the oncoming?", "Greg Hughes", "", "I had made mention to a bunch of the unencumbered notes that would come due, particularly the 2012 that we had issued last year which would be purchased in 2012.  I think if the market didn't change dramatically from where it is today.", "First you would look to do corporate unsecured financing would be first choice to refinance those.  That's probably not a viable alternative as we sit today; don't know where it's going to be in four years from now.  We do have the 8 million square feet that I reference, equates to roughly $4 billion plus worth of real estate.  And so I think a likely add from the 2012, would be to go ahead and mortgage those properties.  ", "So if you went around through the portfolio we own 1185 Sixth Avenue.  We own 810 Seventh Avenue.  We own 1350 Sixth Avenue.  We own 750 Third Avenue; major fully occupied office buildings with credit tenants that don't have mortgages on them?  You would go ahead and likely mortgage those and retire those obligations.  ", "Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors", "", "You wouldn't come across covenants on your lines that would restrict that activity?  ", "Greg Hughes", "", "Again, if you look at the covenant package, we're in very, very solid shape.  We have the unencumbered asset pool is the one that we're probably closest to.  But again, when you're mortgaging a property, where we have tons and tons of room on the secured indebtedness test, and you're using those proceeds to retire unsecured notes in the form of the converse that would be put, that helps the ratio.  ", "Marc Holliday", "", "Because you're delevering Michael, so, if your securing up and delevering your not worsening the covenant.  ", "Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors", "Then this is the last question, can you just address Viacom and 1515 Broadway as well as the plan to refinance that debt I think in 2010?", "Marc Holliday", "So Viacom is \u2013 we're not going to begin the refinancing plan until we know exactly where we stand with Viacom, even though that goes without saying.  And that situation we would think will be much more clearer to us towards the end of November or December.  But we're not \u2013 but the debt doesn't mature until the middle of 2010, if I recall.  So there's nothing to do in terms of refinancing it now in October until you know where you stand with Viacom in November and December.  ", "Greg Hughes", "But I would add the property is relatively conservatively levered and the debt yield there is approximately 10%. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Jordan Sadler \u2013 KeyBanc Capital.", "Jordan Sadler \u2013 KeyBanc Capital", "", "Just following up on that last question, in terms of capital, can you maybe talk about your view on the dividend on this source of capital.?  You're paying out almost $200 million a year, at this point.  I recognize some of that is requisite for your REIT status, but have you looked at that as maybe a source?  I mean you've got an appropriately conservative posture with all of this cash drawn down on the balance sheet; just curious as to the thoughts on the dividend?", "", "Marc Holliday", "", "Well, look I think there's a lot of question of in that question and the one before, kind of about what does 2012 look like.  Because, I think what we're saying, what I said, what I think Greg said is that where we are our cash exceeds our recourse indebtedness maturities for the balance of '08, all '09, all '10, all '11.", "And I think that at some point you have to look and see and try to get a feel for what our market's going to be like in 2012 and beyond.  That doesn't mean we don't plan for it today.  But, I think Greg rolled out a contingency plan which is if they're no better than they are today they could always be worse, and how much worse that's hard to project.  ", "But we look at it as if they're no worse than they are today but, no better what's our plan?  Our plan would be probably to encumber some assets.  Clearly if AFO looks like it's not there to support the dividend, than you have to reevaluate the dividend.  But I think we would look to the real estate first to encumber as a source to repay other debt because it's debt for debt.  So what Greg said; there's no lever up there.  It's just replacing debt.  ", "Before we would touch a dividend if the AFO covers it and we think that that's an approved use of funds which we do at this time, but if the situation changed and we feel that the situation was not improving.  As we get out there towards 2012, then like every company you've got to reevaluate your dividends.  But that's just not the situation as we sit here today.", "Jordan Sadler \u2013 KeyBanc Capital", "", "Then a separate question just talking about your view of the market, I know its visibility is very difficult here and in the past you've talked about a 10 to 15 % market rank correction.  Bu, if you were to underwrite market vacancy, sort of peak market vacancy here, I know it's very difficult to do at this point, but including and taking into account some of Steve's estimates of the shadow pipeline of sublease space.  Where do you think we might get this time on the down cycle in terms of total vacancy?  ", "Marc Holliday", "That's a very tough question.  We're sitting right now around 8% or so.  And, that includes the shadow direct vacancy that Steve was talking to, the 1.7 of direct.  Steve, total square footage of sublet that you think in addition to that number could be delivered in the next 24 months.  I'd rather sort of look at it that way than predict a vacancy rate, but how much additional beyond the 1.7?", "Steve Durrels", "", "I think that it's widely believed that that could go up to kind of another point or so.  So it would be maybe 2.5 to 3% of sublease space.  But I think you've got to be careful.  If you look at the overall availability of the market and you use that as any guidance as to the impact on our portfolio, because a lot of the vacancy that's reflected out there are in very large blocks of space, whether it's new construction at 11 Times Square that\u2019s come on.  Or big block of space like Pfizer is putting on, which is basically almost the majority of 635 Third Avenue.  ", "Those are the kind of numbers that move the needle on the availability stats but then  when you ask yourself, how does that impact our portfolio right now, recognizing that through the end of next year we only have one or two pieces of space that I'm going to be marketing that's in excess of 70,000 square feet.", "So just because the availability goes up, doesn't necessarily mean that I'm competing against the same inventory; it's more about what's happening in the small to mid sized type tenant space that's out there because that's the space that I've got to fill over the next 12 months", "Marc Holliday", "I would add it's important to distinguish between mid-town and other markets, so midtown, downtown, Midtown and you see numbers floated for the New York Metro area which incorporates suburban activity, which is very different.  If you go back to the last downturn, in the early 2000s, it got down as low as 87, 88% occupancy, but if you look back then we were able to out perform the market and operate it closely to 10 points above that level.  ", "What we did see then, and we think you'll see again this time, is tenants moving towards well capitalized landlords who operate their buildings professionally.  So the performance back then was dramatically different than what the market was.  ", "Operator", "", "Your next question will come from Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors.", "Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors", "", "I was going to ask isn't the absolute dollar size of that loan today, fairly problematic, even though it is conservatively levered on a LPV basis?", "Marc Holliday", "No, I don't believe so.", "Greg Hughes", "It\u2019s not problematic, Michael, until you know what the leasing status is and even if Viacom does renew, we have 18 months and funded reserves in the loan at a fairly low rent per foot that we think \u2013 that would be one the least expensive products on the market today.  If we offered that as we sit, now today and we've got a lot of runway to lease it.  ", "So, the answer is, I think our first order of magnitude, we'd like to make a deal with Viacom and have been working with them on and off for years.  Try and make that occur but, I think that they have their own needs that they'll \u2013 I think will become clear to us over the next couple of month or two and if we make the deal then we'll know what our refinancing strategy is and if we don't make the deal and we're delivering that to the market we think we can lease fairly aggressively, lease it up.  And, I agree with Andrew the loan is \u2013", "Andrew Mathias", "I don't believe that 600 million takes it out of the syndicated loan market, not at all.  I mean We just closed 245 million dollars with a sole arranger on principle basis in September.", "Operator", "", "Your last question comes from the line of [Nick Pearsos] \u2013 [The Choir].", "[Nick Pearsos] \u2013 [The Choir]", "", "The cumulative 14 million established reserved of your structured portfolio, structure finance portfolio.  Other than it being from the non-New York portfolio.  Have you been able to identify any common characteristics that are generating the losses", "Marc Holliday", "No, just I would just say in each one, yes, the common characteristic is our non-New York portfolio is performing, as you might expect or would expect, not as well as our New York portfolio.  That's the common characteristic.  Beyond that, the property types involved vary, the locations vary. ", "I would just say the common characteristic is they're in markets where values have dropped more precipitously than they have here in New York and liquidity is less and unfortunately we have to find a lot of areas outside of Manhattan right now.  ", "So we \u2013 many of those loans, several of those loans, we think are restructureable and/or get repaid and/or I think we're in relatively good shape.  Others will become problems but what we try to do was dimension the bucket of what we think the problems may stem from to a bucket or 200 million; certainly not the whole 200 million.  If that\u2019s not obvious I want to state that.", "But a portion of it, we've reserved I guess 14 million of that $190 or $200 million and if there's further deterioration we'll take more reserves, as we see it.  But beyond that there's no common thread.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi.", "Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi", "", "My question was asked and answered.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of [Ross Wenner] of [D'Amico] Capital.", "[Ross Wenner] \u2013 [D'Amico] Capital", "", "Rationale for why you chose to waive the management agreement, for this quarter with GKK?", "Marc Holliday", "I was just part of the overall arrangement that the boards, each pertain to determine I guess there and appropriate in light of all the back and fourth consideration.  So I can't tell you how one specific piece related to another, but it was an overall package that included some fee relief in Q3 and then additional relief in Q4.", "And then the incentive fee for 2009 is still present but with an option on the part of Gramercy to pay that in cash or stock if there incentive owed in 2009, and it was all considered as part of a package.", "Okay, operator, that's our last question, so thank you everyone for calling in and if there's anyone that we missed we'll try to \u2013 please give us a call directly and thank you for listening in on this call today.", "Operator", "", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

This conference call is being recorded. At this time, the company would like to remind the listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from predictions that management may make today. Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A Section of the company\u2019s form 10-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "Also during today\u2019s conference call, the company may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC regulation G, the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure discussed and the reconciliation of differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found on the company\u2019s website at www.slgreen.com by selecting the press release regarding the company\u2019s fourth quarter earnings.", "Before turning the call over to Marc Holiday, Chief Executive Officer of SL Green Realty Corporation, we would like to ask those of you participating in the Q&A portion of the call to please limit your questions to two per person.", "Thank you. Go ahead, Mr. Holliday.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. Thank you for joining us today. Greg and I will take you through the highlights for the fourth quarter and particularly in light of today's challenging economic challenges. I was quite satisfied with our quarterly results. It was a mixture of strong operating performance with one time gains, as offset against some disappointing, but not unanticipated write-downs.", "Later in the call, Greg will take you through the earnings release and hopefully make sense of the ins and outs of the quarter. And at the end, hopefully, you also will conclude that the platform really evidenced its strength in the fourth quarter by outperforming, what we had anticipated in terms of results in our core portfolio in the Manhattan commercial office properties.", "Many of the highlights and achievements in the fourth quarter were foreshadowed at our December Investor Meeting, which we held in the first week of December. And I am pleased to report that in under two months since that conference, we are well on our way to meeting or exceeding many of the objectives, we set forth that day.", "Looking at the Manhattan leasing fundamentals, which drives a significant portion of what we have talk about today, we were able to increase occupancy by 20 basis points to almost 97%, which is a great jumping half point as we enter 2009.", "Most notable during the quarter, we renewed Viacom at 1515 Broadway ensuring that, that buildings continuing stability will be in place at least through 2015. This took a significant risk item off the table and it\u2019s a great example how we were able to capitalize on meeting the market with a net effective deal netting down all the capital, that works for us, work for the tenant and that we were able to do uniquely because of our low basis in that particular asset, low cost basis.", "That\u2019s a low cost basis that we have universally throughout the portfolio that will benefit us and enable us to lease, where others in the city can't or going to have to differ to their lenders in making important leasing decisions, like the one we were able to make quickly and deftly at 1515 Broadway.", "Outside of that lease, we maintained a positive mark-to-market in Q4 averaging I believe 65% plus or minus mark-to-market, obviously for in excess of what we would have expected or forecasted. But again an example of how the portfolio has an extraordinary amount of embedded growth in rents that were done in the early, mid to late \u201890s and are now maturing in late 2000, and we are experiencing big mark-to-market, not withstanding the rents in this market have been falling throughout 2008.", "Even this morning\u2019s announcement of Wells Fargo taking a full floor at 100 Park Avenue a base floor, 44,000 square feet at a mark-to-market of around 47%, which is the result primarily of a extraordinarily successful repositioning effort that take took what was a un-renovated Class B building in a great location at the 100 Park and renovated it to BOMA building of the year for renovated building standard and enabled us to lend Wells Fargo as a great new addition to our portfolio.", "And that deal comes on the heels of another significant transaction we did in 2008, previously announced to be the old lease. So that project is well on its way to paying dividends on the redevelopment program, not withstanding the economic climate.", "Clearly, this is a market where we are re-looking at the ways we lease and do business with tenants. We are more cautious today; we have increased our security deposit requirements for tenants that are less than obviously creditworthy. And this is something that we have done in other bad markets. It's paid off for us. It's kept our credit losses to a minimum in good and bad markets.", "We are also doing more net effective deals where we put out less capital and pay less commission on slightly lower rents, but rents that still provide for up-tick relative to prior escalated rents. Where we feel the need to do pre-builds to get velocity in leasing certain building where we had space that is not moved. We are doing pre-builds. It's an effective program for us in the down market. It's what sells leases and notably we are saving as much as 20% to 25% on our construction cost of these pre-build. So, as rents are falling, we still are able to make economic leases with this pre-build space.", "Market however is certainly feeling the pressure of job losses, financial services contraction, sublet space, and a limited but growing number of business failures. We can\u2019t help but expect that vacancy rate in mid-town is going to rise beyond where we had originally forecasted, those vacancy rates to be at around 10% to 12%.", "At the moment, those rents seem to be at around 8% to 9% vacant currently. May be even 10% if you take into account whatever space we think will be coming available directly or indirectly on line in 2009. And we think that that vacancy rate could easily now hit 12% or more over the next 24 months.", "So, there are predictions that are all over the place, from about 10% to a number in the low to mid teens. I think we're firmly in the middle of that, it was not all space that is rumor to come, will come and you always discount the positives that will inevitably occur in, in a market like this.", "An example where a company buys an out-of-state company that could result in backfilling of space in the market that was previously gone in for sublet. Alternatively, I think we have to see what the full effects of the Obama's stimulus package will be for New York City, where I believe New York will be a well-represented recipient of the stimulus monies in order to get some of the bigger infrastructure projects back off the ground and working again whereas they have stalled in prior years.", "Notwithstanding these market challenges, we do expect to lease in excess of 1 million square feet of new and renewal space in 2009, with a high degree of emphasis on renewal spaces. The credit loss is something that we will look at closely in 2009, while we do believe that having the well-leased portfolio fortress properties, repositioned properties, so good creditworthy tenants is what will protect us.", "We can't discount the impact that we could see business failures and/or bankruptcies. Traditionally, our credit loss has been very low, 0.5 percentage point in 1998 and 2002. And right now, it stands at just 14 basis points, 0.14%. But there was notable increase in delinquencies and bankruptcy filing in the fourth quarter, continuing into January and I think that we have to expect that one of the risks we will have to guard against and be very proactive on is monitoring our tenants carefully, making deals where appropriate, not making deals where appropriate and looking to switch our tenants early who we think will pose the greatest risks for the portfolio.", "Speaking of the portfolio, I think it was not by chance that you saw the results, the very positive core results that you saw in the fourth quarter. Going into this downturn, I just want to remind you that we took several steps to fortify the real estate portfolio. First, we sold over a dozen properties, amounting to 2.5 billion of gross products sold. These were typically properties believed to be the most exposed in a recessionary environment that we\u2019re currently experiencing.", "Second, we advance leased 1.6 million square feet of space that would have otherwise expired in 2009 and 2010. As a result, only 800,000 square feet will roll in 2009, much of which we expect to renew.", "Third, we redeveloped and repositioned buildings throughout the peak market such that our inventory will be highly competitive in a down market. Over the past five years inclusive of 2009, we have done or are doing significant renovations at 15 properties, totaling more than 350 million in the aggregate. When tenants have an ability to make choices, this level of property improvement and renovation weighs heavily in those decisions as well as the rent, both of which we are well positioned to take advantage of.", "Lastly, we made substantial improvements in our operations. Such that tenants when surveyed consistently rank SL Green's performance as excellent and well above industry in local benchmarks. That is the combination of portfolio wide efforts over the last five to six year that have taken place and have enabled us to increase our retention ratios, increase referral rates and garner more than our fair share of new tenants in a market like this.", "Turning our attention to structured finance, you could see that given the lack of liquidity in the market, we worked hard in the fourth quarter to sell $100 million of structured finance positions at attracted prices relative to our investment alternatives. These sales were mostly of New York City paper, which still has a degree of liquidity, contrary to opinion that New York has been hardest hit and lacked any liquidity.", "In fact, we are finding that SLG's non New York investments are more impaired and suffer in markets without any meaningful liquidity, which is why we recorded an $85 million charge predominantly against these types of non New York investments.", "The cumulative effect of the sales write-downs was to reduce structured finance investment balances to under $750 million with more sales planned throughout the year. Now, withstanding these write-downs, since inception the structured finance program has been very profitable, generating an excess of $400 million of aggregate interest income through 2009 and has led to the acquisition of four Manhattan office properties comprising an excess of 2 million square feet.", "One of the greatest challenges that we have faced during this frozen credit markets has been the management and transition of Gramercy Capital Corp. Throughout 2008 as GKK\u2019s loan book grew and the merger and integration with AFR was finalized, we have worked closely with the company to reduce G&A costs, resolve problem assets and reorganize around a new management team that could take the reins over from SL Green on a fully self-managed basis.", "The additions of Roger Cozzi, a CEO and Tim O'Connor as President have been extraordinarily positive steps towards self management, no later than the end of this year. The special committees for both companies have agreed to approach Gramercy\u2019s banks to seek approval for an internalization that is deemed to be favorable for the long-term prospects of GKK and the company is awaiting bank group consent.", "Recall that during the third quarter, SLG reduced its management fees to roughly cost and in the fourth quarter SLG reimbursed GKK for incentive fees that had been accrued in 2008. All of these steps were undertaken to put GKK in the best position to succeed in increasing cash flow and improving its balance sheet position.", "In light of current market conditions, we decided to write-down SLG\u2019s investment in GKK stock and write-off our investment in the manager. As GKK\u2019s largest investor, we have seen our stake rise and fall over the past five years, but we have concluded that after much effort, it was appropriate to take the write-down in our investment with limited near-term market relief in sight.", "Turning away from the investment portfolio and towards things we can more easily control -- our cash flow. There are several areas, where we took decisive steps to increase cash flow in the fourth quarter and continuing into 2009. First, we did a top to bottom review of our capital expenditures for 2009 and through combination of mostly value engineering, but also taking advantage of declining materials and labor prices; we were able to save significant dollars on our capital expenditure program projected for 2009. And we are estimating that it will be $50 million or more below our 2008 program.", "These savings at first are very difficult to come by. I personally met with about 75 of the companies, contractors, professionals and subs, at a meeting where we put on the table the company\u2019s goals and objectives for achieving these savings and the result of that meeting was extraordinarily positive.", "People came back within days with ideas on how to achieve value engineering solutions. Some were just concessions that were put on the table in light of the fact that we work with these contractors during good times and they are willing to work alongside with us in tough times. And the result has been very positive to date. And I believe that the fruits of those types of efforts will show themselves at the end of this year when we meet again to analyze the work done in the course incurred.", "Second, G&A; we made substantial reductions in MG&A in 2008 with more reductions budgeted for 2009. Savings are the result of lower compensation levels, reduction in head count, elimination of certain accounting expenses and departmental savings achieved primarily through straightforward belt tightening. In 2009, we expect MG&A to be reduced by more than $5 million over 2008 and by $15 million off of its peak expense in 2007.", "These reductions are being achieved without any material reduction in assets under management. So an already lean staff has been asked to operate even more efficiently, work harder, pick up more task. I am also happy to say that, company-wide, people have risen to this quelling and have kept good spirits and good morale in this tough environment and that is what has enabled us to make the reductions that I just reviewed with you.", "Lastly, dividends; during the fourth quarter as you know we made the difficult but we believed prudent decision to reduce our quarterly dividend. Simply put, we did this because we could and we believed we should and not because we had to. Note, that our fourth quarter FFO and SAG easily covered the old dividend level.", "However, in making this decision we listen closely to our shareholders, who overwhelmingly held stated opinion that the cash flow would be better retained by the company for reduction of liabilities or new opportunistic investments than to be simply be paid out to shareholders at the rate of 20% on current share price.", "Opinions may differ, but we ultimately agree that the benefits of conserving cash in this economic environment outweigh the reasons against reducing the dividend. Merely the funding of the buyback of our own bonds had implicit returns north of 20%, presented reason enough to take this action. The dividend reduction combined with the previously MG&A savings and capital expenditure reductions will produce significant incremental internally generated cash flow over the next several years, which will be deployed in a manner to strengthen SLG's balance sheet, P&L and maximize its stock price.", "In summary, we demonstrated in the fourth quarter, we adhered to our strategy stated back in December. Maximize the core Manhattan portfolio, liquidate structured finance in non-core positions, increase cash flow with the company, reduce near-term recourse maturities and build war chest for opportunities in the coming years.", "Over time, we are confident that these steps will be well rewarded and that taking these early and decisive actions will result in the best for the company, shareholders, stock price.", "With that, I'd like to turn it over to Greg Hughes to take through in detail the quarterly results.", "Greg Hughes", "Great. Thanks, Marc, and good afternoon, everybody. I actually reversed the order of the financial review, just go around and start with the P&L, which received little focus these days. And then, finish up with the balance sheet and the liquidity position which is what everybody wants to talk about.", "The operating results for the quarter were solid, as Marc had mentioned. The combined same-store NOI for the portfolio was up 4.2%. If you exclude roughly $7.4 million of accounts receivable reserves that were reported during the quarter, the same-store NOI growth would have been up 7.9%. That $7.4 million is reflected as a reduction in property revenues and is the reason you're seeing a decline in property NOI this quarter versus last quarter.", "At this point of time, we do not expect that those will be recurring quarterly reductions in 2009 and I should note that they do relate to multiple properties. I should also take the opportunity to point out that Citigroup, our largest tenant and the subject of much enquiry, is expected to contribute roughly 13% of our property operating income during 2009.", "As Marc mentioned, a strong leasing quarter highlighted by Viacom and the 249,000 square feet of additional leasing where we realized that mark-to-market of over 65%. You will note from our lease expiration table that our quarterly review of market rents has reduced the embedded mark-to-market in our portfolio to approximately 21% on a combined basis.", "While down significantly from 40% in Q2 of 2007, we believe that an average in place rent of approximately $53.59 per foot that there is still a rental road to be achieved within the portfolio. Today\u2019s announcement of the full four deal at a 100 Park with a 47% mark-to-market, put us well on our way to achieving our 2009 goal of 10% mark-to-market.", "Perhaps even more important from a review of this schedule is the fact that as we head into an economic downturn, just 14% of our Manhattan portfolio is scheduled to turn over during the next three years. This is a testament to the proactive leasing efforts we have set forth during the last 24 months.", "Our structured finance income for the quarter was $42 million, which included roughly $9 million of gains under disposition of selected assets, as well as $7 million from the resolution of our RSVP investment. Other income for the quarter was $9 million, which consisted principally of recurring JV leasing commissions and asset management fees.", "During the quarter, we repatriated $5.1 million incentive fees earned from Gramercy during the first six months of 2008. We serve to offset the base management fee earned from GKK during the quarter. Accordingly, other income effectively excludes any fee income from GKK for the quarter.", "During the quarter, we have recognized $88.5 billion of gains from the early extinguishment of debt, when we repurchased $102 million and $160 million of bonds, which reportable to us in 2010 and 2012 respectively. The yield reported on these repurchases averaged in excess of 22%, which we believe to be a good source, good use of capital while simultaneously de-leveraging our balance sheet.", "Subsequent to year end, we purchased an additional $86 million of notes, on which we expect to recognize a gain of $29.4 million during 2009.", "Loan loss and other investment reserves include $85.4 million of reserves against the structured finance portfolio, a $14.9 million write-off for our borrowed investment in GKK Manager and a $2.4 million write-off for our remaining investment interest in the Mack-Cali JV.", "G&A for the quarter was $33 million and include the write-off of $80 million related to the cancellation of certain employee stock options as well as a portion of the company's 2006 long-term outperformance plan. This charge represents the remaining unamortized cost associated with those plans. This charge was offset in part by the reversal of certain over-accrued incentive-based compensation.", "Excluding these one time adjustments, the quarterly G&A would have been approximately $21.9 million. We believe that this is an appropriate run rate as we head in to 2009 and should result in us achieving savings well in excess to the $5 million that we identified during investor day.", "In an effort to sort through the various moving parts this quarter, where the junk and the trunk, as it has been described. Page 10 of our press release attempts to remove certain of the one time items from this quarter\u2019s operating results. This reconciliation results a quarterly run rate FFO per share of approximately $1.40 or $5.60 on an annual basis.", "This run rate coupled with increased 2009 property in Hawaii, reduced G&A and interest expense savings enable us to reconfirm our run rate guidance of 575 that we provided on Investor Day. Recall this amount was further adjusted down to a range of $5.25 to $5.50 to provide for possible additional reserves on our structured finance portfolio. We are also reaffirming that guidance range today.", "It is worth noting, as Marc alluded to as we revert back to focus on core operations that of the $1.40 run rate of FFO approximately 94% of that is being generated from our core real estate operations.", "Before we leave earnings, I want to spend a minute reviewing our taxable income, which we summarized on page 18 of our supplemental and wish a significant consideration in establishing our dividend. You will note from a review of this analysis that through effective tax planning, we were able to meet all of our 2008 distribution requirements with the first three quarters of dividends.", "According the fourth quarter dividend carried a record date of January 2nd and will be utilized to meet our 2009 distribution requirements. This flexibility enabled us to reduce our dividend and use the $95 million of distributions that would have otherwise made in 2009 to de-lever the company and generate substantial gains.", "Even with the early extinguishment of $262 million of debt during 2008, we finished the year with $726 million of cash. We also had $55 million of availability remaining on our line, $73 million restricted cash that can be used for capital projects and certain operating expenses. And we expect that the company will generate over a $100 million of cash flow during 2009 after the payment of dividends.", "As we have mentioned on Investor Day, the cash on hand that we have already covers the $532 million of corporate obligations that come due during the next three years. This $532 million includes our only major 2009 maturity of $200 million which comes due in March.", "Also as we mentioned in Investor Day, we had six major property mortgages which mature over the next three years. Our share of which totals $786 million. Although none of these mortgages matures this year, we would expect to be in the market this year taking advantage of the historically low interest rates.", "Even in this lousy credit environment, we remained optimistic that not only can many of these assets be refinanced but that in a number of instances we may realize excess financing proceeds as a result of the modest leverage currently in place on these assets. A review of our all important debt covenants for the quarter shows us well within compliance on all our major covenants.", "Our ratio has actually strengthened during the quarter as a result of improved property performance, early extinguishment of debt and lower interest rates. It is worth noting that our unsecured debt to unencumbered asset leverage ratio, which had been our tightest covenant declined to 52.3% versus the maximum available of 60%.", "Other items of note on the balance sheet include the following; our investment in joint venture was down by approximately $169 million, principally as a result of the $147 million write-down of our GKK stock position to its closing price at December 31 as well as the aforementioned write-off for the GKK Manager investment.", "Our structured finance balance finished the quarter at $748 million, reduced by $99 million of sales during the quarter as well as $85 million of reserves. Note that $68 million of the structured finance portfolio is now classified as assets held for sale, which also includes our 55 corporate investments that is scheduled to close in the first quarter of 2009.", "As previously mentioned, we booked additional accounts receivable reserves during the quarter. Given the current economic climate that Marc alluded to and the increase in delinquencies, we took the opportunity to top-up our reserves related to tenant receivables and deferred rent receivables. These reserves amount to $16.9 million and $19.6 million respectively at year-end.", "Our mortgage notes payable declined during the quarter principally from the re-class of the 55 corporate mortgage to liabilities related to held for sale and our term and unsecured notes decreased obviously as a result of the $262 million of debt repurchase we made during the quarter.", "Well they remain substantial with the chop; we feel that we have made good progress during the quarter in cleaning up our balance sheet, delivering the company and positioning ourselves for the challenges at hand. And with that I would like to turn it back to Marc for some closing thoughts.", "Marc Holliday", "Thank you. I think we missed earlier in mentioning that Andrew is on the road today. He is dialed in, listening in and available for Q&A, but because of the logistics, this was not a part of the commentary that we just went through, but anything related to the investments or anything else for Andrew, he is on the line.", "And with that, I think we would like to open it up for questions, operator.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman from UBS. Please proceed.", "Jamie Feldman - UBS", "Great. Thank you very much. I was hoping you could walk us through your largest leases with Citi and the kinds of conversations you're having with them, and what exactly are they doing in ad space?", "Marc Holliday", "Why don\u2019t we handle this three ways. Let Greg run you through or run everyone through what leases we have with the company and Steve Durels can describe what they are doing in this space and I can just mention briefly conversations we've had. So, we have that, chart.", "Steve Durels", "Yes, I think Jamie, if you and if people want to refer back, we had in Investor Day, we had a separate Citigroup tenancy slide, and it's really six major positions. They have 338,000 square feet of space over a 34th Street, which we actually had signed up with them knowing that they were going to move out of ad space in June of this year. We actually have already subleased ad bunch of the space to the [Siebel Company].", "So that was something that we knew was going to occur. 485 Lexington, roughly 297,000 square feet of space that has some private banking over there and some of the property folks in there which\u2026.", "Marc Holliday", "Yes, 485 is kind of a wealth management and a good deal of the people and they are there related to the Group being bought by Morgan Stanley and just to go back, the 333 because I\u2019ll layer in as Greg goes through this.", "333 as we said, we bought it with the knowledge and intention that they would be exiting out of the building. In fact, they should be out a little early, although they were rent obligation that they will continue to pay through the end of August and we have pre-let a $160,000 of square feet of ad space to the [Siebel Company].", "Steve Durels", "Right. So those are tuned in the wholly-owned portfolio. In the JVs, we have 800. Third, we have a small retail space over there for 7,000 square feet. Of course, the biggest position, 388, 390 Greenwich Street, we have 2.6 million square feet. We own that in joint venture and we\u2019re a 50.6% owner of that building again. Our understanding is that that\u2019s the building that they are backfilling into and Steve can walk through some of the high end space that they are actually looking to subways.", "Marc Holliday", "Yes, like Greenwich Street, it\u2019s a mixed group that\u2019s over there, none of them are related to wealth management or any other people that are be part of the Morgan Stanley acquisition. But its investment banking, it\u2019s some of their tax and planning group, and there are three or four other the users group.", "But again, all corporate headquarters type people. It is their Beachhead facility of which case, between that and right on the city are the two facilities that they have been moving people into as they led a less spaces leases expire around town or as they led other satellite offices, they take the spaces to sublease market. We got a wide variety of spaces, 666, 5th Avenue, Citicorp Center, space on 7th Avenue, where they\u2019ve got spaces anywhere from 100 to 400,000 square feet and those are the facilities that you hear and you read in the headlines, where they are subleasing space and consolidating back into a modeling city.", "Andrew Mathias", "That\u2019s a headquarters building, then we have a small office space up in 750 Washington, which we have a 180,000 square feet of which we have a 51% ownership stake. And then lastly, Modeling City, which is Steve, is referring to where one foot square as we call it, a million four square feet of space. We own a 30% stake in that building. Again, that sounds like they are building at their back filling in to, the difference in the headquarter building, that is a building that they do have some shedding rights in as we move into the latter part of 2009 and 2010.", "Steve Durels", "Lot of facilities, people located over there. Lot of the back offices located over there and many of you may know that next door to one core square is a building that Citibank, about a year and half ago, just finished building as a second property, not part of the facility that we own. But most properties are linked and those are really that the two buildings that they migrating all their back office people to.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. So, net and net when you call away the GV ownership and call away 333, which expires this year, it's about 2.25 million square feet space that we have on a pro-rata basis at the company and it\u2019s relatively in expensive space city relatively well occupied. So, that\u2019s the status with them.", "Jamie Feldman - UBS", "Okay. Thank you. I\u2019ll pass through on.", "Steve Durels", "And again I think it is an important point because when you look at the, when you pickup our supplemental and look in Salt Lake City has 4.7 million square feet of space on a 25 million square foot portfolio, its actually reduced considerably, when you look at the JV structures, the Long Island City, NOI contributions are actually very low and that\u2019s why took the opportunity to point out that 13% of our income is going to be coming from city, not the 25% that you might look at on a square footage basis, if you just paid due to supplemental.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Haley from Wachovia. Please proceed.", "Brendan Maiorana - Wachovia", "Good afternoon. It\u2019s Brendan Maiorana with Chris. Marc, as you mentioned in your prepared remarks the market wide vacancy assumptions that you are using, which I think was in the Investor Day, which I think was data from Cushman was around 12% at the peak or maybe 12% by year end. There are number of other brokerage services that are higher than that up to 16% and it seems though the market has probably gotten a little bit worse since your Investor Day.", "That\u2019s almost two months ago. If you used, what is the updated expectation that you\u2019re using for market wide vacancy levels by year end or into 2010 and how does that impact your expectation to achieve 10% mark-to-market on new rents for this year?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, what I said earlier, which I think is consistent with what you just said is that market may be around somewhere 8 to 9, maybe even 8 to 10 looking out some period of time now and that could rise to 12 or 12 plus and I think that\u2019s where our current thinking is.", "There are some people who may be, think that will be worse than that, may be there is some that, things to be better than that. But I think that everybody is pricing in the negative news, there is no positive news priced into that. And I do think that ultimately the announcements exceed the actuality in terms of what space will be delivered.", "And so I think, as we sit here today we are still in single digits, that will go to double digits we think by the end of the year. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to make a dramatic difference in rents today. I think the rents you are seeing today are already reflective of that expectation.", "And when you said earlier, the mortgages have gotten worse, I don\u2019t think so. I think it\u2019s just playing out as we envisioned it. I am not sure that it\u2019s worse than we envisioned it. What we are envisioning is more and more space coming to market, and I think you are seeing that play out, I wouldn\u2019t say that our sentiment today is worse than it was 50 or 60 days ago.", "I think that we will be able to achieve our mark-to-market, because we are getting leases done right now and as you know people have a strong preference to deal direct as appose to sublet. Sublet is not necessarily on the market as forcefully as tenants who are looking to move into new space needed in terms of contiguous available space with concessions and with options and term for some of the bigger tenants and I think that the leasing is a lot tougher.", "Right now, I would say it\u2019s not tougher than it was back in \u201901 or \u201902; it was tough then. We expect it will get tougher, even the math, but not yet. And I think that, may be 2010 is where you will experience more of that rental decline and vacancy increase. But we think through \u201909, the numbers we gave out previously in terms of expected occupancy and average mark-to-market throughout the year and vacancy levels, we think those are in the right ballpark.", "Brendan Maiorana - Wachovia", "Thank you for that.", "Steve Durels", "Let me just add some Marc\u2019s comments because I think it will be useful to give people a little bit of color in understanding to how some of this stats come out. As everybody throws around the current vacancy, and too frequently people confuse that with what\u2019s called the availability rate in the market, and depending on which brokerage firm you are talking to, both numbers are thrown around.", "To understand the market right now, the current vacancy is between sublease and direct space that\u2019s vacant. In midtown, it\u2019s about 9% in total. By contrast, the availability rate, and what\u2019s that availability means is space that is yet to become vacant but has been marketed and depending on whose sketch you are looking at is anywhere from space available in the next 6 to all the way out 18 months. And that number right now by most accounts is somewhere between 11% and 12% available space that\u2019s been marketed.", "Some of ad space maybe converted over to spaces that are renewed by those tenants but I think it\u2019s useful to differentiate between availability and vacancy. And as far as meeting the mark-to-market, couple things, in the availability rate right now 70% of the space that\u2019s on the market through the availability rate is for space that\u2019s 50,000 square feet or larger.", "And if look at our portfolio, the number of spaces that we are really dealing with that are that size, this is really a handful of spaces spread around throughout 24 million square feet. That\u2019s really testament to the fact that over the last year, year and half, we were very vigilant just trying to renew a lot of our big tenants that were rolling between 2009 and 2010.", "That last point is just to drive home where rates have declined, and fairly they have declined over a period of time, 12 months, we were way ahead of the market as far as dropping our rents and have continued to do so. So I think we've really taken the lead as far as the market goes, as far as adjusting or asking rents, and therefore are expected taking rents. And that too has served us well as far as being able to keep the portfolio full.", "Brendan Maiorana - Wachovia", "Thank you. Can you, may be you can't really do this because it\u2019s your portfolio, but give a sensitivity of if vacancy moves either to the plus side or the down side by 100 or 200 basis points, what that might mean for your portfolio in terms of rental rate achievement growth?", "Steve Durels", "I think it's impossible to quantify because it's so specific as to which submarkets and then what size space and therefore which building. The impact of available space coming in on Gra Mar Building versus available space in at 1350 Avenue of the Americas could be widely the different. In that case, it could how big a piece of space; is it built; is it not built; is it big; is it small? So I think it's virtually impossible for anybody to give you a clear answer.", "Brendan Maiorana - Wachovia", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ian Weissman from Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.", "Ian Weissman - Merrill Lynch", "Yes, good afternoon. Just two questions. You talked about taking impairments for your structured finance business outside of New York. If we think about some of these loans like on Tarrytown Ownership retail components, 666, I mean, what would be the trigger points for you to consider impairing these loans?", "Marc Holliday", "Andrew, do you want to take those, you are closest to.", "Andrew Mathias", "Sure, I think we monitor all the positions carefully and Tarrytown Ownership has indicated publicly that they intend to contribute additional equity to the project. And if that situation changes obviously that\u2019d be good reason to take a closer look there but we track property performance and sort of sponsor this attitude and what the public will say about their investments.", "You know certainly 666, an investment we made last summer, is one we still feel very comfortable with. The bulk of the investment decision that was made around the lease with Abercrombie & Fitch which was executed, so most of the speculative lease-up component of that investment is completed.", "There is some additional leasing to do with property, but I think we\u2019re still very comfortable with our bases in that property, but we evaluate each of the investments quarterly and try and project where current values and current market metrics are in each of these different markets and where impairments call for.", "Ian Weissman - Merrill Lynch", "Okay.", "Greg Hughes", "Ian, that\u2019s one of the reasons why we have the drop down in a range of guidance.", "Ian Weissman - Merrill Lynch", "Right", "Greg Hughes", "So we continue to evaluate how sponsors are going to behave, what\u2019s happening with the values, that you could see some additional reserves if we go into 2009.", "Ian Weissman - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. This might be another question for Andy. You guys in the past have been known to test the market for asset sales. Clearly, it\u2019s not the environment for that, but there was a recent press article which talked about potential deal on 485 Lexington, I would say a pretty healthy number.", "Can you just talk about that asset in particular or are there other assets that you think you could test the market in \u201809 and so?", "Steve Durels", "Sure, sure. We are looking carefully at the portfolio. And obviously assets that have relatively healthy amounts in place asset level leverage are most attractive candidates for sale. In the case of 485, Lexington we put on new ten-year fix rate financing in the beginning of 2007, still see a significant term left on that financing. I think we are constantly in discussions with different market participants, both on JV, on a sale basis on the different assets.", "And it's really just a question of when a buyer is of like mind with as the seller, we have not there yet on 485 or some of the other assets that we are talking about. But those are certainly the assets; we are focusing on this market environment, although that has highest levels of in place asset level financing, because going and getting new financing so difficult for buyers unless the sellers providing.", "Ian Weissman - Merrill Lynch", "I mean the article suggested that this asset could achieve 600 bucks of food. I mean, is there a market for asset to this probably $600 for the New York City of today?", "Steve Durels", "I have to tell, because nothing is traded. We have very high quality assets with a high quality tenant roster and a great, very in the money, in place first mortgage, but we would fetch those kinds of numbers.", "Ian Weissman - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Steve Durels", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed, sir.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Thank you. I had a question regarding the G&A, I think Greg you went over it quickly. I didn't get all the detail there, but may be Marc, could you just give us a little bit of color. I don't know if the decision was joint or several, but the decision of management team members was to relinquish or cancel some of the options that were granted.", "Marc Holliday", "Well, it was a decision that everybody thought made sense given they were so far out of the money, as we sit today. They were a very significant expense on earnings and people were willing inclusive of myself, all the executive management teams, Steve, Andrew, Greg and others, just turn the back with the recognition that they may or may not be worth something in the next 8, 9 or 10 years because those are typically 10 year options.", "But again the cost to the company was so severe for something that as it said today was so far at the money that as part of looking at year end and looking at establishing a new run rate MG&A for \u201809 and beyond. We thought it make sense to just turn those back and rather than do I think what some other companies are either doing or looking at exchanging, buying back, re-pricing, we\u2019re doing anything as a like, we thought it was easiest to just keep it simple, hand them back to the company really reflective of at least what current value seemed to be and just keep going from there.", "And I think the company will experience a big benefit from that part of the G&A savings is from that non-cash options in OPP that have been turned back and I think that was inflating our MG&A to levels that people on the street were interpreting to be out of whack and I think when you look at it, it was because our stock price had risen so much, we were a little bit of victim of our own success.", "The more our stock price rose, the higher MG&A went in a non-cash sense and in the accounting sense. And as a result, when the price came all the way back down, we didn\u2019t get that same relief on issued options and we thought that turning back made sense. So, that\u2019s the rational behind them.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "So, was this like did everybody follow yours and Steve\u2019s lead over the sort of a mandatory decision. None of the options\u2026..", "Marc Holliday", "No. It was purely voluntary. In other words, there was no mandate. I talked to people, I gave them the choice to do it or not do it. It was only done at with a small percentage of the firm, but where many of the options were held. And people I think universally didn\u2019t blink an eye. They saw the merit in it and did it, but it was not mandatory in that course.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Greg do you maybe, what\u2019s the accounting on that. I don\u2019t understand why there'd be an expense if you are reversing an option that you have already.", "Greg Hughes", "They are two separate exercises. So, what required to do on both the OPP plan and the options is when those are issued there is a differed cost that set up its amortized over the investing period. So, when those become cancelled unfortunately that costs even though obviously concluded non-cash doesn\u2019t go away all of those differed unamortized costs need to be immediately expensed, which is what we did during the quarter and that\u2019s the $18 million that you saw come through.", "The offsetting that was through 930 both Green and Gramercy, we had accrued and send the compensation to a certain level in anticipation of where we might end up for the year. Those accruals through 930 turned out to be higher than it was necessary given based upon really actual bonuses ended up. So, you had some of those reversing or offsetting that $80 million charge, which is why if you look at our reconciliation table, we have kind of a net at those two or roughly $12 million that were heading back as recurring G&A related.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "And it\u2019s perfect. My follow-up is just on the repurchases you did in 2009, I know you said it\u2019s $86 million. How are those split between the 2010s and 2012s?", "Gregory Hughes", "You have to wait until next quarter to say, because it creates competition for the repurchase of those. So we will disclose at the end of the first quarter.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Could you talk about given, the focus on maintaining liquidity, the soft process behind retiring some or actually going after some of the 2012s given sort of the maturities you get?", "Gregory Hughes", "It\u2019s sort of circular, Jordon, you are retaining liquidity to pay off recourse indebtedness to some extent. So using liquidity to pay off recourse indebtedness particularly at discounts and pretty attractive prices, Is not something we look at as depleting our liquidity. It\u2019s what the liquidity is there for us now. At least the way we look at it, others may differ and choose into other things with their liquidity.", "But what I went through earlier today was the various steps we are taking and various significant steps we are taking with dividend, MG&A, and capital, all oriented towards embellishing what\u2019s already a pretty sizeable cash balance for the near-term retirement recourse debts. So, it is using liquidity but it\u2019s using liquidity for what it has to be used for a repack and that\u2019s just our philosophy. Others may differ with us but that\u2019s how we do it.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Now that makes sense.", "Gregory Hughes", "Okay.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Thank you.", "Gregory Hughes", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee from Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed.", "John Guinee - Stifel Nicolaus", "John Guinee here. Very nice job gentlemen. Three questions squeezed into two. One, should we expect, going forward, to see debt gains to be offset by impairment charges for the structure finance portfolio? And then, is there an earnest money deposit on 55 Corporate Drive, and is that a 100% assured of closing?", "And then Andrew, what's the status to the best of your knowledge on 1540 Broadway pricing buyer, valuation metrics etcetera?", "Marc Holliday", "Andrew, why don\u2019t you hit those two first on 55, and I don\u2019t know what you can and can't say about 1540.", "Andrew Mathias", "Sure. 55 Corporate, we do have a non-refundable earnest money deposit and that closing is preceding a pace, obviously complicated by the fact that it\u2019s a securitized mortgage and it\u2019s a servicer. So those approvals can be laborious. But we expect to complete that sale and certainly in the first quarter.", "On 1540, there\u2019s been nothing sort of official in the market. There is been a bunch of articles with speculation. We do, we know at the rumored price of $375 million or so on our numbers that would represent to 5.5% going in cap rate. There is some significant vacancy that asset has had a quite bit of vacancy for a long period of time. If you lease up the vacancy, you probably stabilizing between 7% and 8%.", "I think the buyer there is likely modeling exit cap rates in the 6%, 6.5% range in order to make sort of the mid-teens IRRs that buy after are supposedly expecting today. So, clearly if the sale happens, the headline per foot is deceptive. It\u2019s an office condo. There is no retail. The retail was sold to a different company. There is a significant amount of vacancy, a 193,000 square feet.", "So, the basis per foot going in, is going to increase substantially is that vacant space is leased and there is no retail associated with it and we would call it, we would be encouraged to see somebody purchase it on this basis and we modeling those, those kind of exit cap rates in order to make their anticipated investment returns.", "John Guinee - Stifel Nicolaus", "Great and Greg.", "Greg Hughes", "The gains on the bonds and reserves on the structured book are not tied at all nor could they be. I mean if you look at the guidance, we did say in the Investors Day presentation that there are reserves, net of promotes and gains, so there is certainly was a contemplation and it\u2019s a contemplation that you would see some bond gains and possibly some miscellaneous promotes and those would be offset or maybe offset in part by additional reserves, but the two are certainly are not tied together.", "John Guinee - Stifel Nicolaus", "Great, thank you.", "Greg Hughes", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Charles from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "Vincent Charles - Deutsche Bank", "Hi. Just a question on the structured finance portfolio, I'm trying to understand in terms of the repayments or the maturity that are doing due in \u201809. What your expectations are around those maturities and do you expect any repayments to result from those?", "Andrew Mathias", "Yes, and I think, certainly we do expect some repayments, many of the maturities are initial maturities with extension options. In that case, we will fully expect borrowers to avail themselves of their extension options. And, as far as the final maturities that occur, we will carefully evaluate those on a case-by-case basis.", "And where we feel, either the sponsor is willing to invest additional capital to sort of reinforce his equity interest in the asset; we may evaluate extending our positions. And if they are not, then we may ask to be taken out. We have done both with maturating positions, thus far.", "Marc Holliday", "Just to elaborate on that, so I\u2019ve got the sheet in front of me here, Vincent. As Andrew said, whether it's paid off or restructuring extended is a function of sometimes how, and of what posture we want to take to a particular situation. I would say, I would hope at a minimum that most of what comes do this year.", "We would be in a position to restructure an extent. So, you may not see payoffs. You may see paydowns. You may see enhanced terms. You may see a 123456, looks like that eight or nine or so, potentials. You may be you will see one or two payoffs, but I think you are much more likely to see either as of right extensions as Andrew alluded to.", "Andrew Mathias", "Yes. Many of those nine are as of right extensions.", "Marc Holliday", "Many of as of right, but even if they are not as of right, you may see extensions with pay downs and kicked up rates and you may see a couple of payrolls. So, I think in terms of forecasting liquidity from a bad batch of this year's maturities, whether it will be initial or final maturity, I would think about it in those terms.", "Vincent Charles - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Can you just give us a sense of this? It looked like maybe 175 maturing in \u201909, what percent of that has got our first maturity versus final?", "Marc Holliday", "What percent our initial maturities?", "Vincent Charles - Deutsche Bank", "Yes, exactly.", "Marc Holliday", "You know what; I think that one we\u2019d have to call you back on because we\u2019d have to go through each one. The sheet I\u2019m looking at doesn\u2019t make that extension, so.", "Vincent Charles - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. On the 68 million that\u2019s held for sale at the moment, can you give some color on what sort of the status of those sales, are they just initially starting or you close to?", "Andrew Mathias", "It\u2019s across the board. We did a significant amount of marketing and for all which resulted in the close sales which we disclosed today and there are other sales where we\u2019d like to identify buyers and then when we close in process. Many of our investments sit behind securitized loans or as I mentioned in 55 Corporate does involve the sort of the first mortgage, approving the transfer as well and then a lot of, we\u2019re initiating new conversations, additional assets which moved out for sale this quarter.", "Vincent Charles - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Is that a continuous process?  Could that go up from 68 million or have you looked through the portfolio and that\u2019s kind of what you\u2019re looking to do this year?", "Andrew Mathias", "No, I think it definitely could go up just based on asset level developments, borrower level developments, a lot of different factors. But as I said, we\u2019re evaluating all our positions, debt and equity sort of continuously and trying to find pockets of opportunity out there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citi. Please proceed.", "Michael Bilerman - Citi", "Hi, good afternoon. Marc you talked a little bit about the proactive leasing you have done over the years to narrow down this year\u2019s maturity you said just under 1 million square feet. You talked a little bit about how you expect to have a very high renewal rate.", "Can you talk about the confidence that led you to that decision in terms of tenants being brought to some of the sublease space, with some direct vacancy, and then perhaps some of the tenant failures going on but also may be these tenants I want to take reduce their square footage? So, renewing but at a lower number just as you sort of look at that 1 million square feet this year.", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I think the confidence in the ability to renew is simply one I think they will be satisfied, two will be to meet the market, and three it\u2019s expensive to move and a lot of tenants today don\u2019t want to incur the cost to move in, they are landlords today who can\u2019t really afford to be too aggressively bring in the tenants.", "So, because of that, they were I think I mentioned this in December they were tenants who originally we thought were going to move, consolidate the other space, may be even other Green buildings, many of them came back to us and just said what rent do I have to pay to stay put. And we are seeing more and more of that.", "Your point about could that be consolidating is absolutely right. So the renewal rate for a tenant may be high that doesn\u2019t mean we are going to be able to renew in every case the entire footage, but also it\u2019s not only so simple to take smaller space which many of our tenants by number are smaller space tenants.", "Steve stated earlier that we don\u2019t have more than a handful of 50,000 foot and over maturities this year. So, we may be dealing with a lot of 510, 15,000 square foot spaces and we are not really always able to or desires of subdividing ad space. We may encourage a tenant to renew all the space and then look to sublet that portion which it doesn\u2019t need or the tenant will make to with the existing condition, but you are right we could be renewing for less in those instances.", "So the confidence factor there if I sound over the confident because it's hand-to-hand combat, you know that. But the confidence is, we are getting good results, the good results give you a level of confidence and two we have what I think are the right elements that are necessary to retain tenants.", "Now there are times that just can happen that tenants go out of business or move out of the city. That\u2019s unavoidable. But we don\u2019t expect to lose many tenants to other competing realtors.", "Michael Bilerman - Citi", "And just going back to the cancellation of the options and Marc over the years you have expressed a desire to pay people and retain talent and that\u2019s important to have those plans and to have those compensation levels.", "And I can understand why these things were so far out of the money it was a huge drag on reported earnings of some of the rationale of just giving them up. Can you talk about the other side of it of how you talk with the Board and how you talk with your management team about potential new plans that you\u2019re thinking about instituting and how you are thinking of awarding from here and out.", "Marc Holliday", "Well, there is no change in philosophy if that\u2019s what you are asking. I mean, we put OPP programs into place, the first one might have been \u201803 and I think we did \u201805 and \u201806. We elected not to put anything in place in \u201807 and \u201908.", "And the original intention was once per year, once every other year because they rolled ironically the \u201803 deal was still in the vesting period and whole management team, who was part of that \u201803 program that was a seven year deal. So, that\u2019s not even fully vested. That fully vest I guess next year in \u201910. 05 is in vesting period and the \u201806 plan has retired. Well, I guess its still technically, it will retire presumably [values] and many of those interest it can turn back.", "So, I\u2019d think that having people motivated primarily by the upside was what enabled me to amass the talent team that I have and put together, what I still believe today is the best New York City platform. It\u2019s the biggest by size, I think its best by product and that\u2019s why we regarded by people in this market, tenants, brokers as an exceptional team.", "So, a big part of that program was equity incentives on the upside, everyone including myself has now been formally and thoroughly introduced to equity participation on the downside, which is just a fact of life, is what our shareholders are experience, is what we as employees have experienced.", "But clearly a motivating factor in looking out over the next two, three, five years is the notion that if we do things right, that we'll able to participate in equity on the upside. And looking out in time OPP, options and restricted stock are always a part of compensation packages, they are just in these days at levels reflective of today's return to shareholders as opposed to where it was, when we were at very high prices.", "So, I don\u2019t think, philosophically, we get at it at the same way. The amounts were different, but I think the equity incentives are what keep morale and people motivated and hopefully the team together for the next three or five years. Are there any other questions or follow-up?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sloan Bohlen from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.", "Sloan Bohlen - Goldman Sachs", "Hi. Just one quick one for Greg and Andrew. I\u2019m thinking about write-downs and structured finance portfolio going forward. I think Greg, you mentioned that the debt yield on the portfolios around a low 6% last quarter. And likely that was lower because of lease-up in lot of the assets that the loans were on. Were those the types of situations that you\u2019re writing down or was it mostly just non-New York versus New York assets?", "Andrew Mathias", "It was certainly focused on non-New York assets where we see the most value diminution and the asset types, the lease-up has not occurred the way it has and New York asset has projected and the markets are significantly softer than New York\u2019s market, so that\u2019s how I would summarize it, Greg.", "Greg Hughes", "Yes, I don\u2019t think that those numbers have changed dramatically as a result of the reserves and/or dispositions. We obviously moved some of the more liquid positions. And as we have said a couple of times focused heavily on reserving on some outside of New York is naturally, and those were assets that don\u2019t form the category stuff that we would be interested in owning which is a very different exercise when we look at the New York portfolio.", "Sloan Bohlen - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thanks.", "Marc Holliday", "That's it, operator?", "Operator", "At this time, there are no further questions in queue.", "Marc Holliday", "Thank you all for calling today and we look forward to speaking with you next time. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you for participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

This conference call is being recorded.", "At this time the company would like to remind the listeners that during the call management may make forward-looking statements.  Actual results may differ from predictions that management may take today.  Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the company's Form 10-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "Also during today's conference call the company may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC Regulation G.  The GAAP financial measures most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure discussed and reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on the company's website at www.slgreen.com, by selecting the press release regarding the company's second quarter earnings.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Marc Holliday, Chief Executive Officer of SL Green Realty Corp.  (Operator Instructions).  Go ahead Mr. Holliday.", "Marc Holliday", "", "We recently concluded a pivotal quarter in which substantial progress was made towards addressing our near term debt maturities while producing solid operating results in our real estate portfolio.  More than two years into what is arguably the worst downturn we have faced in the past 30, we have taken affirmative actions to stabilize our assets while reducing our liabilities and increasing our cash liquidity.", "While more challenges lie ahead, I believe that steps we have taken to preserve and raise capital better positions the company to be a net beneficiary of the market upturn that will inevitably occur.  The extent to which we will look to take advantage of key market opportunities will be guided largely by where we believe we are in the cycle relative to underlying market fundamentals.", "To that end we continue to see a receding in the panic and fear that gripped much of New York's financial services industry during 2008 and early 2009 with certain commercial and investment banks returning to profitability for the second quarter in a row.", "We are also beginning to see a slowing in the pace of contributed sublet space.  The rate of job losses appears to be declining according to New York City budget data and there is evidence of financial firms with relatively stronger balance sheets capitalizing on the opportunities presented by the market, resulting in sporadic new hirings and a realignment in power among New York's major financial firms.", "The average of available statistics show that the vacancy rate has risen to approximately 12% to 12.5% with sublet space comprising approximately 4.5% of that total, near its historic highs.  The rental correction over the past 12 to 18 months has been sharp and painful for all landlords.  But I believe we will see evidence of a bottoming in 2010 which would be consistent with the long end of the range of peak-to-trough cycles when compared with prior economic downturns.", "The rental reductions only partly evidenced by rate declines are further evidenced by significant increase in tenant allowances which have to be competitive with turnkey sublet space in this market.  From a landlord perspective owners will continue to be divided among two camps, those like SL Green that can shoulder the burden of temporary but increased capital expenditures to maintain occupancy and those that can't.  Many of whom will ultimately wind up losing their properties to their lenders.", "However I am confident that for the first category of owners who have the financial wherewithal to press ahead in this market, we will be rewarded in future years when most competitive sublet space has been eliminated or reabsorbed into the market.  And landlords again will be able to curtail tenant concessions and increase rents in a recovering market.", "You can see the strategy playing out in SL Green's own portfolio where over 500,000 square feet of leases were signed during the quarter with the majority of that in mid-town Manhattan at rental levels that are more than 20% above replacement rents.", "Notably, we maintain our occupancy at 96.2% as of quarter end, albeit holding occupancy required us to grant higher levels of tenant concessions for both new and renewal tenants.  However, even in this market the existing landlord still has the decided advantage with existing tenants due to a general desire for tenants to want to make deals with existing landlords and avoid disruption and moving costs associated with business relocations.", "That effort goes into maintaining our occupancy base and pricing advantage in this market is only partially told by the occupancy statistics.  A lot of the work happens behind the scenes as we work with existing tenants to manage the reoccupation of sublet space in an orderly manner so as not to give rise to excessive competition for space within our own buildings.", "With 24 million square feet owned in Manhattan and 7 million square feet more owned in the suburbs this is a massive undertaking, but one in which our leasing and management teams have risen to the challenge and our outperformance will become even more notable in future quarters when the market finally bottoms out.", "Not to be outdone, and consistent with the competitive spirit we try to foster within SL Green, the suburban division delivered in a very big way this quarter with total lease volume of 217,000 square feet signed in 31 deals, the highest volume quarter since been being affiliated with SL Green.", "The mark-to-market on that leasing activity was a muscular 0.8% but positive is positive in this market, and we were very pleased with that result.  The most notable transaction was a deal signed with ConEd Solutions in Valhalla right at the end of the quarter.  ", "Important to note that this deal literally began as a cold call  one year ago and was brought to its conclusion in part given SL Green's strong relationships and buying power on the utilities side, aggregated between New York City and the suburbs.", "Notwithstanding vacancy rates of upwards of 20% in Westchester and 18% in Connecticut, the suburban portfolio weighs in at a 90% occupancy rate, and my hat's off to the folks in our White Plains office for holding up their end of the bargain in this very tough economic climate.", "Advancements with the balance sheet is another area of achievement where progress accelerated during the second quarter.  Over the last nine months we have reduced SL Green's balance sheet leverage by over $1 billion through a combination of early and scheduled debt retirement.", "This sizable amount of de-leveraging was funded through cash on hand, asset sales and a reduction in dividend.  Gains on this activity have exceeded $150 million making the de-leveraging not only prudent but economically attractive during these difficult times. ", "However, we recognize that given reduced rents in our market and asset value declines that a further reduction in our indebtedness is necessary to get to a targeted debt-to-EBITDA multiple of approximately eight times EBITDA going forward.", "We have a plan that I believe is readily executable to achieve this goal which consists of deploying some, but not all, of our cash on hand for further corporate debt reduction, combined with certain secured refinancings which will produce excess proceeds, significant internal cash flow as a result of the reduced dividend, and potential additional asset sales that will create liquidity and also reduce balance sheet indebtedness meaningfully.", "That game plan which was executable but tight one quarter ago became much more manageable with the completed equity raise in the amount of $400 million during the second quarter.  A very difficult, but ultimately correct, decision by management and the board of directors to execute a significant, but right-sized amount of equity to address all corporate debt concerns that we believe is prudent through 2013.", "The offering was well received by both existing and new shareholders, and on a relative basis SL Green stock has significantly outperformed the REIT Index since the date of issuance.", "Turning now to another strategic objective discussed at the outset of the year, we have reduced our structured finance balances from approximately $1 billion to just over $600 million in the past six months through a combination of loan sales, pay downs and loan reserves.", "The single largest contributor to the loan reserves this quarter was the sale of the single mezzanine note.  This type of sale, which was done to generate capital as opposed to mitigate underlying credit risk, will be de-emphasized going forward due to SL Green's materially improved balance sheet position.", "Loan loss reserves, which peaked in the fourth quarter of 2008, have trended downward in Q1 and Q2, and I expect that downward trend to continue in subsequent quarters.  At this point in time, over 80% of the remaining book is located in Manhattan, with under 20% held for sale in markets outside of New York City.", "In fact, we are now looking at the remaining positions we have in Manhattan assets as a source of potential growth and opportunity as we have several positions in Manhattan office buildings, encompassing nearly 10 million square feet, a potential pipeline at average debt yields in the range of 6.5 to 7%.", "I would fully expect that certain of these positions will be foreclosed upon, providing SL Green with the ability to reposition and approve these underlying properties such that future gains will be realized either through incremental NOI, if we decide to hold those assets, or through gain on sale if we ultimately decide to dispose of those assets in better markets.", "All in all, it was a good quarter.  Still however, our headlines will be dominated over the next few quarters by a lack of credit in the market and the excess sublet inventory.  I would continue to encourage everybody to watch for improvement in these two key metrics as a leading indication of market inflection which has not yet occurred but draws nearer and nearer.", "With that, let me turn it over to Andrew Mathias.", "Andrew W. Mathias", "The standoff between buyers and sellers continues in the Manhattan market with a couple of notable exceptions.  The Worldwide Plaza sale closed within the last few weeks which was the last of the EOP assets to trade out of Deutsche Bank.", "Deutsche did provide seller financing in that sale.  However, this sale does demonstrate a well-capitalized buying group comprised of family and opportunity fund money was prepared to take on upwards of 600,000 square feet of leasing risk in this market and write a check we estimate at upwards of $200 million of cash equity.", "The other notable property on the market at the moment is a sale lease-back on a major financial institution on Fifth Avenue.  This offering also drew considerable buyer interest and is reportedly close to going to contract after getting bids in excess of from 20 or so different groups.", "Both these deals have large elements of vacant space giving us insight into the buyer's mindset that rents have at a minimum stabilized if not these buyers are undoubtedly projecting a rental recovery in the near-term which they'll be leasing this vacant space into.", "There continues to be a broad-based group of buyers, both foreign and domestic, looking for bargains in Manhattan.  As we've entertained various proposals with respect to 485 Lexington, we've seen first-hand this eclectic mix.", "This depth keeps us very confident about the market's ultimate recovery.  However, we don't see a breaking of this log jam until credit in size returns to the market.  Health and other programs to date have not had any measurable impact on the market and until there's a return of financing on a large scale, it's difficult to see buyers and sellers have a meeting of the minds.", "Our own activity for the quarter consisted of our sale of mezzanine and equity interests in 1166 Sixth Avenue and a new structure finance investment in 1330 Sixth Avenue.  First the sale, we sold an 11-year instrument at approximately a 15% return to the buyer.  The charge-off we took on the loan was solely related to a mark-to-market discount on the note, as the purchaser is underwriting a power of recovery on the loan at maturity.", "While we felt the note represented an attractive risk return, the duration profile was a bit long for SL Green, and the sale freed up capital to pursue more opportunistic investing whether in our own balance sheet or external investment activity.  As Marc indicated, it's unlikely we'll be selling further positions in the near future as we're nearing our core group of assets we've either targeted for hold to maturity or foreclosure.  ", "During the quarter, we also bought an interest in the mortgage at 1330 Sixth Avenue.  This building was recently foreclosed by a mezzanine lender who stepped into the ownership shoes and is continuing the full building redevelopment undertaken by prior ownership.  We're the special servicer on the loan now, and this represents a good example of the types of opportunities we see going forward as the market presents us with unique situations where we can utilize our debt and special servicing expertise to get involved in troubled capital structures.", "To this end, during the quarter, we received our second formal rating on our special servicing business, adding Fitch's CSS2 rating.  SLG is one of only 17 servicers in the country to attain that rating and the only equity REIT on the list.", "Additionally, Standard & Poor's upgraded our rating to their select list of servicers during the quarter.  We're finding this business to be a valuable source of information in addition to a profitable enterprise for the company.", "We're actively tracking quite a number of these developing situations as loans hurtle toward maturity and we intend on using a small and prudent portion of our balance sheet to pursue the best of these opportunities as we did this quarter.", "And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Greg to take you through the numbers.", "Gregory F. Hughes", "During the quarter, we were able to make good progress in strengthening our balance sheet and continuing the deleveraging process.  The highlight for the quarter was of course the equity raise which netted us $387.3 million.", "As we laid out in the marketing materials for that raise, we sized this offering based upon our belief that there were other sources of liquidity within our portfolio.  A number of these sources were realized during the second quarter, with the $40 million upsize of the 625 Madison loan, the $58.5 million realized from the sale of structured finance and the $55 million of internally generated cash flow after deducting the payment of the newly established dividend from our second quarter FAD.", "In addition, through the vigorous pursuit of our contractual rights, we were able to obtain an additional $30 million of fundings under our credit facility which had been previously withheld by one of the participants.", "During the quarter, we also signed a term sheet with an insurance company for the refinancing of our 420 Lexington property, which we expect to close during the third quarter.  The term sheet calls for a seven-year, $145 million loan that bears interest at 7.5% with two one-year extensions and a 30-year amortization schedule.", "This loan will replace the existing $108.5 million mortgage that bears interest at 8.44%.  This financing helps demonstrate that even in the worst of credit markets, our buildings can get refinanced and in certain instances generate incremental liquidity.", "Similarly, we were pleased to have a major pension fund provide us with $40 million of incremented financing at 625 Madison Avenue for six years which resulted in a blended rate on that loan of approximately 7.22%.", "As Marc mentioned, since last October, we have repaid $1 billion of debt including $700 million of which has been repaid here in 2009.  Our combined debt load for the year has been reduced by almost 9%, with our average debt maturity being extended by about five years to closer to 5.5 years.", "Through our bond buy-back program which was commenced in October 2008, we have repurchased $732 million of bonds.  It is worth noting that the new convert accounting allows us to recognize only $155.2 million of gains when in reality the company has saved approximately $200 million, having achieved these repurchases with only $532.7 million of cash.", "Despite our concerted efforts to simplify our business and provide detailed disclosure, our debt-to-EBITDA multiple remains a great mystery to the Street with estimates ranging anywhere from about 10 times to more than 27 times.", "Much of the confusion seems to occur as a result of the GAAP presentation of our JV interests and depreciation.  We would refer people to page 12 of our supplemental where, with a little simple math, you can help put an end to this great mystery.", "Here, it is easy to calculate EBITDA for the six months ended June 30, 2009.  Here you can see that our consolidated properties generated $257.4 million of NOI, our share of our JV properties generated $108 million of NOI.  Our structured finance portfolio generated $32.4 million of NOI.  And we had other income of $29.4 million of NOI.", "It caused us to run the company $35.9 million of G&A, leaving us in EBITDA amount for the first six months of $391.3 million.  Our combined debt at June 30th is clearly set forth there at $6.85 billion, and when you net the $377 million of cash on balance sheet, which would be used to retire debt, our net debt balance is $6.475 billion.  With a little annualization of this EBITDA number, one can see that the EBITDA multiple is 8.3 times and when one backs that out, the straight line rent included in these earnings numbers, it is 9.15 times, a far cry from 27 at the high end of the range.  ", "Much has also been written regarding the appropriate debt-to-EBITDA multiple at which REITs should operate.  Of course, this one-shoe-fits-all approach to the real estate is hardly appropriate, as it is a unique and complicated asset class.  ", "For example, 20% of our combined net debt resides in two assets, One Madison Avenue and 388-390 Greenwich.  These assets are fully occupied with net-type leases to credit tenants that have an average remaining lease term of 11.5 years.  Such assets naturally lend themselves to a higher leverage point, which need not be a bad thing, if structured appropriately with some amortization and long-dated maturities.  The average remaining maturity on these financings is 9.8 years.  ", "Interestingly enough, the EBITDA multiple that we just calculated would drop from 8.3 times to 7.7 times if these two assets were excluded.  This may be one of the reasons that our targeted EBITDA multiple is higher than others.  ", "Turning to the P&L, it was a solid quarter, particularly for our core operations.  We were able to maintain our Manhattan occupancy at 96.2% with gains at 100 Park, 1350 Sixth Ave, 485 Lexington and 420 Lexington offsetting scheduled lease expirations at 750 Third.  ", "As Marc mentioned, we continue to see an uptick in PI dollars, which average $53 for the quarter.  This increase was most notable at 461 Fifth Avenue and 1350 Sixth where we made use of our pre-build strategy.  The pre-built attracted a number of high-quality tenants and these installations often last well beyond their initial lease terms.  ", "Notwithstanding the tough operating environment, our same store NOI continued to grow, posting an increase of 2.1% increase for the quarter.  Note that these results were achieved inclusive of $2.5 million in additional receivable reserves, which were recorded during the quarter.  These reserves were not necessarily related to tenant-specific collection issues, but rather a precautionary approach to a challenge operating environment.  ", "Our structured financing comes for the quarter was down approximately $1.5 million this quarter versus last quarter, as a result of lower LIBOR and one additional loan that was placed on non-accrual.  During the quarter we recorded reserves of $45.6 million against three structured finance positions, the largest of which was $38.5 million resulting from the decision to sell 1166 Sixth Ave mezzanine position.  With the successful sale of 1166, we also made the decision to hold to maturity another New York asset, which was removed from held for sale at quarter end.  ", "To summarize, at 6-30 we have 4 assets held for sale with a carrying value of approximately $73.8 million and 25 assets which we intend to hold into maturity with a carrying value of $534.5 million or total structured book of $608.3.  ", "Our other income for the second quarter includes approximately $4.8 million of incentive fees which became recognizable with the sale of the Mack-Green joint venture.  This sale also enabled us to eliminate $49 million of combined mortgage debt.  Our MG&A for the quarter was $17.9 million, which is consistent with the first quarter of this year and keeps us on pace for a 30% reduction over 2008.  ", "This over $30 million of projected savings has been principally achieved through the reduction of incentive-based compensation, as well as headcount reductions and cost-containment methods.  ", "Interest expense for the quarter was down $3.4 million reflecting the benefits of our deleveraging efforts as well as lower LIBOR.  ", "As we head into the second half of the year, there are several items to keep in mind when projecting our earnings.  The weighted average shares for the third and fourth quarter will be approximately 79 million shares, representing a full quarter's impact of the May equity raise.  There is, as we've discussed historically, some seasonality to our operating expenses, which generally run higher in the third quarter summer months. ", " As previously announced, Citigroup will be vacating approximately 193,000 square feet at our 34th Street property during the third quarter.  As Andrew mentioned, we may foreclose on selected structured finance assets or we may be required to take some additional structured finance reserves.  ", "Also during the first half of the year we have benefited from historically low LIBOR rates and we will incur a certain defeasance cost associated with the payment of the 420 Lexington loan.  Given consideration to these variables, we are reaffirming our FFO guidance of $4.35 to $4.50 a share for 2009.  ", "And with that I would like to turn it back to Marc for some closing comments.", "Marc Holliday", "We will hold off on closing comments.  First, I am going to go straight to questions, operator.  It's 2:30 so we have left some additional time for some questions if there are any from the listeners.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", " (Operator Instructions).  Our first question comes from James Feldman \u2013 Bank of America.  ", "James Feldman \u2013 Bank of America", "Marc, you talked about how it seems like the market may be nearing a bottom.  Can you just give us an update on what you saw in the second quarter in terms of the type of demand from users that maybe you haven't seen thus far this cycle?  And then also the types of space that was been given back in terms of sectors and types of companies? ", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I can take you through some of my observations here with Steve Durels also, who can chime in and add to that, but whereas we saw, what I recall sharp contraction in financial services through almost all of '08 and again first month, two or three in '09.  That sharp contraction is much more mollified right now.  I don't want to say it's gone, but it's not nearly as forceful as it was for that sort of 15-month period.  So that unto itself is the basis for a lot of my speculation that we may be nearing the bottom.  ", "In terms of new activity, what we are seeing is expansion in selected healthier firms who are picking up business lines, divisions, resources from some of the companies that had to shed and as a result, there is movement and expansion that we're seen in certainly within some of these consulting firms, accounting firms, law firms, certain hedge funds that we see are sort of back in the market, whereas there were a void there for six months or so.  I would say those service industries which have been sidelined for much of the year are kind of sporadically back.  ", "I don't want to say with any kind of a forcefulness.  The vacancy rates did increase quarter-to-quarter, so we still heading in the wrong direction.  It's just with less velocity and because of that we are seeing in our own portfolio and we think the market generally, signs that we are near a bottom.  It's the best feeling and pulse we have for it is it kind of feels like the ebb that we've noticed in two or three prior cycles where you're not yet there but heading in the right direction.  Steve, do you want to add to that?", "Steven M. Durels", "", "I'll add to it.  The big takeaway on it is we're not seeing demand by any one industry.  It's a lot of different industries.  In addition to the list that Marc provided, we are seeing demand from education groups.  We are seeing demand from governments and a lot of general, basic line businesses.  It's not just law firms.  It's not just financial services the way you heard us talk about it a couple years ago.  ", "Specific deals, we saw, deals that were done in our building at 750 Third Avenue was an accounting firm, Markum & Kliegman that was 67,000 feet.  There was a deal done with Gellar and Company on Third Avenue.  The Consulate General of Japan for a government deal.  Edison School just did a big sub-lease on Lexington Ave.  InBev which is Budweiser did a big deal on Park Ave.  So it's really pretty broad across the board.", "James Feldman \u2013 Bank of America", "", "Can you discuss your current bankruptcy watch list or credit watch list kind of how deep it goes right now?", "Marc Holliday", "", "Yes, we're going through that just before the call.  Depending on your point of view it's either not so bad or certainly worse than in any prior quarter we've had.  But still we have three tenants over 25,000 feet that are what I would call either in significant arrears or bankrupt.  And that's out of, God, 1,000 tenants in total.  I don't know how many of those are over 25,000 feet, but there are three that are currently in that camp.  When we drill down to top 10 the tenth biggest tenant that fits that category is 4,000 feet.  ", "So we've been very fortunate, I would say to date, at keeping our bad debt and/or bankruptcy or tenant litigation risk, material tenant litigations down to a very small percentage of our rent roll and of our lease space and I'd like to credit that to a number of things, anything from our proactive abilities at blending and extending people we think are survivors or cycling out of our properties companies we thought were not survivors, or just for tenants that have gone bad we've quickly replaced them in this market albeit at an increased cost.", "And as a result, we do have some work ahead of us with these tenants but I think anecdotally I would say this is probably a much more manageable watch list that we have in front of us now then many of our peers are dealing with.  And in part I think the strategy\u2013 our portfolio management strategies have paid off because I don't think we could've predicted, envisioned or prepared for a much worse market then we're currently in.", "Steven M. Durels", "", "Let me just add to that, there's one interesting stat because everybody always asks us, \"What do we do when we're confronted with the scenario that knocks on door and says, 'I need rent relief'?\"  How frequently are we doing that and how are we handling those situations?  Before the call we added up the total square footage of tenants where we've either provided rent relief in the form of deferral agreement which is essentially a short-term loan or a modest amount of rent reduction or, more frequently, an early lease renewal where we blend and extend it.", "That total square footage of deals that we've done year-to-date only covers 132,000 square feet, which I think is testimony to the fact that we've got a pretty strong portfolio.  ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of [Ian Wiseman] \u2013 ISI Group.", "[Ian Wiseman]\u2013 ISI Group", "", "Yes, good afternoon.  I was wondering if maybe you can, given the drop in rents in New York City, the dramatic drops in rent especially in the Plaza District.  Maybe you can talk a little bit how some of the fringe markets in mid-town will perform as tenants might seek out quality.  In particular your assets, let's say, in and around Grand Central.", "Marc Holliday", "", "Well, just out of curiosity are you referring to Grand Central as a core location or a fringe location?", "[Ian Wiseman]\u2013 ISI Group", "", "Well, I'm saying my assumption is that the Plaza District, which is probably some of the most desirable space in New York City, has seen rents drop about 50% and so the cost differential is no longer $125 bucks.  You could get space in the Plaza District for $50 or $60.  So we haven't seen that dramatic of a drop in rents I think in the fringe markets let's call Grand Central, Third Avenue, the West Side.  I just want to know how do you think your assets\u2013 or let's just put it, how do you think assets outside the Plaza District will perform in this market.  ", "Marc Holliday", "", "Got it, I'm going to refer to Grand Central as to Grand Central market and it is still a highly desirable market in our minds.  There has been a rent correction.  It's not 50%.  It didn't have the run up that the Plaza did.  It also doesn't have, let's say, the absolute top end class of inventory in general that Plaza District has, which is partially the reason that the run-up was so much more pronounced in Plaza then Grand Central.", "But I would say Grand Central which is our biggest submarket is performing reasonably well all things considered, meaning the buildings tend to be fairly well occupied.  Our biggest vacancies in that market is 100 Park Avenue which really has to do more with the redevelopment timing and warehouse space more than anything else which we are making great inroads with us as you've seen the leasing activity.", "Most recently, I don't know if it's been announced or not but \u2013", "Steven M. Durels", "", "Wells Fargo and then Aetna life insurance.", "Marc Holliday", "", "Aetna on the heels of that and ... sorry.", "Steven M. Durels", "", "And [ECT] which we closed for 20,000 feet a week ago.", "Marc Holliday", "", "We slipped to \u2013 a 20,000-footer slipped his mind but we just signed a 20,000-footer, [ECT], at 100 Park Avenue.  So there's good demand there, Graybar well leased and this is a great barometer for the Grand Central market.  So anyway Grand Central I would say hasn't experienced the rent declines that the Plaza has and velocity is good, and I think it's a stable market.  ", "Third Avenue, I would agree with you.  It's there's just a lot of inventory on Third Avenue, not necessarily because it's a fringe market.  I think you've had the culmination of a couple of big occupants on Third Avenue have just unfortunately at the same time put back a lot of space onto the market, be it in the form of teachers who probably led the charge here with how much entry.", "[Ian Wiseman]\u2013 ISI Group", "", "Let me just ask the question all the way, just I mean is it safe to assume that the Plaza District will recover faster than some of the other fringe markets or markets outside the Plaza District?  I don't want to call your markets fringe but other mid-town markets, just given the desirability of the locations?", "Steven M. Durels", "", "Let me address it this way.  It's dangerous if you look at a sub-market and sort of the general stats that get published the way you see the rents in the Plaza District.  It's important to remember that rents in the Plaza District rose the highest of any of the other sub markets in Manhattan driven largely by financial services and largely by the rents that were being asked and where leases were being signed for the top third of those buildings.", "There was a real night and day pricing difference between the top of the house versus the middle and the bottom of the house in a lot of the Plaza District buildings, and if you take a couple of our buildings in that district like 810 Seventh or 1350 Avenue of the Americas, you saw there was a short period of time where there was astronomical increases in rents driven largely by financial services as those industries went for the best rents and it got very competitive.", "And when that part of the market disappeared, you've had a huge price correction.  So I think we're now seeing good demand in that market and at the same time during the whole the chaos of the past seven or eight months, Grand Central, Third Avenue and the rest of the mid-town market has still treaded pretty decently.", "[Ian Wiseman]\u2013 ISI Group", "", "And finally, I think it's a very impressive feat that you guys have been able to maintain occupancy at 96% in this environment.  Marc, if you said that you're going to bottom or at least the market's going to bottom sometime in 2010, what is your expectation for where your occupancy will end at that bottom?", "Marc Holliday", "", "Where Green's occupancy will end?", "[Ian Wiseman]\u2013 ISI Group", "", "Green's, yes.", "Marc Holliday", "", "Well, I'm hopeful not to lose more than a point a year of occupancy, so I think we're holding to our projection of 95% at year end although it certainly would appear that we have a chance of exceeding that at this point.  And unstated but I think it would be fair to extrapolate somewhere around 94%-ish next year if things are sort of consistent with the views that I expressed.  If they are a lot worse then it could be lower than that and if it more quickly moderates in the second half of this year and next year then maybe we don't even touch 94% but I guess that would be my best guess at this moment.", "[Ian Wiseman]\u2013 ISI Group", "", "And that's against the backdrop of a market which could be at 15% availability, is that correct?", "Marc Holliday", "", "Yes, up to\u2013 and again, the availability verses vacancy.  I tend to quote vacancy.", "[Ian Wiseman]\u2013 ISI Group", "", "Okay.", "Marc Holliday", "There's a lot of conjecture in availability.  So right now working off of what I'm saying it's around 12, 12.5 now.  And maybe there's a couple hundred, 1 to 200 more points coming.  Then that would be consistent with the numbers I just said.", "Gregory Hughes", "", "Our leasing today is ahead of schedule.  And when you look at our 2010 expirations we only have around a million square feet of space actually expiring in 2010.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from J. Habermann \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "", "Jonathan Habermann \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "I'm here with [Sloan] as well.  Marc, you commented on reducing leverage and then Greg gave some specifics on sort of leverage and debt-to-EBITDA.  It sounds like you're sort of close to that target of eight times.  But I'm just curious how much you guys are thinking about in terms of asset sales, excess proceeds from refinancings, because you do have the benefit, obviously, of having reduced the dividend.  So you're saving a couple hundred million a year.  But should we expect to see much more in the way of de-leveraging over the next 12 months or so?", "Marc Holliday", "", "Well, there's two levels of de-leveraging.  There is one that I would say is almost certain, which is coming out of the cash on hand that we're holding, which I think Greg referred to and gave you some specific perimeters on how we intend to deploy that cash over and above the amount we intend to hold in corporate for general use and for growth.  So that amount, I think, is relatively certain.", "And then how much beyond to hit our target is sort of a function of what the EBITDA is going forward.  So I can't give you an exact number, but I would say if you run it through there's probably another $500 million to $900 million of reduction coming over the next two to three years which we would do either internally or just by way of example.", "If we sell a building like 485 Lex, which is a building we've off again-on again considered selling in this market, there's $450 million of balance sheet reduction in one fell swoop.  So we have to work through it to get to an exact number, but I think looking over a two to three-year period, out of cash flow, out of further asset sales, both the proceeds we get and the debt it relives us of, somewhere in the $500 million to $900 million range is probably a fair number.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup.", "Michael Bilerman\u2013 Citi", "I'm just continuing on the rent theme.  If you think about market\u2013 and you talked about trying to really push occupancy and sort of accepting what the market is in terms of higher inducement packages such as free rent.  But that you are going for term on those leases.  How do you think about, I guess, encumbering the portfolio with those net effective rents today under that duration and sort of what that means from a value perspective?", "Marc Holliday", "", "Well, fortunately we don't have a lot maturing annually as it relates to our whole.  So if we have 24 million, 23.5 million, 24 million square feet in total we may be looking at 1 million feet a year next year, year after, balance of this year it's under a million square feet remaining.", "So yes, we're\u2013 to use your words\u2013 we're encumbering that portion of the properties with some pretty uninspiring net effective rents.  But it still represents a small fraction of our investment in that portfolio.  And I do think that when that sublet space starts to attrition then you're going to see the net effectives bounce back, maybe not to levels two years ago, 2.5 years ago, but certainly to a normalized level that will be very economic.", "So one, we're trying to turn\u2013 where we're doing big capital credit deals we're trying to get 15 years out of those tenants.  Which one, it kind of caps the upside but we are getting rental bumps.  Remember, everything we quote to you guys to the Street on a quarterly basis on mark-to-market is a starting rent figure not an average rent.", "And Steve and his team are doing a very good job of getting embedded rental increases that we're going to enjoy as the market recovers contractually.  Plus we're getting term, so we're advertising a lot of that excess tenant concession, in certain cases, over 10 or 15 years.", "I think we've got one of the longest lease durations in the office sector.  So the numbers are big, appear big, but when you sort of carve it down for those factors rent bumps and term, it's not as bad as it seems.  And hopefully this is not more than another year or so phenomenon until sublet spaces absorb, a year, year and a half, two years.  Then I think it's unfortunate, but it is what it is.", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions).  Our next question comes from [Brandon Mayorano] \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "[Brandon Mayorano]\u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "", "With respect to opportunities that you're looking at, understanding that you're likely to de-lever a little bit over the next couple of years.  But as you think about the cash that you've got on your balance sheet and potentially deploying that cash, how do you see the opportunities between the structured finance book and then looking at holding \u2013 or property acquisitions?  And then thinking about that with potential investment partners and how that stands?", "Andrew Mathias", "", "I think on the\u2013 in terms of the equity opportunities the challenges, as I outlined it, there's not sort of a healthy, active market between buyers and sellers.  It's still very fractured because a lot of the properties that would trade are encumbered with legacy leverage, and it's really up to the lenders the ultimate disposition of those properties.", "So our JV focus would certainly be on the equity side to the extent we start to see some good equity opportunities.  You know we have a big stable of JV partners.  We've done joint ventures since 1999.  And we have a lot of very long, successful partnerships, and all of our guys sort of have capital and are ready to jump into the market at the first sign of an opportunity.", "So we've had all those conversations and I think we have a good understanding of where our partners want to see opportunities.  Nothing has emerged yet.  And then in terms of the structured finance, I mean I think it's similar to 1330 where we're making a small, sort of pry the door investment if you will, taking over special servicing of the asset in certain instances.", "So in the case of 1330 we're special servicer for a $240 million capital structure there with a $10 million to $15 million investment.  And those opportunities we'll probably likely be pursing on our own, although I wouldn't rule out venture partner but historically we've done them more ourselves.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors", "Michael Knott\u2013 Green Street Advisors", "Hey guys, can you just talk about 45 Lex a little bit more?  From what we had read in some trade rags, that something like the nominal price on the deal was over $500 million.  Can you just comment on strategically how you're thinking about that deal and what would sort of push you one way or the other?", "Marc Holliday", "", "Sure.  I think that obviously one of the challenges there is we have a very attractive piece of financing on that property, which is why it was a good candidate for sale when we first started entertaining interest on the property.  And I think we have a very attractive after debt cash flow on that asset.", "So we're certainly weighing the benefit of continuing to hold it and being the beneficiary so that after-debt cash flow verses the offers we've gotten to date.  And we are working with a couple of groups, and I would expect to probably in the third quarter make a definitive decision one way or another in terms of the direction we're going with the asset.

I would say generalizing, most of those senior lenders are not interested in sort of taking back real estate right now and they're generally inclined to extend out so we think we certainly wouldn't be in a position of having to take out a senior loan or give it a very significant pay-down.", "I think it's more likely going to be in circumstances where the assets have lease-up requirements and prior ownership, prior sponsorship has not done a good job of filling up those holes in the rent roll, we step in.  ", "I think the conversations with the senior lenders have more been along the lines of give us some comfort in the form of funded reserves or whatever it is that you're going to write checks for capital to complete the lease-up of the building.

I just wanted to know sort of where is that marked now at the end of the 2Q and maybe if you could help us understand where you come up with that valuation.", "Andrew Mathias", "Yes, we go through and there's two different buckets.  There's the held for sale which are mark-to-market in anticipation of the sale and then there's held-to-maturity or evaluated for whether there's a credit loss or not.  And so with those parameters, as dictated by GAAP, that's how you come up with the $608 million carrying value that we have at 630.", "[Rob Salzbury] \u2013 UBS", "And so in the percentage of face value, what would that be today?", "Andrew Mathias", "As a percentage of face value, hang on a few seconds.  ", "[Rob Salzbury] \u2013 UBS", "I think at the end of 1Q it was $691 million, on the face value it's $852 million?", "Andrew Mathias", "The 608 is approximately 78% of the original face.", "[Rob Salzbury] \u2013 UBS", "So it went down by about 3% roughly?", "Marc Holliday", "From what, 81%?", "[Rob Salzbury] \u2013 UBS", "Right.", "Marc Holliday", "Yes, the answer is that's mathematically probably correct but there's a much higher proportion of reserves on the held for sale and that's appropriate and also guided.  On the hold-to-maturity bucket, there's a number of those loans where we believe they're par positions.", "Now, if we were to sell those positions today like to 1166, that was very long-dated.  These aren't as long-dated, but they'd be at discounts but we're not selling them.  And if we're not selling them, we expect to collect par so I'm not sure how you would look at them and it's however you want to look at those, the stuff that we intend to market, sell, monetize, liquidate, have to reflect real deal today reserves. The mid-town Manhattan office portfolio we intend to either stay with the properties or possibly foreclose.", "We look at those based on what we think the underlying value of the assets are at the time we're going to resolve them and in many cases that's a pretty high proportion of our debt balance, so if you're aggregating them together which you can, but we look at them as two separate buckets.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from J. Habermann \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "", "[Jay] Habermann \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Just a follow-up and [Sloan] has a question as well.  Marc, the comment that market could bottom sometime mid-next year, are you anticipating that the tenant concession packages are going to remain at that $53 a foot over that time?", "Marc Holliday", "Tough to say because you really have to look at the blend between new and renewal and I frankly don't have that at my fingertips for Q2 to know if that blend is going to hold.  I think for new tenants, we're certainly going to try to hold the line at around $50 or so but for longer term deals or for higher rent deals, as long as the sublet space is out there, we're going to get pushed on that a bit.", "On the renewal deals, it really just depends.  It can be in some cases if the installation works for the tenant and the space is a desirable space we may have relatively low, higher, but low concessions that we'll make and in some cases, if it's a gut and rebuild and the existing tenants have the ability to move to a sublet, then we'll have to be more aggressive with it.", "But I guess I don't want to speculate.  I would hope it's not going to be too much greater than that but I will tell you certainly I don't want to underplay the severity of the situation.  With 4.5% sublet space maybe rising to 5% on the market, that's built, attractive, well-located space, not all 5% of it but let's say even half of it, 2.5 %.  If that's the case, you're competing against turnkey space and for a period of time you're going to spend money to retain tenants.  So I'm hopeful, but I certainly would not say that that $53 is going to be a peak quarter for us.  We'll just have to see what third quarter brings.  ", "By the way, just to give you a little bit of a leading indicator, for those of you that have hung on the phone an hour into the call, we'll give you something.  We just signed a 65,000-foot deal that hasn't been previously announced.  And there, that's a long-term deal?", "Steven M. Durels", "Yes.", "Marc Holliday", "About a 15-year deal and amortized over 15 years, I would say it's a regular market concession.  It's about $70 a foot over 15 years so that will fall somewhere within our strike zone on a 10-year basis.  And that's a 65,000 footer, brand new tenant sopping up space over at 1515 Broadway.", "So we are going to do what we have to do within reason to make deals work.  We're focusing on the higher rent buildings where we're going to do significant concessions and the lower rent buildings we're just going to hold the stakes which we haven't really done in prior markets but we're not going to spend big TI in low-rent space.  We're just not going to do it.", "", "[Jay] Habermann \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And just another quick one if I can for probably Andrew and Marc.  If you think about the $500 million to $900 million of asset sales and you think about the timing of that, how do you consider pricing in today's market versus say in a year or two's time where there might be more distressed assets in the market.", "Marc Holliday", "I'd be careful to, $500 million to $900 million, I want to make sure we're clear on this.  To give you an example, a lot of that is going to come over the next two to three years internally because of the reduced dividend.  That could be upwards of $150 to $200 million per annum.", "So over two to three years, that could be $0.5 billion right there.  So we are not projecting, if we did a 485 Lex, there's a number right there that may be at the low end of that range.  But I wouldn't state that we are looking to do those sales and I think we can get there with very modest sales, maybe a large one but modest in number.  Maybe one sale.", "Operator", "Our next question is a follow-up from Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup.", "", "Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi", "I just want to go back to the structured book for a second.  Maybe, Greg, you can split out your health maturity is 535 current balance and then another 74 that's held for sale.  You've had about $230 million of reserves over the last six quarters.  Obviously some of that is for stuff that you've already sold.  But maybe just sort of bridge the gap between the two and then maybe just have some commentary.   Obviously you sold the 1166 at $0.60 a book.  ", "Clearly that was probably, as you said, it was long-dated but that reflected sort of market and could have reflected also your desire to get as much proceeds as you can so the most marketable of the pieces and why we shouldn't be marking the book-to-market at a minimum of $0.60 on the dollar from where it is today.", "Gregory F. Hughes", "You've got to break down the two because the held for sale are actually based upon market quotes that we go out and look for.  We do have on the health maturity, we have taken a 10% reserve against the face amount of those loans.", "The 1166 deal, the negotiations for that actually commenced before we embarked upon our equity offering when we were moving forward with trying to find liquidity on all fronts.  And so I think you \u2013 just like you've seen a tightening in the spreads on our bonds and a lot of the other real estate paper, I think similarly you've seen that on our structured book.  So for a lot of people that were marking our book at $0.30 and $0.50 on the dollar to sell 1166 at $0.65 on the dollar, which is probably 90-day old pricing, we think is probably \u2013 gives a good indicator and makes us feel good about the carrying value here at 630.", "Or said another way, as Marc alluded to, we think the reserves that will be required going forward should diminish considerably off of what you've seen in these last three quarters.", "Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi", "And just a clarification on the G&A, your comment on being down 30 just because had GKK and also had the $18 million charge for redeeming the forward options.", "Gregory F. Hughes", "Yes, that's without regard to that charge, thought.", "Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi", "Right, so the down 30 is just the SL Green G&A piece or is it comparing the total with GKK last year?  I was just trying to get a feel.", "Gregory F. Hughes", "Just G&A, so apples-to-apples.", "Steven M. Durels", "Just Green", "Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi", "Just Green's G&A.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Guinee \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus.", "John Guinee \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Great job answering at least 15 questions on the structured finance portfolio, which I guess is somewhere between 3% and 6% of your total enterprise value.  Question for you, Greg, it looks like you financed out on 420 Lex at, if I'm doing the math right, about $1.20 a square foot and you financed out on 650 Madison at, if I'm doing the math right, looks like about $2.40 a square foot, which seem sort of light to me.  Can you kind of walk through why there's such a low dollar per square foot on your loans?", "Gregory F. Hughes", "Well again, both assets carry ground leases with them, so in terms of how they're underwritten you get dinged for that.  And if you look notwithstanding that Graybar as a for instance, has operated at 95% plus occupancy for the last 10 years, that was underwritten at an 89% occupancy level by the people doing the underwriting, under the presumption that that is what the market is.", "So I think given the environment that they were very good executions in terms of the debt yields that you would see, I think the ground leases that were in place made the debt yields that we achieved there a little bit higher than you'd otherwise see for a conventional fee property.", "Marc Holliday", " But like everything it's a matter of perspective.  It may be \u2013 I've always said I'm not a big per foot person.  It does represent roughly on average a 40% increase in proceeds over debt that was put into place in \u2013 not that [inaudible] is in place in the past 10 years or so, so I guess the point is in this environment where there literally is almost no credit out there, to go out and nail to non-TALF loans at 40% upsizes, when I think the market is generally trying to refinance current outstandings or even make pay downs.", "I think is evidence that these are good assets.  They're desirable.  Pension funds, insurance companies are willing to finance mid-town Manhattan, they're willing to finance sponsorship and they're even willing to finance up investments if they think they're getting well protected, which on these two assets they clearly are.  You hit it on the head.  These are not max leverage loans, nor do we typically do that with our secured financings.", "So that's not to say we couldn't put more on in a better market, but these met our objectives.", "John Guinee \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "And then the next question looks to me like you've paid out about $0.45 or $0.50 in dividends so far this year.  What will the taxable minimum be per your current projections?", "Gregory F. Hughes", "Well if you look, we've paid out \u2013 if you look on page 19 or the supplemental, we've already paid out 139% of what the requirement is for the year, so we are kind of well ahead of where we \u2013 way beyond where we need to be.  And part of that is the benefit of having taken last year's fourth quarter dividend and being able to shift it into 2009.  If you recall that had a January record date, so we're getting the benefit of that deduction this year.  So again, that's part of the tax plan that went into being able to take the dividend down to its new level.", "Marc Holliday", "Operator, unfortunately, I hope the queue is empty because that's about all we've got right now.  We, unfortunately, have to be somewhere we're a little late for and if there's anyone left in the queue we will call you later this afternoon.  But hopefully that's it.  Thank you and look forward to speaking to everyone again in three months.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference.  This concludes the presentation.

This conference call is being recorded. At this time, the company would like to remind the listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements.", "Actual results may differ from predictions that management may make today. Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the company\u2019s Form 10-Q and the other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also during today\u2019s conference call, the company may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC Regulation G.", "The GAAP financial measures most difficulty compare to each non-GAAP financial measures discussed and reconciliation of the differences between non-GAAP financial measures and the comparable GAAP financial measures can be found at the company\u2019s website at www.slgreen.com by selecting the press release regarding the company\u2019s third quarter earnings.", "Before turning the call over to Marc Holliday, Chief Executive Officer of SL Green Realty Corp, we would like to ask those of you participating in the Q-and-A portion of the call today to please limit your questions to two per person.", "Thank you and go ahead, Mr. Holliday.", "Marc Holliday", "Thank you. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for calling in today. I am joined by Andrew Mathias, Greg Hughes, and others at SL Green and we will be discussing the quarter\u2019s activities and take your questions. I thought we had a good quarter during the third quarter and one that shouldn\u2019t have contained surprises for anyone.", "Core performance was solid, particularly in light of the current economic climate. All of the so called one timer and trends associated with this quarter have been surfaced and discussed some prior calls and from my vantage point, the quarter is very much inline with our expectations and management\u2019s guidance.", "Some of the important highlights from the quarter include substantial NOI growth on a same store basis, positive mark-to-market on Manhattan leases, maintenance of our occupancy rate, reduction of our balance sheet indebtedness, extension of certain liabilities and obtaining control of 100 Church Street.", "However, the results also reflect the significant battering of the New York City economy and resulting impact on real estate fundamentals in our market. Availabilities in midtown during the third quarter inch up to a total of approximately 13% with 9% directly offered by landlords and 4% representing sublet availabilities. This is within the range of the 12% to 14% we have been forecasting.", "While the rate of increase is slowing dramatically and will hopefully soon cease, the high level of availability is obviously negatively impacting rental levels and specifically the sublet availabilities of course all New York City landlords to substantially wide in out concession packages in order to compete with fully built out space. The effects of this competition for tenants can be clearly seen by a low mark-to-market of 5% for the third quarter.", "However, this is right within the range of 0% to 10% we had forecasted at our December investor meeting last year and was consistently reinforced throughout the year. While much of our mark-to-market has been eroded, I still think it speaks volumes to the fact that we can maintain a positive leasing spread on new and renewal leases in Manhattan during the worst economic climate in possibly the last 40 years, and it also underscore strategic rationale of our acquisitions throughout the last decade where embedded rents that were well below market primarily drove our investment decisions to acquire.", "So, with that as the background, it may first sound contradictory to hear that I for one, believe after 2.5 very bearish years that 2010 will be a transitional year and one in which we will see a return of job growth in New York and a shrinking of tenant concession packages during the second half of the year. I believe this to be the case because when you look through the numbers there are some encouraging signs of stabilization that are occurring today, but may take six months or so to filter through the indicators.", "First of all, I think the office sector jobs picture in New York City is better than the national picture and improvement will occur first in New York before most or all other commercial markets in the US. Private sector job losses for the year in the city are trending about 100,000 jobs less than what was originally forecasted by New York City budget and public sector job loss in our market has been negligible, although could possibly increase in the ensuing year.", "While durable goods meltdown has directly affected manufacturing construction jobs around the country, manufacturing jobs account for only a small portion of the Manhattan particularly the office market, to begin with and they are not really a factor in the numbers. While we have our share of construction job losses as well, it has been mitigated by the amount of public construction projects being undertaken within the state.", "I estimate that an increased 30,000 private sector office jobs over the course of 2010 and 2011 would bring the midtown market back into equilibrium and job creation beyond that would shift the market back to where landlords have the pricing advantage. The good news is because job losses are less than initially projected, tax receipts to date are ahead of schedule in New York City and as a result the budget remains in at least a balanced position through the fiscal year ending in June 2010.", "While there is likely to be a significant deficit that will have to be tackled for the first year ending in 2011, the mayor has stated his goal of not having that deficit closed through personal income taxes or other Forms of taxes increased and we are hopeful that through structural cost savings, deferred stimulus dollars and other one timers, that the budget will again be balanced through mid 2011.", "In Albany where the picture is not quite as good, the legislature will be in session in first week in November to effectuate a deficit reduction plan, which will eliminate a $3 billion so in balance in the state\u2019s budget and indicators are this will be accomplished on or prior to November 10. With a rebounding economy in 2010, I believe you will start to see an inflection point in the leasing market as well.", "Most of the prime well built sublet space that has approximately 10 years of term has or will be absorbed over the next six to nine months. What would be left is a large amount of sublet space that may have five years or less remaining or not have the necessary improvements to be competitive with spaces directly offered by landlords and at that point, you will start to see the major New York City landlords pull in the concession packages that are currently being offered.", "In the specific example of our portfolio, our free rent increased to 6.9 months for the quarter and tenant improvements increased to $56 per square foot, but if you pull out just two of the 28 deals we did in that Manhattan statistic, one located at 1515 Broadway and the other located at 100 Park Avenue, the statistics for the remaining 26 office deals would result in four months of free rent and $40 per square foot in concessions.", "In the case of the deals at 1515 and 100 Park Avenue, we were particularly motivated to get deals done in those buildings, which in the case of 100 Park, was recently refinanced and the case of 1515 Broadway is pending refinancing, in order to increase in place cash flow and maximize the refinancing execution. Clearly, in the case of 100 Park Avenue, that strategy worked out well and we were more than benefited for the expense of lease that we installed to a very efficient refinancing of that property.", "Monthly leasing rates in the city have essentially doubled to more than a million square feet per month, almost a million and a quarter square feet per month and that\u2019s doubled the beginning of the year when the pace of leasing was extraordinarily anemic, and that pace will pick up even further as the economy starts to strengthen again and as tenants who are holding off their decisions in order to try to bottom tick the market, will fear the risk of losing that opportunity if they don\u2019t act decisively in the next 6 to 12 months to lock in these favorable terms.", "While the next two or three quarters of results will continue to reflect the market forces of current, I do believe the second half of 2010 will begin to tell a different and better story. In the suburban portfolio, the results exceeded our expectations, although clearly shows more signs of stresses that I think are endemic to markets outside Manhattan. Velocity is very strong as approximately 160,000 square feet was leased during the quarter.", "Exceeding the historical average for that portfolio and not reflective of two additional leases for approximately 33,000 square feet that were linked in the third quarter, but have commencement dates beyond and also doesn\u2019t include about 50,000 square feet executed in the suburbs since the end of the third quarter.", "Mark-to-market in the suburbs was negative, although on a whole dollar basis not a very material diminution to SL Green\u2019s NOI performance, given the smaller rental base that will work of I believe our team in White Plains will continue to do the best job of any try state suburban management team in keeping the buildings well leased.", "However, they will be fighting a trend of continued tenant fall out at some faller to mid sized businesses who have been holding on throughout the recession may or may not be able to make it through completely without having to down size some of their existing space.", "We\u2019re watching approximately 100,000 square feet or a little under that we\u2019re monitoring in the suburbs to see what direction these companies will take during the next six months or so, but like Manhattan, the overall bad debt and distress rate in the suburbs has been very, very low given what you would expect because of the economic conditions.", "In our structured finance portfolio, balances were kept relatively level when compared to last quarter at around $615 million of carrying value of that amount, approximately $500 million or 80% of those outstanding are represented by office or retail collateral located in New York City and of that amount, approximately $350 million is solely comprised of Manhattan office collateral totaling 9.5 million square feet the collateral interest and having an in place NOI debt yield of approximately 6.5%.", "When eliminating just one property from that Manhattan office database, which represents one high grade net lease new construction project, then the outstanding debt amount per square foot for all other such collateral is approximately $320 per square foot, and the NOI debt yield rises to approximately 7%.", "These properties are generally fully levered and therefore the borrowers on such facilities will either have to find new forms of takeout financings, in many cases requiring an equity pay down or work out a restructuring with us and the lender groups or in certain cases will be at risk for losing the properties to us in the lender groups.", "As an example, we recently and successfully took control of 100 Church Street during the third quarter on terms that Andrew Mathias will brief you on shortly. Certainly there is a subset of this collateral which will represent proprietary pipeline situations as final maturity dates or other monument dates approach, without a corresponding increase in liquidity in the debt markets.", "The balances I just mentioned include only a $1 million carrying value for our loan on Stuyvesant Town, which we have all but fully reserved at this moment, given the adverse New York State Court ruling against the borrower group in control of that property and the deteriorated market conditions.", "Our view is that in light of the current court decision it would be challenging to impossible for the borrower group to meet their original business plan and therefore, our debt position is likely impaired. However, we will actively monitor the situation very closely and the potential exists to be a part of some form of restructuring or resolution of this investment and we\u2019ll just keep you apprised as that unfolds.", "I believe that our presence in the Manhattan marketplace as a structured debt provider, combined with our rated special servicing group, will present us with significant opportunities over the next 12 months to 24 months that we will look to capitalize on and this quarter was consistent with our expectations, we are leaving our estimates for full year FFO unchanged, at a range of $4.35 to $4.50 per share.", "The determining factor between where we wind up within that range will be largely driven by the level of loan loss reserves we may establish during the fourth quarter, continuing a general downward trend from peak loan loss levels over the last six to 12 months, but still a factor until credit becomes more readily available to provide refinancing for real estate projects in and around the city.", "With that, let me turn it over to Andrew Mathias.", "Andrew Mathias", "Thanks, Marc. Not surprisingly capital markets activity in the third quarter continued to be virtually non-existent versus prior year\u2019s levels. The one notable exception in our portfolio was the announcement of our contract to sell certain interests in 485 Lexington to a partnership of Optibase and Gilmore, U.S.A. more on that later.", "Additionally, HSBC entered into a contract to sell their U.S. headquarters building located at 452 Fifth Avenue. In a positive sign for the market, this deal was struck with no financing in place and reportedly the purchaser intends to close the deal all cash at a price of $330 million, approximately $381 per square foot. The purchase price and the transaction is structured in such a way that HSBC committed to a short term one year lease-back on certain tower office space.", "The base of the Fifth Avenue building and the significantly older Class C building, with both of which are included in the overall transaction square footage, were leased back for a 10 year period by HSBC. Clearly, the buyers are anticipating firming demand for space will allow them to spend the necessary capital and lease up the property when HSBC leaves the tower. The property was bought by a foreign group, continuing the trend of foreign capital being the dominant buyers in the Manhattan market.", "The only other notable transaction in the market currently is UBS\u2019s sale of a minority interest in 299 Park Avenue, which is a unique offering given Fisher Brothers\u2019 managing position within the partnership. While this deal has yet to go to contract, we would not be surprised to see private, high net worth capital be a successful purchaser here as well, if Fisher Brothers elects not to exercise certain contractual rights they have in their partnership agreement and we expect the price in excess of $600 per square foot.", "Aside from these two transactions, there continues to be a dearth of sellers on the marketplace and a growing bench of capital impatiently waiting on the sidelines to put money to work. The weak dollar is again becoming a strong factor in people\u2019s asset allocation strategies as well.", "With this in mind, we continued our global outreach this quarter with SLG personnel completing a one week road show in Asia, where we found very encouraging investor interest, in U.S. real estate in Manhattan particularly, and Expo Real in Germany, where the story was similar, and too much capital with too few investment opportunities.", "We\u2019re guardedly optimistic that banks are starting to again mark assets down to closer to market value, and recent changes in CMBS regulations giving special servicers more flexibility to modify and dispose of assets will again facilitate more transaction flow, initially in the debt space, but ultimately on the equity side as well.", "Our activity in the quarter centered around the purchase and sale agreement for interest in 485 Lexington, an opportunistic debt investment where we added to an existing position we have in 450 West 33 Street, and the sale of a small property in Westchester. On 485 Lexington, our buyer has obtained all internal approvals and is ready, willing and able to close.", "However, the assumption of the loan as a condition to closing and we have found servicers in this environment to be highly unpredictable, even though assumption of the loan is permitted in the loan documents. We are currently in discussions both the master servicer and the special servicer for the transaction, and hope to reach resolution on the assumption issue shortly, as it is the only closing condition left unsatisfied.", "Additionally on the disposition side, we sold a small non-core asset in Westchester, which was a multi-tenanted, highly management intensive property. Particularly in this environment, we were happy to dispose of the asset. Despite the challenges within the property\u2019s rent roll, it still sold for an 8.3% cap rate, giving a bit of visibility into current suburban cap rates.", "On the investment side, we took advantage of an opportunity to buy out our partner\u2019s 50% interest in the Mezzanine loan secured by 450 West 33. We purchase the interest at a significant discount to par value, such that our expected yield to maturity on the paper is approximately 20%. Our last dollar basis in the asset is approximately $250 per square foot, a level which we feel very comfortable owning this property and the significant air rights attached to it, should that eventuality arise.", "Additionally, in the quarter, as Marc mentioned, we reached a consensual agreement with our borrower on 100 Church Street in downtown Manhattan, taking over management and leasing of the property in August and we expect to assume formal legal ownership in the first quarter of 2010. This property is over 1 million square feet in a prime location on Church Street, with approximately 600,000 square feet of vacancy to be leased up.", "We\u2019re very confident in our leasing team is up to this challenge and our basis in the asset of about $175 per square foot should allow us to structure highly competitive deals to get more than our fair share of tenants in the downtown market.", "As we have indicated on prior calls, we expect this market environment to produce additional opportunities within our mezzanine portfolio like 100 Church, giving us an opportunity to grow our portfolio with quality assets at an attractive basis. The other notable asset level activity for the quarter revolved around a refinancing we closed on four of the company\u2019s assets.", "These financings clearly demonstrate that for high quality sponsors with reasonably levered assets, there are many lenders willing to do business in Manhattan. These lenders range from German Landesbanks, to US Life Insurance companies to pension funds, and we continue to see the tangible fruit of our global outreach program I described earlier in the form of new relationships and ability to source capital in a market environment where capital is very hard to come back.", "We thank all of our lenders in these transactions for their confidence in us and the liquidity with which they provided the company, and continue to work on additional transactions to address upcoming maturities. In conclusion, rewardingly optimistic that we may see a pickup in transaction volume with market confidence growing that a bottom has been reached in the leasing market and banks beginning to again make money, giving them the flexibility to take marks and move assets.", "We still do not expect to see many direct sellers of real estate, as the larger owners were fortunate enough to not enter the cycle with excessive leverage are generally holders, and the less fortunate, highly levered owners don\u2019t have the option of selling and are in fact negotiating with their creditors, including in many cases SL Green.", "With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg for further insight on the financials.", "Greg Hughes", "Great thanks, Andrew. We start out by taking a look at our balance sheet. The balance sheet at 9.30 actually reflects many of the benefits office our continued efforts to raise liquidity and deleverage the balance sheet. As of 9.30, we had approximately $780 million of cash, restricted cash and marketable securities. Note that during the quarter, we invested some of our cash in short term bonds in network to gain some additional yield. ", "With a decent cash position and most of our short term debt maturities having been addressed, we decided to hold you off on the sale of any future structured finance investments. Accordingly, $59.7 million of structured finance investments, previously classified as held for sale have been reclassified to the structured finance balances. This, coupled with the $16.1 million of new originations during the quarter, accounted for most of the increase from the $534 million at 9.30 to the $615 million at 9.30.", "Note that the $615 million is substantially below the $725 million targeted balance we established during our investor conference last December. During the quarter we continued our deleveraging efforts with the repurchase of $33 million of our outstanding bonds and $48 million of our credit facility.", "Since the inception of this buyback program roughly a year ago, we have been able to repurchase $802 million of our debt for approximately $595 million and have been able to realize $162.9 million of gains on these repurchases. During the quarter, we successfully closed on the refinancing of our 100 Park Avenue project with a $215 million loan, which enabled us to recoup a portion of the $72 million used to renovate that project.", "This loan has a maturity date of 2014 and carries two one year extensions and has a fixed interest rate of approximately 6.7%. This loan repaid the previous mortgage of $175 million that was outstanding. Recall that last quarter we discussed in detail the refinancing of 420 Lexington and 625 Madison and as Andrew pointed out, these refinancing during the worst credit environment in 20 years demonstrate lenders commitment to Manhattan real estate.", "During the quarter, we generated funds available for distribution of $0.76, which brings our year-to-date total to approximately $2.61. At our new dividend rate $0.10 per quarter, which we believe will be sustained at least through 2010, the company is positioned to generate funds available for distribution after dividends of $150 million to $200 million. This free cash flow will be a major contribute to the further deleveraging of our balance sheet and provide capital for future investment.", "Before leaving the balance sheet, I would like to quickly review the covenant ratios on page 27 of our supplemental. There had been some concern that we might come close to breaching some of these covenants. However, I\u2019m happy to report that when one reviews our positions with respect to these covenants, we are in good shape and have substantial cushion.", "Our total debt to total assets as computed under our credit facility is 47.7%, compared to the requirement of 60%. Our fixed charge coverage sits at 2.71 times, compared to the 1.5 times requirement.", "Our unsecured debt as a function of our unencumbered assets, which will be a critical metric as we look to refinancing our underlying credit in 2012 sits at 49.3%, compared to the requirement of 60% and our unencumbered interest coverage sits at a healthy three times compared to the 1.7 times requirement. While these covenants would suggest that we have room for additional debt capacity, we continue to work towards our targeted debt to EBITDA multiple of eight times.", "Now I would like to spend a moment discussing the P&L results for the quarter. The results for the quarter include a number of onetime items. As previously mentioned, we realized a gain of $8.4 million on the early extinguishment of debt. Offsetting this gain was a $16.1 million reserve against the structured loan portfolio related to our Stuyvesant Town investment.", "Our interest expense includes approximately $10.5 million of defeasance costs incurred in connection with the refinancing of 420 Lexington, and during the quarter, we realized lease termination income of $6.6 million related principally to the termination of a lease at 220 East 42 Street.", "Turning to the core operations, we were pleased to finish the quarter at 95.7% occupancy. As previously discussed, the decline from last quarter is principally attributable to the expiration of the Citicorp lease at 34 Street. Interestingly enough, I had someone complain to me a few weeks ago that there was no upside in our portfolio because our scheduled lease expirations over the next couple of years were very limited.", "I had to point out that this was by design, and we were actually very happy to have limited expirations here at the bottom of the market. Note that when the market does recover, which we believe will happen towards the end of next year, we have always been very successful on executing our early renewals and leasing substantially in excess of what our scheduled to these expirations are.", "As expected, the mark-to-market decline from the 20% plus that we had been realizing during the first half of the year and it was down to 5.2% for the quarter. We are pleased that it continues to be positive, and this is one of the reasons you continue to see solid same store NOI growth within the portfolio.", "During the quarter, we realized same store NOI growth of 5.9%, including 5.6% on the consolidated portfolio, and 6.5% on the joint venture portfolio. Income from the structured finance portfolio remained constant at about $16.2 million for the quarter. Note that the pending foreclosure of 100 Church and other anticipated restructurings, we would expect that the quarterly run rate from the structured finance portfolio will decline in future quarters.", "As of 9/30, there were five loans with a book balance of $59.2 million that were on non-accrual. When we foreclose on the 100 Church assets, which we expect to occur in early 2010, we will own approximately a 50% economic interest in the property, subject to $140 million first mortgage. We currently expect this investment to be accounted for under the equity method, and we would expect that there would be a de minimis contribution to earnings in 2010 from this asset.", "Our G&A for the quarter was $18.9 million, bringing us to $54.7 million year-to-date and putting us inline to achieve savings in excess of 20% over last year. Note that this is achieved notwithstanding a new accounting pronouncement that requires the expensing of virtually all transaction costs.", "As a result of this new pronouncement, our G&A includes approximately $1 million of cost to-date, which would have otherwise been capitalized prior to the implementation of this announcement. Our interest expense for the quarter totaled $85.5 million, which included the aforementioned $10.5 million of defeasance paid on 420 Lexington Avenue.", "In conclusion, as Marc pointed out, we are reaffirming our guidance of $4.35 to $4.50, which would imply a fourth quarter FFO per share of between $0.80 and $0.93 and as Marc said, where within the range will be largely dependent up on the reserves related to the structured book and the other two variables would be the floating rate borrowings where we\u2019ve benefited from historically low LIBOR rates and also restructurings within the structured finance book, where the income recognition might be reduced on the prospective basis.", "With that, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Marc for some comments.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. Why don\u2019t we open it up for questions you now and at the end of the questions for those that stay on, I\u2019ll have some just closing remarks concerning our December Investor Meeting that is coming up in just over a month\u2019s time, but for now, we\u2019ll take questions.", "Questions-and-Answers Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Ian Weissman - ISI Group.", "Ian Weissman - ISI Group", "The first question I guess is for Steve Durels if he\u2019s on the line, Steve just talking about or looking at the pace of leasing this quarter, if you look at the deals that tenants are taking, how much of that is growth space? They\u2019re taking advantage of obviously rents down in the marketplace 50%, so I\u2019m trying to get a sense of utilization on leases and are tenants taking growth space given how far rents have dropped?", "Steve Durels", "I don\u2019t have a number for you, but I can tell you intuitively that a good deal of the transactions that we do where it\u2019s a new tenant coming into the building, rather than just a renewal transaction, that a large number of those deals seem to have some component of growth.", "It\u2019s modest, though. It\u2019s generally 10% to 15% of the space. It\u2019s rarely a driver of people\u2019s decision as to why they\u2019re moving. There are a couple of examples out in the marketplace like the CV Star deal, which is done on Park Avenue and some of the recent financial service deals that were done on Park Avenue that were driven by growth, but I think generally speaking, new deals have a growth component.", "It\u2019s rare that it\u2019s the driver, but the big news is that guys are really making decisions to take long term deals and they\u2019re making decisions to actually relocate rather than just to renew in place.", "Ian Weissman - ISI Group", "Just one on that, the deals that you\u2019re seeing or the strength in demand, is there a particular sector, is financial services driving it this time around?", "Steve Durels", "No, the good news is that it seems to be pretty broad based. We\u2019re seeing user groups from law firms who are doing consolidations, smaller financial service businesses that are actually out there expanding. We\u2019ve had a couple small guys that have picked up 5,000, 10,000-foot and accounting firms seem to be active in the marketplace. We\u2019ve had growth from healthcare, some from education. So it seems to be that it\u2019s no one, not dominated by a particular industry but pretty broad based.", "Ian Weissman - ISI Group", "For this quarter, you broke out marketable securities and looks like there was a big pickup sequentially from the second quarter. What exactly was the cause of that?", "Greg Hughes", "That\u2019s what I alluded to when I was talking about my cash, restricted cash and marketable securities, it was some short term bonds, they come due accounted within the next 12 months, just to get some additional yield on our cash balances.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jamie Feldman - Banc of America.", "Jamie Feldman - Banc of America", "Another question on fundamentals, Marc, you had mentioned a good amount of sublease space in the market that is built out and ready to go and once that sort of dries up, that\u2019s what really would turn market conditions. How much space would you say that is?", "Greg Hughes", "How much space over the 4% is highly competitive?", "Jamie Feldman - Banc of America", "Correct.", "Greg Hughes", "I don\u2019t have an exact number for you. I will have that when we meet in December, because we\u2019re going to have to do a space by space inventory. I would estimate that to be at least half, but not three quarters. So within that range, I can\u2019t be more specific, but I would say maybe half of that space is competitive, it\u2019s not 10 years, it\u2019s long enough, call it seven to 10 years. It\u2019s got to be seven to 10 years, well located, got to have decent assignment sublet right in the lease.", "It\u2019s got to be generally fully built out, not requiring much capital, or if not the deal gets tougher and I think half is probably a good proxy, maybe a little over, we\u2019ll try to get more specific with you in a month.", "Jamie Feldman - Banc of America", "Did you have something to add?", "Greg Hughes", "I\u2019m sorry?", "Jamie Feldman - Banc of America", "It sounded like Steve was going to say something.", "Greg Hughes", "You have something to add?", "Steve Durels", "The only think thing that may help us some color of that is that 25% to 30% of the sublease space out there has a term of five years or less, which is a big handicap as far as it making that part of the inventory marketable, which from an owner\u2019s perspective turns those kinds of spaces into opportunities that we convert on a pretty frequent basis.", "Greg Hughes", "That\u2019s why it can\u2019t mathematically exceed more than 3% of the four and I would guess it\u2019s somewhere between 2% and 3%, probably closer to 2%. That we point in midtown is about a little over 2 million feet. So that\u2019s quote somewhere around 4 million to 5 million feet. Let\u2019s say competitive sublet space.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Josh Attie - Citi.", "Josh Attie - Citi", "It\u2019s Josh Attie with Michael. Can you talk about the upcoming refinancing of the mortgage on 1515 Broadway next year in terms of the level of debt you thing you can achieve, the level of amortization, you think might be necessary and if you think you might need to put equity into that property and how the lenders are thinking about it given that there\u2019s a million square feet of lease expiring in 2015.", "Marc Holliday", "Yes, I think, Josh, we\u2019re still pretty comfortable with the estimates we made for the sources and uses that we did at our equity offering in May and I think there we modeled $125 million amortization payment.", "Greg Hughes", "That would be our portion of it.", "Marc Holliday", "Our share and the new loan, I would say will likely have an amortization component because Viacom as you know is a 2015 expiration, but we\u2019re working hard on addressing that situation and are still comfortable with the estimates we made.", "Josh Attie - Citi", "Then just one more question on the line of credit buybacks. Are any of the other of the 30 lenders in your bank line do you think willing to sell their commitments back to you?", "Greg Hughes", "I think everybody has reached the conclusion that it\u2019s obviously a money good credit at this point in the game. So I don\u2019t know that we would expect a lot more activity. I think you\u2019ve got to wait and see what happens here at year end. It\u2019s certainly possible. You heard a lot of the banks talk about and foreshadowing additional marks going forward, whether this would be a position that they would mark is entirely possible. You may have people that may clean up their balance sheets and look for liquidity at year end. We\u2019re not counting on it being a big number, but certainly a possibility.", "Josh Attie - Citi", "Greg, how are you thinking about with sitting on the cash on your balance sheet and obviously a fully drawn line of credit and it sounds like from Marc\u2019s comments things in the city and financial markets have gotten better. We sort of past, do you think the lines are going to be pulled that you just effectively pay back the line a little bit?", "Greg Hughes", "I think if you look for $9 billion companies to be carrying cash balances of $6 or $700 million in today\u2019s environment, a large piece of that\u2019s going to go towards, we have some convertible notes that come due in 2010, and so I think that the cash balance relative to the size of the company, some of the pending maturities and some of the other capital work that we have going on. I think is a pretty appropriate level as we sit right now.", "Josh Attie - Citi", "So when you think about next year in terms of having to put $125 million into 1515 Broadway and some other cash needs, that effectively is going to take a lot of the free cash flow that you\u2019re generating, where do you sort of get in terms of having the capital if the line\u2019s fully drawn, and you want to keep that level of cash, where is the other capital going to come from?", "Marc Holliday", "I would say a couple things. The sum of the things you mentioned would still leave us with a pretty ample cash position, even net of 1515 pay down and net of the bond retirement. We could still be in a position of north of $500 million, so I guess it\u2019s all relative as to whether you call that a lot or a little, but I think north of $500 million balance in my book is still a decent chunk of change and because of the dividend policy we\u2019ve adopted, we\u2019ll be increasing those balances organically through cash flow.", "We also have the ability to receive repayments and/or pay downs of structured finance positions, and/or we could sell those positions as we\u2019ve done in the past and we\u2019ve shown I think demonstrated an ability to raise money pretty readily, even in very bad markets, through that structured finance portfolio by monetizing through note sales.", "So all-in-all, whether we do it through refinancings as we\u2019ve just completed, upsized refinancings in three out of four projects that are contained in today\u2019s release or otherwise, I think excess to capital, given our cash position and the things we have available to us going forward, I feel like we\u2019re in a pretty decent position.", "Andrew Mathias", "We said remember, we have a cash balance that we\u2019re expected to use those money\u2019s to retire the corporate obligations, so the 2010 converts and 2011 notes that come due, it\u2019s a very different environment than just from the last quarter call, the unsecured debt markets are very, very much opened at this point in time and so you could see those corporate obligations being refinanced because there\u2019s heavy demand now as you\u2019ve seen from a bunch of our accessing the unsecured market.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from [Ross Salisbury] - UBS.", "Ross Salisbury - UBS ", "", "Marc, I thought I heard in your commentary that you thought potentially the balance of power could come back to landlords by 2012 if we saw 30,000 new jobs created in 2010 and 2011. What should we infer from that comment in terms of your view on net effective rental rates in Manhattan over the next 12 months to 24 months?", "Marc Holliday", "I think it\u2019s going to be a two step. The first part, which is obviously nearer term, is going to be absorption within 2010 of what I\u2019m calling the prime or primer sublet space which will have to get a better answer to you on exactly how much but I estimated earlier, about 4 million to 5 million square feet and as that occurs, I think you\u2019ll see a tightening of the net effectives through a tightening of the concession packages, trim down the free rent, trim down the work letters.", "It won\u2019t be the peak levels they are now, nor will it be the trough levels they were when we had a 5%, 6% vacancy rate in Manhattan, but it will be back to let\u2019s say a market equilibrium for the moment and then the second shoe, which I think will start to increase nominal rental rates, will be job growth.", "It\u2019s anyone\u2019s prediction as to whether that will or won\u2019t occur in 2010, but I think the fact that we\u2019ve been through such a draconian period, if you will in the various business sectors in the country and certainly in New York and yet the job base the service, the office service job base in Manhattan was hit, but not hit so much more catastrophically so than what we experienced in \u201801, \u201802, \u201803, or the early 90s, that I think it will be resilient, we will get job growth again as financial service firms drive business in and around our city.", "All the other business sectors that have reported to us that their businesses are picking up in terms of ad revenues and such, and that will I think start to drive nominal rental growth. So I think we\u2019re hoping in 2010 to see concession packages trimming and then I guess you could see rental growth and I think before \u201812, I don\u2019t know why you couldn\u2019t start to see that in \u201811, because you don\u2019t have to be at equilibrium in order to drive that, you just have to be trending there and when tenants see you trending there.", "I think they\u2019ll be called into action to do something in what they will perceive to be a rising rental environment. So we need competition for space and I think competition for space will result when we start to see job growth again.", "Ross Salisbury - UBS ", "What impact if any do you think is going to have on rental rates from the Worldwide Plazas and the 452 avenues trading at 400 or sub 400 a foot levels to the extent where you\u2019ve got new owners with low cost basis who can undercut the current market rents? If we fee banks taking assets back in the hand of new owners, is that an increasing pressure that has some offsetting factor?", "Marc Holliday", "I think the pressure is supply and demand, primarily, its a lot of what you\u2019ve seen I think is priced into those deals.", "Steve Durels", "Those deals are trading with the expectation of leasing at current market rents, not below current market rents and in some cases with growth off of current market rents.", "Marc Holliday", "So I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see further pressure. I think it\u2019s more of an inventory issue, whether it\u2019s in the hands of the borrower or a lender if it\u2019s available and I would say once the deal trades and there\u2019s new money in the deal, they\u2019re going to try and maximize those returns.", "They\u2019re not just going to be cutting and running to put low rents in, certainly not lower than today. So, I think the only thing that would cause rents to go lower would be accelerating job losses in the private office sector, not necessarily or not at all the trading of properties to lenders. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be a factor. The lenders are going to put it out. The brokers going to work the market and they\u2019re going to get market rents.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs.", "Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "Here with Sloan as well. I guess, Greg back to the line of credit, could you give us a sense of what your target would be for the end of next year? I mean, you mentioned the $800 million of delevering so far, but is that a realistic target for the next 12 months or so. I know you\u2019ve deferred some of your asset sales, but why not take advantage of liquidity in today\u2019s market?", "Greg Hughes", "We\u2019re borrowing at LIBOR plus 80, right, so we\u2019re borrowing at around 1% and I think if you look at the projections that we\u2019ve laid out for people, we\u2019re targeting getting to in 2012, that the line would be paid down to kind of $900 million to $1 billion. Obviously, we\u2019re going to look to retire the most expensive debt first.", "Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "Separately, you mentioned your trip to Asia. Can you give us give us a sense of what sort of cap rates foreign buyers are interested in New York?", "Greg Hughes", "Obviously, totally depends on the opportunity and sort of the flavor of the opportunity whether it\u2019s a vacant lease subplay, whether it\u2019s a core property that\u2019s stabilized and whether the rents in the building are at or above or below market, but I would say generally we feel very comfortable around a 6% to 6.5% cap rate. There are many, many groups that expressed a great desire to find core midtown properties around that level.", "Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "Just to be clear, are you still expecting positive lease spreads even until the market bottoms as you sort of forecast mid-next year?", "Marc Holliday", "I\u2019m going to stick to my range to the end of the year, 0 to 10, 0, I\u2019m not sure, my math is, I think it\u2019s positive. I think that something in and around that range is where we will expect to end the year. In December, we\u2019re going to roll up all our budgets which we\u2019re working feverishly on in October. We go through them, tenant by tenant in November and first week in December we\u2019ll have a you view as to where we\u2019re going to be in 2010.", "It really just depends on what\u2019s coming due in \u201810, so we really just have to look. You could have, if there\u2019s a lot of low rate rents coming due, we\u2019ll still have sizable mark-to-market. If there\u2019s some high rate deals from the year 2000, it might be modest, but we don\u2019t have that number for you now. We will in a month, but I do certainly stand by that for Q4.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Guinee - Stifel Nicolaus.", "John Guinee - Stifel Nicolaus", "Couple of quick questions on just sources and uses, Park, I think you quoted about $56 in tenant improvement costs. What\u2019s the associated leasing commissions\u2019 on the most recent deals? Should we figure $10, $15 a square foot?", "", "Marc Holliday", "In New York, it\u2019s really arithmetic. The good news is it hasn\u2019t gapped out, because of the market, but it filled it. It decreases as the rent decreases and the per foot is just a translation of whether we\u2019re doing a $40, $50, $60 or $70 deal. So Steve, can you ballpark it?", "Steve Durels", "32%.", "Marc Holliday", "32% of first year\u2019s rent is sort of a ballpark.", "Steve Durels", "So, $50 rents, 15 bucks in leasing commissions.", "Marc Holliday", "That\u2019s on new deals, John has.", "John Guinee - Stifel Nicolaus", "Renewals?", "Marc Holliday", "Renewals will be less.", "John Guinee - Stifel Nicolaus", "Then of the structured finance income, how much of that is pure cash actually being generated by the properties? How much of it is accrual? How much of it is coming from some sort of reserve account?", "Marc Holliday", "When you say it, which it are you referring to?", "John Guinee - Stifel Nicolaus", "You\u2019ve got $600 million, $610 million of structured finance assets generate I think $16 million last quarter and income weighted average yield, somewhere in the nine, but that\u2019s not all cash generated from these particular structured finance loans. A lot of that is in a reserve account when you originally setup the deal or it\u2019s on a pay accrue. So how much of that is actually hard cash that the properties are generating?", "Marc Holliday", "Let me break it down to two levels. There\u2019s a question about how much of the interest is being serviced by cash. I\u2019m going to leave that to Greg and/or Matt, if we have that statistic, but the statistic I quoted earlier on that New York portfolio, 6.5 debt yield overall, NOI debt yield or 7%, when pulling out one property, those are cash NOI yields.", "Greg Hughes", "The income recognition, you should assume that 60% to 70% of the structured finance is a cash number.", "John Guinee - Stifel Nicolaus", "So 30% is either a reserve or an accrual?", "Greg Hughes", "That maybe in terms of interest recognition, but in terms of hard cash divided by outstanding debt balance on Manhattan office, that\u2019s 6.5% to 7% yield. If I would coincides, because 10% is the rough average yield and that\u2019s the 25% to 30% since at all sort of time to get\u2026", "John Guinee - Stifel Nicolaus", "Of your $500 million of sort of cash after all the expected pay downs, etc., how much would you expect to use to unwind some of the structured finance deals, pay down the debt senior to you?", "Marc Holliday", "In an example like 100 Church, how much would we expect? There, it\u2019s a lease up situation. We expect that the equity that goes into the property will be for lease up and not for debt pay down.", "Greg Hughes", "There\u2019s also a significant reserve at the first mortgage level at 100 Church, which we expect to be able to access to defray those lease up costs.", "Marc Holliday", "It would be on a case by case basis, but I would say generally if we\u2019re going to come into a situation, take it over, put our resources behind it, and we\u2019re putting cash in that\u2019s going to be something that\u2019s accretive to the property to make it more valuable.", "Greg Hughes", "If you think about it in terms of our liquidity, we would say at this point in time it\u2019s not a meaningful number. We would put it based upon what we think we might take back between now and next year, would be with any $50 million or less.", "Marc Holliday", "We have certain situations, John, where we\u2019ll the mezz will be in restructuring discussions and the first mortgage may still be performing based on the asset level performance. So there, you could potentially because of inter credit agreements, which are preexisting. You could potentially foreclose the equity and assume the first mortgage as it sits with remaining terms.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc", "Just given your comments on capital being on the sidelines, sounds like you\u2019re in the camp that opportunities down the road from either debt default or the wave of maturities maybe limited. So I\u2019m just curious, if that\u2019s correct and if it is, your view, where would you expect to see opportunities?", "Marc Holliday", "I think we believe that the opportunity pipeline is going to open up, which I mentioned in my comments. We see banks beginning to take marks on their assets again and we see special services beginning to start to move loan situations, in other words, sell our whole loans, and resolve other situations and that we think will be the beginning of a transactional pipeline opening up. So we\u2019re very hopeful than in 2010, you\u2019ll see a more transaction in rich environment, where we may be able to find some opportunities.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc", "So this is a follow-up, given that much of your capital sounds like it\u2019s earmarked for debt reduction through 2012 or so, how do you expect to capitalize on the opportunities you might see and does Asia factor into that, your tour through Asia.", "Marc Holliday", "John, In part of that, I had addressed earlier in terms of, I still see that we have substantial cash balances. We\u2019re going to have more cash coming via the non-dividend payment. We have opportunities to either finance real estate or as Greg added, possibly pass the unsecured markets.", "We have the whole potential of monetizing structured finance and/or doing these deals in a JV format in some cases, which in part was reflective of the efforts in Asia. So, I think we\u2019re very resourceful I think in that regard and we grew very substantially when we were just a company at inception 12 years ago and we never found access to capital to be an inhibitor to growth.", "We\u2019re starting from a much better spot today for this next cycle of opportunity, with cash and balance sheet so I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll be able to capitalize the deals. To me, the hard part is always if you find a good deal in midtown Manhattan core real estate, we will find and/or have the capital resources available to do it.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc", "For Steve, maybe just the curious about the lease buyouts during the quarter. You may have mentioned it. I didn\u2019t hear. What was the sort of source and timing? Who\u2019s doing sort of lease terminations these days?", "Steve Durels", "Well, the one that really drove the number was Pfizer bought out of their lease at 220 for its 2 street where they had 40,000 square feet and they paid us $0.94 on the dollar of the remaining obligation which had roughly seven years left on the term. So, obviously in that kind of situation, that\u2019s a great opportunity. We now have almost all of our money and can take the space back to the market and gives we rent it at substantially discounted number we\u2019re way ahead of the game.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc", "So, lease buyouts expected sort to slow down?", "Steve Durels", "We haven\u2019t done that many buyouts where it wasn\u2019t backed up with a replacement tenant simultaneously. In this case the number was so compelling that we took advantage of it but almost every deal that we do a buyout other than that\u2019s where it\u2019s an elective on our part is a coordinated transaction with a replacement tenant.", "Marc Holliday", "", "Operator, we\u2019re done with questions.", "", "Operator", "Yes, we\u2019re done with questions.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. Thank you everyone for calling in today and listening throughout.

", "Thank you.  I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday, please go ahead Marc.", "Marc Holliday", "", "Thank you very much, Heidi.  Please mark that date down, it\u2019s an important date coming up in December for our investor conference.  Hope many or all of you can attend.  I want to welcome you today\u2019s call to review our third quarter earnings and activity.  We had a number of notable accomplishments over the summer.  First and foremost, our core portfolio operating results were very much in line with our increasingly optimistic outlook as market fundamental in Manhattan continue to improve, and rising levels of business earnings, confidence, and space demand, are translating into reduced concessions and modestly increasing rents.", "We held steady our same-store occupancy at about 94 1/2 %, and we expect that figure will begin to rise in the ensuing quarters indicating a bottom of what turned out to be only a marginal occupancy decline over the past three years of somewhere at or under 300 basis points in total.", "Also, new rents on DO signed in the third quarter, slightly exceeded expired rents.  But it\u2019s more important not for the magnitude of the increase, but where the average rents currently sit in the portfolio, which for those expiring leases were only in the low $40 per square foot, leaving substantial room for upside as average rents in our buildings increased over $50 per square foot over the next several years, beginning \u201811. ", "With 2010, the visible improvements have been in our tenant concessions, which have serially declined each quarter in 2010, and free rent on leases that commence in the third quarter which averaged just somewhere between 3 and 4 months.  While it is apparent in the operating metrics, which are firming, what is less apparent, the more important to note, is that market activity over the next 3 to 6 months should drive Midtown Manhattan vacancy levels to under 11%, and result in somewhere between 5% and 10% increases in the face amount of rent in 2011. ", "One of the leading stats underlining our rental forecast is the amount of vacant sublease space available for rent, which is now under 5 million square feet in Midtown after peaking at double-bend numbers less than 18 months ago. ", "We currently have multiple offers in for space at 100 Church Street, which continues to demonstrate that if you have the flexibility to price space at the market-clearing levels, tenants will migrate towards, and even pay a premium for these buildings with well-capitalized ownership.", "Notwithstanding, what we believe to be pent up demand, current indicators appear more muted as private sector job gains have been slow to accelerate.  New York\u2019s largest leading businesses are generally sitting on sizable sums of cash, in some cases holding on to it, and other cases dividending it out to shareholders, but hesitant generally to invest that cash in growth, and new business lines, and new employees until they have a clearer and more acceptable picture in the political landscape, taxation, and new regulations. ", "Conversional wisdom, with say new regulations might have a detrimental impact in our business, but we have seen to date that the disaggregation of business lines resulting from .frank, has in many cases resulted in increased business activity for us as new businesses have been taking space within our properties or other established financial firms have been picking up trading groups and trading lines, and expanding.", "So on a net basis, this has some time to play out, but we\u2019re confident that with time these metrics will only get better for us.  So it\u2019s within this framework of what we see as improving market fundamentals, but where the indicators are still not showing any material degree of market recovery that we are actively and aggressively making investments, recycling capital via asset sales, accessing the capital markets for debt net equity securities, and deploying into new deals that we believe on average will minimally contribute double-digit returns.", "Three Columbus Circle is yet another example of our execution of this strategy, capitalizing on our established market presence in both debt and equity in Manhattan, and our long-standing and mutually beneficial relationship with Joe [inaudible].  We negotiated with him a recapitalization of 3 Columbus.  This was another one-on-one preemptive of opportunity where we were able to bring debt and equity capital to the table to ensure completion of construction, and lease up of the property over a reasonable period of time, in order to get this done.  We have mutuality of vision for the property, we\u2019re both long-term owners, and we think this will be a very successful venture for us.  ", "While this is a project who\u2019s profits will likely be measured over a period of years, at the other end of the spectrum, we had a favorable resolution on 510 Madison Avenue, that only took a period of months.  In fact, three months ago when we had last spoke, we had just settled with Harry Macklowe, after a fairly contentious court proceeding.  Dial forward three months later and our investment in the mortgage and mezzanine positions have been paid off at 100 cents on the dollar, plus reimbursement of most of our expenses.  ", "This certainly demonstrates the velocity in with which debt and equity capital is reengaging in the Midtown market, and the resulting compression of CAP rates that we are now seeing.", "We were framed from hitting up \u2013 for bidding up the price of the assets due to our belief that we would be better served by re-patrioting our investment plus gains and reinvesting it to projects where we felt we had a much better opportunity to make our threshold returns deals like 3 Columbus Circle.  ", "That\u2019s not to say, however, that we don\u2019t believe in [Inaudible] Property\u2019s ability to lease up 510 Madison Avenue, possibly it rents into the triple digits, rents that we think will actually surprise most analysis and be consistent with our view of a recovering market.  ", "However, we simply have a different approach and a different strategy for the business and are targeting more opportunistic returns than we believed we could have earned on reinvesting in essence on the 510 transaction.", "The other investment of note during the quarter was a mortgage investment that we purchased on an asset located in City Center in London.  This was an opportunity that came to us through conversions of several channels.  The building has crossover tenancy to a major company that does business here in New York, who we know well.  It was sourced through one of the big U.S.  based commercial banks with whom we have a deeply established relationship, and we did in conjunction with the London-based asset manager who we have transacted within the past.", "We paid a fairly sizable discount for the loan.  It has a debt yield that we thought was a very attractive debt yield on an absolute risk-adjusted basis.  Given that it\u2019s secured by long-term credit net lease for this relatively new construction property, and net of in-place financing that we put on the investment when we closed.  We have about $20 million plus or minus of equity in the deal, which affords us I thought, a relatively good entry point in both size and product quality.  And a placeholder in the market where we thought we had relatively safe risk-adjusted returns and would give us the ability to see if there were more opportunities that fit alongside this type of an investment or whether would be just be a one-off opportunity that was a unique moment in time for us to take advantage of, and what I\u2019m quite confident it will be a good investment for us.", "With that, I\u2019m going to turn this over to Andrew, who will give you more background and stats on the quarter. ", "Andrew Mathias", "", "Thanks, Marc.  We had a very active third quarter on the acquisition on this position front.  As Marc mentioned, yesterday we announced our strategic joint venture with Joe [inaudible] on 3 Columbus Circle.  This off-market transaction on a 770,000 square-foot Class A property is the combination of our 10-plus year relationship as a buyer, seller, and lender to Joe. ", "The terms of our investment include a $250 million standby mortgage commitment and a future equity interest on the building.  The deal will play out in more detail, as Joe contest the activities as an aggressive lender, including a complaint being served today, and a detailed answer to the pending foreclosure; an action he believes is inappropriate.", "We look forward to jointly completing the re-development of the building with Joe, and believe it\u2019s important for the tenant market to know that the building is not being demolished, and is a prime big block of space available for lease in Midtown.", "In September, we closed our sale of 19 West 44th Street, another highly successful repositioning by our leasing and management teams.  We were emboldened to see foreign institutional buyers step up for a very well-located, but mid-block asset.  At over $420 per square foot, and a sub 6% 2011 return to the buyer, we believe 19 West was a strong statement for the market.", "And the final chapter for SL Green has not yet been written on the building, as the buyer asked our team to stay on as an incentivized managing and leasing agent of the building.  The proceeds from that sale were reinvested via reversed 1031 exchanged into 125 Park Avenue.  ", "The quarter also saw us complete the final phase of our capitalization of 600 Lexington, with our closing of a $125 million refinancing of that building.  This loan is a good indication of one contributors to the resurgence of the New York market.  The loan material exceeds our underwriting in terms of proceeds, rate, and term, and will help us optimize our joint venture on that asset with CPP. ", "The fourth quarter should also give us significant additional insight into the market, with several major buildings currently on the market including 111 8th Avenue, and 13 36th Avenue.  The majority of the trading activity, however, continues to be in structured finance though it\u2019s within the duct stacks of existing buildings and in new capital structures.", "Our own structure finance program gives us a powerful seed of many of these tables.  In the quarter among other things, we added to our position, 280 Park Avenue, and originated a mezzanine loan on new acquisition of a 5th Avenue building that we had bid for but were unsuccessful in buying.", "We continue to see great relative value in this business today.  And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Greg.", "Greg Hughes", "", "Great, thanks, Andrew.  I think as everybody can see from what we\u2019ve been through so far, it\u2019s been a very, very active quarter for the company.  When you look at the sale of 19 West 44th Street, the repayment of 510 Madison, the refinancing of 600 Lexington, and our $345 million convertible note issuance, people can once again see that the company enjoys very, very strong access to various sources of capital.  In fact, year to date we have raised over $2 billion through property sales, structure finance payoffs, property financing, unsecured note issuance, convertible note issuances, prep-equity issuances, and of course the free cash flow from the company\u2019s operations.", "This access to various sources of capital, coupled with the solid performance of our portfolio during a very difficult time, and a substantial de-leveraging that has taken place over the last two years are the primarily reasons we believe our balance sheet is in solid shape as we close out the quarter. ", "At the quarter end, we have $343 million of cash on hand, which does not include the $337 million of proceeds from our convertible note issuance that settled the second week of October.  At quarter end, our debt to EBITDA was approximately 8 times, which is in line with our targeted debt to EBITDA multiple established last December.", "Our credit facility, which many had perceived to be a refinancing risk, had $800 million outstanding at quarter end, and has been sequentially repaid down to $700 million in October; roughly half of where it was just 10 months ago.  This coupled with the strength in the bank credit markets, should alleviate any concerns surrounding the refinanciability of that facility.", "It does remain the case that we operated a slightly higher debt to EBITDA ratio than many of our peers, but we believe there\u2019s good reason for this.  The demand for New York City assets, clearly demonstrates that our assets are among the most liquid.  With CAP ranging from 5 to 6%, the real-estate markets clearly ascribing much higher value to the NOI underpinning our EBITDA than most of peers. ", "The average term of our office leases is approximately 8 years, making it the longest in the office sector.  The credit composition of tenants is one of the best in the industry, and continues to improve.  Our largest tenant city group continues to show solid improvement and the credit ratings for two of our largest tenants, Viacom and Amerada Hess have been upgraded this year.", "Accordingly, in comparing leverage in credit metrics, it is important to remember that all cash flows are not created equally.", "Other quick items of note on the balance sheet, the balance sheet quarter end of course reflects the sale of 19 West 44th Street, and the closing of 125 Park Avenue which included the assumption of $146 million mortgage.  A structure finance balance end of the quarter at $907 million increased principally for the new investments, at 280 Park, as well as the structure finance investment in London that Marc had mentioned, offset by the retirement of our first mortgage on mezzanine investments at 510 Madison.", "Note that the London investment was executed through joint venture and has been financed with $62.8 million of non-recourse lending.  So the company\u2019s equity investment sits at around $23 million although the gross investment of 86.3 is reflected in this structure finance balance.", "Turning to the P&L, it was obviously a very successful quarter, highlighted by the gain we realized at 510 Madison.  Excluding this gain, the quarter is right on top of what we reported last quarter, which is a solid result given the seasonal increases in expenses that we once again saw during the third quarter.", "The third quarter trends were as expected; and continue to point to the recovery that we previously projected.  The mark-to-market on our New York rents for the quarter was 1.3% but as Marc diluted to, and more importantly, we started to see a decline in concessions with TIs averaging just $18 and free rent to 3 months compared to $56 and 6.9 months a year ago, and $21 and 3 months free rent during in the first half of this year.", "Our occupancy remained at 94.4%, originally we had expected to see a dip in occupancy during the third quarter, but as a result of the strong leasing activity, we are ahead of schedule and expect to finish the year higher than our original goal of 94%.", "Our same-store NOI for the quarter was down 2.83%, but as always, this includes lease cancellation income in this calculation.  If one were to exclude the lease cancellation income from the third quarter of last year, same-store NOI was actually up 1% for the quarter.", "In the suburbs, our rent declined by 9% which is principally attributable to our decision to aggressively pursue the retention of Pepsi at 100 Summit, where we realized a significant roll down in rents on their 75,000 square foot renewal.", "Excluding this, the suburbs actually realized a 3% increase in the mark-to-market rents on the balance of the leases during the quarter.  SOG share of property NOI from JDs, was down for the quarter which is principally attributable to the sale of 1221 Avenue of Americas during the middle of the second quarter.  This investment had contributed roughly $10 million per quarter of NOI.", "A structured finance income of the quarter of course, included the gain from 510 Madison,  In addition, during the quarter recorded a $5 million reserve on a mezzanine position related to a non New York City asset.  This reserve was offset in part by a $3.6 million gain, on an asset which we had previously fully reserved.", "Other income for the quarter was down slightly from last quarter which included leasing commissions at 1515 Broadway, realized during the second quarter.  MG&A for the quarter was approximately $18.4 million consistent with the previously two quarters and in line with our original guidance. ", "As we look forward to the fourth quarter, we seem well on track to meet our revised guidance of $4.75 for the year, needing just $0.84 during the fourth quarter to meet this target. ", "We have not adjusted guidance at this point in time pending the deployment of the proceeds from our convertible note issuance.  Note that the coupon on these notes is 3% but the actual interest charge for county purposes is 5.6%, to give effect to the cost associated with the conversion feature.", "We expect some temporary dissolution from this issuance until the proceeds are fully deployed. ", "We continue to be a very active \u2013 very active on the investment front for which we are penalized under the new accounting rules.  While we do not have a current estimate of the fourth quarter transaction expenses, we expect them to be higher in the third quarter.  The timing of structure finance repayment as well as interest rates represents additional variables to the fourth quarter results.", "Based upon these variables, we continue to maintain our guidance for the year and will give greater color surrounding 2011 at the investor conference on December 6.  With that, I\u2019d like to turn it back to Marc.", "Marc Holliday", "", "Okay, we tried to keep our remarks relatively brief today because we wanted to leave enough time for full amount of questions, which we\u2019re prepared to answer now.  ", "The one thing that I would just add, since not everybody makes it to the end of the Q&A session, we will do, as we\u2019ve done in the past, a very thorough market perspective and outlook for \u201811 at the December meeting, which is about a little over \u2013 a little less than a month and a half away.  So you can\u2019t do justice on a call like this to anything other than really a review of the results.  But in that forum, we\u2019ll have an opportunity to look at a lot of the trends that we see going on in the market right now, and try to pinpoint fairly accurately, as we\u2019ve tried to do in the past for you, where we see premium rents heading ,to what degree, what we think the drivers of those things are, maybe some more anecdotal information from a lot of the tenants in our portfolio that we see either actively approaching us for space now, or looking to lock in early renewals out 2, 3 years or more from now, and try to quantify what kind of effect that will have on our earnings.  And hopefully, share price in a positive sense as we move forward.  But for now, I would say, let\u2019s just open it up to questions and we\u2019ll try and get to as many as we can.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions)  Our first question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel Nicolaus", "John Guinee \u2013 Steifel Nicolaus", "Very, very nice job.  Two quick questions.  One is Greg, I guess you\u2019ve figured out your tax planning and dividend treatment for the next few years now.  Can you keep the dividend as long as you have, retaining cash.  ", "And then the second question is, I was looking over your ground lease summary on Page 30, every few quarters you come up with buying back the ground lessor.  Do you have any issues or concerns with your ground leases going forward? ", "Greg Hughes ", "", "I would say first as it relates to the dividend, obviously we have a significant amount of taxable income from the sale of 1221, which was not sheltered through 1031, and from the gain on the repayment of 510.  We\u2019re fine with the distribution level for 2010.  I think originally we would have thought that there\u2019d be no adjustment required to dividend until at least 2012.  I think given the acceleration of the significant amount of taxable income into this year, we\u2019ll have to re-evaluate 2011.  We\u2019re in the process of doing various taxable income estimates for 2011 and I think in December we\u2019ll be able to offer you a better point of view as to if the dividend needs to be adjusted in 2011.  It\u2019s certainly fine for this year in the fourth quarter and in the process of redoing 2011 estimates. ", "As it relates to the ground, I think there was a modification that 670 \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, 711 Third and we periodically have opportunities to take in pieces of that and consolidate it, which we did there and we\u2019ve done previously at 420.  ", "So I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a problem, it\u2019s we had the capital and sometimes those opportunities present themselves.  They\u2019re generally small and we just kind of take advantage of them when they \u2013 when they\u2019re out there. ", "Andrew Mathias", "", "I would add to that, we extended out the least on 420, as Greg just mentioned.  We acquired it in the fee on 919 Third during this downturn.  We had an opportunity to do that.  Modified 711, we have the absolute right to acquire the fees on 379 West Broadway and also 461 Fifth.  Short of that, I don\u2019t think there are any other near-term situations that we would characterize as warranting any intense scrutiny at this moment unless you\u2019re looking at one \u2013 a specific one that you want to know about. ", "John Guinee \u2013 Steifel Nicolaus", "Will 711 Third transition to a fee in 2012?  I just noticed that the cash payment dissipated after \u201911.  ", "Andrew Mathias", "", "No, 711 is actually owned in fee by [inaudible].  That partner has never stressed an interest to sell and doesn\u2019t look to.  ", "John Guinee \u2013 Steifel Nicolaus", "Thank you. ", "Andrew Mathias", "", "We don\u2019t have the fee there, John.  The other half is sell by a third party.  ", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from the line of Jay Habermann with Goldman Sachs.  Please proceed. ", "Jay Habermann \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Good afternoon.  Marc, you mentioned with trends improving, I\u2019m just wondering with your stock now trading still at an implied value per square foot at around 500 or 520, you know, is this a more compelling investment say then originating structured finance at this point in the cycle? ", "Marc Holliday ", "Is what a more compelling investment? ", "Jay Habermann \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Buying back your own stock versus originating structured finance investments? ", "Marc Holliday", "", "You know, we\u2019ve \u2013 we get \u2013 we bought that stock in the past.  We\u2019ve done it with mixed results.  I think we\u2019ve been rewarded much more from shareholders by reinvesting our equity and making very sizable returns in some cases and sizable returns in others.  There\u2019s been a few bumps along the way, but on a net-net basis, it\u2019s been very profitable and has afforded us five or six good properties and it keeps us embedded.  ", "Without the structured finance programs, Jay, I don\u2019t think we get 1775 equity deal, 3 Columbus Circle.  I don\u2019t think we get it.  I think that\u2019s \u2013 what you saw there was six or eight incremental transactions with Joe [inaudible], all successful and all of which created a moment in time for us to step in on a one-on-one and get that deal done.  So I think that\u2019s a better use of the company\u2019s capital, but it\u2019s always in hindsight.  The stock, you know, we could be proven wrong on that, or maybe the real estate values will compress to a five or sub-five cap and we\u2019ll be happy we bought the real estate.  But I think generally we\u2019ve \u2013 we\u2019ve certainly done both.  We\u2019ve invested in structure, we\u2019ve invested in stock and at the moment we\u2019re more interested at this point in the cycle in asset growth than we are shrinking the equity base. ", "Jay Habermann \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay.  And just a second question, can you comment on \u2013 I guess you left open the guidance for the full year.

We\u2019ve talked about 666 possibly repaying, although we think at this point that probably we\u2019ll be out through the balance of the quarter, but want to provide some room there in case it gets paid down.  ", "I think you will see us carry a large cash balance through the fourth quarter depending upon when some of the proceeds for 1775 actually get deployed to, so that higher cash balance will be somewhat diluted during the fourth quarter.  And I would say probably the biggest variable are these transaction costs that have to be expensed now and are very, very hard to budget for.  We had people that run around here every week trying to estimate what those costs are going to be, but when you try and pin down what brokerage costs are going to be and transfer tax costs are going to be, and what you have to pay professional fees, it\u2019s very, very hard to do.  We have 1775, we have 280, we have a lot of other investments that we\u2019re evaluating so all I can tell you is I know that number\u2019s going to be higher, maybe a lot higher than it was in the third quarter.  And unfortunately we would have to expense that.  ", "So it\u2019s $0.15 off of what our third quarter run rate was.  So could you see $0.05 dilution from carrying cash proceeds and then another $0.10 of dilution related to transaction expenses?

And then, you know, we probably go out and, so you might see use draw on that defunded, but then do additional property sales to pay that back down.  So we have that type of immediate liquidity.  I think plus 300 million of cash on hand.  So you know, you can make the case that we have $1 billion of liquidity.

I think the supplement showed it around 207,000 square feet.  City renewed for about 82,000 square feet, and the mark-to-market would have been a positive 3.3% but for the Pepsi transaction, 75,000 square feet in Valhalla, which as I said, brought down those numbers.

And we, unfortunately, work with all of the various agencies set up to try and track and retain these tenants, but there just doesn\u2019t seem to be a lot of money, or emphasis on doing that as much so as I mentioned, in Connecticut.

", "Sri Nagarajan \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "", "Yeah, thanks.  A quick question on the \u2013 I think you said in your prepared remarks about some letter of intent signed for the 100 Church Street space.  I\u2019m wondering what kind of \u2013 what percentage lease would that put you at, or what kind of square footage are we talking about there? ", "Marc Holliday", "", "Yeah.  We do have good activity on that space with multiple people, you know trading proposals with us and we see a path to get into north of 70% occupancy in the, you know, in the relatively near future.  ", "Sri Nagarajan \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "So that kind of dovetails with your remarks that it was about 70% leased already with HealthFirst lease? ", "Steve Durels", "", "Yeah.  This is Steve.  Some of the activity, which I would \u2013 I don\u2019t know what you say, letter of intent, these are \u2013 these are proposals, term sheets in some cases, early-staged leases.  So nothing we would be comfortable in quoting a deal.  ", "Sri Nagarajan \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "What do you think the 70% may increase to in the next six months or so? ", "Steve Durels", "I think a good shot would probably be end of this year or first \u2013 early first quarter next year so that we get the building up to 80-85% occupied.  There\u2019s a reasonable shot that we get a lot further than that based on the deal we\u2019ve got.  We have offers in that have actively been negotiated which short listed for three or four tenants of very large size that would almost make them 100%. ", "Sri Nagarajan \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "That\u2019s very helpful.  My second question is on the 510 Madison gain, obviously the business has increased your FFO well above expectations.  If you could share with us what the compensation impact would be for 2010 and \u201911, just based on the gains, that would be helpful. ", "Marc Holliday", "", "Well, the compensation program is not directly tied to these gains.  There\u2019s a \u2013 there\u2019s a component of performance based [inaudible] that are based on either increases in share price above thresholds or increases above FFO, above thresholds.  But the \u2013 the total return to shareholders is so dramatically exceeded the threshold to date, now the FFO as well, that should \u2013 that\u2019s \u2013 those shares, but there\u2019s no incremental comp program or strategy that\u2019s tied to that FFO generation.  ", "Sri Nagarajan \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "So just to sum it up, your stock performance all overrides anything at this time? ", "Marc Holliday", "Stock performance, [inaudible]. ", "Sri Nagarajan \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Yeah, I was just saying that your stock performance year to date overrides your \u2013 any other factor such as FFO at this point in time. ", "Marc Holliday", "", "Yeah, for \u201910 and \u201911 is a new ballgame. ", "Sri Nagarajan \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Okay.  Thanks. ", "Operator", "", "There are no further question at this time.  I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday for any closing remarks. ", "Marc Holliday", "", "Great.  Well, I appreciate for those still listening the way we left time for the questions.  I hope that was informative and look forward to spending some quality time with everybody in December.

This conference call is being recorded.  ", "I would now turn it over to Heidi Gillette, of SL Green. ", "Heidi Gillette", "Good afternoon, all.  At this time the company would like to remind the listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements.  Actual results may differ from predictions that management may make today.  Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the company\u2019s Form 10-K and the other reports filed with the SEC.", "Also, during today\u2019s call, the company may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G.  The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure discussed and the reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found on the company\u2019s current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC today.

", "In December, executive management provided substantial commentary at its investor conference addressing both past performance as well as detailing the estimates for 2011.  Therefore, for today\u2019s call we will be utilizing an abbreviated format from that of other quarters past.  Initial commentary will come only from Chief Executive Officer, Marc Holliday, then we turn the call over immediately to Q&A.  As a reminder, for the Q&A section, please limit your questions to two per person.  Thank you, I will now the call over to Marc Holliday.  Please go ahead Marc.  ", "Marc Holliday", "", "Thank you, Heidi.  Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today.  We were pleased to close out the year with a solid fourth quarter in which occupancy was up sequentially, same-store NOI was up year over year, and earnings came in slightly higher than we had forecasted.", "SLG portfolio leasing volume in Manhattan topped out at over 800,000 square feet for the quarter, which is reflective of the continued strengthening of the Manhattan leasing market.  ", "In December and January alone, we signed major new and renewal leases with Acom at 100 Park Avenue, Greater New York at 555 West 57th, New York State at 100 Church Street, Wells Fargo at 100 Park, and CUNY, the City University of New York, also at 555 West 57th Street.  That\u2019s all essentially within under 60 days.", "Looking at the broader Midtown market, there was 5 \u00bd million square feet of net absorption in 2010 driving the vacancy rate below 11% in Midtown to right around 10 1/2 % as we stand today.  Of that amount, less than 3% is sublet space and a smaller proportion of that is what we would term competitive. ", "As detailed in our December investor conference, there are only about a half dozen continuous blocks in Midtown in excess of 250,000 square feet, and the large block requirements in the market right now far exceed that inventory.", "Tenants known or rumored to be looking at the space 200,000 square feet and above includes such firms as Nomura, UBS, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Hobbis Advertising, J.Crew, Credit Agricola, Oppenhimer & Co., Coach, Wells Fargo, WilmerHale, Morrison Foerster, in addition to many, many others.", "Anecdotally, I would say this activity is at the highest level I\u2019ve seen in the market in any January, a traditionally slow month, exceeding anything I\u2019ve seen and recalled since 2006.  ", "The reason driving this activity in large part can be attributed to the private sector job growth in Manhattan, which amounted for about 50,000 private sector jobs added in New York City in 2010.  Of that, about half or 25,000 were office-sector using jobs.  ", "The prediction for 2011 by city forecast was for less than that amount, and if you recall, in December I had given a range of 10,000 to 20,000 office-using job growth for the year, which exceeded the cities estimates.  ", "I fully expect the city is going to come out and revise its estimates sometime in February to reflect the effects of the extension of the Bush-era tax cuts, the lowering of FICA payroll deductions by 2 percentage points, and the effects \u2013 the positive effects of [inaudible] which I think will be most positively felt and effected here in New York City.  All of which, I believe will result in about another 50,000 private sector jobs being added to the payrolls in \u201911, about 25,000 of which will be or should be office-using jobs.  Which means that with another 5 million square feet of absorption in 2011, I think we may inch our way closer to that equilibrium number of around 9% which is the point at which I think that pricing power will be at least neutral, or at least going back to an economically rational market for net effective rents and start to put the market favorable nature back into the hands of the landlords.", "In addition to an improving leasing market, external growth drove earnings in 2010.  Much of this activity was reviewed last month at the investor conference, but since that date there has been additional activity including the buyout of City Investment Fund\u2019s interest in 521 5th Avenue, the closing of the purchase of three fee interest in Midtown Manhattan office buildings in the GKK transaction, and additional investments in debt and preferred equity securities bringing total structured finance investments for the year to almost $500 million.  ", "As Heidi mentioned earlier, we\u2019re going to curtail the prepared remarks and we\u2019re going to jump right into Q&A.  I would urge all of you who haven\u2019t either reviewed the transcript or done the playback for our investor conference just a month and half ago, I think if you do that you\u2019ll find an extraordinary amount of information.  I think it was about 2 \u00bd hours plus of strategic insight for 2011; our views on the market, inventory, how current trends related to historic trends, and a lot of data and strategic rationale for the structure finance portfolio.  Much more than we can cover and should cover on an earnings call, but all of which was covered in great detail in December.", "We set out goals and objectives and guidance in December.  We maintained all of that today.  It was an ambitious set of goals and objectives but it\u2019s one we feel we\u2019re off to a very good start in 2011, and should be well on track to meeting our objectives.", "The market momentum, generally I would characterize as one of declining vacancy, obviously declining sublet availabilities, tenants with real requirements for big blocks as I mentioned earlier, little to no new inventory being added, and very low interest rate environment and private sector and office-using job growth.  ", "That\u2019s a great confluence of factors that I think will put us well on track to meeting or exceeding our estimates which were given very early on.  In fact, over a year ago when we talked about 25% rental growth from trough rents back in 2009.  I think you\u2019ve seen at 5 to 10% growth in our portfolio and in the market already.  You\u2019ve seen shrinking concessions, and I know that over that three-year period we should be well in hand to achieve that 25% target or more.  ", "I wouldn\u2019t over analyze or be confused by the fact that the mark-to-market today doesn\u2019t reflect those numbers because you\u2019re not \u2013 those numbers are comparing not the trough rents, and therefore not reflective of growth.  They\u2019re comparing to rents that are expiring.  And rents that are expiring today, by and large were rents done in 2000 and 2001 which was almost on par with the 067 peak rents.  And in fact, those \u201900 and \u201901 rents had been escalating for 10 years, and also had base-rent increases compounding that.  So when you take near-peak rents 10 years ago, factor in base-rent increases and escalation increases, you\u2019re going to get into some very high rents that are rolling off in the years \u201910 and \u201911, which is why our guidance for those years was minus 5 to plus 5 for last year and for 2011. ", "For last year, we were right on target; this year we feel confident as well.  We\u2019ll be right within guidance.  And then the rents that start rolling off in \u201912 and beyond are more reflective of the \u201902, \u201803, and \u201804 rents which was a much worse leasing environment where I think we\u2019ll achieve much higher mark-to-markets.  But most importantly, today rents to trough rents are much more favorable.  And we are seeing not just \u2013 not just predicting, but seeing tangible evidence of those increases.  So that is why we set that bar high for ourselves in December.  That\u2019s why we reaffirm guidance today.  And with that, I would like to open it up for Q&A.", "Just to confirm for people who is here today, we\u2019re joined by a slightly different cast.  As usual, Andrew Mathias, Steve Green, Steve Durels, Andy Levine, and Matt DiLiberto are with me for the Q&A portion.  Jim Mead is here for his inaugural run at an investor earnings call and we welcome Jim.  And we also welcome David Schonbraun and Isaac Zion who were both promoted to co-CIO, taking the mantle from Andrew Mathias, are here today and will also give some input on some of your questions regarding the investment fronts.  So with that, Heidi, let\u2019s start the Q&A.  ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "(Operator instructions).  Our first question will come from the line of John Guinee with Steifel Nicolaus, please proceed with your question.", "John Guinee \u2013 Steifel Nicolaus", "Oh, hi.  Thank you very much.  This is regarding 885 3rd, 2 Herald Square and 292 Madison.  It appears to me, and Marc or Jim, correct me if I\u2019m wrong that you went from a JV ground lessor investment wholly owned ground lessor investment.  And for example, on the balance sheet it looks like your other assets went up by 525 million, your land and land interest went up by 290 million, total consolidated debt went up by 633 while at the same time investments and unconsolidated JVs went down by 146 and portion of the JV debt went down by 215.  Can you walk through the sort of the accounting overall, the balance sheet changes, how these three investment use to run through the income statement, how they run through the income statement now, the risk profile on the investments, the leverage philosophy on the investments, and then the cash and GAAP income returns and the per square foot investment basis?", "Marc Holliday", "I think John, we\u2019re going to give you all of it and we\u2019re only going to penalize you for the two questions.  But let\u2019s start with the accounting, and income side of it.  Jim and Matt, why don\u2019t you take that then we\u2019ll flip it on over to us.", "Jim Mead", "Let me do the simple one, the asset treatment on the balance sheet.  We bought the fee interest and if we had bought the buildings we would have allocated the buildings between land and building.  In this case, because the buildings are under lease, we can\u2019t put that part of it in our balance sheet of the building.  We put it into other assets.  So basically, take the purchase price allocated between land and building, but in this case we\u2019re calling the building the other assets, and that\u2019s why you see the other assets going up by so much.  And yes, effectively we\u2019re converting an investment in joint venture into a wholly-owned investment and we\u2019re booking 100% of the asset, 100% of the debt.  And I think that generally speaking, you\u2019ve got the right accounting there.  I\u2019ll let Matt touch on the income side.", "Matt DiLiberto", "The income statement is actually, I mean it\u2019s simpler to understand what was recognized in the income from unconsolidated joint ventures.  Just for 885 and 2, we\u2019re speaking about, will now be consolidated through our rental revenues and consolidated expense line items.  As we move forward, 292 is obviously a new acquisition so that will also be included if not, consolidated revenues consolidated [inaudible].", "Marc Holliday", "All right, and on the asset side, Andrew, do you want to check off?  David, you can certainly chime in on the \u2013 I think John, your question\u2019s related to what\u2019s the risk profile of the investment and the leverage strategy.", "Andrew Levine", "I think these were intended to be and are extraordinarily low-risk investments.  They represented between 40 and 50% or so of purchase price of the assets when these assets traded at the peak.  And I would say the leveraged strategy sort of mirrors that in that you have a very secure investment that has a long time period to run and you \u2013 therefore we put long-term fixed rate leverage on the assets at a time when we could get very efficient financing that mature between 2016 and 2017.  ", "I think a good example of that is on the lipstick building where you just saw the lease hold of the building essentially go through a restructuring, go through a prepackaged bankruptcy, and ownership of the leasehold mortgage change hands with some debt forgiveness given by Royal Bank of Canada.  But you still have somebody investing new capital into that deal at a basis of over $110 million in the leasehold.  So therefore, we take a lot of comfort at the feet position that whoever\u2019s investing new cash into that situation is intending to make their rental payments under the fee, and ultimately extend or purchase the fee based on the options that are embedded in those leases.", "John Guinee \u2013 Steifel Nicolaus", "And your leases run through how long?  You know the master lease with the\u2026", "Marc Holliday", "They were approximately 99 year leases with initial terms of around 15 to 20 years with the resets every 10 to 20 years thereafter depending on the lease.", "John Guinee \u2013 Steifel Nicolaus", "And they have the right to purchase the fee at points in time?", "Marc Holliday", "Correct.  They were designed so usually within 20 years of the initial date they would have a purchase option and each reset they have a purchase option at a higher price that ratchets up.  They were kind of designed to give them an incentive to hit them, otherwise the payments get exceedingly higher.", "John Guinee \u2013 Steifel Nicolaus", "Difference between GAAP and cash on this?", "Marc Holliday", "", "It\u2019s around a 4% cash as we sit today and the GAAP yield is going to be north of 10%.", "John Guinee \u2013 Steifel Nicolaus", "Got you, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with ISI Group, please proceed with your question.", "Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group", "Hi, good afternoon.  Just a couple of questions.  First, for Steve Durels.  Can you just go back through some of the larger blocks of space that Mark had mentioned, and just give us an idea of whether those tenants are just looking at spaces of similar size that they currently occupy, are these expansions, downsizings, and just kind of what is the landscape for these tenants today.  I guess start with that.", "Steve Durels", "It\u2019s a void, it\u2019s a combination of everything.  Maybe rather than be specific to the list of those tenants that he spoke to because I think the intention was to really demonstrate how much activity there is in the marketplace right now.  ", "Let me make a couple of points.  One is, you noticed off that list there was a good number of financial service tenants.  There were a good number of big center banks and there were a good number of very, very large transactions.  Many of those tenants are either doing consolidations from multiple locations or their doing just pure relocations because their moving out of space that\u2019s where it would be too expensive to really rebuild the space around them.  ", "But to go through a couple of them specifically, you know Nomura started in the market with a search for 400,000 square feet, maybe a year and a half ago.  And I\u2019m going to go off just basically sort of general market rumor anyway.  There\u2019s a 400,000-foot search.  While the search was going on, they leased 200,000 square feet through a variety of different transactions.  It was originally going to be a downtown location.  They\u2019ve now moved their search to Midtown and the requirement has grown to 800,000 square feet.  ", "I think that\u2019s a pretty big statement as to where the markets come from a year ago, if I\u2019ve been answering the same question in January of 2010.  UBS, unclear as to what their requirement is for 800,000 square feet.  They just renewed for 700,000 square feet in New Jersey, they\u2019re now believed to be searching the market for a front office requirement of somewhere in the neighborhood of 800,000 square feet.  B of A, you know, rumor is they\u2019ll leave downtown and come to Midtown, but they still keep a small footprint, or a relatively small footprint downtown.  ", "Morgan Stanley\u2019s in the market for a couple of requirements of 5 to 700,000 feet apiece.  One is probably a Midtown requirement, one is probably downtown requirement at the end of the day.  But they haven\u2019t made any decisions yet.  It\u2019s been a search that\u2019s been ongoing for the past year.  ", "Coach is out there for 500,000 square feet and all the headlines in the papers have been that they\u2019re [inaudible] talking to them about new development on the west side.  Rail yards, Hobbis has been searching the market for 400,000 feet.  Interestingly enough, this is a service \u2013 an advertising services business that is finding it very challenging to put all of their requirements under one roof at the price point that they seek, which says two things.  One if you\u2019re looking for sort of that value office rental rate, that supply is tightening up very quickly.  And they may find themselves having to split the operation.  ", "Wells Fargo, rumored to be negotiating a lease right now on a block of space that\u2019s been vacant for and been marketed for the past year and a half.  And then there\u2019s a couple of law firms out there in the market for a couple of hundred thousand square feet a pop.  ", "So you know, a couple of conclusions.  One there\u2019s diversity of the tenant base, two there\u2019s a lot of demand for financial services that we didn\u2019t see a year, year and a half ago, three not everybody\u2019s going to land the kind of space that they would have thought they could land a year and a half ago, and four the net result of this is concessions.  Concessions are timing and the net affects are slowly creeping up.", "Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group", "Okay, thanks, that\u2019s helpful.  And then secondly, Marc, could you or Isaac, or somebody else just talk a little bit about the investment opportunities that you\u2019re seeing in the marketplace today?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I would say that having just come off of a big year which carried through to a \u2013 one of the reframes in December, I think it was December 7, our investor meeting, was hey that\u2019s great, but isn\u2019t it going to be challenging in the future.  And then we went out and we did 521, closed up [inaudible] fee consolidations where the 3 Columbus deal is relatively new and we made some new structured investments in debt and equity securities that I think will yield, or could yield some future pipeline 2011.  ", "So I just have always found for over a decade now good mortgage, bad mortgage, tight, not tight, or platform.  And our approach to the business seems to attract deal flow.  We have a lot \u2013 we have a very big pipeline deals right now that we\u2019re evaluating for both debt and equity investment.  We gave a goal at the December meeting of greater than $400 million of new investments, and I think with GKK and 521 were probably at or maybe in excess of that already.  So that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t intend to do anything for the balance of the year but I think you\u2019ll see our future investments balance with some divestitures.  And we\u2019re probably going to increase the pace of some of those divestitures to prune profits which we love to do.  ", "I think we\u2019re one of the few [inaudible] that sequentially and serially roll out mature properties, take gains, reinvest in some new buildings.  We\u2019ve done it throughout.  I think we\u2019re close to \u2013 or in excess of $4 billion of that kind of activity, and you\u2019ll see more of that clearly this year with the first being a deal that should hit the market with the next forecast.", "Isaac Zion", "Yeah, basically within the next couple of days we\u2019re bringing 28 plus 44th to the marketplace, and as Marc said, this is a mature asset that\u2019s 93% leased.  We\u2019ve created a lot of value in the asset by upgrading the lobby and doing certain things in tenant spaces.  But we feel now is the time to bring that asset to market and feel we\u2019ll get a lot of traction in the marketplace.", "Marc Holliday", "", "So Steve, I would say, full pipeline, pretty confident in our ability to execute and we\u2019ll probably necessitate and increase in divestitures.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.  Please proceed with your question.", "Rob Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "Thanks guys, maybe a question for Matt or Jim.  Can you guys talk about what drove the increase of reserves in the structure finance side, and whether or not, what your expectations are as we move throughout 2011?", "Matt DiLiberto", " ", "Sure, so about half of the reserves we took in the fourth quarter were on the structure finance book.  It\u2019s actually taken down to a zero position we had outside of New York that we had previously taken a reserve on in the prior quarter.  The other component that\u2019s in there is we live closely and the accounting rules are a little intricate for off balance sheet joint ventures, but there was a very small venture out in New Jersey that when we did the analysis we took right around a $3 million market on that position.  It\u2019s an equity in real estate, it\u2019s not in the structured finance portfolio.  But you know, we discussed in pretty significant depth in December about where we sat with reserves and how we felt about the existing portfolio and I think we\u2019ve taken a lot of marks and we feel pretty good where we stand now.  We haven\u2019t layered in \u2013 you know, expected additional reserves into 2011, and I think we have adequately marked book as to where it stands today.", "Rob Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "Okay, and then as a follow up, can you tell me a little bit about G&A?  Is this just the normal fourth quarter bonus in there or is there any material charge for the CFO change in there?  Is there anything else that would not be in a regular run rate going as we move throughout the rest of the year?", "Marc Holliday", " ", "I\u2019m going to let Jim and Matt handle this, but one piece which I think is the majority when you get down to some granular detail on the difference.  We finished up towards the end of the year either signing or negotiating management contracts with approximately 8 to 10 or so of the senior-level employees department heads in essence, whose contracts either had or where expiring throughout \u201910.  So at this point, estimates were done throughout the year.  I think the good news/bad news, depending, I look at it most as good news, the stock price having ticked up towards the end of the year drove the cost of the stock component of some of those new contracts up I think only about a million or so beyond what we had forecasted at lower stock price.  But I know at least a million of the million in change of increase is attributable to that.

I know you guys signed some longer leases in the quarter and that helped drive up some of the concession packages but they seemed fairly high nonetheless.  And so I was wondering if you could talk about Tis, leasing commissions, free rent going forward, if the environment tightens further as you talked about.", "Unidentified Company Representative ", " ", "Yeah, there\u2019s a couple \u2013 looking back first off, there were a couple of deals that hit in the quarter that one were negotiated.  In the case of one deal, was as much as a year and a half ago where the terms were negotiated, the deal was papered and it was a forward commitment.  So it was sort of at the bottom of a dark day, it just happened that it came online in the fourth quarter. ", "A couple of the other deals that really drove the concession package numbers; the 170,000-foot deal done downtown, and obviously there\u2019s a different concession package that one receives when negotiating downtown and in that case it was for HeathFirst versus the Midtown deals.  That was 170/2000 square feet so it influenced the overall average.  ", "Going forward, in the deals that we\u2019re negotiating today, it\u2019s worth noting, we\u2019ve got a couple of hundred thousand square feet of leases that have already been signed since the investor conference with a significantly improved mark-to-market over what we saw in the fourth quarter.  ", "Concessions have started to tighten.  And as a rule of thumb I would say where typically you would have seen 12 to 14 months of free rent on space that was raw and where the tenant was building up the space, now it\u2019s more typical the concessions are 10 to maybe 12, but I\u2019d say 10 months is more on target.  ", "The Acom deal that we just signed at 100 Park Avenue for 90,000 square feet, that was a 10-month deal and that\u2019s probably the most recent deal inked that was for vacant space, that was done early the last two weeks in December.  ", "TIs, where you would said last year, almost every deal irrespective of size, we would have had to either build the space or give it up cash to fully fund the construction of this space for a tenant, which meant TIs were on many spaces, going into the $75 to $80 range, even though \u2013 and remember these all get averaged out because the combination of renewal deals, and some deals where we retrofit space.  But for raw space you saw a lot of deals that influenced our averages that went into that kind of TI package.  Now they\u2019re more into the 60 to $65 range when the deals being negotiated today.  So concessions have tightened, and we\u2019re seeing the pace ramp \u2013 inch up as well.  And I think that\u2019s pretty consistent of what we were feeling at the end of last year and we\u2019re seeing it roll right into first part of \u201911.", "Rob Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "Okay, and that 10 to 12 month of free rent, that\u2019s something for a 10-year deal?", "Marc Holliday", " ", "That\u2019s a 10-year deal on raw space where the tenant is building the space themselves as compared to a 10 or 15-year deal where the landlord may be building the space, in which case the construction time falls on our clock.", "", "Rob Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "Okay, got it.  My second question, just on 521 5th,  and just what is the \u2013 what do the economics look like really just from an earnings point of view with that debt coming due I guess in a few months and bringing in that interest?  And then I guess then you also had a new retail tenant in the bottom there, just how does it shake out in terms of the economics of buying the rest of that in?", "Marc Holliday", " ", "Well, Andrew, do you want to just go through some of the baseline economics of the deal and how we\u2019re doing the debt, and I think Matt or Jim can give the earnings impact.", "Andrew Mathias ", "Sure.  Our going in tap rate is right around 5%, and that\u2019s with about 15% vacancy in the building.  We historically have run that building closer to 97-98%, and definitely anticipate as the market tightens up, that we\u2019ll be able to lease up the balance of that vacancy.  So our stabilized cash on cost in the very near term, we expect to be in excess of 6%, with some below-market rents in place to continue rolling over the coming 5 to 6 years.  ", "In terms of financing, it does roll in April.  We are talking to our existing lenders, and sort of deciding corporately how we wanted to handle our financing strategy there; whether we want to unlever the asset is one possibility, or continue with the existing financing, or go out and get new financing.  The financing\u2019s at a level that\u2019s extremely comfortable in the market today, and we\u2019ve already had quite a number of unsolicited reverse inquiries from lenders looking to finance our purchase.", "Marc Holliday", "I think from just commenting on what we had put out in the investors conference in terms of our guidance, this acquisition is sort of right on top of the economics that we begged in to our guidance for the year, so there would be no change to our guidance this year as a result of this deal.  ", "Rob Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from the line of Jay Habermann, with Goldman Sachs.  You may proceed with your question.", "Jay Habermann-Goldman Sachs ", "Good afternoon.  You know, just following on that last question, as you look at your 2011 debt roles, do you have a preference toward fixed rate at this point in the cycle, or will you continue with floating rate?  And I guess just as interest rates are at very low levels today, are you looking forward and expecting NOI to pick up before you put more current financing with fixed rate in place?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, you know, I\u2019ve said in the past, Jay, we tend not to like to prognosticate on interest rates.  Over the years that\u2019s proven to be a bit treacherous, and we just try and match the form of financing to the investments.  So long-term net-lease deals like the ones we own, or the ones we just acquired from [inaudible], those either have fixed rate or if those debts were coming up, we would fix them.  ", "Then we have transitional assets like 521 5th where Andrew said we have some significant lease up there.  Clearly 3 Columbus Circle when that litigation sort of resolves itself there will be a building there to reposition and lease up, which would warrant, we think floating rate debt and we pretty much like to group things in to buckets of transitional assets; have a floating rate that warrants more mature-fixed assets, and fixed rate debt.  And then a whole basket of properties that carry no debt to support the line in our unsecured financing.  ", "So, I don\u2019t think \u2013 we don\u2019t have a corporate view at the moment that rates are going to stay where they are, or are going to go up significantly so we\u2019ve got to rush out and fix rates.  We will swap on occasion when we think there is an asset-level reason to do so.  If we\u2019re carrying floating-rate debt on a JV that we think we should be fixed, but our partner doesn\u2019t want to fix, we\u2019ll float, and then swap.  That\u2019s not a directional view, that\u2019s an asset-level view.  ", "Occasionally in the past, we have made some bets; some worked for us, some worked against us.  We tend not to do that.  So I don\u2019t know if that fully answers your question, but I\u2019d say we\u2019re a little view neutral on the issue of rate.  We carry a slightly higher proportion of floating to fixed and other rates because we carry a slightly higher proportion of transitional assets to mature assets, and we think that\u2019s appropriate. ", "Jay Habermann-Goldman Sachs", " ", "That\u2019s helpful.  And I guess, just given your progress so far, at 100 Church, can you talk about the competition from downtown at this point in the cycle, you know, given the rent differential?  And does that potentially change your rent growth outlook for Midtown, just given the growing vacancy in lower Manhattan?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, you know, listen, the growing vacancy in lower Manhattan is all sort of relative, right?  I mean, at the beginning of last year everybody expected the downtown to be a whole lot worse than where it seems to be going.  And although the vacancy is slowly inching up, you can argue that it\u2019s actually been rather successful about it not being as bad as what was projected.  ", "We are left now at 100 Church Street with two blocks of roughly over a little over a hundred thousand square feet each.  When we started the project, we were half a million square feet that needed to be leased.  And our major competitors, which to date have been 125 Broad, and 77 Water, both of those buildings have had some leasing success as well.  So for the primary buildings that we\u2019re negotiating against, the supply has been tightening.  ", "Now that we\u2019re going in to smaller blocks of space, rather than the unique 500,000 square foot space that we had to offer, it sort of opens up the field a little bit as far as broader audience of competitive buildings.  So that will change things, and I don\u2019t think it really invites an opportunity to raise rents materially, although we had anticipated that we would continue to see some modest increase versus the first deal that we did.  And by comparison, the deal that we signed with the State for 90,000 square feet, which was just a couple of weeks ago, that is a ten-year deal, $65 in TI, and 6 months of free rent after the construction, which is a big improvement over the first anchor tenant that we signed with a lease that we saw with no firsts.  So I think we\u2019re going to continue to see good success; the building continues to get better every single day because of all of the activities down at the World Trade Center, particularly with [inaudible] coming in the neighborhood half a block away.

Please proceed with your question.", "Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi [Josh Attie]", "", "Thanks, it\u2019s Josh Attie with Michael.  Can you talk about some of the larger loan-book investments, like 280 Park, London, and maybe the new investment that was made in the quarter; if you\u2019re in active discussions, or considering taking equity positions in any of those buildings?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, Josh, you know we\u2019ve given a lot more disclosure in December on that book.  Really as much as we think we can give, and we think anything greater would unnecessarily put us in a position of not being aligned with the interest of the borrower which is paramount here as a lender.  It\u2019s really not appropriate to talk about live investments, which are strictly debt investments and talking about what the long-term expectations or strategies are.  These are all, for the most part, we can talk about some exceptions, but for the most part these are all well-covered, performing debt investments that every one of which we expect will be paid off if the borrower so chooses.  The borrower doesn\u2019t always choose to pay off, so I wouldn\u2019t limit that commentary to the investments you\u2019ve made.  ", "If anything, on that book, you saw in December where we detailed the [inaudible].  These are for the most part high-quality assets, predominantly located in Manhattan, predominantly or almost exclusively office and retail, and in all cases where I think the bar could and should support the investments, and where booking for the most part yield to maturity kinds of returns in these investments.  ", "With that said, there may be time to time where we\u2019ll have the opportunity for pipeline, typically consensually, very rarely non-consensually, as evidence by the fact that over fourteen years of this business we\u2019ve only had one foreclosure to this program.  ", "The other buildings that we\u2019ve acquired out of this program have been done consensually.  So I would say it\u2019s likely of the 10-million square feet plus or minus that we have loan interest in, in and around Manhattan, that some of those could result in portfolio assets in the future.  And again, I would reiterate, if they do, more likely they\u2019re not consensually.  And to give any specific color on any specific asset, we can\u2019t unfortunately do on this call.", "Jay Habermann-Goldman Sachs ", "Okay, and separately, can you give us an update on 600 Lex?  It looks like the occupancy has declined a little bit sequentially, and I know it\u2019s early, but how is that property performing versus your underwriting in terms of being able to roll up the rent?", "Marc Holliday", "It\u2019s pretty much on target.  When we bought the building, we put it under a modest but a capital improvement program that\u2019s wrapping up now.  We should be completing our lobby work, hallway work, a model office in the next 10 days to 2 weeks.  Remember that this is a small-space building, so very rarely do these types of tenants make forward commitments with a great deal of time.  So generally, it\u2019s the type of tenant that comes in and says, \u201cWhat\u2019s available?  I want it tomorrow.\u201d  Because the floors are 12,000 feet at the largest, and more typically 6 to 7,000 square feet.  Unlike other buildings where you have very large tenants, they make lease commitments 10 months to 2 years in advance.  So it\u2019s not surprising that until we have the capital program completed, that there be some slow lease up.  ", "We knew the majority of tenants who had leases that were rolling were not planning to stay in the building, irrespective of anything we did, or the pricing, or the market.  Many of these spaces have already been sublet, some of the tenants already moved out.  So, we have very good color going in to it as to where the vacancy would grow to.  And quite frankly we intentionally priced the building a little ahead of where the market was at the time of acquisition and it\u2019s been, as anticipated, it\u2019s been an effort on our part to educate the brokerage community as to what we\u2019re doing with the building, educate them as to why we think there is logic in our pricing, and I think we\u2019re getting support on that. ", "I believe that this year we\u2019ll see a decent amount of leases signed in the building, at numbers that were materially higher than where that building was transacting before we bought it.  But the proof will be in the pudding when I post the leases.", "Jay Habermann-Goldman Sachs ", "Could you remind us of what level of space rent you underwrote on the building for the new leases?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, our asking rent today is anywhere from between 65 to $80 a foot in the base, and normally there is always a little bit of room off the asking rent.", "Jay Habermann-Goldman Sachs ", "Okay, thank you.", "Marc Holliday", "You\u2019re welcome.

Just wondering if you have any update on the dividend?  It\u2019s probably too soon after the analyst day, but just wondering if you have any color there. ", "Marc Holliday", "No, I would say we discussed that at that at length, all the reasons why we thought where we are now is appropriate.  Long-term desires see that increase, but it\u2019s really tied mostly to the taxable earnings of the company for this year with expectations certainly for next year, towards increasing.  This year I think we\u2019ll just have to wait and see how things shape up from a taxable earnings perspective.  But I think that most of the shareholders, we seem to support the use of the retained cash, not only from not paying dividends higher than what they currently are, but also other strides we\u2019ve made on reducing our capital to increase our cash flow and using all that for either \u2013 to fund new investments, debt reduction.  We think it\u2019s the right time for that in this market where we\u2019re reacquiring assets that we look at as kind of seeds of growth for the future.  So we\u2019ll re-evaluate that probably towards the end of the year, but it\u2019s a little too early now.", "Vincent Chu \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, and the second question, just going back to 100 Church, I think it\u2019s 60% occupied at the end of the quarter, and it sounds like you have another 90,000 square foot lease that\u2019s coming in.  And I think last quarter you talked about maybe an 80 to 85% sometime in the, it sounded like first half of \u201911; does that still seem like a reasonable target for you guys?", "Marc Holliday", "Yeah, well we\u2019re now at a 70% occupancy with the signing of the lease that we just completed with the state for 90,000 square feet.  We\u2019ve 275,000 square feet of vacancy.  I think the building stabilizes in that sort of 80 to 85% range, which means we\u2019ve got a little bit of road still to go to it, but we\u2019ve got good activity, good tenant demand, we\u2019ve had a lot of good showings that are ongoing.

And also what your thoughts are on TI\u2019s and concessions for those deals.", "Marc Holliday", "Well, the biggest one \u2013 the reality is, we don\u2019t have that many real large expirations this year.  We knocked off a bunch of them last year with the new renewals, but the more significant ones would be the Meredith role at 125 Park Avenue.  To remind you, when we bought that building, we knew Meredith would not be staying.  They occupy about 150,000 square feet that expires on 12/31.  We\u2019re already in the market with that space.  It\u2019s a continuous block, it\u2019s sort of the upper half of the building.  I am not really too worried about it.  I believe actually that the rents will be north of where we underwrote the building, ultimately.  But we do not expect to land a tenant until at the very best, until the end of this year.  ", "Beyond that, we have some role, you know, not a lot.  Tower 45 we have DE Shaw is going to downsize about 30 or 40,000 square feet.  We\u2019ve got more role next year in that building, which is why we put the building under a renovation program where we\u2019re doing a new lobby, elevator caps, turn styles, and renovating the atrium in the property.  Those are small floors that are 13,000 square feet a pop.  DE Shaw essentially outgrew the building; they started as a small tenant and ended up needing a whole lot of floors.  Now we\u2019ll have to go back and retenant on a floor-by-floor basis, so that will be a little bit of work.  ", "Other than that, my biggest role is at 800 3rd.  I\u2019ve got a lease that expires at the end of the year that\u2019s another 50,000 square feet, and that\u2019s it.  I don\u2019t have any huge blocks of space.  We have vacancy in the portfolio that we\u2019re working on.  You know, we\u2019ve got 600 Lexington and 100 Church and 3 Columbus when that building comes in house.  So that will be \u2013 the majority of our attention this year will be filling the vacancies.", "Jamie Feldman - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, and then given the ramp up in TIs in the fourth quarter, what\u2019s your latest guidance for AFFO in \u201911?", "Unidentified Male Representative", "Let me jump in on this while I remember before Matt answers that.  The ramp up in TI was a result of deals, many of which were negotiated anywhere between the first quarter of 2010, going all the way back to early 2009.  So it would be wrong for us to conclude that that increase in TI is a reflection of where the margin is or where we would expect TI\u2019s to be on deals that we\u2019re going to start to negotiate today.", "Matt DiLiberto", "Yeah, Jamie, it\u2019s Matt.  You know, as far as how that flows through AFFO or TAD as we refer to it, we provided guidance in December that took our mid-range of FFO 413 down to $2.02 a share of TAD, which factors in capital that you saw flow through here in the fourth quarter.", "Jamie Feldman - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, so that\u2019s unchanged,  the AFFO or TAD estimate?", "Matt DiLiberto", "Correct, yes. ", "Jamie Feldman - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay.  And then just finally, given signing market conditions and your success in 180 Broadway, are you guys changing your stance at all on the appetite for developing in Midtown?", "Marc Holliday", "No.  Our view is you can make much, much better risk-adjusted returns with the strategy we employ of buying existing products that\u2019s often but not always under managed, under positioned and then repositioning, remarketing, rebranding and ultimately leasing up and obviously get into that, you\u2019ve got to buy in at the right basis.  That approach yields returns we believe that are traditionally much more attractive for much less time, much less risk, much less effort.  You know, you\u2019ve heard me say before, it\u2019s as much about, you have to look not just only IRR, but eternal effort.  We do a lot of volume here, and a project that would take senior-level capacity, often taking your eye off the ball for three to five years to develop a major project, or longer, generally doesn\u2019t fit in with our design except for an exceptional property or an exceptional location.  So there are always exceptions to the rule, but as a rule our approach is the approach we think is best suited for us in the public markets.  ", "With that said, there\u2019s always going to be outlier kind of situations like American Eagle, [inaudible] our site at 317 Madison, where the basis is good enough, and the economics are compelling enough that we make a decision to move forward, but that will be the exception of the rule.

Please proceed with your question. ", "Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors", "Hey guys, I just wanted to touch back on CapEx real quick, on leasing costs.  Steve, which deal did you refer to that was done a year and a half ago?  Because there were a couple of eye-popping packages in the lease detail at a couple of Midtown Avenue properties? ", "Steve Durels", "Well, the one that jumped off the page at me, I actually had to go remind myself of the deal, was the Lloyd deal, at 919 3rd Avenue.  They had forward commitments to extend into a piece of space where the entire block was going to be vacating.  We got the deal back in \u201909 and in fact, part of the TI there was there was a reduction in commissions paid that shifted over to an increased TI package, so that\u2019s why that number jumped up.  ", "The other ones that were big, or the other one that was biggest, which was HealthFirst downtown.  Again, it\u2019s important to differentiate the downtown market, where we have a pretty small foot print, versus the Midtown market where the vast majority of our real estate, and the vast majority of our current vacancy is currently located.  So downtown trades of bigger concession packages.  That one had an $80 TI, plus a $7.50 redecorating allowance to tenant guests ten years from now, but still we had to post the $87.50 as TI allowance.  And then we gave them 15 months of free rent, which included their construction time.  That was, I will tell you, a lower concession package than the building that we were competing against what they were offering, though.  Still, at least from our perspective, and inconsistent with the concession packages that we\u2019ve experienced in Midtown.  ", "Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors", "And then my second question is about small tenant demand.  It sounds like big-block demand is coming back, especially from finance.  But it looks like some of your smaller tenant properties, namely Graybar, looks like it continues to lose a meaningful amount of occupancy.  Do you feel like the small tenant demand picture is not yet firmed up, and not part of the Midtown recovery story?", "Marc Holliday", "Michael, Graybar is one that we\u2019re treating a little bit uniquely internally.  We think that when you look at the peak, the trough rents in Graybar, it was a higher-than-average drop that is just starting to make its way back, and we think will firm substantially in 2011, and this is one of the few areas we\u2019ve chosen to warehouse some space. ", "We did it at 100 Park when we weren\u2019t prepared to lease at the trough and you see the results there; that worked out extremely well.  We\u2019re doing it here, at Graybar, and we think that will work to our advantage because we see those small-to-medium sized tenants showing up in size and we think that we can make up enough rent by waiting 6, 9, 12 months relative to the capital that you have to put in to pre-build or build for the smaller tenants.  We think that we should be waiting for rents that are back in the 50\u2019s, Steve.  In the 40\u2019s, it\u2019s not attractive enough of metric.  So while the building itself has higher-than-historical vacancy, our portfolio is almost 95% leased.  So at 95% lease, you start to be able to get to pick your shots at where you want to spend your capital.  Right now we\u2019re looking to spend that capital in the spaces that we think we can get a highest nominal and net effective rents.  And right now, that\u2019s not Graybar, that was 100 Park, 461 5th, Tower 45, and 600 Lex, and soon to be 3 CC.  You know, the capital dollars are close to the same, the only difference is the rents.  We\u2019re targeting that capital for the higher rent buildings, and that\u2019s not to say we\u2019re not actively reaching Graybar, but there\u2019s a couple of blocks of space we\u2019ve kind of said we\u2019ll deal with at the end of the year, and we\u2019ve modeled it as such in our 2011 budget.

I think, as you know, Ross, we have a very significant cash NOI there versus the financing that\u2019s in place, and we\u2019re anticipating having the option to upsize the financing if we choose to do so in the market today.  That\u2019ll be a long-term fixed-rate financing.  717 5th, we have an extension option on, which we\u2019ll likely avail ourselves of.  That financing in place is pretty efficient.  1551 is in the process of being refinanced now.  You know, we\u2019re down to a very small interest on that property, 10% or so, but it\u2019s in the process of being refinanced now.  ", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS", "And then I guess the other question I have is, you guys started off the call talking about all the big blocks of space and demand that\u2019s clearly out there, as time goes on here, how much more of a factor is all the available space downtown?  Obviously, those requirements aren\u2019t getting filled overnight.  Are a quarter, a half, a third of those folks just going to say, you know what, let\u2019s wait a couple years and just take brand new, fresh space down town, especially if it\u2019s not necessarily for our front line people?", "Andrew Mathias ", "Well, it hasn\u2019t traditionally been our experience.  The almost exclusive motivating factor is rental spread, and when we see those spreads get upwards of 35-$40 a foot, that\u2019s where we see the spill-over in to what would be described as being new, freshly-built space downtown.  But I don\u2019t think Midtown has diminished in any way from its attractiveness and allure to people who live, whether they live downtown, Midtown, uptown, New Jersey, Long Island or Grenache, this is still the area of convenience, the area closest to where the heads of these businesses tend to locate.  And it\u2019s usually first choice until the bottom line impact makes it compelling enough.  But when we see that occur, that\u2019s usually when a Midtown vacancy level well below 9%, which clearly we\u2019re not at now; we\u2019re at around 10.5%.  So I wouldn\u2019t characterize that as a 2011 phenomenon, but eventually, certainly, and you know, that\u2019s healthy for New York to have a more moderately priced alternative for companies, and tenants to avail themselves of who can\u2019t pay \u2013 don\u2019t want to pay the Midtown rents when they back to that point of neutrality or higher, in the 60\u2019s to well over $100 a foot.  Downtown offers an outlet for that rental price point in the 30s, 40s and 50s, but I would say at the moment that is not a factor, but eventually and certainly will become a spillover.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS", "Thanks, appreciate it.

", "Jordan Sadler-KeyBanc Capital Market", "I\u2019d just like to follow up on that last question on sort of the big blocks you were discussing earlier. And Steve, your comments regarding where you think we\u2019ll be occupancy wise.  I am curious, and Marc, you talked about being able to achieve the 25% rent growth, and maybe even better, that you had outlined quite a while ago at this point.  I am just curious, you laid out I think at the investor day, at plus or minus 5% mark-to-market on the New York City leases.  Is it feasible at this point, given the demand you\u2019re seeing, that you\u2019re already running ahead on that, and it could be better for 2011?", "Marc Holliday", "Yeah, I want to make this \u2013 I think there\u2019s a slight confusing here between \u2013 the 25% or better comment, relates purely to trough rents.  It doesn\u2019t relate in any way to the in-place escalated rents of the company.  That\u2019s rents that had peaked in \u201907, and had kind of hit bottom in \u201909, early \u201810, in sort of middle of \u201810, or maybe it was third quarter \u201810 there was a belief that rents would come at least 25% off the bottom.  And that we\u2019ve seen building momentum in \u201910 and we believe will continue in \u201911.  But that is unrelated in a certain respect to where those rents are relative to what\u2019s coming off our book.  What\u2019s coming off our book now are rents that were largely put in place in 2000, 2001 when rent levels were very high.  We\u2019d typically make about 10% increases in to those leases off of those peak rents, and then you\u2019d have ten years of operating and tax escalations on top of that compounding situations.", "Jordan Sadler-KeyBanc Capital Market", "And that\u2019s clear.  I wasn\u2019t trying to relate.  It sounded, just at the margin in January, you said this was the best January you\u2019ve seen since 2006, and maybe incrementally since 45 days ago when we last talked, that you\u2019re seeing greater demand.", "Marc Holliday", "Yeah.  That may push it more towards the higher half of the range and the lower half.  It certainly \u2013 it takes a lot to move our mark-to-market on over a million square feet of rollover.  And if we were minus 5, plus 5, I would say if anything you may think more towards the positive territory than negative territory, but I wouldn\u2019t advise the guidance at this point because we could just have an anomaly where one or two, or three very big high-rent leases are rolling off the books in \u201911 and we\u2019re just going to get tagged with a 10, or 12, or 15% downtick.  The modal of leases, we may have, by number of leases, many more up and down but if you get tagged with two or three big roll downs it\u2019s very hard to overcome that.  I think what you\u2019ll see is there are nothing of a monumental [inaudible], but there\u2019s enough done in that \u201900-\u201901 era that\u2019s going to be below, you know, in the negative category that even with a good-tight improving market it\u2019s going to make it tough to exceed our estimate.

And if we\u2019re in that top half of that guidance, our same-store will be at least that or more.  That will make for a very good year and you know, set us up well going forward.  Those would be very good metrics.  So I think the guidance is consistent with an expectation of some absorption and big job growth which I did set out in December for office-using jobs, close to 20,000 office-using jobs efficient, which is where I think things will \u2013 where the projections will ultimately get to in another month or two.

My follow up is just on your comments regarding maybe increasing the sales activity that this sort of coincided with the increased investment activity.  I think in the past when we\u2019ve talked about increased sales, it sounded like you were happy with sort of the collection of assets that you had whittled the portfolio down to over time.  I\u2019m just curious, what would sort of be potentially on the block or have a higher likelihood of being put on the block for you guys?  At what type of volume it could potentially be, and at what point \u2013 what\u2019s sort of the assessment in terms of relative growth; what you\u2019re selling versus what you\u2019re buying, where you\u2019re opting to sell some of these assets as opposed to maybe issuing equity.

And I think I indicated at that point in time that we were looking at these assets and it\u2019s clear that we\u2019re not going to sell all of them.  Obviously we have one on the market and might pick one or two others, but the point that we made with respect to each of these assets is actually a slide I have on Page 43 which basically said that, you know, we actually bought \u2013 we feel we bought these assets right and as the capital expenditures in these assets continues to rise and the current NOI growth isn\u2019t quite there, it\u2019s clearly time to prune those assets and deploy that capital into more accretive investments.

And Marc, just going back to some comments you made earlier in the call, is it fair to say \u2013 it sounds like from where we sit today that new investment activity is probably likely to be offset by net sales activity given that there could be some increasing dispositions in given how active you\u2019ve been early in the year on the investment side?

I think that\u2019s generally a fair statement.  You know, the way we go about looking to try and arbitrage the market to find the assets where we can get the best bid, realize the highest amount of gain relative to what we perceive as future NOI growth and then put that money back into accretive activities, I think even if the dollars are the same that\u2019s accretive activity onto itself because we do believe we are subscribing to the theory of buy low, sell high.  And unto itself, over the long term you\u2019ll end up with a growth portfolio by doing that even if the dollars deployed are the same.  If that makes sense because that is an accretive activity.

Has any of that been reflected in the Q4 leasing activity that you guys have given us?

So effectively raising the rent by raising the measurement, which I think probably caught some people off guard but I think the market is there to support it.  ", "In other buildings, we raised it as much as $10 a foot.  In some spaces, it was just a couple bucks a foot.  And then I think also we\u2019ve already seen in the second half of 2010 space rents have increased by comparison to where our expectation was for many of those transactions at the beginning of the year.  ", "You can almost pick any single building.  Deals that we\u2019re doing today in Graybar I think are a couple bucks higher than they were six or eight months ago.  100 Park Avenue is usually a couple bucks higher than where we were expecting on the base floors.  ", "I just did a deal for one of mid-rise floors over there where we actually recaptured space.  First time we\u2019ve seen that in a couple years where we took space back, subleased it back from a tenant with seven years left on the lease at $39 a foot.  We rented the space at $52 a foot.

So a lease that I sign in the fourth quarter of 2010, at best probably doesn\u2019t start until the first quarter of \u201911.  And more typically would be anywhere from 6 to 12 months forward by the time \u2013 if we\u2019re building the space, then we don\u2019t book the deal until we\u2019ve actually completed the work and turned the space over to the tenant.", "And even where the tenant is building the space, we actually don\u2019t recognize that lease until they\u2019ve completed their work.

Sorry, 2008 was 6 million.  2007 was 11 million.  So it\u2019s a number that is consistently in the results of the company.

I think it\u2019s a few million dollars based on the guidance books.", "Marc Holliday", "", "Yeah, and probably, you know, half of what has been the average over the last five years is based to 2011 guidance.  But because it\u2019s been so recurring, we took a step of lease layering in a nominal amount.", "Steve Bennett \u2013 Jefferies", "Okay, and then just one more conceptual one.  In the scenario where the ten year goes closer to 5% say by the end of the year, what do you think that does to the New York City office CAP rates in terms of the risk premium that property buyers are going to require.  And also, how would that essentially change your approach to investment or balance sheet management?", "Marc Holliday", "", "The question of where treasuries go to has to be coupled with a view as to what\u2019s happening in the rental market.  When CAP rates have been very low in the city, and I define that as under 5% or 5% and under, I\u2019ve seen that in low rate and higher rate treasury environments because the CAP rate\u2019s a function of cost of funds, but it\u2019s also a function of expected growth.  And if treasuries go from 3.5 to 5, but people\u2019s expectations for rental growth rates go from 3% a year to 25% over the next three years, the CAP rate could be unchanged or down because the expected growth could dwarf the 150 basis point pickup in CAP rates.  ", "So traditionally, CAP rates will trade at a spread to treasuries.  You know, if a ten year goes to five, it would be reasonable to think that CAP rates could be 6% or 6% plus.  But CAP rates could be 5% and CAP rates have traded through treasuries.  So it was only three or four years ago, maybe five years ago, where CAP rates were around 3.5% to 4%, and they were traded through treasuries.  So they can trade through treasuries.  They can trade on top of treasuries.  And historically, they\u2019ll trade at premium to treasuries for Class A, up maybe 100, 150 basis points plus.  ", "But again, if we\u2019re at the mindset that there\u2019s going to be sort of above-average rental growth in the next three years, that may overwhelm what\u2019s happening with treasury.  That\u2019s not to say treasury explodes.  That\u2019s not going to have a funding impact, but I would say to you right now, it\u2019s not a leveraged market.  People aren\u2019t pricing these assets to the last dollar borrowed.  If you look at the profile of people buying today, it\u2019s largely equity-oriented investors who are looking for good, safe, risk adjusted, and tax sheltered yields for the most part.  And for that, I think New York office and New York real estate in general is a mecca for that kind of investment.  ", "And it could have an impact, or it may not.  And like I said, I think you have to just couple that with a view of rental growth.", "Steve Bennett \u2013 Jefferies", "Okay, and then just in terms of your balance sheet and investment outlook in that higher rate environment?", "Unidentified Male Representative.", "", "Your investment outlook in the higher rate environment, where does \u2013 we\u2019re going to play capital.

So it\u2019s all just a pricing exercise for us at the end of the day.  If the treasury goes to 5 and borrowing costs go to 6.5 let\u2019s say, that isn\u2019t going to curtail our appetite for investment.  It might curtail the price we\u2019re willing to pay.  Or if we think the rental increases will mitigate that, it might not have an extraordinary effect.  That is basically what comes out of the analysis we do.", "But I would say in a 5% treasury environment, we have been traditionally, and I would still expect to be an avid buyer of real estate where we see vacancy rates declining from 10.5% today to single digits.

We have to evaluate accrual, non-accrual status every quarter.  Actually, we touched on this two investor conferences ago that non-accrual status is not necessarily indicative of those positions that have reserves, or require reserves, or could have reserves in the future.  It\u2019s a separate analysis of income stream.  Historically, those don\u2019t go back and forth.  Can they, yes.  Historically, they\u2019re on non-accrual they stay on non-accrual.  And in the current book, we have one position that\u2019s the vast majority of the positions that are on non-accrual right now.  It\u2019s a performing loan, but it was an independent evaluation and determination made by us to turn off the income stream.

And we\u2019re showing that I think historically that this business has been a good business for the company, so I think if what you\u2019re asking is how much, how important this business is to the company, it\u2019s going to continue to be important, but I think that we are also irrational in measuring the exposure to risk.  And taking into consideration credit metrics and other things, but we\u2019re going to continue to have a big focus on this business.", "Susanne Kim \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, great, thank you so much.", "Marc Holliday", "", "Okay, thank you for whoever is still with us at the end.

So far the ATM has worked very, very well for us. And we raised, I think $311 million through the program. So we'd liked it very much as one option to raise capital. As far as leverage, Michael, I think that you've seen over this first part of the year is what I'd like to think that was a very balanced funding strategy we deployed a lot of capital in properties and then we raised a corresponding amount of equity to maintain our credit ratios. And by doing that, in fact, we're upgraded by S&P in the process. Our approach it\u2019s been very prudent. It's been sort of -- the things we've done in the last few months are kind of the many ways, the capstone on what's happened over a longer period of time in the company. And so far, as credit quality, access to cheaper capital and liquidity, I think we feel like we're moving -- we've moved in the right direction and are in the position to continue to protect and improve where we have opportunities.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc.", "And if I can ask one more question. Does the 1515 Broadway transaction suggest anything about your view on Viacom's intention to renew or not a few years out? Or is there any reference to be drawn about sort of the increasing value of potential vacancy in terms of asset values, if they do in fact, don't renew a few years out?", "Marc Holliday", "Yes. I would say that generally, we manage our investments with an overall portfolio view. We're not always looking at individual discreet assets and individual discreet events. And I think that's one of the benefits of scale that we have in this market over our competitors. To us, it's not a question of will Viacom or any other of large tenants renew in a particular building. But it's certainly much more oriented towards out of 25 million or 26 million square foot portfolio, what kind of rollover do we have each year and trying to manage that rollover through early renewals, trying to keep that rollover down to generally about 1 million square feet a year, maybe 1.2 million, something like that. And where it comes from, who it comes from becomes a little less important in that context especially for wholly-owned asset like this now is. So, I think that Viacom, as a company, seems to be doing terrifically well. We\u2019ve just finished a renovation of that project, which is excellent and I think was really efficient, but complete transformation of certain aspects of that building and that maturity is still probably 4 years or so off. So it's not what would put into kind of the present day active consideration, but something that would likely be worked on over the next couple of years. And we would assume that they seem happy in the building and we think they'll have a continued presence in the building whether that's all or most, I mean, that just something that will be determined over time. But if it does not turn out to be the case, our conclusion was that at this basis in that market for that quality of building and that quality of floor play, especially with the views that you get to sort of halfway up and beyond, it's a spectacular space that, in some cases, can be rented for maybe much more than media companies can often afford to pay, just given how sectors can afford different types of rents for different buildings. So we think our downside is certainly protected, given the quality of the real estate. But I would also say, we think Viacom's a terrific tenant, and there's no reason to think that they're not going to have longevity either. But in a portfolio sense, we think either way, it's completely manageable.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sri Nagarajan of FBR.", "Srikanth Nagarajan - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Question on leasing spreads. It appears that early renewals always have an impact on positive leasing spreads for you as you sit down with these tenants who have really long-term leases. How is that picture looking today as tenants are kind of pressured with lack of opportunity, if you will, looking forward for the rest of 2011?", "Steven Durels", "Well, we'll see. I think, we've seen a trend over the past 18 months where tenants have clearly been convinced that the market is rising and if they have leases -- if they're confronted with leases that are expiring 2, 3, 4 years out, I don't know, there's a consensus out there that they're scared, and they should be. Tenants are worried about where occupancy or costs are going up because rents are rising and we've had -- we've seen it over the past year. We're continuing to see tenants initiate conversations where they'd like to handle an early renewal today, trying to average rent that's in place with a rent that they're going to be confronted with in the past, then we've always been open-minded to that because as Marc mentioned earlier, we think the long ball view on this, which is managing the least rollover in the future rather than just dealing with leases as they expire present day. But clearly, on the renewal side, tenants have gotten the word that they're being confronted with the rising market.", "Srikanth Nagarajan - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Quick question on all the gains. Can you give us some color on taxable income and dividend policy now?", "Matt DiLiberto", "It's Matt. The way the gains are structured, I mean, at this point, we have no real change to our taxable income projections for 2011. As we talked about in the past, we'll continue to evaluate the dividend, and taxable income beyond 2011 as we get later into the year. But none of what took place in the first quarter, as we look forward, will adjust our thinking for 2011.", "Srikanth Nagarajan - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "A quick bookkeeping question, if I may, you mentioned lease cancelation of about $2.1 million. And could you just repeat what assumptions you're making for the rest of the year as well?", "Matt DiLiberto", "It's actually about $2.7 million. And historically, we've averaged over the course of the last 5 years, call it $8 million a year, so we would expect to see something along the same lines this year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Suzanne Kim of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Suzanne Kim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "I'm calling about what you sort of expect is the embedded gain in the structured finance book?", "James Mead", "Expected gain in the structured finance book?", "Suzanne Kim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Yes. What's the mark-to-market gain that you're sort of...", "James Mead", "I don't know that we have that statistic. I mean, obviously, we're not writing up the investment.", "Marc Holliday", "And we don't mark our book to market every quarter. So that's not information that we disclose at any event.", "Suzanne Kim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Okay. And then also with regard with your top 10 investments, could you disclose what the maturity is on the second investment that's yielding 11.25%?", "Marc Holliday", "2014.", "Suzanne Kim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "2014. Okay. Great.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from line of Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "I'm just not sure if I missed this, but what was the valuation on 1515 Broadway, maybe on a cap rate basis on the PC bought in? And what's the plan for financing?", "Marc Holliday", "We assume that, that in place, which was a Bank of China led syndicate loan we put in place at the beginning of 2010, I believe. The going-in cap rate is about 5.5% and we would expect that to grow to about 6% over the next 12 months or so.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Okay. There was no cash equity portion out to the partner?", "Marc Holliday", "SITQ did receive proceeds of about $260 million.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Okay. That's going to be on the line and then permanently financed through ATM or otherwise or...", "James Mead", "It's on the line today, and we'll permanently finance it at some point.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Okay, that's helpful. And then within the structured finance book, there were a couple of -- you touched on some of them really quickly. I don't know if all of them were realized during this quarter, maybe falling over into 2Q. I think you said 1166, but I'm not sure if you still had exposure there. Starrett-Lehigh and then whatever your remaining exposure is to GKK, on a book basis, I'd be interested in the expected outcome there as well.", "Marc Holliday", "Starrett-Lehigh is still outstanding. 1166 is paid off, and we have no remaining position there.", "David Schonbraun", "We have a -- on book basis, we have one mortgage invest.", "Marc Holliday", "This is David Schonbraun, who runs the structured finance. Andrew Falk, who's also obviously, is part of that who handles the GKK situation.", "David Schonbraun", "On the GKK, we have a approximately $34 million mortgage position secured by net-leased bank branches. It sits within approximately $240 million mortgage, which is secured today, I think. The net lenders are working out the loan with Gramercy. I think they entered a 2-week extension approximately 10 days ago. When that flushes out, we'll determine what to do with mortgage. But it's a secured position backed by net-leased bank branches.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "But SLG's total carry value is the $34 million?", "David Schonbraun", "Yes.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Okay. And so what's the value of the investment in Starrett-Lehigh?", "David Schonbraun", "Carrying value is about $85.6 million.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "$85.6 million. Is that at par or what's the remaining discount to par?", "James Mead", "There's a discount on that. About $10 million left.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "$10 million left. Okay, that's really helpful. And just lastly, Marc, in your commentary you mentioned your sort of debt markets feeling good, probably in the back of QE2, any sort of change in terms of your positioning as a result of the assumed end of QE2? Or you just sort of expecting rates to remain low for a while and not factoring that as much?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I don't want to sound like a broken record on this but we're generally neutral when it comes to rates. We like to tag floating rate deals, big upside assets. We put fix financing on mature assets and we try and keep it stable of unencumbered assets to support our credit line and whatever kind of unsecured financings we do. So I just don't make interest rates. That's one way or the other because it's always a bias towards thinking increasing rates are coming, but over the long run, I found that running a book that's a been approximately 20% to 30% floating and 70% to 80% fixed has roughly paralleled our asset base and has been -- could matched funding in that regard and has allowed us to benefit from the lower floating rates while also fixing away the bulk of our debt to protect us against the unknown sudden movement. I'm much more focused on duration management. I think more so than rate issues, I think duration is key where we've seen people more frequently get into trouble, and I think why we were able to manage through the most recent recession, as well as we did was because we had very good liability management on the term side. Jim mentioned earlier, I think that he's now taken our average duration out to -- was it 6%...", "James Mead", "Yes, I mean, we've taken the average maturity out to 6% and I think that what's more important in that is that we have a smooth maturity schedule so we don't have a big risk in the year-on-year going forward in terms of maturities.", "Marc Holliday", "Right. So I would say regardless of the yield curve, we always model internally on investment yield curve plus 50 basis points on LIBOR. And that yield curve is pretty sharp right now. So we don't -- when we underwrite a deal with LIBOR-based financing, we're not modeling any benefit really from these low LIBOR rates because it ramps up to 4% plus or quickly on the yield curve, then we tuck [ph] 50 basis point inside of that. So we hit the models pretty hard for expected increases in rates or if we're fixing it, we use treasury curve. And we're just trying to kind of get as much maturity as we can deferred and also make sure that we're not mismatching by locking away mature assets with floating rates nor vice versa, we don't want to have assets with tremendous upside fixed away for 10 years. That would be I think very suboptimal. So that's how we approach it. If the rates stay where they are now, it's a pretty good environment with some positive leverage that's available where you can buy in the 5% to 6% range and financing to 4% to 5% range. I find in New York that those conditions don't last too long. The market just doesn't permit it. And eventually, those arbitrage opportunities will go to somewhere between neutral or negative leverage that's -- New York is more often than not a negative leverage market where the cost of debt exceeds. You're going in cap is growing into it, overtime, with the rental increases. But right now, we're still on the right side of that equation, which is why we're net acquirers and why we think this is such a good markets to buy in. When we see that invert, we'll become more careful.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of Ross Nussbaum of UBS.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank", "A couple of questions. The 919 Third Avenue financing, can you give a little detail on what the rate in term is on that?", "James Mead", "Well we haven't even closed yet. So we've signed an application for the deal and it'll likely to be a 12-year of fixed-rate financing with a rate in the low-5% range.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank", "And was that CMBS, bank, foreign? Who was the source of that capital?", "James Mead", "Insurance company.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. Second question, Jim, on the FAD guidance, I think you said you took it up from $2.47 up to $2.60 for the year. The $0.13 delta there, can you pinpoint, at least, from your model what the $0.13 variance was?", "Matt DiLiberto", "Sure. We obviously, some of the -- it's Matt. Some of gains that we took in the first quarter and some of the other positive variances we saw in the first quarter are cash. So that factors in there as offset by additional second cycle and recurring capital that will now pick up as a result of the 1515 acquisition and 521.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. And then final question, Marc, Sri had asked about the dividend. I want to ask it a slightly different way because I understand the argument on where taxable net income is. But just from a higher level view, I guess, the company is asking shareholders to effectively get almost 100% of their total return through residual value, if you will, rather than incur an income. And that is obviously odd for a REIT and odd if one were to buy a piece of commercial real estate directly. Are you rethinking the dividend policy at this point to be able to give shareholders an opportunity to get some incurring income off of their investment?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, Ross, I would say to you that it's not us sort of trying to convince shareholders that\u2019s the right approach. It's really us responding to shareholders who have said they are pretty indifferent to the dividends so long as it's obviously compliant with the taxable income rules. And at the moment, given the bullish posture that matches we have and our investors have in Manhattan, they seem to want to see us reinvest it in New York and create these total returns to our stock price. So we're pretty responsive on that level, and I think we get some good realtime data from our shareholder base, which happens to be almost entirely made up of institutional investors who seem pretty agnostic to the dividend. If there was a significant vocal group of our large shareholder base who were more focused on the dividend than they are on share price appreciation, then I think we'd be very quick to respond because we certainly have capacity to increase the dividend above where it is today. We always go above the taxable. We don't have to manage the taxable, as you know. And I think we're just being responsive there. So there's always going to be certain shareholders, retail shareholders like us who hold stock and like dividends. I mean, don't think that anyone sitting around this table doesn't like dividends. We just like high stock price better. And our shareholders seem to be, if not 100%, at least the vast, vast majority seems to be on that program. So that's where we're managing to. When we hear and sense a shift in that sentiment, I think we'll be quick to respond.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank", "I think that's fair. I'd throw out the idea that the higher the stock price goes, perhaps the more indifferent the voices have been on the dividend. But when the share price gains aren't as spectacular, the dividend might become more of a focus.", "Marc Holliday", "Yes. I would think that's right. And so were just -- we're measuring this off probably the last 2.5 years of performance, where it's been weighted to appreciation. And I guess if we get to a level where we see those external opportunities and growth opportunities start to subside, then clearly, we'll take a harder look at the dividend return portion of that equation. But obviously, this year, that's not the case. And we think we've been pretty consistent in saying that we expected the dividend to remain relatively static, if not static, completely through 2011 with a revisit for 2012. And I think we're on that path.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of Tom Truxillo of Bank of America.", "Thomas Truxillo - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I have a question on your financial policy. You talked about prudent balance sheet management today and maintaining your credit metrics. Does that mean you plan to take kind of a passive attitude towards getting those fully investment grade ratings, meaning, you're not going to pay down additional debt, rather than use the balanced approach with debt and equity as you grow your balance sheet? And kind of letting EBITDA growth result in a natural deleveraging?", "Marc Holliday", "Well first of all, our actions, not just in the last few months but in the last year or 1.5 year, got us to investment grade for the unsecured notes with S&P. So I would say that the actions that have been taken have actually been as much very favorable to the...", "Thomas Truxillo - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Yes, I'm talking more of going forward from here. And you obviously done great works [ph] at the last time, yes.", "Marc Holliday", "I think consistent with what I've said earlier in this year or late last year, prospectively, a lot of the work that we are trying to do is instructional leverage. We unencumbered 100 Church. We're set up to potentially unencumber other assets. And we're looking at ways to bolster the credit whether that requires a deleveraging in total, I don't think we\u2019re seeing that. I think that we can improve the overall credit through other means, as well. So I guess I'm not answering the question of deleveraging, whether that will come or not. But so far, experience is that we can do a variety of things to improve credit without delevering.", "Thomas Truxillo - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Sure. And then just a bigger question of why look to continue to improve the credit, I mean, looking at your debt maturity schedule you guys just talked about, you've extended it. You don't really have a maturity in 2014, but it's pretty small. You don't have any sizable maturities until 2016. You talked about the capital recycling that you're doing now. You have a bunch of availability in your credit facility now. So it doesn't seem like you really need to tap the unsecured market anytime soon. So why continue down that road, I guess? What do you see as the benefit?", "Marc Holliday", "We've said in the past that we feel that after 2, 2.5 years of a consistent program to delever and improve to get to where we've gotten today, that we feel we are at about the right level. I just want to -- there's no significant internal mandate to make another significant push forward to delever another from 8 to 7 debt-to-EBITDA. That's not -- we've stated right around 8 where we think is the right place for us in our market. Different firms, different quality of tenants and buildings. Different markets, probably need to operate below that. Maybe [indiscernible]. But I think, we've said we feel pretty good about where we are. If anything though, you have to realize we've just --we're digesting an enormous amount of transactional activity that took our metrics from where we were and they started to go somewhat in the reverse direction. So now we've embarked on a, what I would call a -- tweaking is not the right word, but a minor adjustments to equity and unencumbering assets. These are not major steps in the context in the size of our company. This is fine-tuning to kind of keep within the same level. So if you see us continue to be very acquisitive and I'm thinking you have to see us figure out ways to raise that due to some unencumbered -- raise equity or do some unencumbered asset bond deals or retain cash flow and sell assets because while we're not looking to necessarily make significant strides to become a more conservative balance sheet, the more acquisitive you are, the more you have to do just to stay where you are. And I think that's probably what Jim was trying to say. And I think it's consistent with what you're saying. We're not managing necessarily towards a rating. We're managing towards a level of debt and liquidity and cash flow coverage that we think is right for our portfolio and can survive all markets. It's substantially below where we were in '06, and '07. It's right about where we think we need to be. But these deals are big and everytime we do big deals, you have to do some fine-tuning to keep that balance sheet on track. If of that answers your question, that's the kind of how we're looking at it.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no further questions in the queue.", "Marc Holliday", "Sure, okay. Thank you very much for everyone listening in, and we look forward to speaking with you in the near term.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.", "Operator", "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q1 2011 SL Green Realty Corp. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Chantal Lei, and I will be your facilitator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today's call, Ms. Heidi Gillette. Please proceed.", "Heidi Gillette", "Thank you, everybody, for joining us, and welcome to SL Green's Realty Corp.'s First Quarter 2011 Earnings Results Conference Call. This conference call is being recorded. ", "At this time, the company would like to remind the listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from predictions that management may make today. Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the company's Form 10-K and other reports filed with the SEC. ", "Also during today's conference call, the company may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulations G. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure discussed and the reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found on the company's website at www.slgreen.com by selecting the press release regarding the company's first quarter earnings. ", "Before turning the call over to Marc Holliday, Chief Executive Officer of SL Green, I would like to ask those are who are participating in the Q&A portion of the call to please limit your questions to two per person. ", "Thank you. I will not turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay, thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today. Last evening, we reported earnings for the first quarter, which in my opinion, are reflective of the company's extraordinary efforts resulting in a high degree of our performance in all areas of the firm, demonstrating a very balanced strategy. Highlights were on the gamut from increases in same store performance and rental rates; substantial gain taken in the structured finance portfolio and absence of additional write-downs or loan loss reserves for the quarter; occupancy increases in Manhattan portfolio; substantial new acquisitions, such as the one we announced earlier this morning; an increase to the 2011 earnings guidance and credit ratings upgrade received from Standard & Poor's, in response to deliberate actions taken to improve our overall credit metrics by issuing equity, unencumbering assets and retaining cash flow and selling properties.", "The foundation for these results is a continuation of overall market improvement in New York City. The economic climate is reacting quite favorably to a number of factors: First, opening recent passage of a budget, which included no new taxes and a reduction in overall governmental expenditures; also steady improvement in job creation, combined with increased consumer spending and increased corporate revenues; substantial availability of debt financing and a stability of interest rates at or near historical low levels, in part due to QE2. You can see how all these factors are coming together at the moment to basically create the framework in which we're able to execute our strategy. ", "On the jobs front, where there were another 11,000 new private sector jobs created just in the first quarter of 2011 with 4,000 of those being office-using jobs. We are continuing to forecast between 20,000 and 25,000 new office-using jobs for all of 2011, which is somewhat ahead of New York City's estimates, but we think consistent with what we're hearing and seeing in the market. Only half of the projected job losses from the beginning of the recession were actually realized. And at this point, the city has regained 40% of those losses after bottoming in 2009. ", "Examples of some recent market activity that we think back up some of our estimates include: Citigroup, which is rumored to be adding up to 500 new banking and trading positions; Bloomberg, who as we reported earlier in the year, signed up for an incremental 400,000 square feet of 120 Park Avenue, along with Wells Fargo, who signed up for an additional 275,000 square feet at the Mobile Building on 42nd Street, both of these being first quarter deals. And we're even seeing this improvement in the media industry where one of our largest tenants, Viacom, just announced revenue increases of 20% and net income increase of 53% for the quarter, driven in large part by extremely robust ad revenues. ", "Tax collection revenues, business tax collection revenues, another important indicator of the health of the economy, we're up approximately or expected to be up 15% in New York City year-over-year when that tally is ultimately finalized, and personal income tax receipts are also expected to be up between 7% and 9% with increases in sales in New York City also exceeding 10% on year-over-year metrics. It's quite apparent that New York City recovery continues to outpace a strengthening but still lagging overall U.S. recovery. ", "With all of these stimulus, real estate asset prices continue to increase sharply. At our December Investor Meeting, we stated that 2010 was a transitional year with the market moving off the bottom and starting to produce increases in rental rates and asset prices. We predicted that this would accelerate in 2011, much like we saw rents and pricing in 2005 increased after a transitional year in 2004, that was very similar to what we have said in 2010. ", "So again, we are seeing certain cycles repeat themselves from early 90s, late 90s, early 2000. And now late 2010, we feel confident that our strategy is well timed, but also is risk mitigated by managing a prudent balance sheet and also selectively joint venturing assets to diversify certain risks as we go along and enhance our returns with institutional JV partners.", "In fact, just four months into the year, the rapidity of the recovery is outpacing even our expectations with many asset prices approaching 85% to 90% of peak valuations that were achieved in 2006 and 2007. In this interest rate environment, with interest rate swaps at about 200 basis points inside of where they were way back in '06 and '07, you may possibly see a return to peak pricing levels in 2012 and 2013. This would imply sub-5% cap rate pricing, which again, is consistent with historical norms for cap rate spreads to treasuries, which we detailed back in December to be between 100 and 150 basis points over comparable term treasuries. There is clearly an expectation that rental rates, which were up about 5% in 2010 and look to be up about another 10% in 2011, will begin to exceed SL Green's earlier estimates of 25% rental rate growth over the 3-year period 2011, '12 and '13. ", "In anticipation of these current market dynamics, SL Green has had a decidedly aggressive market posture for the past 18 months after a 2.5 year hiatus. During that period of time, I believe the strategic value of our platform was clearly on display as we consummated over 3 million square feet of off-market transactions utilizing our relationships, structuring capabilities and debt investment platform to maximize opportunities for this company. The examples of this are numerous with counter-parties, such as City Investment Fund, SITQ, a number of German bank lenders, Bank of China and The Moinian Group, to name a few, that produced opportunities for us, such as 280 Park Avenue, 3 Columbus Circle, the buyout of 1515 Broadway, the buyout of 521 Fifth Avenue, the acquisition and ultimate redemption of 510 Madison Avenue debt investment and the same as it relates to 666 Fifth Avenue. ", "This list goes on and on, but these, just to name are transaction, many of which are all within the past year, 1.5 years. We're incredibly proud of these results in such a compressed period of time, thereby allowing our shareholders to benefit as much as possible from a recovering market, not only relating to our existing inventory of assets and tenants, but also with the goal of continued growth of the portfolio to leverage our returns in this increasing market environment. We don't believe in simply riding with the market, but rather, we believe in cause and effect in trying to determine our outcomes, sound investment strategies and careful balance sheet management. ", "With that, I'd like to turn it over to Andrew to discuss in detail some of the more notable transactions in the quarter.", "Andrew Mathias", "Okay. Good afternoon, everybody. We had a furious quarter of activity since our last call, capped off by our announcement this morning of our purchase of SITQ's interest in 1515 Broadway. More on that in a bit. ", "As we told you in December, the capital keeps coming and there are not enough quality assets for sale to satiate demand. This, in a fertile financing market, are mating from material cap rate compression in the first four months of the year. Deals like 750 Seventh Avenue, Starrett-Lehigh and other pending transactions are demonstrating people's confidence in Manhattan and its rental prospects.", "The quarter started with our purchase of City Investment Fund's interest in 521 Fifth Avenue. Last week, we completed the recapitalization of that building exercising our contractual right to buyout the fee position and completing a new $150 million loan with an Asian bank, a brand new bank joining our family of lenders. 521 represented this bank's first large commercial real estate loan in New York City, another encouraging trend as more foreign balance sheet lenders get active in this market. That loan is fully prepayable without penalty and gives us extraordinary flexibility as we complete our lease up of the asset and determine the best long-term financing strategy. ", "We then moved on to 3 Columbus Circle where we closed our previously announced joint venture with Joe Moinian. Since closing, we've had a very busy quarter with the building, both on the physical side, as we prepare for the formal launch of our marketing campaign on May 5 and on the balance sheet side, as we completed a refinancing of a bridge loan we used to close the venture. The $300 million facility is significantly ahead of our underwriting in terms of both cost and timing and promises to further enhance our returns on this investment. The leasing professionals who've gotten a sneak peek at our marketing floors have been blown away by the transformation of the building, and initial leasing inquiries have also exceeded our expectations.", "This morning's 1515 announcement caps off 3 million square feet of off-market acquisition activity, a real credit to our investments and underwriting teams. Since buying 1515 in 2002, we've overseen its transformation to a premiere office and retail trophy, and we're excited about the opportunity to consolidate the interests. ", "One way to think about the deal, capping the retail NOI at a conservative 5% cap rate based on 666 Fifth and several other recent retail trades, leases at a basis of around $500 per square foot in the office portion of the property. We have several revenue-enhancing initiatives underway and believe we can continue our 9-year trend of increasing NOI at the building.", "On the sale front, we entered into a binding contract to sell 28 West 44th Street completing our disposition to plan for our 2 mid-block 44th Street assets. The cap rate at 5.4% was reflective of a tightening market, and we had a solid field of bidders around this number. Expect to see us rollout additional properties for sale as the year progresses. ", "On the structure finance front, our big transaction of the quarter was 280 Park Avenue. While our partnership with Vornado, a friendly competitor over the years, took some by surprise, we saw a win-win combination on one of Manhattan's best assets. As a result of this transaction, we reduced our aggregate investment in the asset by $125 million while booking an attractive gain and picking up 50% of the junior most mezzanine interest on the capital side. ", "We've otherwise, been active in the secondary market, buying mezzanine positions in our several new originations in our pipeline as well. Given the runoff we've had in our book, we expect positive net originations over the next couple of quarters with returns in the 8% to 10% range, reflecting tightening in this market.", "We also had a notable resolution in our Third Party Special Servicing business, which should contribute to second quarter results. Fitch has again recognized our excellence in this area, upgrading our platforms\u2019 rating again as of yesterday to CSS2. This rating allows us to handle virtually all highly structured loan workouts. Congratulations to David Schonbraun, Andrew Falk and their team on this great accomplishment in the Special Servicing area. ", "And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jim to take you through the earnings in more detail.", "James Mead", "Thank you, Andrew. I'm going to start off this financial discussion today with some overall observations, and then I'll turn it over to Matt to review our guidance for the remainder of the year. ", "Last night, we reported a $1.75 FFO per diluted share after giving effect to about $0.03 of transaction costs incurred during the quarter. Let me give you a bit of a breakdown on the composition of this number. $46.2 million or $0.57 per share came from transactions in our debt portfolio. The bulk of this, $0.47 per share, was from the sale of our mezzanine debt positions in 280 Park Avenue to a joint venture with Vornado in which we are 50% partners. In effect, we accelerated the amortization of the discount. We have embedded in our position that would have otherwise been taken into income over the remaining term, if we had held these positions to maturity. ", "The majority of the remaining $0.10 per share was gain recognized on the sale of the mezzanine position at 1166 Avenue of the Americas. Excluding these sources of added income, the company's FFO was $99.6 million or $1.18 per share, an increase of 10% from last year's first quarter. As you've already heard this morning, demand continues to strengthen and our financial results reflect the market's recovering employment, office leasing activity and net absorption. Improvements are showing up in our mark-to-market and leases signed and leases that commenced during the quarter in Manhattan, which were both positive. We signed 565,000 square feet of leases during the first quarter and had a healthy 10.6% mark-to-market. Combining our results with overall improving market statistics is a strong indicator of the positive turn in direction for the year.", "We also saw a pronounced improvement in lease concessions during the first quarter with a just over three months of free rent and about a $29 per square foot of TIs. Occupancy in our Manhattan portfolio increased year-over-year by 90 basis points and is now 94.9%. We positioned ourselves to be able to capitalize on the strengthening market in the near term by acquiring new vacancies, such as at our 3 Columbus Circle joint venture that was just introduced into the leasing market a few weeks ago and at our 100 Church, which we took control of last year and is currently 71% leased. ", "Our suburban portfolio performance is lagging, and we continue to be defensively clustered. We signed 142,000 square feet of leases in the first quarter with a 0.1% mark-to-market on the office component of that leasing. It's important to note that our 86.3% occupancy, while down year-over-year, substantially outperforms the market we are in and that there are some positive signs with the expansions in a few of the larger tenants in Stamford and increasing activity in Westchester. We'll see how things develop over the year, so there's more to come on that.", "While the office cycle in Manhattan is rebounding, we expect that are NOI performance will lag. Cyclically, the last few quarters and the next couple would represent the bottom of the market for us in terms of property financial performance. With that as a context, we are encouraged by the company's first quarter 2.3% same store NOI growth from the year ago quarter. This improved performance was as a result of strengthening property operations and supports an increasingly optimistic view on the remainder of the year.", "The company's debt and preferred equity portfolio was reduced by $384 million during quarter and now stands at about $580 million or 5% of the company's total assets. The biggest components of this reduction were the sale of our mezzanine position in 280 Park Avenue and the early repayment of our mezzanine loan at 666 Fifth Avenue. The average IRR on this $490 million in closed-out positions was about 30%. ", "And partially offsetting these reductions were $104 million of purchase debt positions that had a yield of about 11%. Importantly, we took no reserves against our debt and preferred equity portfolio during the quarter.", "Now turning to the balance sheet. We've been active investors over the past six months and the balance sheet has grown by about $850 million, largely through new investments and properties. Our historical approach to funding new investment activities has been the first, the aggressive recyclers of assets and consistent with our past practices turned properties that relative to the rest of the portfolio, have fewer growth prospects to a lesser quality. We are currently under contract ", "to sell 28 West 44th Street, and as you heard Andrew say, we have other potential targets for later this year. And then if after these sales, we expect longer term growth in the balance sheet, our approach has been to fund to maintain our credit metrics and available liquidity. Consistent with this in the past several weeks, you've seen us tap our ATM program to raise $311 million in newly issued common stock. ", "We've also taken additional steps to strengthen our balance sheet. To give you a sense of the improvements they've made, let me contrast where we are today, against where we were a year ago. First, our average consolidated debt maturity is increasing to over 6 years from 5.3 years. Our floating rate debt, net of floating debt rate investments has been reduced to below 20%. Our debt-to-EBITDA, including prorated joint venture debt, is 8.2x income in comparison to 8.4x last year. And using the methodology that the rating agencies use, our debt-to-EBITDA is below 8x. And finally, our liquidity stands at $1.2 billion, an increase of $400 million from this time last year.", "So as a result of these improvements, the disciplined approach we have shown in balancing the funding of our growth and due to the overall improvements in our operating environment, we achieved a major milestone with the upgrade of our credit rating on our senior unsecured notes by Standard & Poor's to investment grade. As we move forward, we will continue to prioritize steps to enhance our liquidity and access to low-cost capital. ", "Now I'll turn the call over to Matt to review guidance.", "Matt DiLiberto", "Thanks, Jim. First, I'll take a step back and quickly summarize some of the basic assumptions incorporated into our FFO guidance of $4.05 or $4.20 per share provided at our December Investor Conference and how that compares with our performance in the first quarter.", "On the leasing front, we projected mark-to-market on 2011 leasing of minus 5% to plus 5%. In the first quarter, that compares with signed leases that had an embedded mark-to-market of 10.6%, ahead of our expectations thus far. We expected that same store NOI to be flat to modestly positive in 2011 versus 2010. In the first quarter, same store GAAP NOI, on a combined basis, increased 2.3%, also slightly ahead of where we anticipated. We expected operating expenses up by between 2.5% to 3.5%, primarily driven by higher real estate taxes and utility costs. As of the first quarter, OpEx is up by about 2.5% right on target.", "We did project a certain level of new investment activity. Obviously, we've been very active on both the debt and equity fronts, thus far. We expected  LIBOR to increase over the course of the year. Thus far, this assumption has not played out, but very few people are under the illusion that LIBOR will remain of these levels forever. ", "We expected debt or other investment reserves, none of which we've taken in the first quarter. And we expect the transaction cost commensurate with our consistent investment activity. This quarter, we incurred approximately $2.5 million in transaction costs, which is pretty much in line with our expectations. The transaction volume continues to be robust. ", "All that considered, our overall operating performance, thus far, is trending modestly ahead of our original expectations. As a result of these positive indicators and as a result of the gains we recognized on our debt investments during the first quarter, we have revised our FFO guidance for 2011 upwards to $4.65 to $4.80 per share. On a normalized basis, FFO for the first quarter, excluding the $46.2 million of additional income recognized on the debt positions we sold or where we were repaid, would equate to about $1.18 per share. Recall that we view items like lease cancellation income, which was approximately $2.7 million in the first quarter, as recurring given the historical precedent.", "If you were to annualize the $1.18 per share, you wouldn't expect that our revised guidance to be higher than the $4.60 to $4.85 we've provided. However, as we look ahead to the second, third and fourth quarters, it is important to note those items that will cause the upcoming quarters to vary from the implied Q1 run rate. ", "The most significant impact comes from the acceleration of income on our debt investments in 280 Park. Recall that the total discount on our purchases of those positions was approximately $41 million. We began amortizing that purchase discount into earnings in the fourth quarter of 2010 over the remaining term of the debt. The \"gain\" we recognized in the first quarter of 2011 was basically just the acceleration of the remaining unamortized portion of those purchase discounts. ", "So while we do still hold 50% or $200 million of debt at 280 through our joint venture with Vornado, that income stream will go away. Also given the uncertainty of the property, we have excluded any future interest income of those debt positions from our guidance. ", "In addition, during the first quarter, we are repaid on our $137 million mezzanine investment in the retail condo at 666 Fifth Avenue. This was a repayment we have been discussing since the middle of last year, and we're expecting at some point this year. However, this investment provided recurring yield of approximately 13%, while we are finding a lot of good debt investments in this market, even Andrew would admit that this income stream, which is difficult to replicate.", "On the financing side, we're in the process of refinancing the low leverage mortgage at 919 Third Avenue, which matures this year. The financing of this Class A stabilized property is very well received by the market and the bidding was competitive as we referenced at the Investor Conference, we anticipated increasing the size of this financing to more prudent level on a long-term fixed rate basis, which will significantly reduce coupon, but increase overall interest expense at the property from levels precedent in the first quarter. We expect this financing to close in the coming weeks. ", "Separately, as it relates to interest expense, we are very cognizant of the current interest rate environment, and while our net floating rate exposures well below 20%, even after taking on additional floating rate debt on 1515 Broadway, we do monitor the forward LIBOR curve very carefully and are conservative in our thinking about debt cost for the remainder of 2011.", "Finally as of last week, we had issued approximately $311 million of new common equity for our ATM plan with approximately $214 million remaining available to issue under the plan. We feel this equity is a very important piece of our strategy to prudently manage the balance sheet and finance our investment activity over the course of 2011. ", "Turning to FAD, which is FFO less any noncash accounting adjustments and cycle leasing and recurring capital costs, in December, we provided an estimated FAD figure of the $2.47 per share based on the mid-point of our FFO guidance of that time of $4.13 per share. As a result of the items noted above, giving considerations only half of that 280 Park gain being factored into FAD, we now expect our FAD per share to be closer to $2.60 per share for 2011. ", "Year-to-date, our capital expenditures are in line with our expectations. Recall CapEx is historically the lowest during the first quarter of the year, but we will incur some additional capital costs as a result of the consolidation of our partners' interests in 1515 Broadway and 521 Fifth. ", "With that, I'll turn it back over to Marc for some closing comments.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. Thank you. That's really what we wanted to get across as part of the prepared remarks. We've left one hour for Q&A. The question period seems to have been increasing over the past few quarters. So we want to leave plenty of time. We are going do a hard stop at 3:30 if there are still remaining questions. If not, we'll just end it whenever it ends. But there's been a lot of activity we try to concisely convey that in the past half hour, but I'm sure there's a number of questions, so let's get right into it.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from line of John Guinee of Stifel.", "John Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "John Guinee here. Andrew, you guys are still basically running at an opportunity fund strategy here. And it is still primarily net asset valuation despite the fact you guys have had good FFO and FAD numbers. Can you walk through the 4 or 5 fully -- without affecting any confidentiality agreements, just walk through the 4 or 5 assets currently on the market right now in New York City and how those are expected to trade and why?", "Andrew Mathias", "Sure. I can give you a little bit of color on what's out there in the market now. 750 Seventh was, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that was an asset that Hines marketed that they own with GM Pension in Times Square. That asset, we believe is on the contract and should close shortly. It's a prime asset about 20 or so years old. And there was ferocious demand for this asset so much so that the bidding process got pre-empted to a buyer. So we're curious to see where that price shakes out on that asset. 1633 Broadway also in Times Square area. Paramount is rumored to have consolidated their partners there, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch. And I think that deal also has yet to close. There was a fee interest on the market recently that traded at a low 3% cap rate, sub-3.5% cap rate. Obviously, different kind of position and subject to a long-term leasehold. But that was another very positive trade to the market. I think there's a lot of funds that are considering assets. I mean, it was rumored today that 1211 Sixth can [ph] may be looking at selling. So you're seeing sellers start to re-evaluate as the market achieves new pricing levels. And I think we expect to see more of that, but there is still more demand than there is supply right now in the investment sales market.", "John Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "How about the Seagram's Building?", "Andrew Mathias", "That asset has been reported to be out there as well marketed and looking for the very top pricing, trophy-type pricing -- mostly how that goes as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of Jamie Feldman of Bank of America.", "James Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Can you talk a little bit about any difference you may be seeing in demand or leasing demand for your kind of higher end Class A versus your more kind of prewar? And just what if there's bifurcation of the market at all?", "Steven Durels", "Steve Durels. We saw a year ago that the upper floors, the boutique space, the really high profile-type space was in active demand and rents were rising. But I think for the past 6 to 8, 10 months, we've seen a pretty constant demand or consistent demand across the portfolio. The good news is the strength of the market seems to be buying to location and type of business. Meaning that there's strong demand across the board and we've seen rents rise across the board even though it may have been led by either a high profile, upper floor space and most recently, by the really big blocks of space.", "James Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then, Jim or Matt, I'm just wondering can you briefly just walk us through the ramp up in the straight-line and other noncash in the quarter? Was that pretty ramp big jump to $53 million?", "James Mead", "Yes. Matt, I'll touch on that. So one of the things that drives that significantly higher is about $20 million that's there, which is the noncash portion of the gain we recognized at 280. Recall, we only sold 50% of it. So that's a cash gain, the other half of it is really a fair value gain. The other large component that drives the straight-line adjustment up are the fee positions that we acquired late in December, 885 Third, 2 Herald Square and 292 Madison. Those contribute around $9 million to $10 million of additional straight-line adjustment per quarter. So those are the two big components within straight-line that hit in the first quarter that would cause the variance to prior quarters.", "James Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch", "So I guess the recurring is $33 million. Is that the right way to think about it?", "James Mead", "It's probably just a little south of $30 million on a recuring basis. We had a couple of retro adjustments for prior leasing, but it's going to be just south of $30 million, I think, on a recurring basis.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of George Auerbach of ISI Group.", "George Auerbach - ISI Group Inc.", ",", "Matt, just a follow up. So in the first quarter, what was the GAAP NOI received from the ground fee positions?", "Matt DiLiberto", "It actually equates exactly to what the cash rent is that we reported in the Property Tables in the supplementals. So in total, for the quarter, it's just under $6 million for those three positions in total.", "George Auerbach - ISI Group Inc.", "Okay. And Andy, you mentioned that you'd be a net originator of structured finance during the year. Can you give us some sort of a range of where you think the balance could end up at year end?", "Andrew Mathias", "It's sort of -- it's tough to predict, George, just based on -- because we don't control repayments, obviously. But certainly, our target is higher than the balance is now. And to pick an exact number is difficult.", "George Auerbach - ISI Group Inc.", "Do you think you'll get back to the kind of the $900 million to $1 billion you were at in the first quarter?", "Marc Holliday", "It's certainly possible as transaction size increases as bigger building start to trade again. So I wouldn't rule it out. I mean, we just got to go find the deals. Right now, the deals I referenced that we have in pipeline are more in the sort of $15 million to $50 million range. And we're going to close a couple of those. But we're certainly out big game hunting as well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jay Habermann with Goldman Sachs.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Marc, you mentioned pricing getting closer to kind of the peak levels that we saw a few years ago. I'm just wondering, how much of that 30% or 25% to 30% sort of increase in net effective rent do you think we have realized since the bottom? And how much more do you think is yet to come?", "Marc Holliday", "I think half roughly has been realized, and I don't really know how much is left to come. Based on our projections, roughly another half. But the market would seem to be indicating at least that or more. We tend to be pricing into our underwriting these days depending on the asset, depending on the submarket, anywhere between another 15% to 20% of what will cause extraordinary growth before leveling off into ordinary growth from today off of the gains we've already seen [ph]. So given the price levels that we've seen recently in terms of closed deals and some of the pending deals that Andrew mentioned, one of our conclusions would be that there are people pricing in more growth than that, although that's not necessarily our view. I think for several years or at least two years, we've been ahead of the market in terms of estimating growth potential of rents. Now I think the market has caught up for possibly exceeded our estimates for growth from here forward. If that answers the questions.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "It's very helpful. And also you'd mentioned I think on past calls about the number of companies seeking to consolidate and perhaps seeking larger blocks of space. Can you just discuss some of those requirements and where we are today? And also I know you have a development site in midtown, is that something that's starting to appear attractive?", "Marc Holliday", "Talking about -- Steve Durels is here and I guess to the extent of whatever we can share that's out there in the market, certain requirements that are out there, which are either consolidations or consolidations and growth more importantly, what does that look like?", "Steven Durels", "Sure. Well I think there's a couple of things that we're that seeing in the marketplace. We're still seeing deals driven by tenants who decide to consolidate both smaller tenants and very large tenants. We're seeing a lot more relocations in the market as tenants have increasingly become long-term managers of their real estate rather than the short-term reactors that they were a couple of years ago. We're seeing tenants that are making decisions because they have an element of growth in their requirement as employment picks up and as they're growing their businesses. We're seeing more tenants take excess space from what they are leaving behind. And some of the big guys that are out in the market today, we're seeing that the banks are out in the market today, BofA. We're seeing law firms like Morrison Foerster out of the markets. UBS, Morgan Stanley are all very large big block users of space that are shopping the market that has a very limited supply of big blocks. So I think the quick answer is there's no one specific area in the market that seems to be driving it. The good news is that it's a very broad based list of reasons as to why tenants are moving in and picking up more space.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. On the development side?", "Marc Holliday", "Yes. In relation to 317, where we've ramped our kind of preliminary efforts on that side, as we've mentioned back in December and I think we'll have more to say on that particular site and some of our thoughts as to viability, timeline of execution, things like that later in the year. I would say towards the third or fourth quarter, we'd be prepare to address that I think more fully than we are right now.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman of Citi.", "Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc", "It's Josh Attie with Michael. Can you talk about that 10.5% rent growth on the leases that were signed in the first quarter? That was on about 400,000 square feet of space. Was the rent increase broad-based across all that space? Or was it skewed towards some pieces and lower in others?", "Steven Durels", "Well, whenever were reporting mark-to-market, it's tough because it's clearly dependent upon the leases that are rolling off and leases that may have been written anywhere between 5 and 10 years ago. So I\u2019d say, probably 2/3 of the deals, 2/3 of the leases that we signed this quarter had somewhere between modest and significant mark-to-market. And there were still a couple of that were negative simply because there were chunks of space that were at rents well above market. They just escalated to a very high number. And then they were probably maybe 10% or 20% kind of that were just kind of flat.", "Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc", "So I guess, asking it another way, 400,000, it's tough to read too much into 400,000 square feet of space. When you look out over the next 3 quarters and you think about the signings that you're going to be doing, do you feel like they're going to hover around 10.5%? Or do you feel like there'll be a lot of volatility up and down based on what happens to be rolling?", "Steven Durels", "Let's -- rather than focus on mark-to-market, I think it's more useful if I give you a sense as to where we see rents going. Market rents from where we sit today rather than compare them to simply those limited transactions that are maybe burning off on our portfolio. We're still seeing solid increases in rents. We're going through a pricing exercise right now where we're about ready to raise the asking rents in half the buildings in the portfolio. And we're seeing concessions continue to tighten up where TIs, not every deal has to now include a turnkey installation. We're building space where we're capping our contributions on raw space, and we're seeing the free rent significantly reduced from a year ago, where it was usually 12 to 15 months a year ago on large deals where space was raw. Now kind in the 8 to 10 months of free rent, including the construction time. So the combination of continued pressure on upward rents and the timing of concessions, I think we're going to continue to see noticeable improvement for the balance of this year.", "Marc Holliday", "I think, we were -- we give a guidance on it about 3 or 4 months ago, which was I think about somewhere between 0% to 5% increase, right, on a...", "Steven Durels", "Plus/minus 5%.", "Marc Holliday", "Plus/minus 5%. And I think if we were plus 5%, minus 5% in December, we're probably somewhere closer to 0% to plus 5%, 0% to plus 10% in that range. So I would say low- to medium-single digits on the positive side. So probably a slight adjustment. But I think what Steve is saying is that more important to us then what we're going to get in next quarter is the fact that we have an overall embedded market rent for 25 million square feet and if rents are up, we're going to be bleeding that in over time and that has a real present-day value to us. That may or not be achieved in the next quarter or 2. That just really is a very isolated, dependent on -- could be one or 2 big tenants that we signed up in '00 or '01  that are now rolling. But in general, by and large, we see at the peak of the market, SL Green had a 40% to 50% embedded portfolio of growth. At the trough of the market, we were about 0% embedded market growth. And I think right now, we are seeing we have returned to -- if you had to pick a number, maybe 5%, maybe high-single digits, 5%, 6%, 7% extended market growth. But with the trajectory that I mentioned earlier on our underwriting of some still pretty significant rental growth for the balance of this year and into '12 and '13.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "Marc, Michael speaking. Just a question on OPPLTEV [ph], I think the most recent plan, I think it's now, with where the stock is, I guess that has been triggered, the $75 million plan. I guess, where is that today? And where is the Board in terms of re-upping a new plan in terms of compensation philosophy?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, this was also, I think, we touched on this a bit in December. The program that we put in place, I'm going to say roughly 1.25 years, sort of 1.5 year ago has been maximized, but not entirely vested. We get into that issue of I think somewhat of a misunderstanding in the market at large that while these programs may be earned their 5-year payouts, their long-term retention plans and at the Board level, our philosophy is to layer these plans every -- whenever one is capped out, we look to embed a new plan, which would again have a long-term retention element, 4 to 5 years, going forward. So I can tell you that since the cap has been reaching end some because I think the cap was somewhere in the 60s, and today, we are at the stock price much higher than that, we are going to explore putting a new plan in place, which would look, I assume, somewhat similar in size, in structure with 30% increases having to be achieved before there's any value in the plan and then beyond that, some participation in what we deem excess profits beyond a baseline hurdle amount, which in the past has been 30%. So I don't think there's any change in philosophy. We've done 4 of those plans over the past 10 years or so. Of those 4 plans, 3 of them were in the money, one expired worthless and in this most recent plan, even though the stock price is well ahead of the cap, only 1/3 of it has actually been earned, another 1/3 gets earned at the end of this year if the stock price remains above the cap, the final 1/3 at the end of 2012. So that's where we stand on that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson of Macquarie.", "Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research", "Could you give some color behind the $104 million of new structured finance investment in the quarter?", "Marc Holliday", "Sure. I think the bulk of it was acquisitions in the secondary market where we continue to be the most active buyers of mezzanine paper in New York City and that was and I think that was -- and then bulk of the balance was 280 Park, where we made a couple of new originations, did the joint venture with Vornado and as part of the joint venture, we purchased half of their junior most mezzanine position as well.", "Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then can you talk about how the repositioning of 600 Lex is going and that type and level of tenant demand that you're seeing?", "Steven Durels", "Sure. It's actually doing great. We signed 3 new tenants. We've renewed one. All our rents substantially ahead of underwrite. The capital work is ongoing. We've completed -- remember, we have a fairly modest capital program for this building, but we have completed the lobby work. We're about a week away from completion of the plaza work. We've done one public quarter. We have 2 more to go because most of the floors are for tenant floors and the bathrooms are in renovation as the floors turnover. As predicted, the dominant interest has come from financial service tenants. I think every lease that we signed so far has been with a financial service firm. And this is an exercise primarily in rebranding the building, repositioning it to a different place in the market and really re-educating the brokerage community about an asset that had cut fallen off of a lot of people's radar. So the combination of that effort, that marketing effort together with the completion of our capital program is, so far, ahead of expectation.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers of RBC Capital Markets.", "David Rodgers - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Andrew, I was wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on just kind of the mess environment overall, structured finance indications in the city. Obviously, with interest rates low and discounts may be abating, can you give it a little bit color, I guess, where you would could stop doing investments in the mez portfolio? What discounts look like today? And again, at what point you would be more inclined to put money directly into assets?", "Andrew Mathias", "Yes. I think we're actually doing our fair share of both today. I think yields are in the sort of the 8% to 10% range. We're starting to see the re-emergence of a floating rate market, which really hasn't existed too much other than balance sheet lenders, but I think you're going to see the first [indiscernible] floating rate securitization shortly here. And my guess is there's a lot of demand for those bombs that'll blow out and make for a much more healthy and vibrant securitized floating rate market, which will be good for our structured finance program because they need to plug gaps between investment grade and loan amounts, more so than balance sheet lenders do. But as long as we can continue making 8% to 10%-type returns today, that's fairly attractive. And we think a very good balance with the real estate acquisitions we're making, where a lot of times, 600 Lex, 3 Columbus, we have significant lease-up periods and periods with not as much cash flow.", "David Rodgers - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "And from originations standpoint versus an acquisition -- position standpoint, are you able to get discounts still in acquiring, or is it going to be mostly in origination market going forward?", "Andrew Mathias", "I think the joke is par is the new $0.80, so there's been several trades at par and over in the city and that really seems to be the way it's heading. So where you have decent coupons, you can pretty much expect pieces to trade at par and buyers are saying, \"I get paid off. I make a fine yield and if I don't, it's a basis in the asset that I like.\" So it's got an increasingly tougher to get discount other than pay for that has very low coupons.", "David Rodgers - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "And I guess last thought on that topic, and the yield is -- do you think, at this point, you have to be underwriting more as a loan-to-own program? And as you're talking about fairly substantial rental rate growth in the assets, it may be 5 caps versus making these loans at an 8% or so. Do you get to that point where it's going to be a loan-to-own or it's less attractive?", "Andrew Mathias", "Yes. I think the opposite of it I think, it's more counting on the debt to perform. We're always underwriting the downside, we have a program where it generates consistent good earnings for us, and we're looking to get paid off and for the loans to perform. So the loan-to-own sort of concept has gotten a lot tougher as cap rates compress and assets came back, were recappable at the equity level as opposed to from within the debt.", "Marc Holliday", "I would just add to that, we've originated since program inception almost 100 separate positions in structured finance and we've had one foreclosure, 100 Church downtown. So this -- we run the business, almost exclusively for yield or for pipeline on a consensual sense. But loan-to-own is just something that really doesn't enter into this equation or else we wouldn't have the pipeline we do. We wouldn't have some of our competitors in New York look to us as their preferred lending source because they like to deal with us in the way we act and restructure and bring some creativity to deals to help them maximize their economics as opposed to the general market at large. So I think that's why you'll see we're still going to do significant new origination volumes in this program, as Andrew said, through '11 and beyond. We've been doing it year-over-year for almost 14 years now with one foreclosure. And in that case, we wanted to restructure the debt. The borrower didn't want to. We were amenable to a restructuring, it just didn't work out, and round up taking that project back. That's it.", "David Rodgers - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "I guess one final question then, do you think that incrementally, you'll see while you stay in Manhattan with those positions, will you start to maybe diversify away from office and look at whatever it might be hotel, retail, apartment more aggressively in the next 12 to 18 months?", "Marc Holliday", "You mean in Manhattan or...", "David Rodgers - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Yes, in Manhattan.", "Marc Holliday", "Let's say -- I mean, I wouldn't say we start to. We have done several, a number, I mean, more than -- I would say 10 [indiscernible]. Retail and residential projects, with all but one having turned out quite well and the one we've talked about at length for over the years is Stuyvesant Town, which is one of the bad investments we made over that period of time in this program. I don't think that's soured us on residential. I think it certainly made us a little more cautious and careful on cap structure and the rent stabilization laws, which got reversed mid-way through the deal and caused havoc through that whole sector of projects not just Stuy Town. But we have done a number of apartment and condo deals certainly retail deals with a great degree of success. And I think it'll certainly be dwarfed by the office transactions just because the office deals are bigger and more plentiful, but no, we certainly see and underwrite a lot of those other types of deals.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Knott of Green Street Advisors.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc.", "Can you just comment on sort of your experience at the ATMs so far?

Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Andrew Mathias, Jim Mead, Matt DiLiberto and I will provide you with some commentary on the market and second quarter performance. I'm pleased that our significant efforts over the past 2 years of the recovery are evident in our reported results for the second quarter. The core earnings from the same store properties, lease up of newly acquired properties, high earnings from structured finance, substantial gains on sale and operational expense controls all contributed to a very solid quarter, which exceeded our already optimistic expectations. ", "While credit markets have come under pressure over concerns about domestic economic growth and European countries as debt problems, the local New York economy remains a relative bright spot. And it doesn't seem to be showing any signs of reversal that is in any way inconsistent with what we typically experience during these summer months. ", "In fact, over 11 million square feet of leasing activity has been recorded in Midtown alone during the first half of the year or 1.85 million square feet per month, which is an exceptionally high rate and higher than the 1.5 million square feet a month that we've mentioned in the past as somewhat of the threshold amount beyond which we get positive absorption. ", "With over 2.3 million square feet of absorption, the vacancy rate has broken through the 10% mark and currently sits at 9.8% in Midtown and 9.4% for overall Manhattan. Driving the absorption of Midtown is the continuation of growth in office-using jobs, which is predominantly made up of professional business firms. And that growth for the 6 months of the year stands at about 13,000 new jobs, approximately 5,000 jobs ahead of the city's forecast and on track with our estimates back in December of 20,000 to 25,000 jobs added for the full year. ", "Interesting to note that Wall Street is on track to greatly exceed the $20 billion of forecasted profits for the year, having already banked approximately $15 billion to $16 billion profits in member firm profits this year to date. New York City payroll and withholding data is running ahead of projections. And hospitality and tourism activity is at or near peak levels. So this marked environment clearly is consistent with what we've described in the past as market leading and performance and balanced performance, where we're seeing growth from all sectors of the economy. And while it's been somewhat slower growth than we've experienced in prior recoveries, we think it's a very good environment for us to execute our business plan. The environment particularly bodes well for our New York portfolio wherein we added 12 properties over the past 2 years, representing $4.5 billion of transaction values, $2.5 billion of which alone represents SLG share. ", "Many of these new additions contain substantial vacancies. I think it was about 1.8 million square feet of vacancy acquired to be exact in those 12 transactions, all of which represent redevelopment potential, re-lease up potential, such as 3 Columbus Circle, 600 Lex, 125 Park, 100 Church and 280 Park. With respect to this last property, 280 Park, we're feeling very confident that we will be able to reposition that property with our partner into one of the leading commercial properties on Park Avenue commanding among the highest rents. We will have large blocks that are -- will be able to be delivered into what we think will be the exact right time in the market and will be delivered after $150 million or more redevelopment project for that property. So in hindsight, we're happy with each of the 12 properties that we acquired. We think we played that market exactly as we wanted to over the recovery period. I think we've now moved into the middle innings, and while we still have a pipeline of real estate opportunities, I don't expect that you'll see us transact anywhere near the $4.5 billion of volume over the next 2 years as you did over the prior 2 years. ", "Looking specifically at our leasing performance, it's clear that we are garnering more than our fair share of the market with 1.05 million square feet of leases signed in the first 6 months of the year, with another 82,000 square feet signed in July and 645,000 square feet of leases that are out and being negotiated, and another 750,000 square feet of leases that are under active negotiation where we feel we have a reasonably likely chance to move ahead and turn those into signed leases. These kinds of numbers place us squarely on track to approach 2 million square feet of leasing for the year, ahead of our forecast back in December. ", "While the mark-to-market for the quarter may seem light on first look, I think it was 0.3% increase quarter-over-quarter, or if the for the quarter expiring leases relative to newly signed leases, recall our prior commentary about the fact that many of the leases rolling now represent leases that were signed in 2000 and 2001, which was a peak rent time and those rents have escalated significantly over that time as a result of operating and tax escalations and base rent increases. ", "So what you're seeing now are replacement leases that are at least 20% or more than the peak rents of '00 and '01. We had guided at the beginning of the year that because the rents in many of these cases had escalated so high, it would be difficult to replace leases positively and we have given guidance of minus 5% to plus 5% mark-to-market for the year. ", "In fact, year-to-date, we're already at 5 1/2% positive mark-to-market. So that's ahead of our -- ahead of the high end of the guidance. And if this activity had been happening a year ago, I would tell you that instead of looking at plus 5%, we might have been looking at negative 10% or more. So this market has moved. It's moved to cover escalated peak rents. And as we move into 2012 and '13 and '14, much of which will represent leases coming due that were signed 2002, '03 and '04 which were 12 years, I think you're going to see our mark-to-market GAAP out significantly in those years if this market continues on the pace that it's currently doing. ", "I would just make another note on structured finance. We did, in totality shows, almost $900 million or slightly over $900 million of funded originations in that same 2-year period of time in addition to our real estate acquisitions. So the real estate was sort of 4:1 ahead of structured finance. I think in these middle innings, you're going to see that allocation change as the real estate opportunities are still out there but are fewer. ", "Pricing has picked up, largely as a result of incredible demand from foreign investors and foreign capital sources. And you'll see that our pipeline for the balance of the year is going to consist much more heavily of structured finance being done at rates that are consistent with our portfolio and the rates that we've targeted and talked about in the past. But we do also have a pipeline of equity opportunities. So right now, we see this as a very balanced market with relatively low financing rates. ", "On the secured side, they were relatively low rates on the unsecured side, but that market right now is a little choppy so we'll have to wait and see with all other corporations, how that market settles out. But the mortgage market is showing no sign of let up whatsoever, and there is some new financings that I'm sure Jim and Matt will talk about in their commentary, which lowered our cost of funds significantly from prior expirations, and we also turned out maturity substantially. ", "So I think to sum it up, we've got a very durable balance sheet right now where we've turned out much of our debt, we've reduced our debt to EBITDA numbers, we've reduced our floating rate to total debt figures, and we're reducing rate and spread as we go. So all in all, we're funding this very high level of investment activity with very well-priced capital. We've been active issuers in the ATM market, issuers of equity in order to keep our new equity investments equity neutral, and that's something we've talked about in the past. And I think that with continued low interest rates, continued job growth and starting to roll into rents in the future years that were done at much lower points in the market, it all bodes very well for the company. So with that, let me turn it over to Andrew Mathias.", "Andrew Mathias", "Thanks, Mark. Good afternoon, everybody. Despite headwinds that are screaming in the headlines every day, the Manhattan market has shown no let up in demand for income-producing assets. Deals continue to go into contract and close with a full slate of buildings and interest in buildings on the market, bucking the usual summer slowdown. Foreign and domestic capital continue to compete ferociously with no buying sector really dominating. We expect to see another $2 billion of deals go to contract within the next 30 days in the Manhattan market with buyer return expectations continuing to hover around the 7% to 8% unlevered IRR area. ", "In our own portfolio, the most notable addition for the quarter was our completion of the equity restructuring at 280 Park. This brought all facets of our platform together. From a tactical acquisition of the mezzanine notes to creativity in structuring, the eventual takeover of the equity to the redevelopment and lease up of the asset in conjunction with our partner, we're hugely optimistic about this building's prospects and a tightening leasing market. ", "Also this quarter, we closed a deed in lieu on concurrent mortgage restructuring on 110 East 42nd Street, an asset we sold several years ago. At the time we owned this building, we didn't own 125 Park next door, which we subsequently acquired. The floor plates on these 2 assets lined up, allowing us to combine floors and offer a flexible and expanded floor plate to prospective tenants. Our A.B. restructuring of the senior loan also gives us the time and flexibility to be aggressive in making deals of the building. Early leasing returns are better than expected, we're happy to have 110 East 42nd back in the portfolio. ", "Also this quarter, we closed on previously announced consolidation of interests at 1515 Broadway and the previously announced disposition of 28 West 44th Street in the quarter. And expect us -- we're in the market with a retail condo interest, and we have another deal teed up to go into the market probably shortly after Labor Day. So expect us to continue to take advantage of the sales market into 2011. ", "We continue to be the dominant player in structured finance in Manhattan with over $250 million in new deal flow year-to-date. In addition to being very active in the secondary market, conservative first mortgage underwriting standards continue to create a hole in buyers' capital structures that we are more than happy to fill. It's been some time since we've seen risk-adjusted yields as attractive as those that exist today, oftentimes for positions where last dollar at loan-to-cost doesn't exceed 70% or 75%. ", "Expect to see us in several high-profile transactions on the market at planning and structured finance as our origination platform heats up with the dirt of an attractively priced product in the secondary market where most loans are trading for par or north. ", "Much of our activity this quarter was centered on the Retail business, where patience was richly rewarded with some notable milestones. On the leasing front, we signed a blockbuster lease with Dolce & Gabbana at 717 Fifth Avenue. The lease allows us to take advantage of our previously negotiated relocation clause with Escada within the building and position 717 as one of the finest retail sites in the city with Armani's flagship, Escada's flagship and now a D&G store all on long-term leases. Cash NOI at this property will be in excess of $32 million when these leases take effect, more than doubling from existing cash NOI when these leases commence. ", "In addition to retail leasing success, we also contracted to purchase 2 major retail properties. 1552 in the heart of Times Square, directly across the street from 1551 Broadway where we developed the American Eagle flagship store. 1552 will be vacant, allowing us to unveil a complete redevelopment so the retail tenant markets starve for opportunities in Times Square. ", "Additionally, within the last couple of weeks, we contracted to purchase the retail at 747 Madison, the current home of Valentino. Valentino's lease is also up, giving us another prime corner on Upper Madison to bring to market. Both of these deals we purchased in joint venture format with our partner Jeff Sutton. ", "We continue to scour for more retail opportunities given our successes to date. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim to take you through the numbers.", "James Mead", "Thank you, Andrew. I'm going to start the portion of today's call, my portion of today's call, with some overall observations and the discussion of our balance sheet and then I'll turn it over to Matt to review guidance for the remainder of the year. ", "Last night, we reported a $1.10 FFO per diluted share before giving effect to about $0.02 of transaction costs incurred during the quarter. Matt's going to discuss some of the details of the company's year-to-date operating performance when he discusses guidance. So I'll just touch on a couple of the broader observations. ", "I think it's worth noting that the composition of our EBITDA has become much more heavily weighted toward equity-owned real estate, benefiting from deployment of new capital and from converting debt positions. Comparing last year's second quarter to this year's, NOI from property operations increased $21 million or 12% while income from debt or from equity positions declined by $6 million. And despite fundraising that included common equity financings to maintain our balance sheet's strength, investment activities were accretive and improved our per share performance. ", "Today though, there's a large difference in our year-over-year identified pipeline. We're now positioned to accelerate our growth in the coming years as we conclude the final retail and signage enhancements of 1515 Broadway, lease up 3 Columbus Circle and 280 Park, complete the leasing of 100 Church, reposition 110 East 42nd Street, redevelop our 1552 Broadway Times Square retail opportunity and complete our ground-up development at 180 -- 182 Broadway in conjunction with Pace University. These in-process opportunities will be incremental drivers that will compound on the improving New York City market. ", "Despite real estate transactions totaling more than $1 billion during the quarter, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet by adhering to a few basic principles. First is what I call a balanced funding of growth. We've been disciplined in financing to maintain or improve our credit metrics. This means incrementing our equity base with growth in our balance sheet. The 2 ATM programs that we've used to date provide $525 million in new common equity and have benefited the company by allowing us to time financing activity with the actual deployment of capital to be in the market only when conditions are right and by incurring low fees and no discount to market. ", "Next, maintaining liquidity. At June 30, we had almost $450 million in cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet, which when combined with undrawn availability under our line of credit, gives us access to over $1.3 billion. ", "Third, to manage near-term maturities. With the closing of a $500 million 12-year mortgage on 919 Third Avenue with 2 life companies, and by the way, the interest rate on that financing was decreased from 6.9% to 5.1% while upsizing the financing from $220 million to $500 million, the company has largely refinanced its material near-term property maturities. Our line of credit that matures about a year from now is next on our list. And Matt and I will be working on a new facility with the objective of replacing the existing facility by year end. Despite a challenging corporate unsecured debt market, the bank market seems less affected and early discussions with our lenders -- or re-lenders over a new facility had been well received. ", "And finally, to lock in current low interest rates. We're operating in a historically low interest rate environment and have been executing on opportunities to term out our balance sheet. The just closed 12-year financing on 919 Third Avenue is 1 example. Our recently received corporate unsecured investment grade rating from S&P opens up a number of additional corporate financing options. However, credit market conditions have been unfavorable for the past few months. We will continue to watch market conditions and evaluate the potential for an unsecured long-term financing. ", "So at this point, I'll turn the call over to Matt.", "Matt DiLiberto", "Thanks, Jim. Clearly we are pleased with the earnings results we posted for the second quarter, both on an absolute and normalized basis. ", "As compared to the first quarter, where we recognized over $46 million of nonrecurring income, comprised primarily of the gains and our debt positions at 280 Park Avenue, the positive results from the second quarter include a very few income items of a nonrecurring nature. ", "On the special servicing side of our business, green loan services netted $3.2 million of fees in the second quarter on resolution of an assignment. Given the strength of our Servicing business as evidence in working out large real estate loan positions, we may realize similar fees in the future. However, that is a fee stream that we do not include in our guidance. Also during the quarter, we repaid the $108 million mortgage secured by Landmark Square in Stamford, Connecticut in anticipation of a new mortgage refinancing later this year. This repayment was accomplished at a $1 million discount, which results are recognized of earnings in the second quarter. ", "Turning our attention to the remainder of 2011. During last quarter's conference call, I recapped some of the basic operating assumptions included in the original FFO guidance provided at our December Investor Day. These assumptions included among other things mark-to-market on 2011 Manhattan leasing of minus 5% to positive 5%, the increased operating expenses of 2 1/2% to 3 1/2% and flat same-store NOI, and then increased our FFO guidance to $4.65 to $4.80 per share on our first quarter conference call, primarily as a result of the gains we recognized on our 280 Park debt positions and based on our view of New York City operating trends. ", "Through June, our real estate operating performance continues to trend modestly ahead of our original expectations. As Mark discussed, mark-to-market on the over 1 million square feet of Manhattan office leases signed through June 30 is approximately 5 1/2%, ahead of our original guidance. And our Manhattan volume is also trending ahead of the leasing goal we established for ourselves of 1.7 million square feet for the year. ", "Operating expenses are generally in line with our expectations as our operations team continues to do a spectacular job of controlling our variable costs, managing them to a 0 increase for the year despite market pressures to increase them, which leaves increases driven primarily by areas where they have less control, including union labor, real estate taxes and a portion of utilities cost that we did not manage to fixed price contracts. These factors have resulted in combined same-store GAAP NOI increase of 2.6% in the second quarter and 1.6% year-to-date. This is evidence of improving performance in the core portfolio, particularly at properties like 1515 Broadway where the NOI increased by over $8 million for the first 6 months of 2011 as compared to 2010, as a result primarily of the retail repositioning at the property. ", "However, it is worth noting that the positive trends we have seen in our same-store operating results during the first half of 2011 will be somewhat offset during the second half of 2011 by recent investments and the lease up and development plays we discussed earlier that have longer-term growth potential. In particular, 280 Park Avenue, where we look forward to commencing our capital and leasing program, but we'll recognize near-term earnings dilution until that property is stabilized. ", "With regard to the debt and preferred equity portfolio, our portfolio holdings remained at a historically low level and correspondingly, investment income does as well, following the sale and repayment of sizable position first 2 quarters of 2011, including 666 Fifth Avenue and conversion of our positions at 280 Park and 110 East 42nd to equity ownership. ", "Of note, during the second quarter, we recognized approximately $2.8 million from the bridge loan we provided at 3 Columbus Circle. But the recent refinancing of the property, the permanent mortgage provided by Bank of China, that position was repaid. ", "However, as was noted earlier, we continue to see many opportunities for the funding to work at healthy risk-adjusted returns within the capital stacks, New York City real estate. We can successfully execute on these opportunities. There's certainly upside potential in this revenue stream. ", "On the corporate finance front, among the items that will keep us cautious are interest rates. While we continue to see a strong mortgage market, we continue to be conservative in our overall thinking on rates and project forward not only using the publicly available forward interest curves but also a cushion over and above that curve. This methodology holds true for our in-place variable rate debt financing, as well as for purposes of underwriting and evaluating future transactions, also in maintaining consistent balance sheet strategy of appropriately funding our investment activity to maintain credit metrics. ", "During the second quarter and into July, we continue to issue common equity at a very efficient manner through our ATM program completing the $525 million plan. This was not contemplated in our initial guidance but is a direct measured response to the heavy volume of investment activity we have consummated in 2010 and thus far in 2011. ", "All that considered with 6 months under our belts and a better vision toward the next 6 months will hold, we are raising a lower end of our FFO guidance for 2011 from $4.65 per share to $4.75 per share while the high end of our range remains at $4.80 per share. In conjunction with the revision to our FFO guidance for 2011, we are also raising our FAD guidance for 2011 from $2.60 per share to $2.65 per share. ", "With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark for some closing comments.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. Well, before our closing comments, if today is like quarters past, I assume we have a lot of questions in the queue that we should get right to. We're sort of on track. We've allocated about an hour's worth of time to try and get through the entire queue. So let's turn it back to the operator and start.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Jamie Feldman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "James Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I was hoping you could talk a little bit and give -- provide a little bit more granularity on market conditions, kind of which sectors and tenant types in terms of size and sectors are most active? And then also provide a little bit more color on your discussion with tenants and what they're thinking about the debt ceiling and weakening economic conditions out there and why that from your commentary, it sounds like you're just not seeing any kind of slowdown?", "Andrew Mathias", "I'm sorry the last part, Jimmy, from our commentary, we...", "James Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch", "From your prepared remarks, it sounded like things are just flowing ahead, and it just seems like given the economic environment and more concern out there, I'm surprised the tenants aren't a little bit more cautious?", "Andrew Mathias", "Well, I think the tenants take a much longer term view than the street does when you're planning big space moves. So I'm not -- it doesn't surprise me all that much. At the second quarter was actually, by one reports -- by one agency's report, the most active quarter ever. There was like 7 or 8 million square feet in the second quarter. I assume that included deals like Conde Nast, Nomura, there was the city of New York downtown, the Trade Center. There was another one that I'm just forgetting, give me a second. Well, there was Wells Fargo, Morrison & Foerster. So that's a pretty broad range of tenants in those 5 tenants, everything from financials to public sector, to media and entertainment and the like, and law firms. So I would say to you quite honestly, Jamie, I've had maybe 1/2 dozen major tenant conversations in the past few weeks. The debt ceiling doesn't come up in those conversations. It's always about ways in which they can try to update their space to be the most sort of efficient and technologically current as they can be and that always is a big challenge for many of these firms. Its that after 5, 10, 15 years,their installations become outdated relative to their competitors and they're always trying to figure out how they can expand, become more efficient, become more technologically up-to-date, and we work with our tenants in that regard. So in trying to think in terms of that sectors in our portfolio, I gave you market wide just now looking at major leases. Steve, just write or walk up 5 or 6 that come to you.", "Steven Durels", "We've got deals coming with healthcare, with education, with service businesses. We've got more than a fair share of financial services that are in active negotiation, and legal. So its a pretty diverse group of tenants that are both in active lease negotiation and then, what Mark referred to, the 750,000 square feet of what we think is credible pipeline likely to convert over to a lease transaction, that's an equally broad base group of tenants.", "Marc Holliday", "Yes, I would just sort of finish that up, Jamie, by saying that, that's not to say over the next 6 months or so, we may not see a pullback. I mean, that's certainly possible. If companies can't borrow and they're kind of frozen out of the markets and we get a big correction of the data there, not raising equity of course, that's going to, I think, limit these financing activities of a lot of New York's big companies and that would have to have some kind of limiting effect on growth and expansion. But I would say at the moment, interest rates are still pretty darn low. Jim just talked to you about a 5% deal we closed, a 12-year deal. Term is extending, the secured markets are very good, the resig markets are good, and even with the widened corporate spreads, you're still looking at 5%, 5 1/2% deals largely if people are brave enough to go in this credit climate. But I think the expectation is sometime in August or certainly after Labor Day, there'll be hopefully a return to a more normal credit market. I can't really speak about the stock market and that I think fuels a lot of what you see for our customer businesses.", "James Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And just a quick followup. How much are conversations about downtown and the Hudson Yards creeping in to your discussions with tenants as they're thinking about space?", "Andrew Mathias", "We're certainly hearing from the bigger guys who have big requirements upcoming in the next 5 to 10 years. Downtown and Hudson Yards are part of the consideration. And I think there is a lot of question with the Westside in terms of timing of delivery, and I think downtown is certainly -- is more certain as the buildings are underway, and there is not massive infrastructure that has to be completed before you see any buildings going vertical. But it comes up quite often and people are considering them as real options.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of John Guinee of Stifel.", "John Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "John Guinee here. Just to clarify a few things, Marc, first, it looks like something happened on your ground lease at 711 Third Avenue. Second, can you go over the economics of the 110 East 42nd? And then third, it looks like you have a new $49 million mezz piece in New York City. Can you walk through as much as you're allowed to on that?", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. So let's make sure I got them right here. I got $49 million mezz, we have the 711 ground lease, what's was the third, John?", "John Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Just the economics on your...", "Marc Holliday", "110 East 42nd.", "John Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Essentially, what's your stabilized purchase price on that when you bring it back home?", "Marc Holliday", "Okay, so let's start with 711. What was disclosed 2 days ago, which went up from expiring 0 to -- so that John, is reflective of an SMB reset. So these ground mezz stayed static, could be anywhere -- sometimes they're very long term, they could be static at 20, 25, 30 years or sometimes as little as 10 years, usually, 15 to 20 years. And at the end of that period of time, you look at market conditions, and if the market conditions are better than when the last reset was made, there is an increase that's either done consensually or typically by arbitration. In this case, it was done consensually between us, as the lease holder, and half the fee owner. Well, in 711, we own half the fee and we own 100% of the operating position. But in a negotiation with the other half of the fee owner, we agreed to a revaluation, which we think was a market revaluation within -- it was expected. We have forecasted for it. I don't think we got the better or worse half of the result in that case. I think it was where everybody is sort of believed it would come out and that did result in an increase. But now I think that increase is locked for at least the next 10 years, possibly longer. And the increase is mitigated partially by the fact that we own half of the city. So whatever the increase was, it's got a 50% dilution effect. So that's 1.", "Andrew Mathias", "The other 2, the $49 million structured finance investment is a B Note that we made in a new acquisition of a property on Sixth Avenue. It's a 5-year fixed rate instrument with our total return being 8 1/2% to 9%. And that's at that 70% or so last dollar loan-to-cost. So similar profile to the -- what I discussed on the call, there's about $80 million of cash equity from the sponsors subordinate to us. And then on 110 East 42nd Street, we took over 100% of the equity interest there effectively. Our last dollar per foot on that acquisition, if you will, was settled to $500 a foot, and we've taken over leasing management and are actively working to lease the property up to current occupancies around 73%, and there's a bunch of capital escrowed with the senior lenders as part of the A.B. structure to complete the lease up of that property from 73% to a more stabilized level of 95% to 98%.", "John Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay and just one little follow-up, Marc. How was the land, if that's the way to look at it, how was the land valued on 711 Third when you did your fair market value reset? Or is that just too complicated to get into?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I wouldn't say it's complicated. It's generally not thrown out there in the market. I would, I guess, feel comfortable in giving a range as opposed to an exact number, John. Because it's not one of those things we seek in the supplemental. That's just a negotiation between us and the fee owner. But I would say somewhere in the $200 to $250 range is we settled on an appropriate value for FAR.", "John Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And then are you looking to $200 to $250 per square foot or for the entire underlying land piece?", "Marc Holliday", "That's just for the land piece.", "John Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "But for the land, not on a billable square-foot number? You are getting at $200 million to $250 million value for the entire land position or fee position?", "Marc Holliday", "No. $200 to $250 per square foot of FAR.", "Andrew Mathias", "That's determined completely by the language in the lease which can vary widely lease to lease. So it depends on -- it's an appraised value based on a certain use of the building. So the art is to try to get in there and negotiate the lowest value possible if you're the leaseholder based on those limitations on value.", "John Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And then that $10.5 million, is that your pro-rata share in terms of 100% of the fee, 50%?", "Andrew Mathias", "That's 100% so we receive half of that as -- because of our 50% share as a fee owner.", "John Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay, got you. And then what's your pay accrual on the $49 million? The $49 million mezz position, is that a pay accrual or per impact percent.", "Marc Holliday", "Per impact.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Rob Stevenson of Macquarie.", "Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research", "Can you talk a little bit about how rents on comparable space is trending today versus at the end of last year, and where TIs and free rent are also trending on comparable space versus the end of the year?", "Steven Durels", "Yes. I think we've continued to see the same trend that we've spoken about in the last couple of conference calls. And that base rents have risen over the past 12 to 18 months, driven primarily by 2 groups: One is high profile best quality space generally defined as above the 20th or 25th floor, so the tops of buildings; and also big blocks of space. We have clearly seen a premium come back into the market where there is a short supply of big blocks of space. There's more big tenants floating around the market than anyone can identify of big blocks to satisfy that demand. Notwithstanding that, we've seen improvement across the board really on all types of buildings, whether it's our buildings on the farthest sort of fringe of the portfolio or our best located products. It's just a different level of appreciation in rents depending on which part of the building and which particular property we're talking about. On the concession side, I think TIs stayed fairly flat in the last quarter. Where space needs to be completely guided and rebuilt, the TI packages are generally $60 to $65 a foot, but I think the big differentiator is that we're seeing today is we are able to cap the dollars at kind of a maximum of $65 even when we're guiding and rebuilding this piece of space for a tenant, versus 1.5 years ago where we're happy to spend more than that to turnkey an installation. And free rent is anywhere from kind of 4 to 5 months of free rent post construction. And if tenants' choice on buildout, its kind of roughly 10 months of free rent.", "Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research", "And so on an average basis, relative to, let's say 6 or 9 months ago, would you say that rents are up 5% on sort of similar space on average across the portfolio, you think, or more or less?", "Steven Durels", "Well, I think the rents are clearly up at least 10% to 15% and probably on a net effective basis, bigger than that. You don't see it in the mark-to-market per se because that's really measuring against spaces that are rolling off. Where we see it is by comparison to where deals were being written or where we thought the market rate was for space 1 year to 1.5 years ago, and that clearly had a material increase on both base rents and their effective rents.", "Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research", "Okay, perfect. And then earlier this year, you guys were I think shopping one of the smaller Stamford assets. Are you still looking to sell? What was the sort of pricing that you guys were seeing or was it a situation where the pricing wasn't that attractive?", "Andrew Mathias", "I think we're looking to sell that asset. We're having active conversations with a couple of different buyers. And it's a slower process in the burbs to sell assets certainly because the city -- people sign non-diligence contention contracts, and the suburbs, they look for diligence periods and inspection periods, it's still -- it's a slower process. So, we'll see how it unfolds through the course of the summer.", "Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research", "Is there still decent demand for stuff out there or is it just a matter of getting the terms? Or is the demand sort of coming and going?", "James Mead", "When you say is there still decent demand, you mean to buy buildings?", "Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research", "Yes.", "Marc Holliday", "I would object to the words \"still decent\" because it's -- I think what we've been saying for several years now is it's been stalled. It's not decent. It's been -- we've had an inability to really to recycle our buildings since I would say beginning or middle of '07, -- probably, the middle of '07. And we're waiting for the market fundamentals to improve in our major suburban markets, and I think when you see some kind of demonstrated improvement, that's when you're going to see the lenders jump back in. And when the lenders jump back in, that's when I think you'll see the equity jump back in. But that has not really been the case throughout '08, '09, '10, and we've sold, again, little to nothing I guess really in the suburbs over that period of time. So this small property in Stamford was a little bit of a tester, and we do see some signs of market improvement and hopefully over the next 6 to 12 months, that'll take up pace as the rest of, as obvious, New York City does. The job growth in the private sector exclusive of New York City is starting to pick up. There's been about 50,000 new jobs created since the trough of the market private sector, not all office using jobs, but that's generally located on Long Island, Westchester. So that's a bit of a positive result we've been tracking, but we haven't yet seen that really translate to office demand. But I think when it does, then I think you'll see a market start to reform. But I would say right now it's a stable market but less than decent.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.", "As you guys have your talks with your financial service tenants and clients, how many -- how much do you think are you going to sense of the firms that the fact that a lot of folks raised base salaries has meant that we've had layoffs perhaps sooner or perhaps more frequently than would have occurred under the old system where it was a low base in a high part of variable comp?", "Marc Holliday", "It's a hard question to answer. I mean, they have raised base, they have lowered the bonuses, and that's reflected in the payroll and withholding taxes. We were talking with the budget guys, and they clearly see a change. And now they're wondering what's going to happen at year-end. Are bonuses really going to be reduced as a result of that increase in salary? Or is it the case where the Wall Street firms may make $25 billion plus in profits this year and the bonuses may wind up being big. Anyway, I don't know that anybody has an answer to that. In terms of driving the layoffs, we've seen relatively consistent but moderate job growth in the financial sector. The layoffs have pretty much subsided, and I know that's firm by firm in that. So there maybe examples where that's not the case. But I would say in total, the data would suggest that there is net additions to those jobs, and they seem to be operating at full capacity right now. There are some firms we talked to that talked about possibility of some layoffs at the end of the year, but then that's offset by others who say they're completely stretched and looking to hire people. We know certain firms that are actively rating other firms on hiring. So net-net, it seems to be positive, but I don't really know if we have a view as to how that kind of restructuring of compensation is going to directly affect that hiring. I think we're all in a wait-and-see mode.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.", "Okay. And then the second question is with the recent ruffling that's going on in the CMBS market and BP Spires, has that resulted in you guys being able to get more attractive rates on your new mezz [mezzanine] or new debt positions? Or is that not -- or the 2 markets have been sort of separate from that perspective?", "Andrew Mathias", "They're pretty separate from that perspective. I mean, I think, as opposed to single asset lenders like us, don't really bench ourselves too much off of diversified pools, spreads and diversified pools. And when those spreads compress into 250 over wind track as they widen back out 5-7 under over, it doesn't have too much impact. And I think we're competing more against pools of capital that are raised specifically for the purpose of making single asset subordinate investments. And when those pools are raised, they're passing along to those investors in expectation of the returns they're going to deliver. And that's really what we're competing with.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Sri Nagarajan of FBR.", "Srikanth Nagarajan - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Question has to do with your ATM programs, you will. Obviously, you are now sitting on about $390 million in cash. From the prepared remarks, it appears that acquisitions are perhaps in the middle innings, and the structured finance is perhaps flat, if anything else. Would it be a right perception that you're not eager to start a third ATM program here? Or is that a consideration that you're looking at more growth here?", "James Mead", "Sri, the answer is -- it's Jim. The answer is that we wouldn't discuss with you whether or not we were going to put another ATM program on. But I think that again, the great thing about having an ATM program is that we can time the usage of the program against what we consider to be balance sheet growth around real estate assets. So I think if to the extent that we continue to exercise on a real estate pipeline, you would see us coming back in for a blend of capital to fund that pipeline. So I think that, I think you just have to wait and see how the rest of the year unfolds with regard to acquisitions.", "Marc Holliday", "I would to add to that, Sri. Whether or not we put a third or fourth or fifth in place, the issue is more to the utilization than having in place. I think what we've said in the past -- I think we've said in the past but maybe haven't -- this wasn't maybe discussed in as much detail in December, was that we were looking to do the ATM issuances generally to keep leverage neutral, not increase, not decrease, as we buy new real estate properties. And we've found it to be a much more efficient product where we don't have to accumulate, accumulate, accumulate and then equitize and bring a deal. Here, you can sort of do it as you go. You get the benefit of a rising stock price in a market like this, and you can do it in relatively small amounts. We've been an active issuer. But when you really look at the amounts, they're modest amounts and they're really just done to rightsize the acquisition. So going forward, I just want to make sure what you heard from me was that having just done $4.5 billion of equity purchases, $2.5 billion our share in 2 years, that our rate of investment would be less than that. But even less than that could still make us one of the top acquirers in the city. So just want to make sure it's clear in that. And when you talk about flat structured finance, I think what I had mentioned in the earlier part of this call was that I actually think structured finance will take on a more prominent role in the middle of innings and increase the balance as opposed to having a flat balance.", "Srikanth Nagarajan - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "My second question is on some color on a mark-to-market conversation or remarks that you had made, specifically with regards to the rest of 2011. It appears that obviously, you still have some 2000, 2001 kind of leases rolling. And then it's perhaps only in 2012 when we begin somewhat of a relief in the MTM here.", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I would say, yes, that's what we've said. But also the fact that were up 5% midway through the year, that's not bad. I mean, I don't want to minimize the achievements for the half of the year. We've done 1 million square feet of leasing, and we've increased 5%, 5.5% over expiring leases, which were really kind of peak leases. So I think that's very good. I think that, that was done with a shrinking concession package, as Steve outlined earlier. We're hoping those concessions continue to shrink. And with vacancy now at about 9 peak, 9.8%, and we talked about 9% being in our minds, that threshold number which tips it in the favor of landlords to be able to increase rents back towards an equilibrium against construction costs, which they clearly aren't at now. That's another 80 to 100 basis points away. So I would agree with your comments that bodes well, we should see an acceleration. But I don't think that necessarily takes away from the limited activities.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Jay Habermann of Goldman Sachs.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Marc, just a question on acquisition strategy as you look forward. I know you mentioned the foreign capital and institutional capital, which seems to prefer the more Premier Class A types of assets. But as you look at sort of opportunities in the near term, are you seeing much in that sort of B, B plus realm, you missed some of the deals with perhaps some near-term issues like Columbus Circle?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, let me just make sure what you said. When you said you're asking is foreign capital attracted to A minus, B plus assets, is that the question?", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Well, it sounds like you're referencing that the sort of Class A assets are getting a bit frothy, and I'm just curious what you're seeing perhaps in some of these other deals out there that you've done in the past, whether it's the Columbus Circle or other transactions like 1515 Broadway?", "Marc Holliday", "I think they're just as frothy. I mean, there has been foreign interest in assets less than just trophy assets. We sold 19 West 44th Street to Deka Bank, we sold 28 West 44th Street to accrue advised fund, German Fund.", "Andrew Mathias", "Starrett-Lehigh Building is closing this week at a sub-5% cap rate, 626 is in the market now, expected to trade institutional also at a sub-5% cap rate. So I'm not sure you can really draw a distinction. I think this competition across property types and class, all really from institutional capital.", "Marc Holliday", "1186 Avenue sold to a Chinese investor. I mean, the list goes on and on. So I think that location matters as much as asset vintage. And I think some of the better older assets can command as good or better cap rates than some of the newer products if they're well-located in this big mark-to-market in the leasing where there's a big vacancy or repositioning opportunity. So...", "Andrew Mathias", "The difference for us, Jay, is our deals are off-market. I mean, if you go through our list, we don't really compete for marketed deals. So everything we're sizing is marketed deals, with a broker and a book and sort of a worldwide process. And our franchise is off-market deals.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. And maybe a question for Jim or for Matt. As you look at the line of credit, can you talk about your expectations as you go into the back part of the year? And do you expect to reduce that balance as you move towards your year-end?", "James Mead", "In the Investor Conference last year, we laid out a target of $500 million for the year-end balance on the line of credit, which we're at today or we are at by the end of the quarter. And I think that our expectations haven't changed. It'll depend on, frankly, the uses of capital we have going through the end of the year.", "Marc Holliday", "That's down, Jim. It's down from where...", "Andrew Mathias", "$650 million at the end of last year.", "James Mead", "$650 million at the end of last year.", "Marc Holliday", "There's the $500 million. That was our year end target when we're in the middle of the year.", "James Mead", "Correct.", "Marc Holliday", "We could certainly see it being reduced further or not. But I think certainly we've exceeded our timeline.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Michael Knott of Green Street Advisors.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc.", "Marc, can you give us little more color on the comments on leasing pipeline, I guess? And maybe just in the context of your guys'  leasing volume this quarter was a little lighter than it's been for a while, and maybe part of that is just that 1Q is a big number and maybe it sounds like 3Q might be a bigger number. Can you just maybe kind of talk about that a little more?", "Marc Holliday", "Look, I've been telling Steve. He's just got to pick it up in the second quarter but...", "Steven Durels", "That's a good question, thank you.", "Marc Holliday", "Look, I think that it's hard to really parse it down quarter by quarter. I think our annual objective was $1.7 million, okay? So we're $105,000 into $1.7 million. It's dramatically ahead of schedule. I've got another -- looks like $1.4 million, almost a $1.5 million near certain or highly likely or reasonably likely deals. So probably not all close or sign up this year, and some will fall out, and some will get added. But I said earlier, we're on track for, I think, too well. I want to raise that bar a little bit from the $1.7 million previously. I think the 2-0 was achievable unless the market really reverses itself. And if you can exceed your goals by 15% to 20%, I don't know how we could look at the leasing performance as light, I think it's quite strong. The fact that it was -- was it, $450,000 this quarter and may have been a little more like $550,000 last quarter, I wouldn't read anything into that. That's just the way the chips fell.", "Steven Durels", "Well, just to add onto it. Put into context that remembering that we started 2011 with roughly 880,000 square feet of leased roll, and we've already signed leases of $1.4 million with 600,000 feet of leases actively being negotiated and another 750,000 of pipeline, that's a lot of leasing relative to the amount of rollover on a well-occupied portfolio.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc.", "Okay, thanks for that color. And then last question would be just going back to the structured finance versus equity investment kind of question. How much bigger could the structured finance book get? Do you still, Marc, think about that in terms of that 10% of assets number? And obviously, it would take a lot of origination to get kind of back up to that now. But is that something that we should think about?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I think on the last quarter's call, we had mentioned that our prior balances of $900 million to $1 billion are at a reasonable level, that's well under 10%, or I guess that's 7% to thereabouts. I think what we've said is it's a kind of an internal goal of ours to keep it at or under 10%. I don't know that it's ever even really been at that level except maybe for the briefest of times. But over the 15 years of the program, it's generally been in the 5% to 8% range. That's not necessarily because we would be uncomfortable seeing 7% go to 8%, 9% or 10%. It's competitive. Of course, I don't want to make it sound like it's turning on and off a water faucet. You have to compete for these deals. They're structurally complicated deals. There's only so much transactions that are getting done in the city. We're doing more than our fair share with those. But it's something that you can't exactly regulate. So we're estimating that we'll have some real opportunities in the second half of the year to increase that balance. And I mentioned last quarter that I think not necessarily in the immediate term, but in the foreseeable future, getting back to the kinds of balances we had when the program was at its fullest, would be $900 million to $1 billion, albeit now that's out on bigger asset base. So it's a lower percentage because we're a bigger company now.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Michael Bilerman of Citi.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "Josh Attie is on the phone with me as well. Maybe Marc or Andrew, just wanted to delve a little bit deeper into structured finance. I guess I was surprised because your comments would seem to indicate that, at least on the equity side, that asset values have risen substantially, Cap rates are down a lot. The mortgage market, in your words, there's been no letup, and I would say lenders are obviously with values going up. The loan -- the value seems okay, but there's still -- I'd say the underwriting certainly has gotten more aggressive over the last 18 months. So why hasn't there been a shift in structured finance market? Why hasn't -- why were you able in your words to find decent risk reward if you don't think there's a decent risk reward on the equity or the debt side? I'm surprised that piece of the market is still offering the right balance.", "Marc Holliday", "I think -- a couple that come to mind -- Andrew will chop in with his thoughts, but first of all, would say we've created a franchise over 15 years in a name for ourselves, and we're generally first call. And that certainly helps in an ability to get and compete and not necessarily charge a premium rate, but the least we can pick and choose amongst the opportunities we think are best. I mean, this is, I said earlier, it's a complicated business. It strictly involves knowing how to structure the dots, how to go through all the various kinds of rights remedies whether partial interests message, preferred equity interest, B notes, servicing agreements. It's just not commodity-like. And we have a very good book of borrowers. We do a lot of business. I think we have a reputation as being very fair in this market, and we get more than our fair share of opportunities. That's one. The second thing I said on the last call was that a lot of the banks who were competitive and subordinate that origination last cycle have been kind of legislated out of the business because of very large capital requirements. So this just -- the pool of capital for this business is just less. So, I mean, those are 2 reasons that have come to mind.", "Andrew Mathias", "There is less competition because the mortgage rates have so washed out, and they're not competitive anymore. And some other groups have not. And I think the underwriting standards of the seniors has toughened up, and it's just created a larger subordinate fees. Even as asset values have risen, you saw last week Goldman Sachs and Citi had to reduce subordination levels on their CMBS deal. And that's going to just reverberate through, and CMBS is going to be that much more vigilant in terms of their underwriting standards. And that creates a big need for subnets. So it's creating a lot of a supply out there of quality paper, and we're getting more than our fair share, as Marc said.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "With respect to the line of credit, do you anticipate terming that out with fixed rate debt or rolling the balance into a new facility? Just help us model the interest expense and cash flow for next year.", "James Mead", "I think there's a couple of points to that. We have been terming out that as a strategy to extend our fixed rate interest exposure in the company. And I guess so we're looking at other term financing options. So part of the answer to that question about where the outstandings on the line of credit are at year-end will be affected by our decisions on our future financings. But I think that for right now you should assume that we'll just redo a facility -- a credit facility -- by the end of the year going into next year.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Suzanne Kim of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Suzanne Kim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Just a quick question regarding 3 Columbus Circle and 280 Park. What would sort of your gross FFO BFDs amounts are in the run rate?", "Marc Holliday", "Suzanne, it's like stabilized.", "Suzanne Kim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Yes, exactly. Stabilized.", "James Mead", "We haven't given any estimates to the street that would give you an adjusted FFO.", "Matt DiLiberto", "Suzanne, in our Investor Conference Presentation, we did put up a slide on 3 Columbus Circle, which is pretty much on top of the economics we're seeing right now, and put a stabilized NOI number out there as well. As to 280, I mean that we can...", "Marc Holliday", "We have been doing that for -- when discussed our -- we do the investor we'll have -- I would expect a full module on each of these properties because that's traditional with how we do it. And then for 2011 obviously, it's little to no contribution. As we give guidance for '12, we talk about the amount of contribution that will come from these assets, and we can talk about it both for '12 and for stabilization. I think that's fine, but I wouldn't want to gunsling an answer to that now before we have a chance to really internally sign off on those assets.", "Suzanne Kim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "How much are your capping interest on these and other projects right now?", "Marc Holliday", "The primary area where we're capping interest is down at 180, 182 Broadway, our development property. So we have a little bit of cap interest there and a nominal amount at 3 Columbus and nothing on 280.", "Suzanne Kim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Okay. Nothing at 280. And then, you know, when do you sort of anticipate the cap interest of being sort of start picking up like next year or...", "Marc Holliday", "On which property, on 280?", "Suzanne Kim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Yes. It depends. I guess it depends on where you're going to be with that asset, I guess.", "Marc Holliday", "Absolutely right. I was just about to say it. As with any evaluation of capitalized interest or operating expenses, it depends on the status of the asset, the redevelopment plan and then what not, which we are still finalizing.", "Suzanne Kim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Okay. One last question. There's about a $34 million investment in your top 10 investments last quarter that sort of disappeared this quarter. I was just wondering where it went and what was it. I don't know how much of you would be able to disclose, but that would be really helpful.", "Andrew Mathias", "We got paid off on our final mortgage financing investment related to AFR, American Financials, so it was a payoff at par.", "Suzanne Kim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Okay. And does the 0%, the yielding on the third, I guess the third largest investment in the top 10, that's 0 yielding right now. I mean, what are the prospects of that sort of changing and sort of how do you sort of view that investment?", "Andrew Mathias", "Well, we evaluate that investment quarter to quarter, and it's on a Class A Manhattan office property, and we continue to evaluate it for the appropriate trade in this quarter.", "Matt DiLiberto", "Suzanne, that's a fully accruing position. So at the valuation of that we evaluate it every quarter. We feel that we don't -- it's not appropriate at this time to take the value up and therefore it's turned up the income stream.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Brendan Maiorana of Wells Fargo.", "Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Andrew, the flow of buyers and the $2 billion of properties that you cited in the prepared remarks that return expectations of 7% to 8%, what do you think those buyers are looking at in terms of market rent growth in their pro formas over the next few years and how does that compare to the 20%, I think, excess rent growth that you guys throughout for the last conference call for the market rent growth that SL Green is expecting?", "Andrew Mathias", "I would say they're looking at -- they're project a significantly higher rent growth. Certainly the brokers and their packages to the extent people subscribe to those projections are sort of compounding 10-10 and then 5% of the minimum if not further spike of 7% to 10%. So that on a compounded basis is probably almost 30% over the next couple of years. So I think people are generally underwriting more significant rent growth, the purchasers than we are.", "Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "And you guys are still comfortable in kind of the 20 excess?", "Marc Holliday", "Yes.", "Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. And then just quick one for Matt. The straight-line rent adjustment seemed like it was down a little bit more than I think what you guys were expecting. Should we expect that line item to move back up to around $30 million in the quarter, or is the $23 million or $24 million that was in Q2 a good run rate going forward?", "Matt DiLiberto", "Well, I think in the first quarter on the call, I guided to somewhere $25 million to $30 million towards the higher end of that. In that line item as you see in the supplemental, straight-line says 141. Those noncash kind of rent components are not the only items in there.  There's a convert charge, there's noncash income on the debt investments, things like that. So if you strip all that out, we were on the straight-line free rent FAS 141 right inbound $27 million, so only slightly below where we thought it would be. So pretty consistent with where we thought.", "Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "And that line item is probably likely to be roughly comparable to Q2 in the back half of the year?", "Matt DiLiberto", "Yes. Between $25 million and $30 million is a good run rate.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Anthony Paolone of JPMorgan.", "Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "You mentioned some signage income at 1515 that needs to make its way in to turning still, and I think also the full impact of D&G when they take up 717 Fifth. And I think Jimmy maybe even rattled off a couple of others that I missed. And so I was wondering if you could roll that up and give us a sense as to how much FFO is in the offing that just needs to come in still and maybe a little timeline on that?", "Marc Holliday", "Yes. Tony, we're not ready to put out a 2012 number yet. So why don't you give us a chance to do our internal budgeting and really give you a thoughtful response to that question when we get to the Investor Conference?", "Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. But are these like on 717 Fifth, it sounds like that's just done and just the timing issue and same thing with some of the signage. Is there even just a dollar amount as to how much still...", "Andrew Mathias", "The signage is not done. The signage is getting constructed now. So we really would not even know. In 717 we need to complete the move of Escada and have D&G take over possession of the space.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "I wanted to follow up on a question from earlier that downtown and the Hudson Yards, it sounds like from your commentary, Andrew, with tenants saying that their real options -- that seems like a little bit of a change in tone for you guys even about those markets, which may have previously been considered lesser or fringier. So that's to midtown. So what's your perspective from an investment standpoint on those markets these days?", "Andrew Mathias", "We're pretty bullish on downtown. We like what's going on there. We've had a lot of success with 100 Church Street and 388 Greenwich, and we're looking for additional opportunities downtown, which we indicated previously. The far West side is not really -- it's sort of a one-owner market. There's no opportunity to invest there, and I don't know that we would invest there. But downtown, we're actively looking for new opportunities.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Could 100 Church come off of the potential disposition list that you had previously slated it on?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, it could -- I mean, disposition to us is a sale over JV, I mean that item [ph] disposition. So whether we sell it or whether we bring somebody in there, I think we have our options open. One of those 2, I would say, is probably likely because once the asset's put to bed as mature and our modus operandi is to recycle capital on hold, but to the best of our ability. So I don't know that it's going to change our view. It just may change the execution.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. And then on the structured finance book, are there any additional conversion opportunities that may be imminent? It sounds like there's a little bit of talk regarding the CMBS on 5 Times Square. Anything additional on that front?", "Marc Holliday", "We're always kind of talking to all of our borrowers and trying to explore opportunities. So we've had a great success rate this year so far with 280 Park and 110 East 42nd Street, and we continue to talk to guys, that definitely wouldn't rule that out.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Okay. And then last one, maybe for Matt. I'm just looking at the preferred equity, and I think investment income line -- the other income line -- and trying to reconcile that with the $600 million or so that was outstanding and the 6% yield. And I'm coming up with something more like a $9 million sort of current quarterly pay or accrual rate on that investment balance. What would be the difference? I know you -- besides sort of the servicing fee you mentioned, what would make up the gap there in those 2 line items?", "Matt DiLiberto", "The main difference is actually all in one item I mentioned in my commentary on the position, the bridge loan financing that we provided at 3 Columbus Circle. The number as presented in the financial statement is $5 million thereabouts in investment income, and there's an offsetting because we're 50% of the deal, the offsetting 50% of that is done in our JV income. So it shows up as a net $2.5 million number that I referenced. But it shows the investment income higher as a result of the treatment there.", "Marc Holliday", "We've got about enough time for important questions, and we'll have come to a hard stop at 3:30.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Steve Benyik of Jefferies.", "Steven Benyik - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "I was hoping you guys could just provide a little more color. You mentioned a number of the repositioning opportunities you have between 110 East 42nd and 1552 Broadway, obviously 280 Park, 3 Columbus and a few others. Can you just tell us a little bit more about the projected incremental capital spend expected over sort of the next 12 months and what maybe a weighted average yield might be?", "Andrew Mathias", "It varies by building. I mean, 280 Park, Marc said it was going to be $150 million dollars or so of capital investment there. And we'd expect to stabilize cash on cost yields there to be in the 7% to 8% range.", "Marc Holliday", "3 CC, we had announced earlier that we expected total capitalization inclusive of redevelopment capital of about $530 million. So that hasn't changed.", "Andrew Mathias", "And we expect stabilized yields there to be in the 9% to 10% on levered range.", "Steven Benyik - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "What was the other...", "Matt DiLiberto", "280.", "Marc Holliday", "280 [indiscernible].", "Andrew Mathias", "110 East 42nd Street, there, I think it's really just lease-up capital. There's no building redevelopment there. And just leasing that up from 73 to a stabilized occupancy should get us to around 7.5% or so yield on investment unlevered.", "Steven Benyik - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "And now at 1552 or 125 Park?", "James Mead", "Tell you what, 1552, we're not -- we haven't even closed the deal yet, the development deal, and we've got to spend some time there working a plan and spending some time with the city and it's way too early to talk about capital we expected because we've got a number of different scenarios. But we've had to close the deal, get into it, we'll settle on one and then we'll have some numbers to put out there. But 125...", "Andrew Mathias", "125 is just lease-up capital, and there we bought the deal very attractively. And I think with reletting the merit of space, which was part of our initial underwriting, we should stabilize at around an 8% cash on cost on levered.", "Steven Benyik - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay. And then just finally, on accrual liquidity perspective, what are the incremental potential proceeds from revived 717 Fifth and Landmark Square? And then in addition to that, what level of dispositions you mentioned a few for the back of 11, what's currently embedded in guidance from a dollar-value in perspective?", "Matt DiLiberto", "Landmark Square is -- $80 million on Landmark Square -- it's Matt -- and on 717, so we have that's depending on maturity for the rest of 2011. We do have the extension options built into the existing financing. We're evaluating now whether to exercise those options or seek refinancing given the Dolce and Gabbana lease.", "Marc Holliday", "But if we do refinance, there will be....", "James Mead", "Material upsize. Absolutely.", "Steven Benyik - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "I know. What about the 2?", "Andrew Mathias", "It's high as we want to take it, I mean.", "James Mead", "So we have tons of areas of liquidity that we evaluate every time we do a financing. we just try to optimize cost of funds.", "Operator", "Our final question will come from the line of Ross Nussbaum of UBS.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank", "It's been well documented that there has some sizable demand for big box space throughout the year. And I'm just curious what the sliding occupancy rate at the Graybar buildings suggests for the complete other end of the curve for the smallest tenants in the city. Is that -- what's going on at Graybar that, that building hasn't been queued in pace with the market?", "Steven Durels", "Well, it actually is right on plan, to tell you the truth. A couple of points that I guess to understand. One is we're seeing very good demand on small tenants, so even though we didn't speak to it, don't draw any conclusion other than to the contrary. Spaces that are call it less than 10,000 square feet, which are less than 50,000 square feet, plenty of demand out there, particularly if it's 10,000 to 15,000 square-foot full floors, which is not Graybar's market, or partial floors of kind of that sweet spot of 3,000 to 5,000 square feet, in which case that is clearly the natural marketplace for Graybar, a building that has almost 300 tenants. We started the year -- we ended last year and rolled into 2011 with a couple of big years of lease rollover. We knew that we would be confronted with a growing vacancy factor. And then add on to that, we had 2 pretty big blowouts. One was a 25,000 square foot tenant. Unfortunately after the tenant being in the building over 25 years, the guy's business finally came to a crashing halt. So we're dealing with that. We have another big piece of space that we've chopped up in the base of the building. And I guess just to give a little granular color as to the level of leasing, we have at this point 12 -- no, 15 leases out at Graybar of varying sizes and are seeing a high demand on spaces that we're pre- building. We sat with a big block of space -- 25,000 feet on the ninth floor of the building for most of last year. We finally made the capital commitment at the beginning of this year because rents had increased, and enough to justify an expenditure and chop it into pre-builds. And now we're taking that 25,000 square feet into 5 -- into 7 separate units, and before we've even started construction, already have leases out on 5 of the 7 units. So I think that's pretty indicative of where the velocity is at Graybar. And although we're at a unusually high vacancy factor today, I think we're chipping away at it and we'll end up the year in a much healthier place in line with what we had budgeted despite the blowouts that we suffered.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. And then, Steve, while I've got you. Leasing update at 3 CC to be signed, any leases this summer?", "Steven Durels", "No. We have 1 lease that's out for 35,000 square feet. We have 2 term sheets that are well baked at this point that we're hopeful will get converted into leases for another total of 70,000 square feet. You got to that building in perspective, in our minds, we really only launched the marketing program about 60 days ago. Since January, we had really been focused on reengineering the capital program and completing the major elements of the redevelopment of the property. There were a lot of -- there is a lot of work that needed to be attended to before we could really introduce the building back into the marketplace. And that work is being wrapped up. The building is a wildly better place today than it was at last year's Investor Conference. We're getting a lot of positive feedback from the brokerage community, and the space tours are pretty active at this point. But they're big sized deals. The smallest deal in the building would be kind of 35,000 feet up to a multi-floor deal. So those transactions need a good deal of ramp up time before we are going to get any real progress. But I think we're where we expected to be at this point in the game.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. Well, thank you, everyone. We've reached the end of the call. To those that are still on, I don't know, have liked it out to the end. But we want to thank you for your questions and wanted just to reiterate how pleased we were with the quarter. We may little bit have overwhelmed by the market today, but we're confident in the second of the year and what it's going to bring. And we look forward to speaking with you again on the next quarter's call.", "Operator", "Thank you, sir, and thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may now disconnect.

For those of you participating in the Q&A portion of the call, again, please limit your questions to 2 per person. ", "Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.", "Marc Holliday", "Thank you, Heidi, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us in what I know is a busy day of calls for many of you. I'm obviously very pleased with our results for the third quarter reported last evening and has reinforced this morning by several additional announcements we made for activities largely occurring after the quarter's results. ", "We take great satisfaction in knowing these results were distributed throughout all major areas of the firm, including leasing, operations, investments, finance. ", "With respect to leasing, the stats underscore what was an enormously productive, busy summer with over 625,000 square feet of leases signed in 60 different transactions in Manhattan alone. Accordingly, we have already met our leasing goals for the New York portfolio only 9 months into the year, and I still expect that we will eclipse to 2 million square foot mark for the full year, consistent with my guidance back in July. ", "Industry is represented by this leasing activity, ran the gamut from healthcare, media, to fashion and apparel, insurance and finance. However, again, notably absent from our portfolio this quarter was any significant activity among the banking and security sector, a theme we've been conveying to you throughout the year. And that theme is the fact that the other 60% -- 60%, 65% of the industries in Manhattan are picking up the bulk of the activity in new and renewal leasing while the commercial banks and investment banks tend to be in somewhat of a neutral mode at this point. ", "As I mentioned earlier, we have a fairly good remaining pipeline of activity for the fourth quarter. At the moment, we certainly don't see tenants backing off of their desire to lock in today's rates with some growth and expansion included in most instances. Operationally, we had good core performance as evidenced by positive mark-to-markets, same-store NOI growth, occupancy gains and continuing expense control. As you may recall, we set very ambitious operating performance measures for ourselves at the beginning of the year and with a little over 2 months to go, it certainly seems we will meet or exceed all of these targets. ", "That's obviously, for us, a very fortunate position to be in given the most recent headwinds of the current market and also in light of the extraordinary amount of investment activity that we undertook throughout the year, requiring us to access sufficient debt and equity capital to fund those activities at all point throughout this year. A high level of investment activity demonstrated over the past 4 months is typical of the way in which we actively manage our portfolio for growth, monetization of significant gains and simply don't adopt a hold-and-wait strategy. ", "On the intake, we concluded 3 significant transactions, predominantly all off market and all extremely high quality and in excellent locations in Midtown Manhattan. Within our very profitable retail business line, the DFR transaction 1552 Broadway and 747 Madison Avenue fits squarely within such program and will provide for near and long-term upside to this company. ", "The DFR opportunity came about through the mining of our extensive relationships, both with the seller and with Stonehenge, a prominent and successful New York City owner and operator of multi-family properties throughout Manhattan. Likewise, the deal at 1552 and 1560 Broadway came about as a result of our relationship with ownership at 1560 Broadway and our proprietary strategy of creating almost 50,000 square feet of retail and signage opportunity in a prime location in Times Square. And that transaction, in conjunction with our partner, Jeff Sutton, we will able to reposition this property and realize on its upside potential in the near term. ", "It's interesting to note that while much of our activity over the past 2 years has been centered around opportunistic office investments, most recently, we have backed away from such deals as cap rates have contracted to under 5%, and our focus is then turned to an expansion of the retail portfolio and increased activity, structured finance, consistent with remarks made earlier this year about our appetite for putting out more structured capital in Manhattan centric opportunities. ", "As to the financing of these activities, Jim and Matt will go into further detail about our recent activities. However, I would just like to note that as we've continued to expand the asset side of the balance sheet, we've kept our leverage ratios fairly constant through a combination of internally generated cash flow -- internally generated retained cash flow due to our below-market dividend rate, equity raises through the ATM and asset sales where we continue to demonstrate our desire and willingness to bring value-add opportunities round-trip and realize significant cash gains for shareholders. ", "At our investor meeting in December, which Heidi just spoke of, we will go into further detail regarding our balance sheet strategy for 2012. While the market still seems to be in a net growth mode, the trajectory of the recovery slowed in September. After 2 very good years of economic activity in New York City, in 2010 and '11, it now looks like the market is set to take a breather while economic conditions in Europe play out and the debt markets re-establishes at better levels. ", "While the translation of headline risks to leasing activity seemed to weigh heavily on REIT investor's minds, it doesn't take away from the strong showing 2011 the second consecutive year that the market experienced significant growth and improvement in many important areas. Wall Street profits, while projected to be down sharply in Q3, are still on track to register $20 billion of profits in 2011. Average private sector job growth for the year will likely come in around 51,000 jobs, of which almost half of these are office using jobs, which is a very healthy growth rate in each of those categories by historic levels. ", "While these levels may moderate in 2012 and are projected to moderate in 2012, they're still expected to be positive on both levels in 2012, not negative. This, in turn, has lead to continued absorption, driving the overall Manhattan office vacancy rate down from 10.9% last year to 9.3% currently, which reflects absorption of almost 4 million square feet. And near-record tourism has helped push hotel ADRs and occupancies up, with occupancies at almost 90% currently, not withstanding the significant additional units that were added to the hotel inventory in the past 2 years. ", "All of this points to a very favorable setting for SL Green in which we will continue to execute a very deliberate plan of repositioning and leasing up opportunistic purchases, continuing to mind the portfolio for realized capital gains, financing our activities through asset sales, head issuances, the ATM and retain cash flow and conserving our abundant liquidity, new opportunities that may emerge in a transitional market. Given our fairly low embedded in-place rents and only 1 million square feet of space scheduled to expire and roll in 2012 and the lack of any material near-term debt maturities, we are in great shape defensively. I think we're in great shape offensively. I think were just generally in very good shape overall. So rest assured, we are ready for which ever direction this market breaks in 2012. ", "And with that, let me turn it over to Andrew Mathias.", "Andrew W. Mathias", "Good afternoon, everybody. The third quarter marked one of our most active on the investment front with the full power of our platform on display in the office, retail and structured finance businesses. We continue to see and hear of auction processes, and instead focused our time and capital on off-market and tax-sensitive situations where our structuring expertise can gain us a leg up. ", "The broader Manhattan market continued to chug along, and the 2 billion or so deals we signaled last call were about to go to contract have all, in fact, materialized. Buyers continue to show faith in the resiliency of Manhattan rents and continued low rates, hitting up large and small deals in every submarket of the city. ", "On SL Green's plate, in addition to the DFR portfolio, which Marc discussed, we found some great retail opportunities in 1552, 1560 Broadway and 747 Madison. 1552 and 1560 represents the highest profile availability in Times Square, a retail submarket with no vacancy. What we couldn't say on the last call is that we created a way to dramatically increase the envelope of the site via our 7-year lease at 1560 Broadway and convert side street retail to Broadway frontage. The complexity of this deal was unmatched and a real credit to our investment, legal and management and construction teams who were able to synthesize every aspect of this deal. ", "Now the execution phase begins, and I'm pleased to report that we have had some very encouraging conversations with retailers about the site thus far as we think the end product here has limitless potential in terms of visibility and signage. ", "In the quarter, we also closed on our purchase of 747 Madison Avenue in a joint venture with Jeff and Harel, essentially reconstituting our partnership from our Pace project downtown at 180 Broadway. This is the venture's first foray into the Upper Madison submarket and with Valentino vacating its store, we got a prime corner vacancy to market in an area that's currently hot and experiencing a lot of demand from very high-end retailers. ", "Today, we announced 2 sales as well, exiting the remaining condo interests at 141 Fifth Avenue and liquidating our fee interests in 292 Madison. Fee interest became somewhat nonstrategic when the mortgage debt encumbering the leasehold traded earlier in the year. The opportunity to exit this position at a profit to our basis and deleverage as a result, was too compelling to pass up on an asset we consider nonstrategic. ", "Similar story on 141 Fifth Avenue where we had originally purchased the building in 2005 and proceeded to sell the upper floors to a condo converter immediately, sell the second floor to an office user several years later and re-tenant the retail stores with HSBC and Cole Haan. The sale we announced today at a sub-5% cash cap rate completes the investment, which hopefully makes someway -- someday be a business goal case on maximizing the highest invest use of components of buildings. Our equity IRR on the deal is north of 60% over our 6-year hold period. ", "As I indicated on the last call, we had a very active quarter on the structured finance front as well, including several large high-profile preferred equity investments at compelling yields. Illiquidity in the CMBS markets hasn't slowed demand for buildings. It has created some inefficiencies in capital stocks that we're happy to price and fill. Each of the acquisition financings this quarter feature significant new cash equity invested by the sponsors of these deals, a state-of-the-art structural protections for SL Green. ", "Subsequent to quarter end, we marked up and sold a $50 million interest in our largest preferred equity investment originated during the quarter and sold another $28.5 million participation in a bridge loan we had restructured, demonstrating liquidity and the value in our origination platform. ", "As we look to the fourth quarter, we would expect the transaction volume to moderate. While the property markets haven't yet experienced any backup, we expect to see some investor pause while they seek greater clarity on rent growth and value added situations. However, for each sideline investor, there's been typically several others waiting to take their places at the contract table. And we don't see that trend changing. ", "Now I'd like to turn it over to Jim to take you through the numbers.", "James Mead", "Thanks, Andrew. Again, I'd like to reemphasize the point that based on all of our metrics, mark-to-market volume of leasing, same-store NOI growth, accretive capital deployment and successful funding activities, we had a great quarter. I'm going to start now on the capital and funding side and then let Matt go over some of the quarter's operating results in more detail. ", "We continue to be active investors, as you just heard. In total, we invested and committed $812 million this quarter. Included in that number was $348 million of new investments in the debt and preferred equity side that will provide a weighted average yield to us of 9.3%. That brings our total portfolio to almost $900 million or 6.4% of today's total enterprise value, just about where we started the year at. ", "Real estate investments and commitments during the quarter totaled $464 million and include deals we've already discussed today, 1552 Broadway, 747 Madison Avenue and the contracted DFR commitment. We're using a combination of tools to support our financial capacity and maintain liquidity. ", "Early in the quarter, we completed our second ATM program raising $80 million at an average $82 per share, share price, bringing our total new common equity this year to $525 million. We also put a new $250 million program in place, which hasn't been used yet. We continue our program of recycling capital in addition to having closed the sale of 28 West 44th Street last May and sales that Andrew mentioned just a moment ago, 141 Fifth Avenue and 292 Madison Avenue. That brings our total sales so far this year to about $300 million. We're considering additional sales to continue to recycle capital into higher growth opportunities and, importantly, to manage our credit ratios through this period in which we've had deployed a large amount of capital. ", "From a liquidity standpoint, we've been careful to match our sources and uses, and we continue to carry liquidity at the end of the quarter that exceeded $1 billion. We've previously spoken about our desire to extend debt maturities and lock-in today's low fixed interest rates. Getting our first investment grade rating during the second quarter improved the company's access to the unsecured markets. Fortunately, the public debt markets have been, in essence, close to REITs now for several months. ", "In August, we saw a brief opening of the window, and despite conflicting advice from our advisers, we decided to test the market with a small deal. The result was a 7-year, $250 million, 5-year bond issuance that was well executed in the face of what turned out to be an incredibly challenging day. This was the last unsecured bond offering done by a REIT. We're looking forward to a return of the debt markets to raise some additional capital, this time, we hope in a more meaningful amount. ", "Finally, we spoke in our last conference call about replacing our existing $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, which matures in June of next year. It became clear during the summer that the European debt crisis, combined with a growing backlog of REIT revolving credit deals, would increase the challenges to arranging a new facility if we were to wait. So Matt and I accelerated our process to arrange a new facility. ", "Today, I can say with confidence that we anticipate a closing of a new replacement revolving credit facility this quarter. We have the sponsorship and strong demand from the leading U.S. and international banks and expect an oversubscribed new facility with state-of-the-art investment grade structure and pricing. So more on this to come when we close. ", "Now I'll turn it over to Matt.", "Matt DiLiberto", "Thanks, Jim. In past quarters when we discussed our results and provided our guidance for the remainder of 2011, we spent a significant amount time normalizing our results, discussing items like gains on debt investments, non-recurring fee streams or other items that generated significant profits for the company that created what the street likes to call noise in our results. However, for the third quarter, this normalization is essentially unnecessary because the $1.01 per share of FFO we reported is comparably quiet and driven by a strong core operating performance in our real estate and debt and preferred equity portfolios. ", "With respect to the real estate portfolio, NOI overall met our expectations for the quarter. Our same-store NOI continued on a positive trajectory with growth of 3.6% for the first 9 months of the 2011. This performance has not only been driven by our leasing efforts, which were further evidenced during our announcement this morning, but also as a result of the efforts of our operations teams, both in Manhattan and in the Suburbs, who remain vigilant in managing our variable property operating expenses to offset increases in real estate taxes and labor. ", "To that end, we have supplemented more basic strategies, such as fixed priced utility contracts with alternative expense management initiatives, including retrofitting lighting fixture and garages, stairwells and lobbies with LED fixtures, which reduces energy consumption by 50%, installing real time energy monitoring equipment in the New York City portfolio that optimizes building performance for moment-to-moment energy management. And we now have 13 energy star buildings in the suburbs. So our leasing teams keep the buildings full and work to increase rents. Our operations teams are doing an equivalent amount of heavy lifting to ensure that our expenses remain in check. ", "Along with strong NOI during the quarter, we also saw an increase in all of our Manhattan occupancy statistics, achieving over 95% occupancy in our stabilized Manhattan office portfolio. Our Manhattan leasing metrics are trending well for 2011. We are on pace to lease over 2 million square feet of office space and have recognized a mark-to-market in Manhattan on signed office leases of over 6% through the first 9 months of the year. ", "In the suburban portfolio, occupancy dropped 50 basis points sequentially to around 86%. That is still well ahead of market occupancy levels. In addition, we were able to achieve a mark-to-market on our third quarter office leasing in a suburban portfolio almost 2%. In markets that are undoubtedly challenging, this is a significant accomplishment. ", "With regard to capital, the accelerated volume of leasing we have achieved in 2011, coupled with the 3 million square feet of leasing completed in 2010, has resulted in the company incurring higher aggregate leasing-related capital costs. This is not an indication that we are seeing a widening concession packages, its simply a function of the tremendous volume of leases signed over the past 2 years. ", "In general, concession packages have stabilized over the past several quarters. Moreover, it is a function of volume and timing. Also, it is important to note that the capital allocated to each lease is given very careful consideration based on location, type of tenant, new versus renewal and the term of the lease. And we feel the capital we spend on leasing is prudent in order to keep the portfolio full and grow our top line. ", "As Jim noted on the debt and preferred equity side of the business, we still see opportunities to invest capital into our portfolio at attractive yields during the quarter, deployed just short of $350 million at a weighted average yield of 9.3%, all of which was in New York City. This contributed to the $3.3 million increase in investment income during the quarter. We brought the portfolio size back to more historical levels after seeing it significantly reduced early in the year following repayments, sales and conversions to equity at 280 Park Avenue.", "Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, we are reiterating our FFO guidance for 2011, $4.75 to $4.80 per share. In reiterating our guidance, we have taken into consideration the sales announced this morning and interest expense that will be higher on a sequential quarter basis and higher than what was included in our original guidance as a result of the full quarter effect of the $250 million, 7-year, 5% unsecured bond offering we completed in August and the expected early recasting of our line of credit, both of which Jim touched on a moment ago. ", "Clearly, from a corporate finance and capital markets perspective, these events are significantly positive, very efficient executions for the company and a testament to our reputation in the fixed income and bank markets. We're also anticipating the closing of the new mortgage financing at the Landmark Square in Stamford that we've discussed previously. ", "Turning to our guidance for 2012, which I know many people are anticipating, all I can say is that consistent with prior years, we'll have to wait until December for our Investor Conference. ", "With that I'll turn the call back over to Marc for some closing comments.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. Thank you, Matt. We try to anticipate as many questions and topics as we could in our prepared remarks. But something tells me we may have a some questions nonetheless. So with that, why don't we open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Rob Stevenson from Macquarie.", "Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research", "Can you talk a little bit about the plans for the retail portion of the Stonehenge JV as to what the sort of end game is there?", "Andrew W. Mathias", "Sure. And I think there's a prime asset on Fifth Avenue, 724 Fifth, which has a medium-term lease to Prada. And we own an interest in a building next door at 720 Fifth Avenue. So we'll clearly be exploring whether there's any synergies to be gained there. And then there's a site on Madison which is leased longer term to Armani. And that's more of a stable cash flowing asset for the time being.", "Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then I guess a follow-up question is, the apartments that you guys acquired in that joint venture, is it -- is that sort of coupled with some of the development that you're doing now? Are you guys actively looking for incremental apartment investments given your commentary about office cap rates moving so low, or is it just happenstance that those came along in a pool together?", "Andrew W. Mathias", "Well, I  mean, that was clearly a transaction that was connected to a portfolio sale from a generational family owner. And in those situations, we thought the portfolio was pretty well custom tailored to our sweet spot. But, obviously, the retail -- the residential component is something that we have experienced with in the structured finance side, not as much in direct ownership. So it gave us an opportunity to partner with one of the premier multi-family firms in the city, Stonehenge, who we've done transactions with -- certain commercial transactions with in the past. And this is the first time that we've been able to kind of join forces on a multi-portfolio, which is in their sweet spot. So I would say that we don't have an active pipeline of residential, and I can't say that, that is or isn't going to be a focus going forward. I think we'll see how these assets perform. It was a minority portion of the overall portfolio, if you will. And we think they're good stable assets, so it will give us, I think, a pretty good barometer of the profitability of these kinds of investments as they stack up to our commercial and retail platform. But at the moment, no concentrated effort to expand that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Feldman from Bank of America.", "James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I guess, Marc, following up on your comment earlier that the financial services really wasn't that active this quarter. What is that -- what are you seeing in terms of the types of buildings or maybe the types of submarkets that are different with that out of the market?", "Marc Holliday", "What am I seeing in terms of?", "James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "In terms of demand, I mean, are you seeing any shift from -- into older buildings, into smaller floor plates. Just how should we be thinking about what -- how the market's acting today without financial services?", "Marc Holliday", "Right. A couple of different ways to answer that. I would say it's not really just limited to today, but probably more so consistent with how it's been over the past year or 2. This has been a market driven from non-financials. And I would give you as one example, information in media companies accounted year-to-date for about 28% of all leasing, whereas, historically, they've been close to around 15%, 16%. So clearly, they are overrepresented. I don't want to make it sound if there's no financial leasing, they're probably accounting for about 30%, where typically, they would account for 40% and some of those are the secondary banks, hedge funds and private equity firms and other foreign banks like Nomura, which did a deal for about 800,000 square feet a little earlier this year. So it's not -- I don't want to create a picture of where the market is devoid. This market is too big to be devoid of financial tenants. It's a matter of over and under representation. And I think that our portfolio has had a lot of media, information technologies, publishing, some healthcare-related companies, advertising, accounts and lawyers and the financial firms have been underrepresented by no means absence from the market just somewhat absent from our results in the third quarter.", "James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. But I guess given -- I mean, our sense is that the media tenants, the tech tenants are looking more at Midtown South. How do -- what does that mean for Midtown? I mean, are there certain parts of Midtown that were...", "Marc Holliday", "I mean, we -- was drilling on submarkets. I wouldn't -- Midtown South or Downtown or -- is an area, but Midtown is still probably the most prevalent area for publishing and media. So I wouldn't say Downtown is, by any means, exclusive or near exclusive to those tenants. Steve, why don't you comment specifically on the submarkets?", "Steven M. Durels", "Well, I think there's a couple of things to point out. One is, from Marc's point, which is that all of financial services are still in the market that's been -- of late, it's been driven by new media and other businesses, accounting, law firms, other industries. And where we see a lot of activity today, and have seen it for the past quarter. So it's really more in the value type price points, sort of the $45 to $65 square foot price point as compared to the $85 square foot and above. There are plenty of comps out there for high price point, but the volume of deals are being done in the more -- by tenants who are more price sensitive and value oriented. I think that speaks well for our portfolio. They're looking for a lot of value, good quality of ownership, well-positioned assets that have been -- that are improved. And that's why you're seeing tremendous amount of activity acknowledge last year but rolling right into this year and strong velocity as we move into the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Just wanted take the leasing comments just one more step. If you speak to the brokers, it sounds like the tenants today in the market aren't feeling the pressure to do deals today. People are fine waiting. We're just not doing anything. Whereas earlier in the year, there was a rush to get deals signed ASAP. With the sense of perhaps concessions starting to increase or free rent starting to increase, what do you think it takes for the market to sort of get reinvigorated? I mean, Wall Street is still going through its issues and if the other part of Manhattan has been carrying its weight, what's the incremental event that's going to cause the market to tighten back up where the landlords start to get the leverage again?", "Marc Holliday", "Yes. I just want to say, I wouldn't say the leverage is gone, nor would I say it's exceptionally present. I think it's consistent with what we've said. This market has improved off the bottom to date around 15% from the trough in '09. We expect over the next 2 years that, that will increase at least another 10% over the next 2 years and be right on target with where our 25% prediction from earlier, possibly in excess of that. It's -- for the market to be taking a momentary pause while there is some mixed economic news, to say the least, so people -- corporations will naturally be somewhat more hesitant making long-term commitments until things become more transparent for them. I would say we're at a 9.3% vacancy rate. That's pretty low vacancy rate. And that's -- it would not take a lot to quickly tip that into a landlords market. It's not like it was back in '09 where we had to chop away 300-plus basis points of vacancy and tons and tons of well-built sublet space. Right now, the sublet space offering in this market, Steve, is 1.7%, so under 2% desirable sublet space in any market is pretty tight market. And that's generally what we compete with, and that's generally what would cause rents to go in the other direction. So I think that if you take my comments from earlier, we had 24,000 jobs created, office using jobs in 2011. That's where -- I think that's where it's expected to land at year end. If that pace were to continue into '12 or even half that amount, that's real absorption. If we can get 4 million square feet of absorption a year, that's not a lot of job growth. I call that, generally ordinary growth where tenants were renewing or taking maybe 15% or 20% expansion space when they're signing new tenant 15-year leases because they want to be prudent. They don't want to undershoot their needs over that period of time. I think we'll see rental terms stay stable or increase further in '12. It's just not necessarily going to be at the aggressive levels that I think some of our competitors were underwriting earlier in the year. And we talked about that in July, we said we felt good about the growth prospects, but we thought the market had gotten ahead of us where they used to be behind us. So what would it take? I think it would just take a modest amount of job creation in the financial services industry and a continuation of job creation in the non-financial sectors. By the way, in September, there were 1,600 jobs added in the securities industry. I mean, as non-appearing as that may seem, it was actually job growth. Now we're not expecting that to necessarily be the case in October, November and December, and we could see that reverse itself. But if you get 15,000, 20,000, 25,000 jobs next year of -- office jobs, you could see a decent market. But as we said earlier, we're prepared for the reverse just in case this job loss, or more importantly, sublet space delivered onto the market, that's what I would keep my eye on to see if rents go to the other way. Steve, I don't know if anything you want to add to that?", "Steven M. Durels", "Well, I guess just a little bit of more micro color to it which is, as we sit here today and having asked the question dozens of times already in the past couple of months, with regards to subleased space, there's -- were hard for us to see any on the horizon. So I don't think we ever want to say that they won't come. But as we sit here today, it doesn't seem to be imminent. And on the velocity side, we haven't seen a slowdown in our portfolio. I think that speaks largely to the price points of our -- of the average rents of our available space. We're busier today than we were at the beginning summer. We had One of our busiest summers. Fourth quarter is already well ahead of schedule, and the pipeline is still very strong. I think a lot of the uncertainty in people's minds and the uncertainty in tenants' minds is really as they look sort of beyond the next quarter. It's more where does 2012 and beyond go. And I think a lot of people are just sitting there saying, \"Hey, I don't have a firm opinion as to whether the world is in a better or worse place.\" I just don't know. And therefore, that's a little bit of the broker uncertainty that you hear people comment on.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay, and then just quickly, the dividend, it's like 0.5% yield right now. You guys have about a 4% AFFO yield. As we think about 2011 taxable income or where the dividend may end up, how should we be thinking about that?", "James Mead", "Well, we'll give you a full breakdown in December. But I think we've been consistently saying that the taxable -- the income for the company will rise. So certainly directionally, dividend is going to go up. But we'll talk about it in a lot of detail in December.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum from UBS.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Wanted to talk about a little bit about the sale of the leased fee interest at 292 Madison because the pricing there intrigued me. Because at $440 a foot and what looks like to be 3.7% yield, does that encourage you to go out and test the market to go sell the land that you own at 2 Harold Square and 885 Third?", "Andrew W. Mathias", "Well, I think it demonstrates the value in these positions which there was quite a bit of confusion or inquiry when we purchased the package of 3 interests from Gramercy. This is representative of the value of long-term net leased fees in Manhattan. And I think while whereas 292 Madison we view as a non-strategic asset, not one where we particularly have a long-term view on, I would say the other 2 fees we own, 2 Herald and 885 Third, are definitely long-term assets that are of great interest to us depending on the -- ultimately how the leaseholders performed there. So we're not in a rush to sell those assets. But I think it is instructive to see the value of leased fee interests.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then the second question I have is just to clarify, I think there's some confusion around what your involvement or lack thereof is surrounding 180 Maiden Lane. Can you clarify for everybody what exactly do you have anything invested there in equity or mezz, and do you plan to?", "Marc Holliday", "We have -- I mean, we have a small debt interest in the property now that we've owned for some time. And there was a Wall Street Journal article regarding a deal that either closed or was pending, and we haven't announced anything to date. So we have a small debt investment and mortgage there that we've owned for some time.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "How we should we all think about the exposure there given AIG's lease expiring in 2014 and how that factors in?", "Marc Holliday", "Yes, I think we're -- I would have to take a look at what our per foot last dollar is. But we're fairly senior within that mortgage. So I think we're insensitive to the tenant role there. I mean, it's a very high-quality asset in a good submarket. And I think people's -- the ability to retenant assets Downtown, we've demonstrated 100 Church, and there's been decent activity Downtown. So that's certainly not one of that's keeping us up at night.", "Andrew W. Mathias", "There was some confusion on some of the write-ups this morning. Just to clarify, our position in that building is less than $20 million. So it's a very small position for us.", "Marc Holliday", "Yes, I would just add to Andrew, I mean, it's a terrific building Downtown, has improved dramatically. We're looking at more opportunities Downtown on the heels of our success at 100 Church and on the heels of some other structured finance deals we've done Downtown. So I -- we've been asked the question multiple times over the past 6 months, whether we would consider doing more Downtown than we've traditionally done in the past, and we've answered in the affirmative. And its just that -- like old Manhattan. Its just not that easy to come across good deals at reasonable cap rates with high-quality tenants, high-quality building. So the answer is, we're constantly trolling that market as we do to Midtown market and whether it's 180 or some other asset, I think we're looking a little more exposure Downtown on the heels of our success at 100 church.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee from Stifel, Nicolaus.", "John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Mark, you guys are clearly more and more everyday running an opportunity fund with probably a little more or less leverage that I would have expected. I guess, Jim, is beating on you every day. I think you're making a multitude of different investments in New York City in every angle. At the same time, when it comes right down to it, you still are valued as a proxy to the Manhattan office market. Any chance of Matt and his team could provide a little more clarity on these multitude of other apartment retail, et cetera, investments going forward?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, clarity in what respect, John, just so I'm clear with...", "John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Just what your real basis is in these deals? How much leverage there really is? What sort of yield you're looking at going in? What kind of stabilized yields you're looking at? Just a little more explanation on some very complicated deals?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, let's think how to tackle that. Let's talk a bit about DFR, I guess, as one -- I think one component of what you're referring to. That transaction is one that broke down into predominantly retail and obviously, there are the 2 multi-family assets on our 57th, 58th Street. And I think the way we looked at that deal is similar to how we look at most of these retail deals. There's maybe 4 submarkets in general that we look at 4 or 5 submarkets. Times Square proper, upper Fifth, upper Madison, Flatiron and 34th Street and Soho. So let's call those the primary trade routes, if you will, of where we're trying to amass more and more of this retail product. And when we're successful in doing that, typically, we're going at a fairly low cap rates, 4%, 4.5%. But the rents are generally pretty significantly below market, much more so than we find in office deals whereas office rents today, we buy deals are typically kind of at market, maybe 5% or 10% below market. These retail deals can sometimes be 20% or more below market. Conversely, you have to wait longer with these retail deals than typical office assets. So in some cases, we may have to wait 10 years or longer. This was an opportunity where there were -- there was near-term role in this portfolio that we felt we could access. There was synergy between other assets we owned in those markets with the DFR assets. And when we look at what we think the total returns will be unlevered, we get to something in the high-single digits, 8-ish percent unlevered yields. For good retail locations in those areas, we look at that as very, very good. I think we priced the multi-family there under that. We look a little bit more price per foot of around $350, $360 per square foot. Those multi-family assets that we --that have about a 50-50 split roughly between regulated and non-regulated tenancies. But we think that Stonehenge has an extraordinary track record of being able to develop those units, move the rent roll, convert units, just manage a very good property such that we'll be having -- we're expecting to have stabilized cash on cost yields, or I should say, unlevered cash on cost yields in the 4.5% range and IRRs that are probably closer to 6.5%, 7% range. So under the retail expectation, but still pretty healthy especially given cost of funds today to finance these multi-family properties. So I think we look at the retail and the residential. But predominantly, the resi is just 2 buildings, as a way to act as a counterbalance, if you will, to the office portfolio, which tends to be more volatile and consume more capital to maintain those NOIs than our experience on the retail and the multi-family, which once stabilized, tends to be more of a net business. But I think with the intense focus that you all have on our FO, not just FFO, we thought it was important to branch out into these other areas as a way of increasing, not only our returns, which I think are already above average turns, but increasing our cash flow so that we can invest in more and pay high dividends. So I think, a little bit of a diversity within our market, a little bit of a counterweight to the volatility, if you will, and just a pure profitability of these largely defensive assets and offensive in good markets drew us and draw us to the retail opportunities specifically. And we'll look at the residential performance and assess that as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Knott from Green Street Advisors.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Marc, just curious your perspective on the market and how long it can continue to trend sort of in the right direction from the other 2/3 of the marketplace if finance and banking continues to remain stagnant or even if you start to see a little more sublet space put on the market by some of those guys with all the job cuts they've had? Just curious if you feel like you -- the market has done much better than you would have thought given sort of the negative headlines?", "Marc Holliday", "I wouldn't say it's done better than we thought. I think, I would say, it's consistent with where we thought. I think it's -- I think the market had gotten to a point where we've got ahead of these results. I think we were more in lockstep with the results we've achieved. In answer to your question, there's countervailing points. On the one hand, if the market takes a breather, then it will be harder, obviously, to keep the velocity at the levels we've experienced for the couple of years, 2 million square feet-plus. That's a lot of velocity. And rental growth, which we've enjoyed over the past 2 years of about 15% and some shrinking concessions. Flipside is, there's no new availability. The market is getting more and more leased. You're down under 10%. You're almost at 9%. And without more significant economic activity, a lot of the subsidized development projects around the city that were maybe at the tipping point of starting, this may push them back. Maybe not, we'll have to see. But to the extent it does, that puts a limit and a cap on any new availability. And I think go back to what I said earlier, I think it just really depends on the sublet space. I think that without major new blocks of sublet, and I don't mean a couple hundred thousand feet, I'm talking millions of square feet of well-built prime sublet space, this is going to be, I think, still a pretty tight market, a pretty fair market, I should say, where we're going to get decent rents. I think we'll get some rental growth. But maybe 5%, 10% more over the next year or 2. And maybe leveling or possibly even some further shrinking concessions. Now that's assuming job growth next year is slightly positive to along the lines of what I said earlier. If there were significant, significant reductions and significant sublet space, then we have to reevaluate. But that's not what we're seeing now. This is what we saw in '08. So it's a different market. And I think that with low rates and if the rightsizing that domestic banks went through in '08 and '09, the European banks go through that kind of rightsizing in '11 and '12, everybody's right sized. I think you could get significant growth again when this market picks up whenever that is. Second half of '12, '13. I think our bias would be more towards that than the reverse. But we're going to have to wait and see. The reason we're somewhat sanguine about is because we're very defensive in our posture right now. So even if rents were down 10% next year, or couple of million square feet of sublet space hit the market, I don't think it's going to have a material effect on our portfolio.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, thanks. And then my last question is just any color, are you guys happy with the progress on leasing at 3 Columbus Circle today? Then also on the sale side, I know you have 711 Third out on the market and also 1 Court Square, I believe?", "Andrew W. Mathias", "We're seeing very good interest in the assets that we're selling. And we are encouraged there, obviously, 141 and 292 are 2 small deals that got done at very, very efficient levels. And we're working on the bigger deals for sure. Steve, you want to comment on 3 CC?", "Stephen L. Green", "Well, it's been in the paper that there's a big deal rolling at 3 Columbus. And we've had very good response from the brokerage community and prospective tenants. We have active negotiations covering roughly 2/3 of our availability. And we're working hard to get it leased up. So nothing to truly report right now. But I think we're ahead of schedule of expectation.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jay Habermann from Goldman Sachs.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Marc, you gave some thoughts in terms of your expectations for office rent growth. But as you think about retail, can you give us some sense of where you think we are in the cycle and specifically the Fifth Avenue, Times Square markets because rent growth has been pretty robust in those areas in recent years. And I'm just curious where you think rents can go from here?", "Marc Holliday", "Andrew is right on top of where the rental opportunities lie on some of these assets. What you think we have and what kind of...", "Andrew W. Mathias", "In the submarkets that Mark and I identified, we still see the potential for strong rental growth. Times Square is very unique and that retailers essentially get 2 full days for every day that they're open because they can open early and stay open late until 2 in the morning in some cases, and get essentially 2 full shifts out of 1 day. So that the rent that they can pay and the sales that retailers are achieving have allowed rents to drift up significantly in addition to -- you have a lack of supply working there as well. But I think you have similar types of dynamics on Fifth Avenue without necessarily the late hours but certainly with very high sales being achieved and more and more critical mass being achieved on Fifth where you've just had Uniqlo, Hollister, you'll have Zara opening. You'll have Dolce & Gabbana when they open at 717. You have a continual new blood of retailers and just a great critical mass there that draws a lot of traffic. So that's allowed landlords to continue pushing up rents and filling the spaces. And we don't see that dynamic really changing in those areas so long as tourism in the city stay strong. And obviously, a weak dollar always helps. Dollar has been fluctuating around, but the dynamics are setup very well in those of submarkets.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And just a second question, can you comment, maybe perhaps for Jim, just the dollar amount of asset sales that you're looking at, I guess, just given the concerns that you highlighted with the unsecured market today?", "James Mead", "Yes. I mean, I hate to give you a firm number, but it's fair to say that we're looking at something around $0.5 billion in aggregate sales as we move forward into the fourth and then into next year.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Would this be an alternative to doing a bond issuance, or is this in addition to it?", "James Mead", "I think it's different categories, right? Bond issuance would be effectively to term out existing debt. Asset sales would be to find a more efficient supplement to the equity offerings. And also, to, as we've done over the years, to look for opportunities to recycle into higher growth, higher-quality assets.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Bilerman of Citi.", "Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Its Josh Attie with Michael. Last quarter, you mentioned there was a lot of opportunity to put money to work in the structured finance market, and you did that and you brought the loan book up to $900 million. What does the environment look like today? And are you still seeing opportunities to put capital to work there?", "Andrew W. Mathias", "In the structured book, you're saying?", "Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Yes.", "Andrew W. Mathias", "Yes. I think the dynamics haven't really changed. You have insurance companies and commercial banks being the primary providers of acquisition financing because the CMBS market is somewhere between closed and not really competitive to those capital sources for Manhattan-type acquisitions. And the commercial banks and insurance companies generally leave a large chunk of capital between, call it, 40% and 50% loan to acquisition and 60% -- 60%, 65%, 70% loan to acquisition. That's a gap that we've been able to step in and fill in a lot of these cases at attractive returns. That dynamic has not really shifted. And that is why I would say we did generate some liquidity from within the book, selling down $50 million of one preferred equity investment and $30 million or so of another bridge loan to allow us to generate some positive returns. And also to continue reinvesting in new structured deals.", "Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And the 2 large investments that you made in the third quarter, can you talk about them generally, maybe where you stand in the capital stack and how you expect those investments to play out over time?", "Andrew W. Mathias", "I think it's very consistent with what I just described, where 50%-ish or so first dollar and 65% to 70% or so last dollar. The term is generally 3 to 5 years, generally fixed rates or LIBOR -- floating over LIBOR with floors and their varying levels of current pay, but 5%, 6%, 7% current pay and 9% to 10% accrual rates on those pieces of paper.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sheila McGrath from KBW.", "Sheila McGrath - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Recently, we've seen public companies make boost to sell their suburban office assets. And I'm just wondering what your view on your suburban portfolio is? Are you currently planning to hold onto it, or would you consider a sale?", "James Mead", "Sheila, so far, we're -- it's Jim. We're getting -- it feels as though we're either flattening or turning the corner in the suburbs. We've done very well. We got positive mark-to-market for the first time in quite a while in the suburbs. So I think we're pretty content that we've got the highest-quality assets in our submarkets in the -- and that the -- we continue to do much better than the Australian markets.", "Sheila McGrath - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And quickly on the 100 Church. It seems like you've made a lot of strides on occupancy. Could you give us some perspective of how the rental rates, lease-up pays, some returns, look versus your original pro forma?", "Steven M. Durels", "Well on the lease-up, we are -- we just signed a lease that was announced today. It was actually a fourth quarter transaction where Healthfirst expanded by almost another 60,000 square feet. We have only 2 floors remaining in the building other than some very small pockets beyond that. But eventually, 2 full floors left in the building at which we have leases out that are actively being negotiated. So we're, I think, way ahead of pro forma on the building. The most recent deals that we did in the third quarter and this last transaction were $3 to $5 square foot higher than the additional leases that were signed in the building. And the concessions were actually reduced as well, both on TI and free rent. On the return side of it, maybe Andrew or Jim can speak to that.", "Andrew W. Mathias", "I mean the building has blown away our expectations in terms of return, in large part due to occupancy that's going to well exceed our initial pro forma, but also rents and retail and mezzanine space, some medical space, we've just been able to get the building to a much higher level of occupancy than there ever was historically. And that's going to contribute to unbelievable returns on the investment.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "I just want to come back to the tempo in the market. There's obviously been some sort of shift in your last call, or at least early in the summer. One of your peers sort of identified the change that they've seen as the shift to a smaller tenancy in their pre-building out suites, which tends to be your bread and butter. Is that something that you guys have seen? Is there a shift? I mean, there are larger tenants out of the market and more -- the smaller tenants just continue to be the more dynamic ones?", "Steven M. Durels", "Well, I think there's a couple of things understand. There is generally, as I said earlier, uncertainty in both broker and tenant minds as to where the world is headed. Notwithstanding that, there's still very good leasing velocity, particularly in the more value priced point of the market. And there's lots and lots of deals being done. As a matter of fact, the deals that we've just announced, those were all closed within the past 30 days. One was 130,000 square feet, one was 114,000 square feet and the other is an expansion for 60,000 square feet. We're working on several very, very large transactions right now. The difference again is emphasized that they're all in that sort of middle-of-the-market price point. So the big investment banks, the very top of the price point where rents are at $85 and above clearly, I think, that has taken a pause. But I don't see a slowdown on the rest of the markets.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just a follow-up, I know it's early, but you have taken these down now on the 1550 and 1560. Are you envisioning a single-tenant type situation there, or is that going to be a multi-tenant or?", "Andrew W. Mathias", "We think it will likely be single user. That's what we're targeting.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "And the time frame and incremental dollars invested, you think?", "Andrew W. Mathias", "Our capital budget there is around $20 million. And time frame, we have the existing tenant in there on a one-year leaseback. That was one of the conditions of sale. So we'll be getting our approvals and doing all of our preparations over the next 12 months. And we expect to deliver a completed box within 6 months or so after that.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Anthony Paolone of J.P. Morgan.", "Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I just had a question about your discussion on your tenants taking a more value bent and seeing some of the financial services guys a bit rash in the market. So how does that factor into just repositioning of 600 Lex and also your plans for 280 Park where both those buildings seem to be either a little bit more towards financial services or more boutique, much price-sensitive tendency?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I think you got to take each one separately. 280 Park is an irreplaceable location, and that building in almost all markets, I think, is going to outperform and be very attractive for tenants that don't have to be the very large financial service-oriented tenants. Steve can talk about a couple of deals that we and our partners just did there at very good rates above underwriting and certainly near-term than we had envisioned. And there's a capital program that we and Vornado are not really prepared to take investors through now, but at a point in time, we'll be. This is a project that will -- isn't going to be done in the next 6 months. It's probably something that's going to take a year or 2 to fully reposition. And when it is repositioned, we both expect it to be among the best offerings on Park Avenue. So I wouldn't -- I look at that in a very special class, particularly given what our plans are for that building. And I think we're going to wind up with a very good investment there. And today's market, to me, is not quite as relevant as the market we expect to be leasing into in a year or 2. So that's one. On 600, Steve, I don't know if you want to...", "Steven M. Durels", "Well, remember, 600, the floor sizes there are the largest, about 12,000 square feet. The majority of the spaces are 10,000 square feet for a full floor. And the price points is at its most expensive than daily dollar space. So it's still acts as a price relief type of building to the higher price points Park Avenue and Madison Avenue. So although it's expensive, it's still relatively center space. It's cheap space for the profile of tenant that we're going after. And that's where we catch them. Recently seeing the building and we've got still a lot of good traffic. But we're pounding the pavement to take care of the role that we've got. Just to add the Mark's point on 280 Park, don't take our comments the wrong way with regards to a pause in activity. That\u2019s a statement of today. And I don't think 280 Park is a long-term play. We've still got tenants in place and the development program has really just started. So it's going to be one of the 3 best buildings on the avenue, and it think it's going to be a -- there is always going to be a strong market for it. So we're wildly excited about the opportunity there.", "Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And my follow-up question is just on -- in your packet, there was some additional secured fixed-rate debt that you guys took on at 8% for $50 million. It seems like that's related to a preferred investment. I just wonder if you could flush out just how that all works?", "Andrew W. Mathias", "That's a participation interest we sold in an asset. I mean, we essentially financed a position of ours. So it shows up as a secured financing. It's essentially a senior participation.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of Steve Benyik from Jefferies & Company.", "Steven Benyik - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Great. I was hoping you guys could comment a little bit further on just the state of the unsecured -- or the secured financing markets you mentioned, the life insurance companies and the commercial banks sort not fulfilling all the demand there from a loan-to-value perspective. Just sort of whether you're seeing any changes there from their underwriting, and what your expectations are for secured debt over the next 12 months and what impacts that may have on cap rates?", "Andrew W. Mathias", "Sure. I think you characterized it accurately, which is that there's enough of their capital to finance sort of every deal that needs financing. Thus far, they're just -- they don't finance at a proceed level that to a more levered buyer find sufficient. So that's creating a structured finance opportunity for us. I mean, if you look at the financings that we did on the deals we purchased this quarter, we got very efficient secured financing on 1552, 1560 Broadway, very efficient financing on 747 Madison. Both were from commercial banks, and those are non-securitized type execution, balance sheet type executions. But there is a bit of a GAAP out there where mezzanine guys are filling at what we think to be attractive rates. But thus far, most of the deals we've gotten done in the last quarter or so have been insurance companies and commercial banks for balance sheets.", "Steven Benyik - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then also for Andrew, I guess, when you mentioned earlier about some investors stepping to the sidelines and not participating in some of the recent auctions that are out there, can you talk a little bit about who has done that and where does sort of the sovereign wealth funds stand today if the REITs today are the most likely buyer of some of these assets? Is that sort of a negative for the cap rate outlook?", "Andrew W. Mathias", "I don't think so. I mean, I think it's a little more -- the interest rates are so compelling today that you've seen, as I said, 2 guys step in for every guy that steps aside, has led to a dynamic where there's not necessarily one dominant like we've seen. We were a dominant buyer in 2010. And I guess the closest thing you could say is, RXR has had a very busy year with the Canadian Pension Fund PSP. They announced they bought 626 Avenue. That's on the heels of buying this steadily high building. So they're probably the closest thing to a dominant buyer. But you've seen a lot of different groups step in and fill the voids. And it's tough to sort of paint them with one brush. It's been a lot of pension capital, a lot of core funds and saw entrepreneurial deals. It's been sort of all over the map.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck, Wells Fargo.", "Blaine Heck - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I just wanted to see if you guys could comment on the FAD guidance for both Q4 and 2011 full year? I think on your last conference call, you mentioned the full year number was expected to come in around 260 to 265, which would imply $0.55 a $0.60 a share in Q4. Just wanted to see if that was still what you're looking at and kind of how you get there? The guidance for FFO in Q4 is going to be lower than Q3 run rate?", "Matt DiLiberto", "It's Matt. I addresses the capital a little bit in my commentary. Clearly, in the third quarter, we spent quite a bit of leasing capital. And probably, we'll do so again in the fourth quarter, driven by the sheer volume of leasing we're doing. The term of these deals are longer, so we're putting more capital into them. And they're getting done in such a time frame that we will likely spend more capital than we anticipated. That all being said, it is, to a certain extent, out of our control. If it's a landlord contribution because it depends on when the tenant does his work and when we get the paperwork submitted for reimbursement as to when it shows up in our numbers. So it is a gap to fill for the fourth quarter that is going to be tight. But it's somewhat dependent on the pace of the capital spend related all the leasing we've done that happens in the fourth quarter.", "Blaine Heck - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, but you're still comfortable with the 260 to 266 at this point?", "Matt DiLiberto", "265, we haven't moved off it, but it's going to require some capital management in the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "At this time, I'm showing we have no further questions. I'd like to hand the call back over to management for closing remarks.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. Well, thank you for your questions today. We'll be speaking with many of you in December at our investor meeting that Heidi mentioned. So just I would recognize that in terms of upcoming events for us, that's probably the onetime a year where we get to really talk about forward-looking projections, strategies, business plans, much more so than we're set to cover on these kinds of earnings call. So we look forward to speaking with as many of you possible in December. And accordingly, I would expect our next call in 3 months to be abbreviated as they've been in years passed because it comes right on the heels of that investor meeting. So I would encourage you, if you're choosing one of the other to choose the investor day. Thank you, and look forward to speaking with you guys again.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your participation in today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Heidi Gillette. Please proceed.", "Heidi Gillette", "Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us. This conference call is being recorded.", "At this time, the company would like to remind listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from the forward-looking statements that management may make today. Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the company's Form 10-K and other reports filed by the company with SEC.

Therefore, for today's call we will be utilizing an abbreviated format from that a quarter's past and initial commentary will come from -- only from Chief Executive Officer, Marc Holliday, then we will turn the call over immediately to Q&A. As a reminder, the Q&A Section, please limit your question to 2 per person. Thank you.", "I will now turn the call over to Mark. Please go ahead.", "Marc Holliday", "Good morning, and welcome, everyone. We were very pleased with our quarterly results announced last night, to cap-off, very, very good year for the company. While those who had significant concerns at the New York Wall Street [ph] market, while those may have been surprised by these results. We certainly were not as the company's performance was well in line with the guidance we gave last month at our investor conference. Because of the, I guess, 3-hour presentation that was done in December and webcast and was available online, we're going to limit today's remarks coming only 7 or 8 weeks after that extensive dive, if you will, into the New York market in our portfolio and focus mostly on Q&A for the quarter. But I did want to just give you a few thoughts before we turn it over to Q&A.", "First thing I think you'll note in the release is that we are seeing improved earnings velocity coming from 2 different avenues, improvement in same-store and contributions from recently acquired value added properties. Earnings and cash flow velocity will accelerate in 2012 as we lease up the acquired vacancy and the New York market continues to improve. Such improvements being fairly measurable in '10 and '11 but still nowhere close to peak performance years of 2006 and 2007. Recall in December, we highlighted about a dozen properties that are projected to contribute nearly $90 million of incremental EBITDA for the most part occurring over the next 3 years. Also we ended 2011 with peak leasing volume for the quarter of 662,000 square feet. While that is a very sizable number in and of itself, I would just want you to note that, that total would have been almost 900,000 square feet if we included in this total the condo unit that was sold instead of leased to Y&R 3 Columbus Circle. While that market activity in citywide maybe slowing somewhat as reported by several of the New York brokers, our portfolio activity remains quite high with over 115,000 square feet of space leased in our portfolio this month alone, first 30 days, first 31 days and another 1.2 million square feet on top of that, which is being actively negotiated.", "An example of this recent performance occurring after year-end would be the lease signed last evening by Steve Durels and his leasing team at Jazz at Lincoln Center, is now also an occupant at 3 Columbus, leasing about 30,000 square feet, and bringing the total office left to lease at 3 Columbus to about 170,000 square feet. That building -- the building activity is accelerating on the heels of the Y&R announcement and I feel safe to say that we'll have less than 100,000 square feet to lease by year\u2019s end that property, well ahead of schedule. So we welcome Jazz as well as all the other tenants that were signed up as part of that 115,000 square feet at 3 Columbus.", "The leasing market remains in equilibrium at an overall 9.1% vacancy rate, with Midtown being about 0.5 higher than that and we are expecting that number to improve modestly in 2012 with 24,000 private sector jobs estimated to be created in New York City in the coming year. Also the fact that sublease phase today is around 5 million square feet and that represents, if not a low, very near a low since the year 2000. So the sublease space and I think, that being something that people focus on, and rightfully focus on with the concerned with it if there was material glut of improved space on the market. That is right now at its lows and I think that emboldens us to a major projection we made back in December in the face of what people thought a softening  market when we projected an approximately 5% improvement in that effective rent in 2012 and we still are standing by that assessment.", "We also increased our structured finance balances by 10% in the fourth quarter through 4 new originations that are typical of our New York century investment profile. This program continues to be an enormous source of earnings and opportunity. On the investment front -- on the asset investment front, values continue to appreciate, cap rates continue to fall as over $25 billion of sales were executed in 2011 with over half of that represented by office sales. And those are very significant volumes, not peak volumes, but quite sizable. We took advantage of that hot market as a buyer and a seller. As a seller, we announced 3 asset sales at the end of last year, and we intend to accelerate our sales in JV efforts to capitalize on significant value creation and also our desire to continue to demonstrate the vast under assessment of private market valuations by public market investors.", "On the acquisition front, in 2011, as we had demonstrated in December, there were about 10 different transactions where we acquired property or substantial interest in properties totaling a transaction value of close to $4.5 billion in 2011. So you can see that on both sides of the Table, we were active, we continue to be so in 2012, notably 10 East 53rd Street, which was not discussed in December, is our latest acquisition. It fits right in with our core business line of acquiring, repositioning and redeveloping prime New York midtown Manhattan assets in prime location. And in that case, we subsequently brought in a foreign and institutional equity joint venture partner to both leverage our equity, enhance our returns and increase our opportunity set. So that deal was fairly profiled.", "Also adding to our future growth is the DFR portfolio acquisition that is expected to close later today, which includes 402 residential units -- residential rental units in 2 Midtown East apartment buildings and extraordinary retail properties at 724 Fifth and 752 Madison Avenue.", "So we'd like to congratulate the entire team here at SL Green for what was really a fabulous year in 2011. My hat is off to everyone including the operations and management group led by Ed, leasing led by Steve and investments led by David Schonbraun and Isaac Zion. Andrew will address you later on some of the specifics for these transactions but the legal team, Andy Neil and Jim and Matt, Heidi and everyone else, was a part of this enormous effort in 2011. Just want to say thank you.", "And with that let's open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Just a quick comment on the GAAP same-store NOI. The -- in the press release, you had the 2.9, which I'm guessing is a slightly different definition than what's in the supplemental. So on an apples-to-apples basis, what would fourth-quarter same-store NOI have been using the 2.9 definition that was in the press release?", "Matt DiLiberto", "It's Matt. If you use that same definition of what [ph] that includes 15, 15 and 521 in the calculation because we bought out partners during the course of the year that technically doesn't fit the same-store definition but the mathematics would, obviously, hold that. We don't know properties to control those properties, so that should be in there that tell you the 2.9. For the quarter that would be north of 3%, if done under same measure.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. So over 3% for the quarter.", "Matt DiLiberto", "Exactly. And that's how you get to 3% for the year as well.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "And then, just -- you guys sound like you're ramping-up the disposition program. As you think about new investments, certainly Midtown South, especially when you speak to the brokers, they're very excited by that submarket. Just wanted to get your take especially on the Chelsea flatiron, if you think that market truly has lags and now be -- now maybe much more acceptable for institutional investors to go down there especially if that's where sort of the next generation of new tenants and business is coming from.", "Marc Holliday", "While, I think, it certainly has lags from a leasing perspective. The challenge for investors is there's not lag institutional quality of inventory down there. So you're talking about the biggest buildings down there One Madison, which we own 626th and [indiscernible], which just traded this year. There are relatively few other buildings that are Park Avenue South buildings, which are primarily over-term and factory buildings, not a lot of institutional quality or institutional size product, it's lot of very small type properties. So while the leasing market does have lags, I'm not sure yet in terms of the institutional demand for smaller size 3 properties that make a lot of the inventory though.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "If a big institutional size asset were to come up, you guys, I'm assuming would be seriously interested, correct? Or not so much?", "Marc Holliday", "Sure, absolutely. We own One Madison. We had a great experience with them and we would absolutely look at others as we looked at the 620 and [indiscernible] last year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tony Paolone with JPMorgan.", "Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "If financial services demand remains muted over the course of the year, do you think the other parts of the New York economy can make up the slack you can get to the rent growth projections you guys talked about?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I think it has been. I think it's a little less projection, it's more just a synopsis of what taken us from down by about 300 basis points or so of vacancy. This quarter alone, it was tenants, like HF Global Healthcare and Bloomingdale's for office space, Y&R obviously a big deal, leading hotels, Viking Global Hedge Fund, A\u00e9ropostale, which was a tenant that we started with as a retail relationship in Times Square and was able to work with our suburban group and John Barnes at Broomnet tenant out for a sizable occupancy at Chubbway [ph] in New Jersey, and then you have some new media tenants like Amazon, who continues to grow at 1350 Sixth Avenue, I think, Steve, there's another lease last night to Amazon?", "Steven M. Durels", "Yes. It expanded by another 11,000 square feet.", "Marc Holliday", "So that was sound last night. And they continue to expand the footprint 1350, so I mean that's a sample and maybe Steve you can put in more?", "Steven M. Durels", "Well, I think to put it in perspective. Financial Services primarily is defined by the big investment banks and commercial banks. Actually has helped reduce the footprint that we had last year by couple of percentage points. Yet, last year was one of the biggest leasing years in the decade. It was driven primarily by new media and technology who leased 26%, 27% of all the inventory for last year. And we see those industries continue this year, to build during the pipeline are not necessarily financial related except we could always still see the hedge fund private equities, smaller type deals kicking about, but there's plenty of deals out there for advertising, technology, engineering, law firms and general service businesses. So, and I think that's the good news, that there's a big diversity of industries that are in the market and we saw last year, the leases last year was currently have a good leasing without financial services, we did and I think, we're going to see more of that this year.", "Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, thanks and my second question is as relates to 600 Lexington and 125 Park both had occupancies within the quarter, just curious if you could refresh us on the plans there, how they're coming along and whether those were expected and when those occupancies might turn the corner.", "Steven M. Durels", "600 Lexington, actually both this buildings as you recall, we bought them. We then go into the investments that the good percentage of the tenants would be vacating the buildings. 125 Park it was Meredith Publishing Firm who had about 150,000 square feet. We knew there was no chance of them staying in the building. They had outgrown their space and there was nothing available to retain their occupancy, would've wanted to consolidate to a bigger footprint at an equal price. And at 600 Lexington, we did color on those tenants as well, we none of the tenants expiring between '11, '12 in early '13 would renew, the producers have a couple of them. 600 Lexington, we've seen the leasing there, kind of go up and down. We had a burst of activity early last year, went kind of quiet during the year and we're busy there today than anywhere else in the portfolio, 4, 5, full floor deals that are pending at rents that are significantly above the underwriting. We're seeing a lot of tenants that are -- who have been looking at Park Avenue upper Madison Avenue coming our way and price points that are kind of 65 on the base of $80 a square foot in the tower and at 1425 Park Avenue the space just went vacant on January 1. We've pre-let one of the full floors of 25,000 square feet and we're out hunting for full floor tenants over there. So that will take the balance of this year, I think, on getting any traction on that building, but that's in line with the business part.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nicholas Yulico with Macquarie.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "For the New York City leases that were signed, I mean, now have in fourth quarter very strong renewals spreads, you had them in the third quarter as well. I'm wondering how much of that is a function of you guys pushing rents harder as opposed to now getting the benefit from some easier comps on renewals?", "Marc Holliday", "I don't -- I would say it's more a function of the market than anything. We've experienced relatively good growth in market rents beginning back in 2010 and continuing into '11 and received moderating a bit but positive in 2012, probably bringing us close to at least 20% over that 3-year period if not higher, if you include the tightening of the concessions that we've seen in free rents and TI. So, I think, what you're seeing primarily is sublets being taken off the market, vacancy rate that has declined by almost over 300 basis points, in equilibrium market of around 9% where we generally have competition for space that's not in same competition like it would be at 5% or 6%. But it's usually more than 1 tenant on a space that we can get. Those premium rents are very focused to try to get the rents are placed at least equal to or greater than in most cases where they will expire. It'll change from quarter-to-quarter as you may just have in normally a tenant in any given quarter may have a very high head rent and if it was signed at a peak time and it rolls onto market today. So we still have a number of tenants that are rolling down from market, are rolling down from the previous escalated to market but on average when we're leasing about a 0.5 million square feet or more per quarter, the preponderance of those are neutral to up and on average you saw they were up substantially in the fourth quarter and we'd given guidance in December at where we saw that mark-to-market for the full year 2012 and I think that guidance as I'm looking at is greater than 5% on average for the coming year. That's actually, it's very good consistent with our view but there's a lot of work to do. ", "[Audio Gap] ", "program to bring it solidly into the -- to compete with comparable Class A buildings and our rental assumptions there at the top of the building where we've unimpeded Central Park views are at premium to 600 Lexington, for sure. So, I think, locationally it's a premium and view-wise, it's a premium. It does have that same highly desirable boutique floor plate for a tenant can get a floor full identity which tenants will certainly pay premium for comparable 600 Lexington, but you have a location advantage and a big view advantage. So after the renovation we really feel this building compare with other boutique office buildings like it in the plaza district.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "Just to be clear, the 40 million does that include tenant improvements or is that separate?", "Marc Holliday", "Separate.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.", "James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Can you talk a little bit about the loan loss reserves and the", "[Audio Gap] ", "So as you think about what's to come for the rest of the year, what is the environment look like for more equity infusions", "[Audio Gap] ", "transactions that you guys were seeing from more recently like the Des Moines deal?", "Marc Holliday", "Sure. On the structure finance side, it was all New York-based deals, 3 of them were acquisition financing and one of them was a -- we acquired a senior position in a capital sect that we already hold a junior position in 5 Times Square. We continue to bring the investing environment for structured finance is very good, the yields are", "[Audio Gap] ", "historically a high level", "[Audio Gap] ", "gaps that are in our pipeline and certainly for those who don't want to expose more than property for marketing, they have tax issues or they want to stay in and continue to enjoy upside in their buildings, the recap route is a preferred route and I think, we're the first to launch those types of deals in New York, we've had so much success with them and we work successfully with so many other owners and operators as partners in New York.", "James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And then just one final follow-up, is the yield on the structured finance, is that sustainable? You think putting money the rest of that for the rest of the year?", "Marc Holliday", "Right now, the market conditions are holding, there are some new entrants to the space, we always have the risk that people start competing on yield, but for now the most recent deals that we've done are still consistent with the yields that we're making for the year, which is in the 10% or so range.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with ISI Group.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "I guess really 2 questions. One, Marc, can you talk a little bit more about this apartment deal and Stonehenge relationship and I know that your partner has relatively lofty goals in terms of expanding the size of his portfolio and I'm just wondering how you sort of think about apartments, what percentage of that business you'd like it to represent? Or what kind of opportunities you see relative to structured finance and recaps from the office side?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I think, some of it, Steve, to be determined because these initial acquisitions, I think, by the market assessment of these deals I think we've got 2 solid deals and I think our partners Stonehenge, it's a group run by Ofer Yardeni and Joel Seiden, 2 very talented professionals who have a large multifamily portfolio here in Manhattan and have successfully grown it from 0 over the years to where they are", "[Audio Gap] ", "that can be $300 million, $400 million, $500 million buildings or complexes. So I can't really give you any guidance as to investment targets, but I think, it's a fairly nice complement so far to our business where we achieved great inroads, maybe and understatement on the office front, and on the high-end retail front structured finance, I think, we're generally recognized as a market leader in this city and subordinate financing and I think, multifamily provides another avenue where we can capitalize on our relationships, on our tax advantage currency, and on our ability to take projects that don't have a lot of current return, but work on ways ourselves or with our partners to enhance NOI and improve and move rents up. So we like that business, it'll be dictated purely by profitability as we see great profitability that you'll see us do more. If the yields are below our thresholds, and we talked about our yield thresholds in the past, then I think, we'll do some but probably not a lot because we don't -- we're not looking to do low margin business, we're only looking to do business that fits into the spectrum of what we're making on our office retail and structure.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And then, I guess, second question as you think about sort of just the shifting landscape maybe away from financial services, you mentioned media and tech is taking almost 25% of the space in 2011 and perhaps those kind of tenants continuing to grow. Do you need to change kind of where the portfolio is located or types of buildings, that you own presumably a lot of these tenants don't want to be in the 50 story high-rise building on Park Avenue or Fifth Avenue or Sixth Avenue so how do you sort of think about that changing landscape given who's growing and shrinking in the city?", "Marc Holliday", "Let me just, the largest growing segment -- I want to dispel certain notions that I see, and while we're very excited about new media. The sizes tend to be small, it's made up of a lot of small companies that get moderately bigger, that's only -- not every one of these tendencies like Google and Amazon. They're a very important user, I think, for Downtown and Midtown South where there's space that's more in line with their targets in 40s, 50s and 60s and not 80s, 90s, and 100s. But the largest growing segment in New York City by far is professional business services, period. That's where 16,000 jobs were added in 2011 and that's where we see most of the growth coming. So for most media firms, Midtown is still considered not just acceptable but desired. And I think Y&R is a great example of that and the tenant that we had competing for that space, which was a multi-hundred thousand square foot tenant that was ultimately -- we didn't consummate with because we couldn't accommodate both [indiscernible] and the Y&R ideal. And Midtown is still -- sees highest rents that is most desired and we don't see many tenants in our portfolio migrating downtown. So I think, we've got kind of a developing and very healthy complementary markets for users that are looking for different types of space, at different price points throughout the city with Midtown being -- what's most in demand and achieves the highest price. We do a fair amount of lending in Midtown South. As Andrew said, we own One Madison, it's one of the premier institutional assets in Midtown South. As we said on prior conference calls we were actively looking at 1107 Broadway, which we bid for, but it went condo, so what I can tell you, one was residential but we were leading better for 1107 Broadway. We owned other assets in that market like 470 Park Avenue South, One Park Avenue, which we bought and sold, Clock tower. So it's a market we know well, I don't think it's a market that's got the highest asset appreciation potential changes we spoke to earlier, we still believe that to be the best Midtown assets with the highest rent appreciation, potential but with that said, we love that market, we're active in that market. I think that market is going to stay very tight because a lot of the inventory is being leased to tenants looking for affordable rents, but a lot of it is also being converted to residential. And you see that certainly supports to a large extent why you see such a low vacancy rate in that market. And downtown we spent probably, I don't know, a half-hour at our investor conference in December highlighting downtown our investments there in when we announced 180 Maiden. So I would sort of leave it at that but I just want to make sure that it's pretty clear when we're talking about the engine of growth in the city, it vacillates between financial services and professional business services and those are the 2 realism [ph] in the market that you will that drive the big block usage for the most part.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sheila McGrath with KBW.", "Sheila McGrath - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Given that demand that you're seeing in the market today from larger users, do you think some of the shadow development pipeline on the west side or over by Penn Station may be pushed out further into the future than previously expected?", "Marc Holliday", "While you saw Silverstein's announcement that he was going to cap off, one of its World Trade Center buildings due to lack of demand so that there is some evidence of that in the market for sure and Hudson Yards, we continue to watch carefully they signed Coach for the first building but they still need commitments for around 1.2 million square feet there in order to get that building underway. And so we're watching carefully but certainly there is demand for space that's available now and in the short term and much harder to sign up tenants for longer-term development projects.", "Sheila McGrath - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And the second question, you did outline the target goal of same-store NOI of greater than 4% in 2012. Fourth quarter was slightly negative. I was just wondering if you could discuss, if you think greater than 4% is still achievable and what would be the main drivers of that, is that occupancy pickup, rent spreads or new buildings in the mix?", "Matt DiLiberto", "It's Matt. So we targeted 3% or 4% on the cash NOI basis. Some of it had to do with what you mentioned, concessions we've seen kind of stabilizing and not so far as they were seen before, and  you'll also see the burn off of the larger concessions on a lot of leasing that we did over the last couple of years as well as straight-line of the new rents coming on board.", "Marc Holliday", "We have 3 million square feet of leasing 2 years ago, 2.4 or so last year and we targeted in the investor conference 1.7 this year. So as the portfolio continues to stabilize, portfolio continues to run along from the bottom of the market, we're going to have a growth in cash NOI that's going to exceed the cap NOI.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Knott with Greek Street Advisors.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Question for you, Marc, I know the answer to your question, but I've to ask you anyway, I happened to agree with your comments about the power market having undervalued your real estate especially during the fall when your stock got hit pretty hard, just curious again why didn't you make a move to buy back your stock during that time period because your conviction never waiver that values haven't really declined. Like the public market here and just curious why in '12 from disposition proceeds to that initiative as opposed buying private market assets at say, presumably fair market pricing?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I think it's the last piece of what you just said, is probably the barometer. We're making fortunes on the assets that we purchased predominantly in the trough to middle innings of this recovery from 2009, end of 2009 both. I mean very, very sizable levered and unlevered gains well into the double digits. You can argue around the margins whether better or not, I bought in the stock but the opportunity set as I said in December, is about as good as we sought. We see 2012 clearly as the market is heated up the buying opportunities may moderate and maybe the late inning ones weren't quite the same as the early ones. But we had an extraordinary 2-, 2.5-year run where we made investments that I think, are going to prove to be the seeds of earnings in cash flow growth or net asset value appreciation over the coming 3 years that is going to be sizable, that are going to define this period of time for the company. So it's a marginal analysis, certainly not the same as if we didn't have very attractive uses for the proceeds along the way, including the structured finance business which you see is also a double-digit business with moderate risk associated with it. So I think, that has driven our actions to a large extent. And also part of the proceeds went to paying down leverage, which we de-leveraged fairly sizably from 2008, let's say, from where we stand today as measured by debt to EBITDA or debt to assets. So those 2 metrics we felt that it was prudent to bring that -- those metrics closer to in line with the re-community because of our goal of establishing an investment grade rating with S&P and hopefully with Moody's. And while buying back the stock may have been more opportunistic at the time than deleveraging, we think the deleveraging will have a long term structural benefit to us as we are able to access the unsecured markets as alternative to secured markets at very cheap rates. So I would ask Jim if he would like to answer that in a philosophy.", "James E. Mead", "The reality is the accounting for share repurchase gives you less than half of the capacity that you would have to go out and make acquisitions off the balance sheet. So the theory is good but so long as we've alternative uses of capital there, really highly accretive and it doesn't make sense for us to look at our stock.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "And then second question, I guess, more for Steve or Marc or whoever would like to comment, but I would just be curious if you can update us on your thoughts on high-end versus maybe mid-tier versus low-end of the market. I think, you commented before that the middle of the market was faring better than the very best part of the market and maybe just weave any comments that you feel appropriate in terms of submarkets Park Avenue or Fifth or Madison versus some of the more value oriented submarkets in midtown. That would be helpful.", "James E. Mead", "I think, that's still true today that the biggest activity that's out there is kind of the mid-price points type space and you can define that in a couple of different ways. There's the kind of 30-year-old buildings that are $45 to $65, maybe even $70 price points auction of in the middle of the market and I think, that's where a lot of the activities that could be a lot of the products we've around Grand Central, Third Avenue, but even if there were newer buildings that were downtown, the better quality new buildings downtown are mid- price points and are seeing a lot of activity. When you compare them against the same kind of product, whatever it went for in Midtown. So I think, a lot of the decision-makers out there are taking a very prudent perspective with regards to the real estate. They're looking to lock in long-term leases and they're shying away from that $120 price point. But that comes in waves, I would not be surprise if the economy continues to improve the people become more bullish to see that the high price point product pick up steam later this year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Maiorana from Wells Fargo Securities.", "Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just had a question about 711 Third Avenue and maybe the marketing of that project and what you guys are going to learn due the marketing process and how that compares to what you're looking to sell in 2012 where I think expectations are around $500 million or more of dispositions for this year?", "Marc Holliday", "I think there were issues specific to that marketing process maybe the bankruptcy of a 40,000 square foot tenant during the process, and also the fact that we signed up 3 other deals at prices well ahead of our expectations and sort of very fast timing that allowed us to take a step back really work on re-tenanting that bankruptcy with a tenant liquidated, and then reevaluate the building. So the market response to the building rates, the whole activity was great and frankly the indications of value we got were compelling, but we think we can do better bringing it back under our control and getting the vacant space leased up and then bring in a more civilized building to the market eventually what we when we decide to re-market.", "Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And do you still feel like the buyers out there in terms of looking at projects with some longer-term upside are still underwriting at fairly optimistic scenarios in terms of value where it is today in relative to where they can get so couple of years?", "Marc Holliday", "Definitely. You saw the trade-off 575 Lex most recently where that building has a lot of vacancies so people are still aggressively chasing vacancy and taking optimistic use of rental growth and asset appreciation, which has continued to push values in the market.", "Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And then for Matt or Jim, I think, Marc mentioned the $85 million to $90 million of incremental EBITDA from the value add portfolio or the value add properties you guys have within the portfolio. How much of that do you think gets realized in your contemplated in 2012 guidance, how much of $85 million to $90 million incremental guidance that, how much is 2013 and beyond when you realize it?", "James E. Mead", "Actually there's a pretty good reference point for the Brendan's math. You can go to the investor conference are we actually laid out an incremental, call it, $90 million of EBITDA, was coming from notice from the stabilized years a lot of that is beyond 2012, some properties will contribute during 2012 but I think, incremental [Audio Gap] been in full way until 2013 and beyond.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.", "Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "It's Josh Attie with Michael. Just a follow-up on Steve's question on residential, would you now consider doing pure residential investments and is that a shift from the prior strategy, where it seemed to be more of a way to get the retail that you wanted? And would you also consider buying into the Stonehenge's portfolio?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I can't speak to the latter, not our portfolio and I'm not going to speak about somebody else's portfolio, but as it relates to our interest, which is pure residential, which I think you mean standalone residential, I would say absolutely. We would not have purchased the 2 apartment buildings in connection with the retail properties if we didn't think that on the merits they wanted investment that was while it was a smaller portion of the overall. It was still a recollection close to a $100 million, well over $150 million of total value that was ascribed to those property so this was not an incidental investment, if you will.", "James E. Mead", "It was 40% of the investment.", "Marc Holliday", "So I mean, it wasn't the primary objective. The primary objective was Seventh, 24th, Fifth and Morrison Avenue and 752 and 760. But nor would I characterize those apartments as I said earlier incidental I would say that we thought each component of that transaction was very attractive and if we had the opportunity to do that on a stand-alone basis I think, we would give it a very serious look. But the only thing I said earlier, I think, it was in response was simply that you now, people tend to be generational owners of rental and so they don't perceive this type of quality buildings don't trade often, but when they do, I think, we're well positioned because we have a currency that can be utilized in a way that would be very attractive to sellers and tax efficient to sellers and flexible to sellers to treat different people differently as we've done time-to-time again. I think, we've done somewhere between 8 and 10 unit deals at least over time. So it's clearly a valuable tool in our arsenal and I would say that we're certainly -- we're evaluating or will evaluate those types of opportunities going forward.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "It's Michael Bilerman speaking. How you think about your competitive advantage relative to a lot of multifamily REITs same sort of currency benefit that you do in terms of offering units but also have significant operating platform with multifamily and a lot of them have been very active in New York. How do you sort of compete with that especially when the multifamily REITs, probably, lower cost of capital and have lower return thresholds than you do?", "Marc Holliday", "Let me say 2 things, Michael, I don't -- I would disagree with you anyone has got our kind of that currency that appeals to New York owners. When you say there's a lot of other multifamily REITs that have currency that would be as attractive, I don't know of any frankly that have what is viewed as a almost completely New York centric portfolio and operating portfolio like we have at SL Green. I've said it before, I always think that it's very difficult to get people to trade their New York bricks for out of New York paper, that's just my opinion. You could differ with that, others in different with it, it's been my opinion in experience that traditionally people are hesitant and very thoughtful about when and how they're going to trade hard assets that they control for securities that they don't control, the partnership interests that they don't control. And the way in which we've gotten people over than is through track record, management team and portfolio. When you line our portfolio up compared to others, there's a mindset where typically what I've seen is now your people want a New York portfolio. I think it's less an issue of property type per se because I think people view their buying into diversified portfolio. But I know people who just aren't going to trade a midtown rental property for a group of properties located in secondary markets in the U.S.", "James E. Mead", "So it's critical factor in the Franco portfolio as well.", "Marc Holliday", "So I mean that's my opinion but that's opinion developed through my experiences and with that in particular and when you talk about New York operating platforms, I look at our operating platform and would stack it up to many other out of town REITs operating platforms and the ability to manage and local vendors and invest capital and relationships. I view that as a competitive advantage, not disadvantage. The cost of capital I can't respond to, we have excellent cost of capital certainly through the private markets and then the public markets at times when we see that market opportunity. It's there at times, not at others, that I think goes to my statement earlier about what I perceived to be a vast under assessment of private market valuation of private market investors, but again all 3 of these things are just my opinion.", "Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "What are your thoughts on the size, Times Square and the incremental investment that you made?", "Marc Holliday", "In fairness, we have a queue of others, I think, what we should do is we could pick this up off-line. As a residential, I said earlier in response to Steve I had no size parameters for targets and so I don't have any thoughts along those lines because we are driven by opportunity within this market. And I would say that the size of that opportunity will be dependent on a whole number of factors and we'll just see how it goes but we can certainly talk off-line and go through residential more but I would also just want to caution, if you went out there that in the pipeline you're looking at, it's a very small component of our pipeline and I wouldn't look to that to be a major driver of 2012 investment or results.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Louise Pitt from Goldman Sachs.", "Louise Pitt - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just a quick question on unsecured financing opportunity, the wonder if you comment, given the existing low rates and the fact that you already simplified the corporate structure with the recent bank facility. I know that rating agencies have looked for you to unencumber some additional assets, so I'm just wondering if this would be a good opportunity.", "Marc Holliday", "Look, I think that as we move through the year we're going to be doing a number of cap raising activities as we talked about, Louise, including selling potentially some additional assets, more joint venture positions. So as we, for my vernacular as he reload our balance sheet I think we'll look at all sorts of opportunities including the potential for unencumbered additional assets to creating a different kind of capacity not just the mortgage side of the financing that we've done in part over the last couple of years. So that's still the direction that we are consistently on.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Just wanted to follow-up on 5 Times Square. Curious, was the legacy investment performing or is it performing and maybe the strategy surrounding the incremental investment there?", "James E. Mead", "There were a couple of new factors there. The property was marketed and ownership decided not to sell but the property was marketed, we've -- we got some data in terms of where the market and where the bits work for the assets when it was marketed. And a piece Senior to us in the capital structure, as I said before, did become available at a price that was attractive to us so we did pick it up. That piece is -- on accrual and a prior piece, which is a pay in kind piece, has been on nonaccrual. We're currently evaluating whether it should stay on not accrual or return to accruing status based on the outcome of that marketing although the building didn't trade.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "It's helpful. What else is ahead of you besides the CMBS and the stack?", "Marc Holliday", "Just the CMBS?", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Just the CMBS.", "Marc Holliday", "I mean, the piece that we bought the senior piece was current pay, it's not a pay in kind position.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "And then separately, just more of a housekeeping item, on Pages 42 and 43 you used to have your asking rent disclosure which we found helpful over the years. Can you maybe just with that an oversight excluded or did you purposefully sort of eliminate it?", "Marc Holliday", "That was -- we couldn't put it back it was in -- it's not in. I found that there was some people who looked at it and sometimes confuse asking rent, taking rent with market rent and with other kinds. And we've got jumbled questions from time-to-time and they would point to the asking rents in a way that was inappropriately applied. It's easy for us to put in, we can put it back in, the problem is in asking rents, it's not equivalent in all cases to a taking rent. Sometimes it is, but more often is a natural negotiations that was on this market. And bear markets, the deviances could be more substantial in good markets it's relatively tied but we didn't know that -- we thought that was being misapplied in some cases and we also didn't know who would anyone really needed it trapped it, if there's a preponderance of people want to back in we can drop it back in easily in '12.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "From one man's perspective, we liked it directionally to see what you guys thought of market rents given your perspective.", "Marc Holliday", "I would agree with that. Directionally is the most useful application of that. I think, you can get directionally also from average escalated rent unsigned leases in the quarter but with that said, it's a little tough because we have different asset classes so if people.", "Matt DiLiberto", "We'll look at it -- we'll look at it later. We heard this from a couple different sources now, and we'll look at it. But again, it did cause in the last couple of quarters I'm really confused analysis from the investment communities. Now...", "Marc Holliday", "There some people who looked at it and several there's another 15%, 20%, 25% embedded market growth based on the asset rents. Now that's not really accurate and even though we like keeping that we want to be accurate and we didn't feel that was right. When I heard that comment that led me to say if that's what people are looking at this, pull it out. We can put it back in.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "The cynical view, right, not that I would be cynical, would be that somebody that you guys were pulling it out if that number were rolling over in terms of where the market rent no longer going up with the rent at it does i.e. second derivative.", "James E. Mead", "That's not what happened. That's how Steve [ph] operates the asking rents.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Gradually [indiscernible]", "Matt DiLiberto", "We actually did updated but it was up. The peak cynical...", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Do you have the number by chance?", "James E. Mead", "Jordan, it's a matter I'll call you later with that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jay Habermann with Goldman Sachs.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "If you think about ramping up the dispositions in the near term, should be think of that is as a growing appetite to actually see some acquisitions in the back half of the year, I guess, maybe Marc back to the comments you made earlier what sort of opportunities may be size of opportunities are you seeing. Are you seeing more of willingness of sellers to sell and Banks to move properties that create those opportunities?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, 10 East is a fresh brick. I think, that's within the past few weeks. That is a foreign pension fund owner, so owned the properties for a long period of time, wants to take some gain for whatever reason most, speculates has no reason if they want some liquidity at this point in time. And review there is upside potential in converting a building that hasn't had a lot of capital investment over the years into what Andrew stated earlier would be building competitive Class A buildings and that location. It\u2019s a great location. So that business for us is something we've been executing for 15 years prior to that for over 2 decades. That's not -- I don't want to -- there's nothing trend setting about it. It's another value-added opportunity that fits our profile. I hope we'll have more like that this year, no reason to expect we won't but as it relates to -- and the answer is yes, I think, we will see those from, you mentioned banks, I don't think we're going to see those from banks, because banks don't own those kind of properties. We're talking about bank-owned facilities that we're looking to shed in order to free up some capital. You may see some of that, but a lot of banks don't necessarily own this phase, there higher rents products, you may see data centers or back office properties being sold by banks to raise cash. But that I don't view as -- that's not the heart of our opportunities,  the heart of our opportunities set our owners that have owned buildings for 10, 20, 30 years that are deep in the money, that want to monetize gains and don't want to invest a lot of capital, where we see upside.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "At the Investor Day you didn't touch on your development side in Midtown, should we expect any sort of updates throughout the year uses an opportunities, I mean, maybe you're talking more about residential, when would you expect some sort of an update on that site?", "Marc Holliday", "Hard for me to speculate, not in the near-term so I can't tell you whether that's 2, 3 or 4 but it's not near-term. So certainly some time throughout the year, I guess, in the second half of the year we should have some kind of update, hopefully meaningful update for investors. I can't pinpoint it more specifically than second half of the year.", "Operator", "There are no further questions in queue at this time. I would now like to hand the conference back over to Marc Holliday for any closing remarks.", "Marc Holliday", "That's it. Want to thank everybody and look forward to speaking again in 3 months time.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to your host for today's conference, Ms. Heidi Gillette. Please proceed, ma'am.", "Heidi Gillette", "Thank you, everybody for joining us, and welcome to SL Green Realty Corp.'s First Quarter 2012 Earnings Results Conference Call. This conference call is being recorded.", "At this time, the company would like to remind listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements.

Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. Thank you, Heidi, and welcome, everyone, to our earnings call today. Thank you for joining us. Normally, our Q1 is not quite as robust as what we have presented to you today, so I'm sure we have a lot of ground we will cover, both in some prepared remarks and our Q&A. But I would just like to focus in first on 1515 Broadway transaction that we announced last night. This was certainly what I believe to be a milestone event for this company. Lease extension was one of our top overall strategic priorities and having that behind us now affords us great flexibility and opportunity going forward that we'll certainly utilize to our advantage. ", "I've heard a lot of Street commentary about eliminating overhang and derisking the rent roll, but this transaction, in my mind, has a much more profound effect than simply mitigating a future lease roll. We were completely focused on value creation and stabilization of one of our premier asset holdings throughout this transaction. Ultimately, our focus was on term, 15 years of term, not another 5- or even 10-year extension, which doesn't carry the same weight in the capital markets, but now with a 15-year extension beyond the 3 years remaining on the original lease. This asset, in our minds now, moves into elite core status in Manhattan and with an $80 million near-term NOI and applying a 5% cap rate, which I would believe to be conservative in this market, the result would be an asset value worth approximately $1.6 billion based on just those metrics. But that's only half the story as this now extremely valuable office tower sits on top of an extraordinary retail pedestal, which will provide for future rental growth and signage opportunities to further drive NOI.", "I want to thank Viacom's leadership for having the confidence in us to make this additional 15-year commitment. And I especially want to thank our team that worked literally and exactly 24/7 during a very compressed period of time to structure, negotiate and finalize a very large and complicated lease transaction. In fact, over 25 SL Green professionals covering every discipline of this firm were dedicated to this project over the last few weeks 100% of the time. I'd say without hesitation that the completion of this transaction was the proudest moment during my 14-year tenure at this company. ", "But not to be overshadowed by the Viacom deal, I would also like to highlight the Random House lease renewal, which unto itself, tips the scales as one of the largest lease transactions in New York City in the past 6 months. The deal with Random House was truly one of those win-win situations, whereby Random House will be able to rightsize their space needs and achieve densification while remaining in their world-class headquarter building at 1745 Broadway. For us, the lease extension allowed us to put away for term the base of the building while maintaining the opportunity to lease the upper half of the building in 2018 and achieve the then market rents. I have some more commentary later on before Q&A, but right now, let me just turn it over to Andrew.", "Andrew W. Mathias", "Thanks, Marc. On the investment sales side, I would characterize the Midtown Manhattan market right now as a standoff between buyers and sellers, where there's tons of capital interested in looking for deals and sellers whose expectations are high, given their view that higher rents and tightening cap rates are on the horizon. That dynamic is contributing to a slow quarter of activity for core Midtown property. However, consistent with the leasing market, which is very hot in the Midtown South and Soho areas, we've seen a big pickup in sales activity in those areas, including our own sales of 141 Fifth Avenue and 379 West Broadway, which we announced yesterday at a sub-5% cap rate in each case. Also of note, 148 Lafayette, a building with no real retail, traded for about $850 a foot. That's on Lafayette, just a block north of Canal, not an area known for premium per-foot valuations. So there's a lot of investor interest in Midtown South and these surrounding areas corresponding with a tightening vacancy and a lot of leasing activity. ", "In terms of our structured finance business, we continue to be very active, with net originations of around $70.5 million in the quarter at an average rate of 8.7%, which is skewed somewhat because the largest origination of the quarter was a first abridged first mortgage position, which obviously doesn't carry a mezzanine-type rate. We anticipate selling an A note in that mortgage position as we've done in other mortgage positions, and being left with a retained yield in the low teens, which is more consistent with our targets for the program. We continue to see good opportunities on the structured finance side. Although more capital is coming into that space and competing with us, we're relying on our superior origination teams to continue sourcing good product. And I would say our pipeline for the second quarter is looking very strong right now in the structured finance business. ", "And then on the financing side, our big activity in the quarter was closing the 1515 financing, which actually predated their lease with Viacom, although we've built in certain pre-approvals that gave us flexibility to do a lease like the one we did with Viacom. This was a major balance sheet deal by Bank of China, who's been our strongest lending partner over the past 24 to 36 months. A 7-year term deal on this asset, giving us great prepayment flexibility, the ability to swap or keep it as a LIBOR floater and a lot of other unique features that a balance sheet lender brings to the table. So we thank again, Bank of China, for their confidence in us, and we appreciate the relationship and the amount of business we've been able to do with them. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jim.", "James E. Mead", "Thanks, Andrew. We've been reporting over the last number of quarters a large volume of ads that we've taken advantage of, really unique market circumstance. And we've also said in the past that we have access to liquidity that few other companies do. And this quarter was no different as we, in the face of all that investment activity, we ended the quarter and today are sitting with more than $1 billion of immediately available funds. And again, this is demonstrating that access came in a number of ways. During the quarter we had over $1.1 billion of mortgage executions to partially finance our acquisition activity. And that included the $775 million mortgage that, on 1515 Broadway, that Andrew just mentioned. We also supplemented that with about $650 million of asset sales that included 292 Madison, retail condos at 141 Fifth and the in-contract sales of 379 West Broadway in One Court Square. And we finally and, I'll say, prudently tapped the common equity market through our ATM and DRIP programs for about $280 million. Using those programs, we achieved an average selling price of $77 a share in comparison to our volume-weighted average price during the quarter of about $75, so we executed a sales price about 3% above the volume-weighted average price for the quarter, which is a good metric to use as an example of the success we've had and, I'll say also, with very little offering expenses. So the way we've entered the equity market, I think, has been very intelligent and also very efficient for our shareholders.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Matt for some comments.", "Matt DiLiberto", "Thanks, Jim. While our earnings results have seemed to fail in comparison to the other news we put out over the last 24 hours, there are a couple of meaningful things to take away from the very solid results we posted for many expected to be a ho-hum first quarter. Overall, our results were in-line with or slightly ahead of our expectations. Most notably our same-store portfolio, which grew by 7 properties in the first quarter, posted strong cash NOI growth year-over-year of 6.2%. The substantial improvement in this metric, which excluded  accounting noise of straight-line rents and FAS 141 adjustments, continues to be due in large part to our leasing efforts, which have driven occupancy increases in the same-store portfolio for 6 quarters in a row. 100 Church Street now stands at nearly 82% occupancy. We have increased occupancy at core holdings like Tower 45 and 1350 Avenue of the Americas. Along with leasing, containment of our variable operating costs continues to be a focus of our property management teams and only serves to enhance the portfolio's performance. Of note, these positive same-store results also come in spite of the inclusion of 125 Park in the same-store pool during the first quarter. Recall that we acquired this property in 2010 with the expectation that the 143,000 square feet occupied by Meredith will be vacated at the end of 2011. Their leaving took the occupancy of the property down to 70% from 94%. While we were able to temporarily fill some of this vacant space with employees from Y&R as they await their move to 3 Columbus, this did not offset all the lost Meredith income in the first quarter. We also saw continued income expansion in our debt and preferred equity portfolio. With opportunities for new investments continuing to present themselves, our portfolio has now grown to just under $1 billion on a book basis, with a very healthy average yield of around 9.7%, up from just over 8.25% at December 31.", "Finally, significant onetimers were virtually nonexistent in the first quarter. Within other income along with the recurring income generated from third-party management fees, leasing commissions and lease cancellation income, we recognized approximately $2 million and other ancillary fees. With regard to our 2012 guidance, our activity in the -- just the first 4 months of 2012 has been brisk, including new investment activity, the issuance of $280 million of common equity, the refinancing of 1515 Broadway and an incredible amount of leasing. Taken as a whole, with the strong performance of our core portfolio, we are raising our FFO guidance range from $4.45 to $4.55 per share to $4.50 to $4.60 per share for 2012.", "Turning to FAD. Among the other activity we need to take into consideration, some of the capital we have committed for the Viacom deal, all of which is considered second-generation capital, which was obviously not contemplated in our original guidance. As such, we are revising our FAD guidance from $2.70 to $2.80 per share to $2.50 to $2.60 per share. Given the magnitude and importance of this lease, this is some of the best capital the company will put to work in 2012. With that, I'll turn it back over to Marc.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. Thanks. A few final comments, then we'll open it up to Q&A. First, as to the overall health of the New York City economy and leasing market, I would say that things from our perspective seem to be relatively on track and consistent with our expectations and our communications to the market back in December. Job growth continues to occur in areas like professional services, media, information and technology. And those jobs are offset in part, but not completely, by continuing the very modest job losses in the finance sector. This market backdrop enabled us to achieve our goals for Q1 as it related to increases in occupancy and mark-to-market rental increases on rollover. Furthermore, as it relates to where our balance sheet stands, you heard Jim talk about our equity funding program that we've been executing throughout much or all of 2011 and 2012. Combined with our asset sale program, which has allowed us to maintain a debt-to-total asset level of around 45%, which has been fairly consistent, and while debt to EBITDA is hovering somewhere in the 8.5x range, that is before factoring in approximately $1 per share of FFO, that we are projecting to realize from our transitional and recently acquired vacancy, which realization we expect to occur largely over the balance of this year, '13 and '14 and with order being realized by 2015. Notably, very proud of the fact that our current outstanding on the line of credit is $200 million and we pro forma that to be 0 throughout -- as we progress into the year. I think that is another notable milestone, if you will, one that we always believed and felt was completely manageable, outstanding and I think we did a very good job of over the past several years in chipping away strategically through asset sales, equity raises, term financings and strategically, but prudently, reducing that line of credit to pro forma 0 by the end of this year. And likely before, and I guess, to top everything off, to be doing all this activity, which is in our mind storing these chestnuts for future growth that will be realized largely in the future years and doing a significant amount of equitizing both through asset sales and equity raising, to be able to sit here today and raise our FFO guidance in light of all that, I think, is just a testament to the great work of all the employees of this firm. And we hope our shareholders are as excited about that as we are. So with that, I'd like to wrap this up and open up the phone now for some questions and answers.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "On the Viacom deal, was there something that sort of prompted the whole -- the rush to get it done now given that, I think, the lease was through 2015? Was it the fear of them being courted by a developer to build -- whether Hudson Yards or something like that, where they might relocate? Or what sort of drove the rush to get it done right now?", "Marc Holliday", "Yes. I wouldn't use terms like fear and rush. I would say that it was just time. With a firm like Viacom, this was a very deliberate decision on their part. I think they had been evaluating their options for well over a year, if not years. But I think, they're the type of firm who has a little bit of cultural similarity to us. When your valuation's done and the decision is made, there's no reason to belabor extensive time-consuming negotiations and wasted resources. They knew what they wanted. We knew what we needed. And we've had a 10-year relationship with this firm at the highest levels, and we were able to, I would say, quickly and efficiently knock out a deal, which, I think, I would hope you would agree, is somewhat consistent with our pedigree. And I think Viacom, being a leading company in the media sector, as well as terrific M&A shop, and as well as with very deep financial capabilities, I just think you have 2 firms who don't believe in dragging out what's inevitable once the decision is made to move forward. So fear and rush I think is a little bit of a misnomer, I would just say, it was time to get it done and now it's time for each firm to kind of get on to other things because we each have big agendas.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "And then second question is, on the leasing front, just speaking to brokers hearing about like, let's say, Microsoft sort of looking in Midtown, as you guys see the tech and social media boom, especially emanating from Midtown South, are you seeing those tenants seriously consider expanding or relocating into Midtown? Or is your sense that most of those people are sort of just using the Midtown look around to try and retrade to get a deal in Midtown South or Chelsea or one of those submarkets?", "James E. Mead", "Well, you got to remember that the Midtown South-Chelsea market is actually a pretty small market, so there's no choice but those industries are only going to be able to find good space alternatives in Midtown, as much as we'd all like to have more product in Midtown South. Cool neighborhood, but it's too small to handle a very small industry.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Just kind of some back-of-the envelope numbers, which I'm sure are very rough and very incorrect on Viacom: 1.75 million square-foot building, $80 -- $80 million of NOI, I think you mentioned is about $45 or $46 net. You come up with a value of $1.6 billion, $900 a foot. Can you give a little more color in terms of what the rental rates are on the office side of the equation? What the rental rates are in the retail side of the equation and how you come up with $80 million of NOI, kind of peel back the onion more out of curiosity than anything else?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I don't know that we can componentize the entire $80 million on the phone. Although we are going to be putting up a little bit of a what I think what is called a microsite after this call, which is going to show quite exactly the NOI growth of this project from, I think, an inception of $35 million to $40 million when acquired in 2002, which we have doubled to, I think, what is $78 million for 2012. And we have some further bumps and escalation projected on to the future with that $80 million number that  I quoted you earlier being at stabilization as opposed to today because there's still some more bumps and other movement that'll get that 78 point something, up to 80% or more. But with that said, I encourage everyone -- at the end Heidi will give some guidance as to how people can access that microsite and when it will be available but certainly later today. As it relates to, which I quote, the mystery of the economics, we'll try and demystify this in very simple and basic terms. The rent, the total annual rent at Viacom we'll be paying is roughly equivalent or very, very similar to what they're currently paying today with $5 bumps out into $5 bumps every 5 years during their extension term. So that is roughly the economics of the office tower. The balance is from retail, and Andrew can shed a little more detail on the retail than I can.", "Andrew W. Mathias", "In terms of componentizing, I'm not sure how much aggregate NOI comes from the retail but we do -- the retailers -- the AIG Best Buy Theater, the Minskoff/Nederlander Theater, where the Lion King is running, the A\u00e9ropostale flagship store. Viacom did renew their studio commitment for the 15 years through 2031 as part of the broader lease discussion. And then we have 3 stores, Billabong, Element and Oakley. Oakley has long-term lease. Billabong and Element are near term expirations. So there is some additional retail upside in the asset. And asset retail is a significant contributor to that NOI.", "John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then a second question, Steve, can you drill down a little bit and talk about, besides all the activity in Midtown South, talk a little bit about which submarkets might be lagging and also talk about which price points are doing better than others. For example, as a big deal done at 1 New York Plaza was a low 40s, full-service price point. It sounds to me like Viacom was done in the mid-50s, so at just what price points are doing well and drill down some of the other submarkets besides the obvious ones.", "Steven M. Durels", "Well, what we're seeing across the portfolio is there's a lot of demand for kind of the classic value type of price points. That $45 to $65 pricing seems to be where a lot of deals are being transacted. We're seeing it in some of our buildings where there's Third Avenue or 485 Lexington or 521 Fifth, where we have pockets of space. The downtown stats, quite frankly, have been surprisingly good even though there have been some big deals done down there with moderate rents. But as far as the overall availability rates, it's a lot healthier than anybody would have projected a couple of years ago. Midtown South is as tight as a drum and Midtown, I think it's not so much the submarket, it's more the certain size ranges seem to be slower than other size ranges, kind of that 25,000-to-45,000-square-foot-type tenant seems to be slow demand right now. But counter that with sort of the small spaces, 5,000, 6,000 square-foot spaces, if it's nicely built, that stuff seems to be in very high demand. We're seeing at 600 Lexington Avenue continued very strong demand, probably the most activity that we've seen since we've owned the building. We've got 5 deals pending there right now, and we've got a bunch of pull-forward deals of this year. So I think it's very hard to say which of the submarkets is necessarily slow until you understand the size ranges that are slower, and that's not so much the area but more about specific sizes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sheila McGrath with KBW.", "Sheila McGrath - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Now that you have the renewal metrics of Viacom and the capital required to get the tenant to renew, I was just wondering if you could walk us through how you view your pricing of your purchase of the 45% interest a year ago.", "Marc Holliday", "Well, the pricing, I believe, was about $1.2 billion. I mentioned earlier in the call where I thought NOI is or is soon to be ramping. And while I can't give you an exact value on how somebody would value that, you can apply whatever cap rates you want to that very stable NOI stream, and I think in most or all cases, you're going to come to a conclusion that it we're very pleased with the acquisition but, again, in fairness, it's a little bit of hindsight because when we purchased it, we uniquely took on the risk or opportunity, depending on your orientation in life, of having to make this critical lease deal or make the critical decision not to lease and then have to lease up in 2015, '16, '17. So that's not a -- it's not a small risk by any means or not a small opportunity. And I think the price a year ago or a year or more ago in a different market at a different time with that question unanswered versus what we believe the value to be today is obviously a little apples and oranges. But the question is, are we pleased with the overall performance of the building and both our original acquisition and our subsequent acquisition? And for that matter, our entire JV with SITQ has been a terrific partner of ours for probably a decade or so. This building, I think, is textbook case study, if you will, in value creation and good real estate execution.", "Royal Shepard - S&P Equity Research", "And my second question is on The Journal reported a number of tenants, Dewey Stockton [ph] and UBS, looking at putting sublease space on the market. I'm just wondering what your views of the trends in the sublease market are.", "Steven M. Durels", "The sublease availability is still pretty small right now. It's less than 3% of the availability rate overall. Those blocks that you're referring to, they were like $100,000 square feet a pop. So in the context of the overall supply, it's not that meaningful. We haven't seen a whole lot of new supply coming on and in conversing with brokers community, it's -- they're hard-pressed to really identify big blocks that are coming on. Doesn't mean it won't happen, but none that we've been able to identify to date.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.", "Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research", "Steve, can you talk a little bit about what the latest is on 280 Park and what your leasing strategy is there and what the sort of timing looks like these days?", "Steven M. Durels", "We're deep in the development phase right now. We've completed the -- establishing our full scope of our developments. I think we're going to do a little bit of a presentation at NAREIT to really unveil it to everybody. But it it's going to be, and you've heard us said in the past, it is going to be transformative as far as what we're going to accomplish with the building. It's going to be unlike anything that's on Park Avenue right now. We're kind of lightly marketing it. It's a little premature until we get heavier into the construction phase, but shed and bridge went off this week. We're starting to work shortly on the fa\u00e7ade restoration. The heavy construction will start shortly thereafter. It'll be a 1.5-year project. Notwithstanding, the light marketing effort, I can tell you we've had a couple of very, very credible, significant expressions of interest from big tenants on the order of magnitude of 0.25 million square feet each. And we're conversing with those tenants. We're not suggesting that we're going to make a deal anytime soon because we think it's a little early in the market relative to our pricing expectations and what we have to present so far, but it's -- we're very excited about it and everybody that we have presented our development plan to have very quickly endorsed our thoughts.", "Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then, can you guys also give us an update as to the newer retail assets that you guys have acquired and some of the assemblage that you need to do and tenanting and repositioning, where you are in the process there and how talks with potential tenants are going there?", "Marc Holliday", "Sure. 1552, 1560 as part of the purchase, we did give the selling tenant a year's occupancy there. So they are still in occupancy. That's TGI Friday's in Times Square, but we're actively marketing the site to a wide universe of interested retail, signage, and retail and signage tenants. Not clear how we're going to divide up the space, whether it will be one user or whether it will be multiple users for each of the different components, and those talks are going very well. I mean, there's a lot of interest in Times Square. There's not a lot of availability. And our product is very unique in terms of what we offer guys. Likewise, on 747 Madison, we've actually completed the series of transactions so that we can modify and offer higher ceiling height space within the box that we bought. One of the challenges was that a portion of the space was a bit ceiling-height challenged. We made a deal to buy out one of the apartments of the building above. We're going to be basically demolishing that apartment and offering it at higher ceiling height on the retail. We think that will be a hugely accretive purchase and one that we didn't underwrite when we bought the -- when we bought the condos. So we have ongoing discussion with several tenants on that space as well, so very strong in terms of the discussions and demand on the retail side.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Feldman with Bank of America.", "James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I know there's a lot of discussion among the brokerage community that if Viacom had moved, it would really change your landscape of Times Square, that they're certainly looking downtown and even some of the developments on the West Side. I'm just curious, do you have a sense of why they did decide to stay beyond just the economic decision? And what is it about that area? And do you think this is a sign that maybe the pendulum will shift and you'll see more interest in Times Square?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I think, we'd probably just be parroting some of the comments made by their CEO, Philippe Dauman, yesterday. But I think he views certainly a very strong connection to Times Square, where they've resided for over 20 years and have experienced almost unprecedented success for -- in becoming one of the world's leading media companies in that location. So I think created a certain bond and a certain recognition about corporate branding opportunities and corporate visibility and connection to Times Square and a connection to an area of town that is considered by many entertainment companies, not just Viacom, but Good Morning, America across the street. ESPN Zone was filming there for many years. And I think there's a recognition that it's just a -- it's an extraordinary opportunity now more than ever for them with signage, building-naming rights, LED signage cantilevering over Times Square. Their studio -- state-of-the art digital studio that was just rebuilt within the past few years, along with terraces overlooking Times Square. I mean, these are all major, major factors in addition to the building itself, which is in excess of 54 stories, 35,000 square-foot efficient floor plate center core, great lighting there on four sides. I mean, there was a lot to like there. I think the only thing I sensed they were considering was price in other areas. There were never an issue, I don't think, of location or building or anything like that and transportation to this area of town, subways, buses. It's -- you can point to other areas that are developing those kinds of transportation hubs, but nothing matches what's available like the bow tie of Times Square. I think that's a lot of what went into with but you'd have to get to them to get more specific on that point.", "James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And then back to the Midtown South kind of spillover question, what pockets of Midtown do you -- are you seeing benefits?", "Marc Holliday", "Pockets of Midtown?", "James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "What I mean in the submarkets within Midtown, where you're seeing the most interest from the tech or media tenants that would otherwise be in Midtown South but there's not enough space. Is it the Garment District? Is it around Grand Central?", "Steven M. Durels", "I don't think they're -- yes, I haven't seen them really coalesce around any one particular submarket.", "Marc Holliday", "Facebook is at 335 Madison. They would -- they certainly would have been a Midtown South tenant. Amazon is expanding aggressively in 1356 Avenue, our building.", "Steven M. Durels", "Yes, I mean, a perfect example is that 3 Columbus Circle, oddly enough, we leased it to Y&R, but the other competing tenant for that was Havas, so both creative advertising firms. We've had a couple of name-brand tech firms come very close to choosing the building, and we've had a couple of more funkier-type users, nontraditional type users consider the building as well. And in each case, those tenants have looked at that building relative to the Hudson Square, Midtown South, Flatiron neighborhoods. The tenants weren't coming from the more traditional kind of East-West across 57th Street, financial service, law-firm-type stuff. So I think to Andrew's point, it becomes very building specific. If it's something that the building has amenities that are unique or views that are unique or space that offers something where they can really create an environment for themselves, then that's where we're still seeing that kind of demand. And it will be great to see another neighborhood develop, but I don't know that that's happening.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Marc or Andrew, just curious if now that you've secured that and made it a elite core asset or whatever the terminology was you used, do you have any interest in potentially re-JV-ing  that asset again to sort of harvest some of that -- those gains?", "Marc Holliday", "We haven't decided yet. I mean, the ink is just drying on the lease. And it certainly sets up very well for a core JV, but it's also -- there's a lot of retail upside left in the building and that was part of what attracted us to make the buyout we did with SITQ. And that upside is yet to be realized. That's in the coming year. So we'll we look at it carefully. I mean, we've put the financing away for seven years, but it is floating rate so it gives us all the flexibility of a floating rate loan and the idea is to have -- to be able to unencumber it, encumber it. As a JV partner, ultimately, as sees fit, we wanted maximum flexibility with respect to the outside. I think that's the position we're in today.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "And then on the Random House lease site, I think they renewed for, call it, a little over half of their current space. Is that their permanent space going forward and so the other 40%, 45% is going to be on the market in a few years, is that right?", "Steven M. Durels", "They've -- they leased floors 2 through 13. So they took the more challenged portion of the building. That leaves us the Tower of the building, which it steps back a little bit a few floors up to some smaller floor plates with really spectacular views. They've already started to re-stack their occupancy and the balance of that space, they're going to go ahead and sublease that. They've already respect 3 floors -- 4 floors. They have another sublease pending with the 4th floor. We view those tenants as very good candidates for us to renew them in '18 at what will then be, we think, significantly higher rents than in today's world, and particularly given the fact that it's for the best part of the building.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "They took the low floors at $75 a foot, if I read supplemental right.", "Steven M. Durels", "Right.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Any guess on the upper floors today?", "Steven M. Durels", "Well, there's $75 on an essentially as-is deal with no free rent. So that's a pretty strong net effective rate. And I think the Tower is going to trade at a significant premium to that.", "Marc Holliday", "The Tower has some pretty spectacular views in that building.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo.", "Blaine Heck - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Excluding the Random House lease, what was the releasing spread you guys saw this quarter in Manhattan?", "Marc Holliday", "1%.", "Blaine Heck - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "1%. Okay. And then if I take a look at your consolidated same-store schedule in the supplemental, when I compare this quarter to last quarter, there seems to have been a significant move in the straight line revenue adjustments. I know you guys said there were 7 properties that moved into that, but was there any -- anything specific that drove that shift?", "Matt DiLiberto", "Yes. It's Matt, Blaine. It's 2 Herald Square and 885 Third. Those are our 2 fee deals, remember they had large straight line components, those were both added to the same-store pool this quarter. They were excluded after we had to buy out the 45% we didn't own in December 2010. So those are 2 of the 7 and the biggest driver of a straight line adjustment.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Attie with Citibank.", "Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "What are your thoughts on the potential rezoning of Park Avenue that the Bloomberg administration has been pushing for? Do you think it's likely to occur? And how do you think it impacts the portfolio and the company in general?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I think it's a little early to talk about impact until -- unless and until we have a better sense of what might occur under this current administration there. They are certainly seem to be going through the motions of looking at certain upzoning and/or bonusable activities to spur some additional development in Midtown. I don't think it's limited to Park Avenue. And I think they're looking at a broader area of Midtown. But what ultimately comes of that, if it comes, when it comes, we'll have to see. But I think the basic fundamental underlying the exercise is a good one, which is, let's figure out ways to encourage and incentivize development in the areas of New York that have generally the highest rents and can economically support new development as an alternative to some of the other areas designated for development around the city, which rely on some element of subsidy to permit, if you will, below market rents for new construction, because the one constant that doesn't change from site to site generally is construction costs. That's somewhat of a constant. And Midtown and the prime areas of Midtown could support some new construction now or clearly in the future with some more rental growth and I think making sure that the city stays as competitive as possible, not just within the U.S. but around the world where other major world capitals are adding state-of-the-art new buildings to their commercial inventories. New York needs to keep pace with that. It's not a function necessarily of needing more space per se, because right now we seem to be at an equilibrium. We may in the future, but right now, we seem to be at an equilibrium, but it's just I think a natural objective to take, in some cases, older antiquated office inventory and convert it to state-of-the-art, brand-new office inventory and any kind of policies directed in that area we think are sound.", "Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "[indiscernible] One quick follow-up on the Viacom, you talk a little bit about the signage and plazas and LED lighting and naming at the top of the building, is there any freed up opportunity for you to add and earn more income either by putting more signage or is that all effectively on Viacom and that's all embedded in their lease in terms of renewing at market or at their current rents?", "Marc Holliday", "This has been Andrew's baby from the outset with the sort of enhancing and maximizing these signage opportunities both in terms of what we've done and what we hope to do, so why don't you...", "Andrew W. Mathias", "On the 2 existing LED signs on the building, which are -- we added and lit up last year, those signs we entered into a partnership with Viacom on, so we'll enjoy a 50-50 ownership of those signs with Viacom. In terms of additional signage opportunities on the building, we retain the rights to those beyond the corporate branding that we committed to Viacom as part of the lease renewal. So there may be additional future signage opportunities at the building and we'll continue to explore those.", "Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And effectively they get the signage at the top of the building but you retain everything else?", "Andrew W. Mathias", "They get certain corporate signage that was committed to specifically in the lease, but not the top of the building.", "Steven M. Durels", "The elements that they got would not have been practical to think that we could have developed them independent of Viacom because of the replacement and proximity to their window lines. So really everything else on the fa\u00e7ade is open for exploration.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "First and foremost, mea culpa. I was one of the ones that characterized the renewals as derisking, I guess. So...", "Marc Holliday", "Well, like I said, it's just a matter of perspective. It's not a wrong -- it's not a wrong point of view, just a different one.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Sure. The question I had is on 1515, did you mention the TI on the deal?", "Marc Holliday", "I don't know if we did or didn't, but, again, we certainly can. It's -- we had been modeling prior to this a 10-year renewal with TIs in the kind of $35 to $40 range. When the deal went to 15 years, we grossed that up pro rata and wound up at sort of a $55 TI, which is, our view, below to -- far below what a replacement tenant coming in without all the embedded infrastructure would naturally command in a market as opposed to a tenant like Viacom that still can utilize much of its infrastructure.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then on that lease, and I guess on Random House, I'm just curious on commencement. Did those new leases -- I guess more so on Random House given the uptick, does that new rate commence in 2020 from a cash flow perspective or from a GAAP perspective, rather? 2018.", "Marc Holliday", "Random House in 2018, yes. They and Viacom will pay their contractual rents through their existing lease maturities and then the new rates will kick in.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, and the structured finance pipeline, Andrew, you characterized it going into the second quarter as strong. I'm just curious given sort of the success in the capital markets continued sort of competition from lenders, I guess not as many mezz lenders, what do you see in -- and given the standoff you mentioned between buyers and sellers, what's causing it to be so strong?", "Andrew W. Mathias", "I think that standoff is leading a lot of guys to refinance as opposed to sell, and there is still sales activity out there and when it's properties that require real estate knowledge and expertise and they're not heavily leased and strongly cash flowing, we're oftentimes finding that gap in the capital structure between, call it, 50% and 70% and filling it with mezz or preferred equity.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "One more quick one in Random House. What was the impetus for the early renewal? 2018 was the expiration, did they come to you?", "Steven M. Durels", "It started off probably 1.5 years ago in early discussions. And we danced around a bit, but I think they came to conclusion that they wanted to restack and both sides, viewed it as a perfect opportunity to extend the lease as a result of that.", "Marc Holliday", "They wanted to spend capital as part of restacking and didn't -- really wanted some additional term in order to amortize that capital over a longer period.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Just one quick clarification question. The mark-to-market for the quarter, excluding Random House, you said it's 1%, is that correct?", "Marc Holliday", "Yes. Unsigned, yes.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Unsigned. So what's the mark-to-market on the Random House piece then?", "Marc Holliday", "It's just under 50%.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And then the second question is, I know it's not a big part of your portfolio, but just can you talk a little about the Suburban portfolio and just opportunities within that either to sell assets or just to improve overall rent growth out of that portfolio?", "Marc Holliday", "There's still a pretty much of an overhang in that market. There's a lot of space that's available. I'd say the Stamford and Westchester markets are about 20% to 25% vacant. There's really no activity on the sales side. We continue to hold our own in a pretty challenging market, where our occupancy actually ticked up a bit to about 86.4%. So in terms of the ability to do sale, there doesn't seem to be a rather robust market there for both buyers and/or sellers.", "Marc Holliday", "Right. Listen, people on the call who remain, unfortunately, we have a truncated call today. We intended to finish right now at 3:00. We have, as you can imagine, given things that are going ,on, we have a fairly substantial afternoon as it relates to some other things we continue to work on in rolling out this Viacom announcement. But we appreciate your questions today. We appreciate your continued support. We look forward to speaking with you again in 3 months' time. And one other thing I mentioned earlier, this microsite. It is live, I am told by Heidi. It is on our SL Green homepage, which I trust all of you know how to get to and it is...", "Heidi Gillette", "It's the 1515 logo towards the bottom of the page. You can click on that then it'll take you to the microsite.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. So anyways, just a little -- some information and pictures and a little bit of chest thumping, chest more than anything else, on what we consider to be one of our profile achievements. So thank you, and we look forward to speaking with you soon. Operator?", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Lacy and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today, Heidi Gillette. Please proceed.", "Heidi Gillette", "Good afternoon, everyone. At this time, the company would like to remind listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from the forward-looking statements that management may make today. Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the company's Form 10-K and other reports filed by the company with the SEC.

Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Marc.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. Thank you, good afternoon, and happy you're joining us today. I know that many of you have full calendars so we will keep our remarks brief and give everyone an opportunity to ask several questions with the goal of trying to be done by about 3 before we start to lose some of you folks.", "Our results for the second quarter, combined with a series of press releases this week, puts a capstone on a very successful and active first half of the year. There were a number of significant achievements for which we are very proud to have executed during the first half, notwithstanding the current market environment, which can best be described as neutral.", "These achievements include the recapitalization of 717 Fifth, major retail leases to Express and Sam Ash, completion of the sales of One Court and 379 West Broadway, the acquisition of 10 East 53rd Street and 304 Park Avenue South and major lease renewals with Viacom, Random House and the City of New York and 770 -- $775 million refinancing over 1515 Broadway.", "So there's obviously a lot there in a pretty compressed period of time and these major transactions keep us on plan to meet or exceed our goals for 2012.", "However, it is harder to read the tea leaves for the remainder of the year. There are mixed signals in the market that make it difficult for us to assess the level of activity for the remainder of 2012. Leasing momentum, which was very good in 2010 and '11, seems to be modestly decelerating, albeit, there are still a number of deals in the market that are getting done. There is more competition from landlords on newer projects in secondary locations, which is serving to restrain for now any further material growth in nominal or net effective rents, and this will probably remain the case for the balance of the year.", "Keep in mind that we are right in the middle of summer, which is traditionally a slow time of year for us and for the leasing market, generally. And we've also heard from a number of our tenants that they are keeping a watchful eye and a cautious approach on the upcoming election, which many see as pivotal towards their future leasing and growth activities.", "On the other hand, there are several measurable indicators that give us the confidence there exists pent-up demand that should reappear in the market when the confidence factor is higher, including growth in private sector jobs of nearly 70,000 employees, that's year-to-date, with half of those jobs, or 35,000 jobs, being created in the office-using sector.", "Furthermore, Wall Street profits projected by the city to be $10 billion for the year is tracking well ahead of this position with over $10 billion earned in just the first 6 months of the year. So you can see that this more positive jobs and earnings, financial sector earnings data, is somewhat inconsistent with what we're hearing from tenants who seem to be -- have taken a more cautious approach right now. And I think this will remain the case certainly for the next several months until we clear the election.", "When you get past some of these macro market measures and you drill down into our portfolio, what's interesting to note is that we have nearly 50 office leases that are either out for signature or in advanced stages of negotiation in excess of 480,000 square feet. Within that segment, I would put a very high probability of completion on those deals. Then on top of that, there is another 35 transactions that we believe will convert into leases, although not quite as high probability of level, and the square footage encompassed by those discussions or advanced discussions is about 680,000 square feet. So I certainly believe we are on track to meet our goals and objectives for 2012 with respect to occupancy levels, mark-to-market and same-store NOI increases.", "We are also emboldened about the future prospects given the large incremental revenues, we expect to create by redeveloping, repositioning in leasing the recently acquired value-add properties, which is expected to contribute about $1 per share of FFO whether or not the mark-to-market in rents is slightly higher or lower in where we stand today. While these incremental revenues were projected to phase in between now and 2015, we are already starting to see the positive effects of leasing up these embedded growth properties and expect those results to accelerate into 2013.", "I'm also very pleased with how we financed and capitalized these value-add properties over the last couple of years, notwithstanding the substantial upside in that portfolio and the capital we had to expend to take those into inventory. We've also substantially equitized other assets along the way such that we have stockpiled enormous liquidity and we carry a line balance at quarter end of just $80 million, which is the lowest it's been in about 6 years. We have also consummated a series of refinancings that is sequentially reducing our long-term cost of capital, while also lengthening out the duration of our liabilities. And Jim and Matt will go into those items and measures a little bit later.", "But at this point, I'd like to turn the mic over to Andrew Mathias, who will provide an overview of the Manhattan property markets.", "Andrew W. Mathias", "Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. The second quarter was another extremely active quarter for us as we worked hard to accomplish many of our key objectives.", "In the broader market, deals continue to get done outside of the traditional auction process. Sellers are perfectly content to patiently wait until their expectations are met, as happened in the sale of 575 Lexington, 1372 Broadway, 386 Park Avenue South and 666 Fifth Retail during this quarter. We don't expect much change to this dynamic until the fall, when several large offerings are teed up.", "In the meantime, as promised, we closed on our sale of One Court Square in Long Island City, reducing our footprint out of Manhattan and reducing our tenancy with Citigroup in successful fashion. Look for us to roll out an additional property or 2 in the second half, now that 1 quarter is off our plate and market conditions like this, with record lower rates, lack of supply and aggressive buyers generally signaling to us a time to realize embedded gains and harvest assets.", "We are changing our stance slightly to be net sellers in the second half of the year as we project out our disposition activity and look at the acquisition activity that we achieved in the initial 6 months of the year.", "In our own portfolio, we had a couple of crowning achievement type accomplishments in the retail program that deserve top billing. Our lease with Express in Times Square at 1552 Broadway and our recapitalization of our investment in 717 Fifth Avenue. We closed the Express flagship deal on the heels of gaining city approvals for our ground-breaking development plan for the building and signage at the site. This 15-year lease ensures an extraordinary return on our investment, which we expect to reach north of 10% on an unlevered cash on cost basis, once again, demonstrating our value-add strategy and its superior returns.", "High kudos to our entire team with particular mention to Brett Herschenfeld, Bob DeWitt and his construction team and Neil Kessner and his legal team for threading the needle on this execution.", "At 717 Fifth, on the heels of our record-breaking lease with Dolce & Gabbana, we were able to recapitalize our interest there, bringing in new long-term debt and selling a portion of our interests, leaving us with a 10% stake, we felt it was more appropriate to the levered nature of the recapitalization. This investment has been a stunning success for the company with IRRs in excess of 30% on our equity over the 5.5 year hold period and the opportunity for significant additional appreciation via our remaining stake in the property.", "On the office front, we announced our latest foray into the Midtown South market with our acquisition of 304 Park Avenue South. This strategic asset occupying the corner across 23rd Street from One Madison gives us another offering in the hottest submarket in the country right now for office space.", "The Structured Finance business also saw an active quarter, with net originations of $64 million and another large $130 million investment closed subsequent to quarter end. We continue to be the go-to provider for subordinate financing in the Manhattan market and have, thus far, been able to maintain the strict underwriting metrics which were put in place during the recent recession. We expect our balances in this business line to continue to grow modestly as we identify relative value in these investments.", "And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.", "James E. Mead", "Thanks, Andrew. If I were to characterize our balance sheet activities since the bottom of the cycle, we started defensively as we moved out of the bottom and move quickly into an aggressive mode as we saw and then capitalized on investment opportunities. And I would say that we've moved from this aggressive stance into a more neutral position. Notwithstanding that we're still finding attractive investments, we're focused on harvesting and realizing gains, building liquidity, terming out financings and tending to our longer-term goal to improve our credit metrics and capacity.", "Our activities during the quarter are a reflection of this posture. Our line of credit ended the quarter at $80 million in comparison with the $400 million outstanding last quarter and $500 million a year ago. So at the end of the quarter, we had a largely undrawn $1.5 billion credit facility and $230 million of unrestricted corporate cash. At the same time, our consolidated debt to EBITDA is 8.1x and we have a healthy 2x fixed charge coverage. And this is before the $90 million plus or so of EBITDA that will come with the execution of our business plans on properties we've purchased over the past 2 years.", "While we continue to invest during the quarter, we purchased 304 Park Avenue South and redeemed $100 million of very expensive preferred stock. We also funded efficiently and opportunistically. The monetization of our profits at 717 Fifth Avenue generated $85 million in cash. The sale of One Court accomplished a number of strategic objectives. In addition to providing $44 million in cash to the company, we mitigated our single tenant risk with Citigroup, shed a $315 million mortgage and reduced our Suburban New York City exposure.", "304 Park Avenue South was the fifth deal in the last 2 years where our property seller has valued SL Green OP units as a tax efficient Manhattan currency, used as consideration for our purchase. In this case, we issued $33 million of common OP units to the seller and we purchased the property unencumbered.", "We were in the market early in the quarter, raising $79 million of equity through our ATM. Once again, we executed the ATM at a premium to the volume weighted average price and with few fees. Our ATM is off now, but remains a great tool to fund needs related to additional growth.", "On the debt financing side, we used the new CMBS market to raise 10-year mortgage money on 100 Church, providing a low-cost of capital and with a term that continues to push out our average maturity, reducing our exposure to future interest rate fluctuations. You'll recall we financed the Viacom building at 1515 Broadway with a $775 million transitional mortgage before we had Viacom's lease extension. Since we now have the BBB+ S&P rated Viacom for 19 years, it's an obvious next place to take a look at our options.", "I'd like to make a comment on some of the great achievements we've made in the quality of our leasing programs that have taken every opportunity to lock-in our tenants and secure the durability of our future cash flows. Over the past year, our leasing team moved the company's Manhattan average lease term from 7.25 years a year ago to 8.14 years today by executing high credit quality leases with the likes of Viacom, which has 19 years left, City of New York with 20 years, Healthfirst with 20 years and Random House with 11 years remaining. And in Manhattan, 39% of the company's cash rents come from strong invest-grade tenants. These leasing accomplishments are the most important drivers of improving credit quality since they represent greater stability and certainty of future cash flows. The company's improving leasing complexion as well accrues directly to increased property and company valuation.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Matt.", "Matt DiLiberto", "Thanks, Jim. Overall, our second quarter results were very positive. However, before I highlight some of the more notable components of our reported results, it would take 2 minutes to address 717 Fifth Avenue since its treatment and earnings, while also very positive was a bit unusual.", "As Andrew has discussed, we recently executed a hugely significant recapitalization. The property involving, among other things, a mortgage refinancing, new mezz debt and a sell down of SL Green's interests, all of which highlighted the significant value we have created at the property. What may have seemed odd to many people, is not the realization of that value creation but how impactful it was to our reported FFO.", "Almost $68 million or $0.73 per share of FFO was recognized in the second quarter as a result of this transaction. These cash proceeds are equivalent to the recognition of significant profit.", "Prior to the recap, we had a very nominal basis in the venture. As a result of our low basis, any incremental proceeds we received via the new financing over and above our investment balance was recorded as income. If this were an on balance sheet investment, this profit would have been recognized in the future. However, this venture is off balance sheet, which requires recognition of this profit today. And because this profit did not come via an asset sale, it also is considered FFO. At this point, it's also probably worth noting the change in accounting for our first mortgage position in London. With the maturity date of that position behind us, we have taken control of the property via a receiver and the property is being marketed for sale, which allow our mortgage position to be repaid. Because we control the property, even though we remain a lender, the property is now consolidated onto our books as an asset held-for-sale and is no longer included in the debt and preferred equity portfolio. This treatment resulted in the immediate recognition of $4.7 million of original unamortized purchase price discount in the second quarter based on the fair value of the property which would have otherwise been recognized over time. This amount was included in investment income.", "So with the accounting tutorial behind us, let's move on to focus on some of the simpler yet very important financial metrics we reported at quarter. Our second quarter and first half results have been strong and generally in line with our expectations.", "On the real estate side, combined same-store cash NOI growth, the most widely recognized measure of our portfolio's performance, remained strong at 5.7% through the first 6 months of the year, driven by a well-occupied portfolio, the burn off of free rent from large volumes and recent leasing and carefully managed operating expenses which have been below our expectations for the first 6 months due in part to a warmer winter and new electric supply contracts.", "In the non-same-store portfolio, where most of our transitional or non-stabilized properties reside, we remain focused on tapping the more than $90 million of incremental EBITDA that we expect those properties to contribute over the next 2 to 3 years.", "At this point, while the earnings contribution from many of these properties is moderate, our business plans remains largely on track as evidenced by the announcement earlier this week of our Landmark lease deal with Express at 1552 Broadway.", "With regard to the debt and preferred equity portfolio, despite a larger competitive set, we continue to see opportunity to put money to work. These new opportunities have increased the average yield on our $1 billion portfolio from 8.4% at the end of 2011 to a robust 10.1% at June 30 and over 97% of this yield is being generated by positions that are collateralized by the New York City commercial properties. It's also worth noting that there were no reserves taken against this portfolio in the second quarter and only $25 million of the portfolio is on nonaccrual status, evidencing the quality of that book of business.", "Interest expense saw a modest tick up in the second quarter, however, that increase is entirely attributable to a onetime charge of $2.8 million taken in the quarter related to the write-off of unamortized costs on a previous mortgage at 1515 Broadway which was refinanced in April. G&A remains in line with our expectations and continues to trend lower than 2011.", "Turning to guidance. Recall that we increased our 2012 guidance last quarter based on the performance of our Manhattan portfolio and our continued opportunities to invest capital in the debt and preferred equity portfolio. Given that recent increase and the trends we are currently seeing in the market, which Marc and Andrew touched on earlier, were it not for the gain recognized on the recapitalization of 717 Fifth Avenue, we will not be revising our guidance any further at this point. However, given the magnitude of that one timer, another upward revision is clearly warranted. As such, we are increasing our guidance again from $4.50 to $4.60 per share to $5.23 to $5.33 per share to be reflective of the $0.73 gain recognized in the second quarter.", "We will note that we have not treated the additional income from the 717 Fifth recapitalization as FAD, and therefore, are not adjusting our previously provided FAD guidance of $2.50 to $2.60 per share. As is has historically been the case, our capital spending in the first half of the year tends to be much lower than in the latter half. So while our FAD run rate to the first 6 months of the year would indicate an outcome better than our guidance range, we do expect to see an increase in capital spending for the back half of the year.", "With that, I'll turn it back to Marc.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. Thanks, and let's open up the line for questions, operator.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Tony Paolone with JPMorgan.", "Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Marc, you'd mentioned some competition coming from secondary locations. Can you just elaborate a little bit further on what those are, is that lower Manhattan or is that other stuff?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, that's -- I mean, those are any of the newer projects that are not in what I would call Prime Midtown areas. So Prime Midtown we've always defined as basically Third over to Broadway and Seventh and 42nd Street up to 57th Street and converging around the primary commuter transportation hub. So anything that, the further it falls out of that boundary then the further, I would say, it is from being a core Midtown location. So anything of a newer vintage that falls outside of that boundary, I would say.", "Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I mean, is the space downtown like the World Trade Center -- World Financial Center, some of those bigger items, and you could see that as a bargaining chip for large Midtown tenants but does that act as such for 10,000, 20,000, 30,000, 50,000 square foot tenants?", "Marc Holliday", "It's predominantly -- when you start talking about that kind of disparity location, you're talking about the larger tenants. Often, it's a stalking horse position, but sometimes we've seen it's not. There have been some moves that have been consummated for bottom line -- management of the bottom line, or in some cases, just these areas are starting to emerge and people are looking out 5, 10 years down the road and saying that those areas are going to be more core on where they want to be. So I would say, with respect to the smaller spaces, it's generally more local subset of properties that we're competing against. But certainly, the larger tenants, 50,000 feet, and 100,000 feet and over, probably 100,000 and over, we will be competing with a larger set. We can generally prevail, but that just is going to holding back for the time being, further growth in rents over and above what we've experienced over the past 2 and 2.5 years. But it's still what I would describe as a relatively healthy and balanced market, as we described at the beginning of the year. And I think we've shown in the first half of the year that it's been exactly that with some positive gains in mark-to-market and leasing up our value-add properties.", "Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. I just had a quick one on the guidance. You upped it about $0.72, I guess, for 717, but it seemed like you also recognized the few pennies for the mortgage reclassification, was there an offset to that?", "Matt DiLiberto", "Yes. Tony, it's Matt. So just in the quarter, there was a direct offset to that for that onetime write-off charge we had to take on 1515. So just look at the quarter, there's an offset there. That would have been unamortized this year, I think, we will recognize over time regardless, that happens to be taken in one-lump sum in the quarter because of the reclassification.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.", "Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research", "While we're on this guidance topic, Jim or Matt, you guys have given same-store cash NOI guidance at the Investor Day of like 3% to 4% for the year, did you up that when you revised guidance in the first quarter or what's the guidance of the same-store NOI today?", "Matt DiLiberto", "We did not adjust it when we revised upwards our guidance in the first quarter and we're trending ahead for the first half of the year due in primarily to expense loads. But we're not adjusting for the remainder of the year. So we may be at the higher end of that range, but not taking it up from the 3% to 4%.", "Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then the other question is you guys have been in the press recently on the L.A. portfolio on the mezz debt there, what are you guys are thinking in terms of current thoughts in terms of the sort of faith there and whether is that something that would sort of follow through like the London asset?", "Marc Holliday", "I'm sorry, what was the last part of that question about London?", "Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research", "Well, you guys basically took control but now you're selling it, is this a situation where you can see the same thing happen there, I mean, or you guys have any interest in owning Class B assets in Southern Cal?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, Rob, we have a high-batting average in answering all these questions we get with a high level of transparency. This is one we're going to have to refrain from getting into any detail on this particular call about expected outcomes and strategies given the nature of this transaction right now. I think we'll have a lot more to say about it on the next call. So I hate to punt on this one and we will have a lot to say. I would just tell you that we are -- it's an investment where we have a fairly moderate carrying value in this investment. But it's something that we're giving attention to towards a successful resolution for the parties involved. And we'll just have to get into more of that as it plays out and I would say certainly on the next call.", "Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then, excluding the Viacom lease, which obviously dominated the leasing activity during the quarter. What was the new lease spread on the New York City leases on during the quarter?", "Matt DiLiberto", "Rob, it's Matt. By and large, that is a flat, I mean the Viacom deal drives because of its size. The metric excluding that, we would be right around flat for the quarter.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "A follow-up on the Cavi [ph] portfolio in California. I know you can't speak to it specifically but why doesn't it show up in your supplemental as one of your 10 largest debt and preferred equity investments?", "Matt DiLiberto", "Simple question here, the simple answer is only a $25 million investments.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So the 59.4 that's reported in the press is not accurate?", "Matt DiLiberto", "Carrying value is $25 million.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Got it, okay. Can you talk a little bit about 3 Columbus Circle maybe as a proxy for what's going on in the market. At least from the supplemental, the leasing percentage hasn't changed in recent quarters. It's a relatively fresh asset, new sponsorship. Why do you think that's not moving ahead more quickly?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, why the leasing at 3 Columbus not moving quickly?", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Correct.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. I'll have Steve Durels will address it. I would -- the only thing I would say Ross, is we're well ahead of plan on 3 Columbus. And I would say it's -- I think it's moving forward nicely. So I want to reconcile those 2 statements, not moving forward, moving forward. Steve, can you sort of elaborate on that?", "Steven M. Durels", "Yes. Well, I mean, we actually have some leases that are pending, we hope that they'd be close by now. But we have leases out right now on roughly 45,000 square feet. We have term sheets being negotiated for another 50,000 square feet, and we're expecting a proposal in out of this week or early next week for a significant blocks of the remaining space in the building. So remember that when we did the Y&R deal, the sole focus on our leasing activity early on in the development was to land an anchor tenant, and we shied away from any single-floor tenants. So once we closed the Y&R deal at the end of last year, it now turned back to really reintroducing the building for single floor and kind of 2 or 3, 4 type combinations. And that just takes a little bit of time to ramp up through that part of the market. But we're seeing tenants come to the building. We are seeing a pretty wide diverse group of users come to the building as well. So I'm feeling still pretty -- I'm still feeling very positive about the asset.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, great. Last one for me, now that you have Viacom put to bed, are you turning your attention to AIG at 180 Maiden Lane ahead of their 2014 expiration? How do you think about that in terms of an early renewal?", "James E. Mead", "Our attention is certainly on 180. And, if you recall, our underwriting for the asset is that AIG does not stay in the building. So we're actively exploring the possibilities of both redevelopment of the asset and bringing it to the market for new tenants. And also in discussions playing it out with AIG in terms of their occupancy. So it's still too early to tell there. But it's definitely getting a lot of our focus.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Would it stay as an office asset if AIG left?", "James E. Mead", "Likely yes, although we're looking at all the possibilities, but we -- when we --our acquisition underwriting is as an office asset.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America.", "James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Along similar lines, I'm hoping you guys can discuss your largest expirations through the end of next year? And how you're thinking about them in light of your comments about more competition from other landlords?", "Marc Holliday", "Largest expirations. Well, I mean, we can look and see what those comprised of. We typically don't talk about lease negotiations in progress for, I think, obvious reasons. So is there any one in particular or 2 in particular, Matt, that we can -- next year, I think is a relatively modest expiration year. I mean, this year, I mentioned that there's very little, I think, there is 2 tenants between 25,000 and 50,000 feet that expire for the remainder of the year. The rest are small.", "Matt DiLiberto", "Next year is 1 million square feet, pretty balanced out...", "Marc Holliday", "Next year is 1 million square feet in total. So under 5% of the portfolio. And I just -- Steve Durels is there one in particular that's at the top of your head? We don't typically like to advertise who it is. But I think it's safe to say we think we're going to have a very high-success ratio with that 1 million square feet leasing up and retaining as we've had in the past. I think the question is going to be the rental levels, which as we get, as I mentioned in my earlier comments, as we get deeper into the balance of this year, we'll start to formulate our rental projections and assessments for next year. I think for the moment, we are on track for 2012 where we projected to be back in December and with the caveat that I expressed earlier. But I just don't think we're in a position to go through the status of our pending leases, unless you have one, in particular, you have a question on.", "James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "It's more along the lines of just the largest we should be watching and then are there any known move outs, any sizable known move outs in '13?", "Marc Holliday", "Steve?", "Steven M. Durels", "The only one that's scheduled to vacate that was known about for a little while is Draft at 919 Third Avenue. Other than that, I'm actually flipping through my list right now, as we speak, there is no other big expirations. And Draft is 150,000 square feet in one of our premier buildings. So, I think, we'll -- there's a good shot we have that space leased before they ever move out at the end of next year. Other than that, no, I'm looking through the list and there's most of it is  '14,  '15 that we're kind of looking at further down the road where we have some bigger role. But '13 is a pretty quiet year. And I think in '13, we're going to spend a lot of time focusing on filling up some of the buildings that we bought recently. Where we bought vacancies, and finishing off the leasing at 100 Church, finishing off the leasing at 125 Park and a couple of the other assets.", "James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then for Andrew, you commented on maybe a pickup in assets coming into the market in the fall. Can you talk a little bit more about what you expect to see and does that include the Blackstone assets?", "Andrew W. Mathias", "Well, certainly, worldwide, it's teed up and that's out there publicly. We hear rumors of some other sellers that Blackstone is not among them. So I don't expect to see the Blackstone assets come to market in the second half. And I can't comment specifically on the plans. But I think that report was overblown.", "James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, so you think the largest in the fall is worldwide, are there any sizable ones?", "Andrew W. Mathias", "Nothing else that we can disclose publicly that we are tracking. But yes, there are a couple of other large assets there that are in plan.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Josh Attie with Citi.", "Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "The $90 million of incremental FFO that you mentioned, can you remind us what the major components of that are? And how much CapEx might be associated with it over the next few years?", "Matt DiLiberto", "Josh, it's Matt. So the largest deals that are going to impact that the dollar are -- or 1552. So that's buttoned up a good portion of that. 280 Park is clearly going to be the most material in our list of 11 or 12 assets we have acquired over the last couple of years. Our expectation is to put in $75 million. And 3 Columbus Circle is on track, as Marc alluded to, that we hope to have buttoned up over the next couple of years. That capital is largely funded with the acquisition. So there's not incremental capital out of our pockets to put into that deal. And of the other 11, there's a couple of larger ones although relative to 3 CC, 280 Park, much smaller, 600 Lex comes to mind as one where we have gotten a lot of traction through our prebuilt program and starting to get some good traction there. Everything else after that is fairly modest. So it equates to $90 million to $100 million of incremental EBITDA for $100 million to $200 million of cash out of our packets.", "Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And just a question on 717 Fifth, I don't know who wants to grab it. But you talked a little bit about the financing you're able to obtain, especially on the mezz going up to what effectively is almost 100% leverage on the value that was ascribed to you selling down your stake. And then also just talk about how, at least, at the current NOI level, there is -- it's about 0.8 covered before CapEx and any NOI reserve I know there's some vacancy. But just talk a little bit about how you sort of look at leveraging that asset, what does that say about the mezz lenders out there willing to underwrite that sort of leverage with negative cash flow.", "Marc Holliday", "I think a couple of things. As I alluded to in my comments, I mean, we're a minority partner here and we went down further in stake based on the fact that the recapitalization was done by a leverage as opposed to equity sale, which is on a more traditional way of recapitalizing assets. The mezzanine loan does feature a pay rate that significantly below the accrual rate. So the coverage is meant to be around 1.0 or 1.05 based on the cash flow in place. So the difference between that, the pay rate and the accrual rate sort of accounts for that difference. And there is significant growth both in contractual rent increases and also in some additional lease up potential at the asset. So I think it was an aggressive financing. It was done to sort of achieve primarily Jeff Sutton's objectives as the major partner in the deal. And we still think there is the prospect for additional incremental value appreciation in excess of our sale price on the debt balance, which is why we kept a 10% interest in the deal to sort of ride along with.", "Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "What does it say about the mezz pricing being able to -- I guess, would you be lending on those sort of terms and would you take more capital like that for yourself?", "Marc Holliday", "Yes. I think this is a very unique asset in terms of location, in terms of tenant profile and in terms of just high-profile. So I would say the assets that we are making generally are not as long term. This is a 12-year term mezz. We're not doing much mezz that long term. We're generally doing shorter-term floating rate mezz. And at the shorter-term floating rate market, the underwriting metrics are decidedly more conservative than this. But this is a very long-term leased assets and it's a unique type of that mezz investment, which we we're able to take advantage of.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from the line of Evan Smith with Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Evan Smith - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "You talked about the 50 leases that are out right now for about 480,000 square feet. Just curious if you could touch on the type of sectors that are within there, if majority of it is tech or financial services type tenants?", "Steven M. Durels", "It's pretty broad range. I mean, we've got deals pending with insurance firms, some finance businesses, commercial bank hedge fund type part of the group, government, business services, advertising. So it's not being driven by any one group. But a pretty broad range of users.", "Evan Smith - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Okay, and then of those leases, did the majority of them look like they would commence in 2012 or most of them will be pushed into 2013?", "Steven M. Durels", "It's a mixed bag.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Could you maybe give us a little more color on the change in stance related to asset sales. Andrew, you mentioned the second half of this year. What sort of the nature of that shift given sort of the mixed signals you're seeing in the market in terms of tenancy and I'd imagine the same thing in the underwriting side? What are you thinking?", "Andrew W. Mathias", "There is a real lack of supply out there, which is the deals are getting done off market, away from the auction process, but sellers are achieving extraordinary prices. And I think in that type of environment, it definitely pays to have some price discovery for some of our assets, see what buyers are willing to pay and match that up with where our perspective is in value and explore what's possible in a flattish-type leasing market. If there's buyers that are willing to be more optimistic on the asset front than we are internally that's generally where we've made successful sales in the past.", "Marc Holliday", "I think Andrew's use of the term price discovery is right on target. There seems to be a growing differential between the public market valuations, which seem to have stagnated a bit and the multiples have somewhere between held tight or maybe even modestly eroded as a sector in the past few months. Whereas the property pricing market in the public sector is marching forward. And as rates have continued to fall, spreads have compressed more, more capital, more debt, more equity, is looking for this kind of product. And this particular market on a risk-adjusted basis other world markets seem to be more in favor now. There's compression, further compression, we see on cap rates, both in our own executions and elsewhere in the market that is just creating a greater divide and I think that's it's something we think you, as shareholders, should be and analysts should be aware of. And we'll look to continue to demonstrate that one because we think that's important data for you. But more importantly, that's what we do. We create value and if we think these assets have reached some level of maturation then we look to harvest or JV and reinvest and that's kind of what we've done all along, it's still what we do, and we think that's in the best approach to balance growth and income. So as those markets continue to do well and as that disparity between stock price and underlining NAV widens, then I think you'll see us equitize more assets.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "And would the flavor of those look more like 717 or some of the assets you've identified in the past is kind of being maybe noncore like 100 Church, 220 East 42nd, 711, some of those guys?", "Marc Holliday", "I'd say --  I think it's both. It's more of the latter. And we're not going to do levered recaps, we're talking about...", "Steven M. Durels", "I'm looking at 717 simply the joint venture in about levered recap, we might do JVs, we might do outright sales.", "Matt DiLiberto", "Yes.", "Steven M. Durels", "When you say 717, I will keep coming back to that. It's an asset we have a 10% interest in now, I wouldn't look at that as a profile holding of Green. That's a small minority interest to capture...", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "No, I just mean that you guys have talked about increasing the exposure to retail and that's obviously a high-quality location and tenancy with lease structure, et cetera, and you're reducing exposure to it. Obviously, tremendous IRR, an opportunity for you guys. But in terms of what the investments, you'll reduce or pare going forward, is it going to be stuff that looks like that or you'd look to sell or would you sort of just test the market on assets that might be a little bit more non core?", "Marc Holliday", "I guess it will depend on what -- if you know us, you know when we say we're looking to increase exposure of retail, that's not increased exposure of retail at any cost. Let's do it smartly and do it on deals that where we can make significant returns. So if there is a hot bid in the market for retail, we may look to take advantage of those.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "That makes sense. I was just curious what's the additional sales would look like, really, if they'd be more the non-core stuff.", "Marc Holliday", "We'll evaluate where the best bids are on the market.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Matt, with the -- there was a depreciable real estate reserve in the quarter. What did that tie back to, the $5.8 million?", "Matt DiLiberto", "Yes. That is actually -- we have taken a similar reserve late last year. It was tied to the original contract price on One Court Square. As that closing was delayed, we got incremental sales price and that ultimately reversed the original depreciable reserves.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of John Guinee with Stifel.", "John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Just a little bit of a clarification, help me understand, if you could. On Page 37 of the supp, you have Viacom at 1.272 million square feet at $61.59 per square foot annualized. And then on Page 40, you go to 1.387 million and it looks like it's about $54.79. Couple of questions would be who's in the rest of the building? Why the increase in the square footage? And what's the actual rental rate of reset?", "Marc Holliday", "So I'll touch on the disclosure, John. It's -- the size of the lease in the leasing table in the back is accurate for the new lease, and therefore, all the metrics tied to it or the square footage shown on the largest tenants page is their existing square footage because that new lease has a later commencement date. And then I'll let Durels ask -- or answer the remainder of your question.", "Steven M. Durels", "The balance of the tenants in the office portion of the building are, there is an ad firm, an engineering firm and a law firm. That in combination, I don't know how, maybe 3 or 4 floors in total. And that's the space that Viacom will move into as those leases expire.", "John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "So if the rent go on from $61.59 down to $54.79, is that the right way to look at this?", "Marc Holliday", "I think the right way to look at it is to multiply the 2 together, I mean, that's their rent charge. We've recast it in a certain way, but you can look at -- I mean the rents in the market are a function of loss factor and rental rate. So, I think you have to get the product of those 2 numbers to get their actual rental rate. That's the whole loss factor part of our business.", "John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "So is the rent per square foot go up or down on this renewal?", "Marc Holliday", "It depends on what square footage you -- the square footage grew, it increased the loss factor and we -- and there's a smaller nominal rent. But the rents is, I haven't just done the math...", "Matt DiLiberto", "In absolute dollars, John, they are paying more rent on the new lease...", "Marc Holliday", "All right. Yes, the rent went up...", "Matt DiLiberto", "Than the old lease. On a mark-to-market basis that equates to 2% increase.", "Marc Holliday", "Correct.", "John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And what happened to the expense stop? Was the expense stop reset or how did that work out?", "Steven M. Durels", "It's the same. They pay the same proportion of share as they would, irrespective of what the measurement is because that's really just based upon the percentage of the building that they occupy. So whether the building is 2 million square feet, or 1.5 square feet based upon what we measured it to, the percentage of that occupancy doesn't change.", "John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And does the net rent after deducting the new expense stop go up or down?", "Marc Holliday", "Steve, that was new expense stop, was it not?", "Steven M. Durels", "Yes, the expense stop is reset.", "John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "From what to what?", "Steven M. Durels", "Boy, I don't know. Matt -- maybe we've got it, it came to a current base year. I just don't remember whether we used '13 or '15.", "Marc Holliday", "We can go over this, John.", "John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And then just out of curiosity, who is the lender on the 12-year $290 million mezz on 1717 Fifth -- 717 Fifth, and on a pay accrue basis, is the principal on the 12th year on that loan up around $400 million?", "James E. Mead", "We're trying to figure out whether we can tell you.", "Marc Holliday", "Was it in the -- it wasn't in the press release?", "James E. Mead", "Yes.", "John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "You can tell us, we'll keep it secret.", "James E. Mead", "You'll keep it secret.", "Marc Holliday", "I don't think we -- I don't think that we released it publicly...", "James E. Mead", "I don't think so.", "Marc Holliday", "So I don't think we can disclose who it is.", "John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And the decision-maker on that asset as you gone down to a minority interest, who's the -- who owns the other 89%?", "Marc Holliday", "It's majority-owned by Jeff Sutton.", "Steven M. Durels", "John, I just looked it up. The base year for operating expenses are 2014 and for taxes it's '14 and '15.", "Marc Holliday", "The answer to that question, we didn't know yet if we could tell you. Reef [ph] is the lender on the mezz.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.", "Andrew Schaffer", "It's actually Andrew Schaffer here. And I just wanted to get your thoughts on the likelihood of the up zoning on Park Avenue and do you think if that goes through given before any material progress has been made on the West side?", "Marc Holliday", "I'm sorry what was that the second part of the question?", "Andrew Schaffer", "It's actually, do you think the up zoning on Park Avenue is going through without material progress being made on the West side development?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I can't speak to that. I mean, these are, as I understand of their independent initiatives of city planning. This is something that I think stands alone as a major and I think much needed initiative to reinvigorate some development around what is predominantly the most coveted office location in Midtown. So the 21.6 FAR maximum or implied maximum to date or currently is something that by today's world standards is quite small for the city and that's why you're seeing most, not all, but most of the newer -- and 21st century buildings are being built in other emerging markets that allow for heights that are anywhere from 24 to 30 FAR or even above in some cases. So I think this is an updating of a fairly old zoning text. I think it was carefully studied by planning and came out with these recommendations. I think that this goes -- can go forward with or without regards to what transpires in other markets in the city because this market is distinct in being able to support without subsidy, the kinds of rents that are needed today to justify new development. Those rents -- the costs are very high so the rents have to be very high and this is largely the area where those high rents are achieved. So it certainly makes sense in our estimation to put density where rents can -- where tenants can afford it and want to pay and are attracted to those locations. And also to put density around major commuter hubs as opposed to putting density where you have to bring the transportation to the site here. Transportation is largely there in terms of Grand Central and is going to be even further populated once the East side access project is finished and Long Island Railroad begins letting passengers off of Grand Central, there's going to be a significant increase in ridership. So it seems from a planning perspective, from a development perspective, from a good urban perspective, it's the right kind of initiative at the moment. As to the specifics of what's been proposed and whether it's going to pass as it is or get modified, we certainly can't speak to. But we're excited by the proposal as an owner in Grand Central, we think it makes sense from a lot of levels and it will sort of go through its analysis. And over the next 1 year, 1.5 years we presume.", "Andrew Schaffer", "Okay. And lastly, I was wondering if we can get a better understanding of your kind of thoughts on the Midtown South market and the tenant mix and if you are more likely to shy towards credit tenants versus the start ups while you're looking at new acquisitions in that area?", "Marc Holliday", "We definitely will turn towards credit tenants. We did so 12 years ago in the Dot.coms boom and we continue to do so today. We think the Midtown South area is tight enough that -- and there are enough high-quality tenants looking into expand and active in that market that we can definitely concentrate on credit tenants and still have a lot of success leasing there.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Brendan Maiorana with Wells Fargo.", "Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Question, Marc, I heard your comments earlier in the call about a little more caution with respect to tenant activity. In New York, can you guys have $90 million to $100 million value-add portfolio or $90 million to $100 million of NOI gains potential. How do you sort of think about acquisitions that require a fair amount of lease up or value-add acquisitions today? Would you be comfortable doing that, given where the market dynamics are?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, we gave this commentary at the beginning of the year that we had acquired a pool of properties that we thought was sufficient to seed our growth for the next couple of years or few years and that was going to take up the bulk of our attention. So since the acquisition of 10 East 53rd Street, which I think was consummated in December or January?", "James E. Mead", "January.", "Marc Holliday", "January. So we have not been active acquirers of vacancy. So that's not a -- I don't want you to take that as anything to do with my comments today as opposed to our posture throughout the first 7 months of this year has been to basically focus our efforts in capital on the projects we acquired and create that additional $1 a share that we've spoken about. That doesn't mean we're not looking and at the margins we won't do certain deals. But 304 Park Avenue South was by no means a lease up project. That building is fairly well leased and we think that's just a longer-term play that was transacted on reasonably good terms. But there's no -- my only point to you is I don't think there is any shift on this call in that approach. That's been our posture throughout the year.", "Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, that's very helpful. And then one for Andrew, can you provide any details on the lease at 333, 34th with Sam Ash And I think you guys may have put a $25 million or so into that building over the past couple of years and just maybe the return on cost that you're getting on that space, which is now, I guess, fully leased up?", "Marc Holliday", "I have to come back to you with those details. I don't have them at my fingertips. We can come back to you with some specifics on that asset.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "If the public market is trailing private market values, why is the ATM an attractive source of capital so far this year and in this last quarter?", "Marc Holliday", "I think what we said is, Michael, that the -- Jim's words were, I think, ATM is off. So, I don't know where you heard that the ATM is an attractive source of capital.", "James E. Mead", "Michael, we raised ATM money, I think, predominately before even in the last earnings call. I think we were done right about then.", "Marc Holliday", "I think the stock prices then were well in excess of where they sit today.  We had sold values 4 months ago -- Mike, my comment specifically was in the past few months, the stock price in the multiples are kind of steady or eroded while the property markets have moved ahead. So the result of that comment would be sales on ATM off. I think that's exactly what we've done.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just a way of asking about leasing market trends, it sounds like things have slowed down a little bit but do you think have it slowed down enough to make you more glad that you got Viacom done when you did? Would that negotiation feel different just a few months later or is the market not changed enough to really have affected, say, that lease just hypothetically?", "Marc Holliday", "No. I don't think that falls into the category of what we are talking about. That was unique building and unique offering for a certain tenant and then I think you could look at it today and say it can go either way. But we're seeing generally for the more commodity like tenants, and tenants in the financial sector, for the most part, they seem to be a little bit more cautious on growth. They seem to be doing more densification, which is healthy for the industry. But it's just, let's put a temporary cap, we think, on near-term future growth. But that may kick back into gear after Labor Day or after the election which was my comment earlier. But we don't see any kind of seismic shift, if you will. I mean, the market is still, like I said earlier, pretty well-balanced and relatively favorable for us to do the large volume leasing we're doing. So I don't think there's been any material shift of anything in the past few months. We've been saying all year that the gains would be somewhat muted and flat and I think it's turned out that way. So to the contrary, I think, some of these deals we're doing now if we held out a few more months, we'd be doing better deals. But with that said, that's just not our approach. Our approach is generally just leave what's in front of us and we catch the increases on the next wave of leasing. So we try not to -- except in very select instances, talking on 2 things like warehousing and things like that.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Mitch Germain with JMP Securities.", "Mitchell B. Germain - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "Some thoughts on concessions. Marc or Steve. Have you seen any change over the last couple of [indiscernible]?", "Steven M. Durels", "From my perspective, not really. I think they've been fairly flat all year long. It really kind of depends on the size of tenants you're talking about. If it's smaller tenants, call it 10,000 square feet or less, you got to deliver the space to build, which is why you've not seen us stop the prebuild program, we've been doing it for a couple of years and we continue to do it. On the bigger deals, it's still in that kind of $65 cash allowance where the space -- one has to be built for a long-term lease. And what we're doing on renewals, or lease-up on build space, then it's -- it depends on the deal, but it's kind of cosmetic money to modest alterations. But I don't think we've seen a real migration as far as the amount of free rent, it's still kind of 10 months of free rent, if the tenants building the space and it's less if the landlords building the space. And the TI as I outlined.", "Mitchell B. Germain - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "And in that increased competition that you guys mentioned from competing landlords, is that for all tenant sizes, meaning, is it for the smallest spaces to the larger or is it for any particular set?", "Steven M. Durels", "Well, I think what Marc was seeing and certainly what I am seeing, is that tenants are going farther afield to satisfy their space requirements. So that may mean that a tenant who is on Fifth Avenue and you would have normally thought that tenant was going to stay within the 2 or 3 block radius of where his current space is, is now opening it up and saying I'm going to Midtown South because I just like the lifestyle or I'll go farther West because I'm chasing a lower rate. You're just -- you've seen a broader geographic search by a lot of tenants and that's what adding a different twist to the competitive landscape.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Just 2 questions. First one in regards to just dividend policy going forward, how we should be thinking about that?", "James E. Mead", "Yes, I think that just to be consistent with what we've said before, we expected that our -- just by virtue of increases in our taxable income in the company, we will need to increase dividends as we move forward. And our expectation would be to do it at a pace which is relatively high, we think, compared to what others in the industry would be doing. So I think you'd see us continuing to retain significant cash. But increasing our dividends by virtue of need as a result of our taxable income.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then secondly, just when I think back to your Investor Day and all your 2012 goals and I'm kind of looking at the half year report right now, it's like you're well ahead on quite a few of the goals. But two, in particular, I would like you guys to talk about just achieving mark-to-market on New York leases that are greater than 5% and Manhattan portfolio occupancy of 95.8%, just kind of given where you are as of 2Q, how you are kind of thinking about potentially meeting at least those 2 particular goals at the back half of the year.", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I can tell you where we are currently. I can't exactly project where we'll be 4 or 5 months from now. But I would say that currently, I think we're tracking 7 points ahead on mark-to-market. So that would seem to snugly fit within the greater than 5%. And we'll just have to keep --  we've got our work cut out for us for the rest of the year to try and we either achieve that. But as we sit here today, we are certainly not revising that upward or downward. We're comfortable with that particular objective and that was a fairly robust objective, I think, going into somewhat of a choppy market. And as to occupancy, there's a lot of moving parts. I think that we ended the year in something like 95.3% and we have projected about 95.8%, if I recall, right? And I think we'll be somewhere -- that probably bookends where we'll end up. We're going to certainly do our best to try and get right to that 95.8% and I don't see any erosions of where we were. But there's -- as I said earlier, there is like 50 leases that are in advanced stage. And then Steve, how many lease, 35 leases, I think, were [indiscernible] investigation?", "Steven M. Durels", "Yes, I mean, when you look at the pipeline of proposals that we've got out, as you cull through that and you say, well, if there's 50 or 60 proposals out and you say which ones do you think are really likely to make. There's 35 deals -- 35 proposals covering another 680,000 square feet of it.", "Marc Holliday", "So our objective will be to get those done by December and I think if we do, we'll hit it and if we have 10% or 20% that lapse into January, you may slightly miss it or maybe exceed it in December and then have it adjusted again in January. So we're in pretty good shape.", "Operator", "And our next caller will come from the line of George Auerbach with ISI Group.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "It's Steve Sakwa here. Just a question, Marc. I wanted to kind of go back to the, I guess, kind of the Park Avenue and the up zoning and kind of your project actually on Madison. I knows you guys have kind of put that whole assemblage together. Just kind of what are your thoughts for that project and what would it take for you to kind of redevelop that asset today?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, we're constantly working on it, but we're working on it with an eye towards a very long lead time of delivery. So nothing that I would say is imminent because between the planning stage, demolition and vacate, build, and it's just a very long process. And I think we're moving that along. Our goal was to have a lot more to say about it by the end of the year. And I think we'll have more visibility into how this proposal may or may not affect our desires to accelerate or change our thinking as to size and timing. But I think the zoning proposal or the amended proposal makes sense without regard to the project. I mean that's just -- this zoning is going to affect many, many blocks and properties and sites of which this is one of many. So the bigger issue for us is with 11 million or 12 million feet in this year, most of which will not be redeveloped, is just to see this area be improved and be anchored as a #1 destination for business and that could only serve to benefit all the properties located within that district. But I think it benefits the city. I mean it's just going -- it's going to put the tenants at a place where there is the highest tenant demand and where the public transit infrastructure can handle the most amount of people. So our procedure and our thoughts on the site, timing, et cetera, is somewhat independent of this exercise. But certainly, we'll have the results of the zoning amendment before we take any material step forward. So we will kind of know where we are when it comes time to get to that next phase of the project, which would be a more serious and definite timeline for construction and delivery.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And I assume it's fair that you would want a sort of a large anchor tenant kind of pre-lease to lease maybe half of that building before you'd start?", "Marc Holliday", "Yes, certainly in this market you would. I mean, changes from market to market. But I'd say in 3 out of 4 market, yes and there's 1 out of 4 markets, no. So as we sit here today, yes, but I want to put an asterisk on that because it really depends on a market towards the middle or end of this decade, not -- today's market is somewhat irrelevant.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Right. And then, just kind of the other question, I know the Suburban kind of Westchester in Connecticut assets are kind of a small piece of the pie, but just sort of what's your thought process on that longer term and you sold the One Court, but do you have kind of a game plan to sort of sell those assets in the kind of near future or is it -- or the market is just too difficult to try and move any of that product today?", "Marc Holliday", "I think, unfortunately, the market is just too difficult today. There's no -- there's not an active sale or capital market out there. So, I think, our plan for the short and medium term right now is to hold the assets, let's our operations group do what they've been doing, trying to fight for occupancy and do as well as they can in renewing tenants and wait for a better market out there in a broader economic recovery before we evaluate doing it.", "All right, thank you, everyone. I think we're going to -- it's gone past 3:15. If anyone is left on the call, we appreciate your dialing in today and we'll speak with you again next quarter.

My name is Keith and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded for replay purposes. And with that, I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Heidi Gillette. Please go ahead.", "Heidi Gillette", "Thank you everybody for joining today. At this time, the company would like to remind listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from forward-looking statements that management may make today. Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the company's Form 10-K and other reports filed by the company with the SEC.", "Also during today's conference call, the company may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G.

Thank you. Please go ahead, Marc.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay, good afternoon, and thank you, everyone, for calling in today. After releasing earnings last night, I retired for the evening, with our performance -- with myself being fairly pleased with our performance and that we had good results for the quarter highlighted by substantial leasing, demonstrated gains and harvesting, certain debt and equity investments, new investments in an array of value-add opportunities, additional originations and structured financial portfolio and continuing affirmative steps taken to strengthen the balance sheet.", "I woke up only to read a number of analyst reports stating that they perceived we had a different kind of quarter and we would certainly like to use the next hour or so to review our results and discuss the many achievements of the quarter, which I believe are indicative of a market in which we are still able to take advantage of opportunities and create significant value through the investment and repositioning and leasing of real property and also through continued gains in our core same-store portfolio.", "First I would like to specifically address the leasing results for our Manhattan portfolio in the third quarter and then convey some additional thoughts on the broader marketplace. Based on our internal budgeted projections and by historical standards, the 471,000 square feet of leases signed in the third quarter is, in our opinion, a very robust amount of leasing given that the quarter encompasses July and August, which are typically our slowest leasing months of the year. That's nearly 2 million square feet of leasing on an annualized basis, versus our original projections for the year of 1.5 million square feet of leasing. And further, such activity was dominated by new leasing filling existing vacancy.", "These leases were signed at starting cash rents, which were higher than previously occupied expiring rents and does not reflect the effect of the contractual base rent increases that we will be entitled to throughout the terms of the leases. This leasing volume was higher than I anticipated for the third quarter and I've been very pleased with the level of activity in our portfolio since Labor Day. Any notion that the third quarter leasing results underperformed our expectations would be inaccurate. Evidence of this success is our same-store NOI increase for the quarter of approximately 5%, which is consistent with the increases experienced in the first 2 quarters and puts us on the high end of the same-store increases in the office sector.", "As important, and in my opinion, as impressive as these statistics are, especially in light of the neutral leasing market, I would continue to point you to our pipeline leasing statistics as a very good indicator of where the portfolio is heading over the next 3 to 6 months. In the 25 days since the end of the third quarter, we've signed over 123,000 square feet of leases in 18 different transactions and we have another 53 leases in advanced negotiation covering some 435,000 square feet, much of this we will obviously hope to conclude in the fourth quarter.", "Most tellingly, there is another 745,000 square feet of term sheets in negotiation that we believe have a high probability of being converted to lease, much of which would occur in the first few quarters of 2013. In total, we have 1.2 million square feet of pipeline in the third quarter, which is actually greater than the 1.16 million square feet of pipeline we had at the end of the second quarter. You can see why I think our leasing results are reflective or slightly better than the general market conditions in New York where increasing office-using jobs are absorbing the supply on the market from several of the newly constructed buildings.", "A number of job statistics bode very well for New York City in 2013 and over the long term. Specifically, there are 73,000 more jobs today than there were at the prior peak in this market in 2007, of which approximately 43,000 such jobs are office-using jobs. While new job growth in New York has been steady through much of 2011 and 2012, we do see a slight deceleration in new office-using jobs, which rang in at only 6,000 in the plus column for the fourth quarter. However, while decelerating, the fact that New York has added 43,000 office-using jobs this year bucks the conventional notion that New York is losing jobs. This is simply not the case. Rather, I believe, what you're seeing is job growth, which is essentially keeping pace with new inventory, which has kept a lid on rents.", "Job growth has also been mitigated or absorbed by the efficiencies that many of today's tenants are looking for when rebuilding their spaces. So between new construction and forced efficiencies, I think that's why you've seen a fairly steady vacancy rate in the 9.5% range. However, the good news is that, at this current moment, there's about 1.1 million square feet of leases pending at 11x, 250 West 55th Street and the Coach building, such that much of this inventory will be reduced, if and when those transactions are finalized. Thus allowing for 2013 job growth to directly impact the existing commercial inventory.", "The vacancy in Manhattan, as I mentioned earlier, is about 9.6%, which is relative equilibrium, that's less than 2 percentage points of sublet space and the balance being directly offered. And we remain optimistic about the prospects for our portfolio over the next 6 months given our substantial leasing pipeline, given the job growth in New York City and given the reducing supply of new construction that was put in place over the last few years.", "We will be well positioned, I believe, in the balance of this year and next year, to take advantage of these market dynamics as we have a very modest amount of lease expirations scheduled to expire to the balance of this year, about 290,000 square feet and throughout 2013 only less than 1.1 million square feet set to expire. These amounts having been substantially reduced and chipped away at all year through our aggressive early leasing program to reduce these amounts to very, very small amounts relative to our overall portfolio.", "With the core portfolio stabilized and delivering modest but market-leading same-store NOI growth, the focus has been on leasing up the more recently acquired assets where we have been having enormous success and are tracking well ahead of original underwriting in terms of timing and economics. Notably this morning, we announced the signing of several additional lease transactions: 131,000 square-foot lease to The City of New York at 100 Church Street, bringing that building up to 97% occupancy, a long, long way from the 40% occupancy when we acquired the building just a couple of years ago; And additional leasing at 125 Park Avenue where we are backfilling the planned vacancy we acquired and now how that building's occupancy in excess of 80%. We will continue to focus 3 Columbus, where we also announced a substantial upsizing in the Young & Rubicam lease, bringing that building's office occupancy to an excess of 73%.", "So at this point, I'm going to turn the call over to Andrew, who will now discuss the capital and property market dynamics we see in this current environment and the activities we've undertaken and we've executed to take advantage of these substantial opportunities that present themselves to us.", "That will be followed by Jim, who will give a strategic overview and framework for our balance sheet activities, and then Matt will drill into some of the specific highlights of the third quarter results. Thank you.", "Andrew W. Mathias", "Thanks, Marc, good afternoon, everybody. The third quarter continued 2012's furious pace of activity, both in the Manhattan market and within SL Green's portfolio. This activity has accelerated of late given market tightening in the debt markets, which I'll get into further. Midtown saw many transactions go to contract at aggressive pricing metrics, demonstrating strong, continued investor demand from Manhattan real estate. 450 Lexington, 350 Madison, 285 Madison, 575 Lexington, 1411 Broadway and 386 Park Avenue South, were just some of the properties changing hands outside of SL Green's universe, with Worldwide Plaza and 75 Rockefeller Center reportedly closing in on contracts in the very short term as well.", "And the pipeline for year end is robust, with 11 Madison, the Sony building and several other high-profile assets, we expect to come to market this fall and winter. This transaction activity was helped by significant tightening in the CMBS market, which really started in July and continues to this week, where we expect several additional transactions, bellwether-type transactions to price. This tightening has caused other providers of debt capital, like insurance companies and commercial banks to tighten their rates as well, as they have to compete with lower CMBS costs. 3-handle rates seem to be the new norm in the market in tenure reasonably levered fixed rate deals, down 100 basis points or even more from rates just earlier this year.", "The other notable trend to watch in the debt markets is the return of the single asset securitization market, another very positive development for Manhattan assets. We expect to see several very large Manhattan assets avail themselves of this market as it re-gels and redevelops and the initial indications are that spreads in single asset securitizations will be competitive to pretty much on top of spreads and pool deals, which bodes very well for both Manhattan assets and Manhattan values.", "Within our portfolio, we announced the off-market purchase of 635, 641 Sixth Avenue. This exciting redevelopment project has Steve Durels brushing up on his tech talk and also talking big rents with almost 100,000 square feet of vacant office space in the tightest submarket in the country available for 2014 delivery. Plus, 200 square feet of prime retail frontage on Sixth Avenue, a meaningful amount of that retail, is vacant and available to these.", "Once again, our acquisition and legal team showed their ability to creatively structure a deal to meet all of the seller's objectives swiftly and discreetly as of this off-market deal did not reach the press, until we put it in the press. Kudos to the teams and particularly our Co-CIO, Isaac Zion, on this one.", "Today, we also announced our contract to sell a 49% joint venture interest in 521 Fifth Avenue to new partners for our portfolio, the international investors at Jones Lang LaSalle and Quantum. These partners share our vision for this property and the extraordinary long-term value we believe we can continue -- we believe we can continue creating here. The transaction was struck at a gross property value of $315 million or about $650 a foot, which is about a 4.5% cap rate on in place NOI.", "Elsewhere in the portfolio, we acquired a second site downtown at 33 Beekman near Pace University, where we will construct a second world-class facility for Pace on a 30-year commitment from them. This comes as we're on track to TCO our project in 180 Broadway in short order, on-time and on budget, a real coup by our construction team. That project went so well and Pace was so pleased with the project -- the progress that we made there and the finished product, they were willing to commit to another building, which we'd expect to bring online in late 2015 for them.", "We've also stayed active on the structure finance front, funding a major refinancing of an asset on the far west side of Manhattan and directly originating several other acquisition loans. The pipeline for a structure finance book looks very robust going into the fourth quarter, as our market leadership in that business continues and the transaction volume that I discussed earlier continues to build. Thus far, we don't see much of a drop in our returns for that business even with the senior debt tightening I described earlier.", "And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jim Mead to go through the balance sheet.", "James E. Mead", "Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon, everyone. We've also had a very strong quarter with regard to our balance sheet. Starting with liquidity. We ended the quarter with $200 million outstanding on our $1.5 billion line of credit. And $115 million in unrestricted cash on hand, providing well in excess of our targeted $1 billion in liquidity. The line of credit balance increased from $80 million last quarter, primarily because we purchased 635, 641 Sixth Avenue unencumbered by debt. This is consistent with our broader rating strategy to increase the company's number of unencumbered assets. This purchases adds 2 assets to that unencumbered base. You will recall that we purchased 304 Park Avenue South unencumbered and we have plans to unencumber additional assets as we move into year end.", "To give some sense of the proportion of our liquidity today, our available liquidity covers all of our debt maturities for the next 2 years by 1.3x. Turning to a couple of credit metrics. Our debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the quarter was below 8x and our fixed charge coverage was 1.9x, both strong metrics. And as I've mentioned in prior calls, we expect improvements in our NOI and our corresponding credit metrics as our recent property investments lease-up and mature. I think it's notable then in the last few months, much of the leasing that we accomplished is highly strategic in nature and that it relates to achieving this additional NOI growth, which we said in the past will grow to almost $100 million annually in the next few years.", "Yesterday and today, we announced, for example, the completion of the lease up at 100 Church, which is now at 97%. The additional leasing at 3 Columbus -- that takes us -- takes the office occupancy into the mid-70s and the leasing at 125 Park, which is now into the mid-80s percent lease up. And we refinanced expensive preferred stock this quarter with a new issuance, taking advantage of the current window of low interest rates. We raised about $230 million in 6.5% perpetual preferred stock and redeemed $200 million in total of 7 7/8% and 7 5/8% preferred. These activities will have a small but beneficial impact to our future earnings and fixed charge coverage.", "The bank markets are also very liquid today, so we're looking at the current environment as an opportunity to potentially recast and improve our line of credit once again. More to come on this in the upcoming weeks. One final comment. You saw in the earnings release we closed on a $175 million loan with JPMorgan to finance debt positions. The nature of our lending business has evolved with the market cycle, and we're finding that best way to increase the probability of our involvement in a deal and the way that best maximizes our retained yield is to commit to the entire debt stack and once we control the debt to subsequently syndicate, an A note either in whole or in pieces.", "A great example of what I'm describing was a loan we made to finance the old New York Times building. We committed to an entire $166 million loan to Blackstone and subsequently brought in a conventional bank lender to take a $116 million senior piece. This enabled us to get an almost 12% return on the $50 million piece that we retained. We didn't have this new loan facility in place at the time but if we had, it would've provided nonrecourse liquidity to bridge the A note portion without burdening the broader balance sheet of the company.", "It's also important to note that this type of loan has not been common since the last downturn and the willingness of JPMorgan to provide this debt is a strong testament to the high quality of our existing loan portfolio and of the loans that we are originating today.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Matt to review the numbers in the quarter.", "Matt DiLiberto", "Thanks, Jim. As I try to do every quarter, rather than just giving a simple rundown of all of our operating results, I'd like to focus on a handful of items that give rise to variances against prior periods or may require some additional explanation. Focusing first on our property operations, as Marc highlighted, combined same-store cash NOI growth was very strong at 4.7% for the third quarter and 5.4% for the full 9 months, trending well ahead of the expectations we set out at the beginning of the year of 3% to 4% and some of the best growth of the industry. Our occupancy remained strong, leasing is being executed at a healthy pace and new rents are consistent with what we projected. Those searching for any negatives in our cash NOI growth this quarter, particularly on a sequential quarter basis, may look to the reported increase in operating expenses. However I would hesitate to call this increase unexpected because it was consistent with both our internal projections and historical trends.", "In the first 6 months of the year, we enjoyed a significant savings and operating expenses due primarily to the temperate winter and spring we had here in New York City. It would be nice to carry that through the whole year, but the summer months did not follow suit. As such, utility expenses were higher by $6.8 million over the prior quarter in the same-store portfolio, primarily in electric and steam costs.", "Keep in mind that an expense increase from second to third quarter is very common as a result of seasonality. Yes, a significant portion of increased expenses can be passed through to our tenants. We have put in place very attractive utility contracts to mitigate our costs, but that doesn't totally insulate us from expense fluctuations.", "One other item to note when comparing our third quarter same-store operating results to the prior quarter, is a percentage rent payment that we received in the second quarter from the Minskoff Theater at 1515 Broadway. This year that payment totaled about $2.5 million and was included in our second quarter rental revenues. This payment is always received in the second quarter of each year and is not replicated or accrued in any other quarter.", "Turning from same-store results to the consolidated income statement. The increase in rental revenues and operating expenses likely appears more pronounced on a sequential quarter basis than most were expecting. This is due in large part to the consolidation of our interest in the West Coast office portfolio, that some people still refer to it as the Ardner-Cobby [ph]  portfolio, for the months of August and September. During which time we owned approximately 2/3 of the equity in the venture and controlled its activities.", "Consolidating this portfolio for 2 months increased our consolidated rental revenues by around $14 million and consolidated operating expenses, including real estate taxes, by around $9 million. With the consummation of the Blackstone transaction, we are no longer the majority owner and Blackstone operates the portfolio on behalf of the venture so our remaining 28% interest in that portfolio will be accounted for as an off balance sheet JV on a go-forward basis.", "Investment income was free from any unusual items this quarter and reflects a reasonable run rate going forward on the debt and preferred equity portfolio before any additional investment activity. More notably though, the $1.1 billion portfolio, which is yielding an average of 9.6% is now comprised entirely of investments collateralized by New York City real estate and none of them are on non-accrual status. Recall that last quarter we recognized $4.7 million related to the accelerated recognition of unamortized discount on our mortgage investment in London, when as moved from the debt portfolio to real estate held-for-sale. As an update, we remain optimistic that the sale of that asset by the receiver will close before the end of the year, ultimately resulting in an IRR north of 20% on our investment.", "In other income, we recognized lease termination fees of approximately $2.1 million in the quarter, about $1.1 million higher than the second quarter, but $600,000 less than what we achieved in the third quarter of last year, when termination income included our share of an $8.7 million termination payment at our property in Jericho, Long Island. Also included in other income for the third quarter of 2012 was an acquisition fee of approximately $1.3 million related to the Pace development site at 33 Beekman and real estate tax refunds of just over $1 million, representing our share of refunds related to legacy Reckson properties in the Suburban portfolio.", "Income from our unconsolidated JV portfolio in the quarter was positively affected by our share of the discounted payoff of the mortgage at the Meadows of approximately $10.7 million. However, the effect of this gain on the bottom line was largely offset by a significant one-time expense item. This expense totaling over $10 million and appearing further down the income statement relates to the write-off of initial issuance costs and discounts pursuant to the redemption of all $100 million of our 7 7/8% Series D preferred shares and another $100 million of our 7 5/8% Series C preferred shares in August.", "Because of the timing of this redemption, our preferred stock dividends were also $500,000 higher in the third quarter than what they will be on a recurring basis. Interest expense was up sequentially, due primarily to the full quarter effect of the $230 million mortgage financing at 100 Church Street, which contributed $2.3 million of additional interest expense in the quarter. In addition, consolidated interest expense was impacted by the on-balance sheet treatment of the West Coast office portfolio for August and September, which added around $5 million to our reported interest expense. These increases are partially offset by the continued sparing use of our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility.", "Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, with only a couple of months remaining, and after giving consideration to the effect of the transactions we announced this morning, we feel very comfortable leaving our previously provided guidance levels unchanged and I look forward to speaking to all of you about our expectations for 2013 in December at our Investor Conference.", "With that I'll turn the call back over to Marc.", "Marc Holliday", "Yes, well, before we take questions, Heidi is going to give a little bit of information as to some of our shareholder activities upcoming over the next 5 or 6 weeks.", "Heidi Gillette", "Hello, again. As noted in the earnings report last evening, SL Green will be hosting its Annual Institutional Investor Conference on Monday, December 3 in New York City. Details of the event will be available next week. If you wish to preregister, or to verify that you are on the invite list, please email slg2012@slgreen.com. Of note, we will be hosting a property tour before the luncheon and presentation this year, likely starting the tour around 10 a.m. so for those of you arriving from out of town Monday morning, please plan accordingly.", "Additionally, given the timing of the NAREIT Conference this year and its close proximity to our Investor Conference, Jim Mead, Matt DiLiberto and Steven Durels will be representing the company at NAREIT, while the rest of the executive team will remain in New York City, focused on the Investor Conference.", "With that, I will turn it over to the operator for Q&A. Operator, please go ahead.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald.", "David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "A couple of quick questions, and it's been a while since I think I've talked to you about the Suburban portfolio. There's definitely some leasing spread improvement in the quarter. But can you maybe talk a little bit about your long-term strategy for those assets? It's a radically different kind of performance stat from your core Midtown portfolio and I'm just wondering how you're thinking about that group of assets today.", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I think, we haven't talk about it directly with each other, but we've certainly been asked a question about what our intentions are for this portfolio of assets and I think the -- we've been fairly consistent in saying that it's a portfolio that we manage at the moment for stability and very aggressive leasing that we try to execute there this quarter. We signed 160,000 square feet of leases, 31 deals, the markdown to mark was only 1.5. So about as close to flat as we've been in some time, which I think means we're getting very close to having right-sized this portfolio in terms of a rental status and our occupancy is in excess of 81%, which bodes very well to the Westchester market, which is 23% vacant and the Connecticut market, which is mostly Class A in Stamford, which is also about 23%, 24% vacancy. So we've got markets that are very challenging Suburban markets. Within those markets are our team is doing a wonderful job keeping the buildings relatively very well-leased and keeping that income flow in place. It's a largely unencumbered portfolio so we have no financial risk, per se on -- no direct secured financial risk on that portfolio and the portfolio has been very stable. There is a point at which -- I mean it's hard for us to predict when we expect those markets will get healthier and I think the leading indicator of that health is going to be when the housing markets in a lot of those Upper Westchester and Fairfield Connecticut markets start to get more robust, more active. And when that happens, there's a lot of ancillary business activity that we think will start to benefit these markets and when that happens, I think you'll see the debt markets return, when the debt markets return, you'll see liquidity return. So at this point, what we've said generally, and the reason why we're over 90% invested in Manhattan, 90% of our assets, 90% of our revenues, 90% of our resources -- it's probably over 92%, maybe, is focused in Manhattan, specifically is because of liquidity, it\u2019s all about liquidity. Liquidity drives new businesses. It drives refinancing opportunities, sales, JVs, et cetera. There's not a lot of liquidity right now in these markets and without liquidity, we're in a very active and aggressive asset management phase and we have a best of class team up in Westchester based in White Plains executing upon them.", "David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "That's helpful. And then if I can just position one follow-up question. Relative to some of the big transactions that you mentioned earlier in the call, it was our understanding that some of those were going to be delayed into next year. It sounds like, and obviously you're much closer to these, it sounds like some of them will happen before the end of the year. Do you suspect that there's any kind of change in pricing around those assets relative to conditions in the market today given delays in decision-making? Any change in the mix of sort of asset value versus forward rent underwriting? Any kind of additional color you can provide relative to those transactions? And I know some of them are a little bit hairy by relative standards.", "Andrew W. Mathias", "Yes. The challenge is every building has its own set of below market leases, above market leases, vacant space or fully occupied. So it's very hard. Sellers have expectations going into these processes and for the most part, what we've seen is patient sellers in New York. So people are not afraid not to transact if they don't get their prices. And the market is giving them prices that are compelling enough for them to trade at. So in the case of 285 Madison, an asset which YNR is vacating to move into 3 Columbus and we had some preferential rights to buy that building, we gave them sort of our valuation of the building and they said, \"Thanks, but no thanks. We're going to test the market.\" And we're able to achieve, significantly -- significantly higher price than we had valued that particular building at by going into the market with getting almost $575 a square foot for a vacant older, office building in Midtown. So it's really -- there's strength in the market, there's strength in a lot of these deals. And we saw a lot of assets that go to contract that I listed out in the third quarter and we do expect some of the big ones I mentioned to be in contract by year end.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your next question is from the line of Josh Attie with Citi.", "Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Can you talk about the composition of the leasing pipeline? How much of it is new versus renewal? And how much is there in the way of growth or expansion from tenants versus taking share from other buildings?", "Steven M. Durels", "Well, I don't know if I ever broken down that granular as far as specific numbers, but I'll tell you that generally speaking on the pipeline, we've got several large transactions that have significant -- or driven by significant growth. We're seeing, I would say, probably in that 700,000 square feet there's probably 1/3 of it is renewal and then there's a big chunk of it, which is filling vacancy.", "Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And if I could just follow up one. One of the leases in the quarter, it looks like there was a very large roll down at 100 Park Avenue. Can you just talk about what that was and why the roll down was so large?", "Steven M. Durels", "The Rothchild deal, which was 2,700 square feet.", "Unknown Executive", "How large are you showing on your sheets?", "Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I saw 23,000 square feet going to $54 from $85. And it seemed to be a big driver of the roll down on what commenced.", "Marc Holliday", "Just hold on one second.", "Unknown Executive", "That's a -- just to clarify, you're coming off the leasing schedule with the total leasing at 100 Park of 23,000 feet, not all of that is mark-to-market. So to Steve's point, the mark-to-market component of the leasing at 100 Park was around 2,700 square feet.", "Unknown Executive", "So otherwise said the other 21,000 feet was replacing vacancy, which is not mark-to-market. So the only mark-to-market negative, if you will, which was, I guess, substantial, I'm trying to see -- it was a substantial roll down was this -- Rothchild, no it was a new and it was replacing the old for 2,700 square feet. So you have like an optic, it is a significant roll down, but it's on inconsequential amount of space is actually absorption over a space that had been static or vacant.", "Steven M. Durels", "Which underlies on a larger point, if you look at the mark-to-market particularly on commenced, that is only 100,000 square feet. So it's very difficult to extrapolate that out to the entire portfolio.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Just on the Cabby [ph]  portfolio, what are your long term thoughts there? You guys are back in the black, no pun intended. So are you guys planning to hold this for several years? Or is your thought that we may see an exit sometime in the near term?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I think what our thoughts are, we were happy to recapitalize that transaction. That's probably still our thought today because that was a 5-year investment that saw the very, very highs, the very lows then the very uncertainty of how everything was going to resolve itself and then a little bit of a victory dance, if you will, at the end because we were able to pull so many different pieces together: subordinate equity, priming mezzanine debt, mortgage extension, new venture capital, et cetera, et cetera. So I think at this point, the portfolio itself is on very stable footing. It's stable because the debt, the mortgage debt, to which I refer, has been extended for upwards of 3 years. And with our new partner, Blackstone, they have brought to the table some capital for deleveraging, such that the only mortgage indebtedness on the property right now is about $700 -- actually it's about $675 million and then total with mezzanine indebtedness is below $750 million, about $746 million. So it's got -- the debt was right-sized, there are reserves established for leasing that are substantial and should be able to take the properties from what was an under-managed situation of around 76%, 77% and not under managed necessarily as a statement about competency but more as a statement about an improper capitalization. Now we think that occupancies can be taken up to well into the 80s, possibly 90% or 92% or so with the reserves that have been put in place. So I think our business plan, if you will, is to allow Blackstone and their EOP subsidiary or manager, if you will, to execute a very aggressive leasing program since we have such low basis in the deal. I think the last dollar of debt tops out at around $167 a foot. So -- and the rest behind that is equity. So that certainly means that we can be aggressive on leasing and we should be able to hit, I would think, our leasing velocity and economic -- our leasing velocity and economic targets. There is going to be a real focus on paring down some of the assets early to amortized the debt even further, but it's way too early for me to give you an estimate on how much or when. But there will be a focus on paring that portfolio down through sales, because the market -- in many of these submarkets has picked up considerably and now we have the flexibility with the restructured debt to start selling assets. So you will see asset sales, I would say, almost certainly in the first year of the venture. And then the rest is to -- the rest of the plan will be to optimize assets and then decide on the best strategy once it's stabilized. It could be exit, sale, recap, JV, partner. Who knows? I mean, it's just too early. But it's that -- it's a transitional portfolio that we're looking to optimize and stabilize and then looking to monetize, if you will.", "David Schonbraun", "Blackstone is very enthusiastic about this -- at this basis. And obviously, their return requirements are significant as an opportunity fund and they feel highly confident in their ability to achieve those returns with this investment. So we're pretty content to ride along with them for the time being, I would say.", "Marc Holliday", "Sitting here with David Schonbraun who is sort of the architect of this transaction is running me through the myriad of numbers associated with this deal and he's fairly optimistic that we're going to be able to recapture our investment basis in this deal and hopefully significant profits above.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And just the second question is, why do you think mezz and structured finance deals have held the way they have? If you think about senior yields have come down a lot, even core funds and opportunity funds, their return thresholds have come down. Why do you think -- I mean it's great for you guys and other people who are in the mezz business, but given all the competition, why do you think mezz and the structured finance yields have been able to hang in there?", "James E. Mead", "I don't think there's as much competition in the mezz arena as there is in the senior debt arena and we have seen enormous new competition in the senior debt arena, which has contributed to the spread tightening from different pockets of guys that I went through CMBS, commercial banks, insurance companies. You don't have that broad variety playing in subordinate debt, and you still have banks and other institutions coming up against risk-weighted capital ratings for subordinate paper, which are crushing and which make it impossible for them to hold this type of paper. So we've not seen as much competition. There's been spread tightening in certain deals that we've seen. But we're still finding more than our fair share at the type of conservative underwriting that we've been originating over the last 18 months or so.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America.", "James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "There's been a lot of talk this earnings season about new and efficient buildings and efficient floor plates, and I think, Marc, in your opening comments, you've mentioned that as well. Can you talk a little bit about your appetite from the redevelopment side for some of the older buildings in town? And then also from a leasing perspective, I mean, some of your older buildings, what's the appetite from tenants for those or how are you positioning those?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I'm not, when you say older buildings, I mean, any building that's not being tapped out is an older building, it's 400 million square feet of existing inventory in Manhattan, most of which dates back to 25 years ago or older. So I just can't -- I mean, it's 400 million feet of space. The characterization of the demand for these buildings that, I guess, not sure what the question is exactly, but were constructed anywhere from most recently, the mid- to late-80s when there was lot of buildings completed to the 70s, wherein a lot of inventory is 50s, 60s, and then there's a small subset of the portfolio which is pre-war. Those buildings are being met a very high demand as evidenced by our leasing velocity and occupancy rates and I think success in driving same-store NOI. It's the value part of the market. I would say that the market, for the most part today, is driven by small to mid-sized tenants looking for affordable rents, and that's why we've done 3.4 million square feet of leasing. This year, we've been delivering to the part of the market. The newer buildings, let's not miss the main message. They're leasing now where they weren't for the past couple of years for one reason only. The owners of those buildings, traditionally, are dropping their rents substantially in order to meet demand because they were unable, in 2010 and 2011, to fill up those buildings. In some cases, 2007, '08, '09, but let's say, 2007 to 2011, they were unable to fill those buildings at the originally pro forma-ed rents or anything near that because I think, what we've always said, it's about location. It's not so much about the vintage of the building, people want to pay to be near the primary modes of public transportation, near the infill locations, which have -- which attract employees today with diversity of services and restaurants and nightlife, as well as convenience, and that's where our portfolio sits and that's why it leases well and we've been able to increase our rents over the past few years while the preponderance of newer buildings have generally been in the newer pioneering or fringe locations where there was a hope or an objective of getting rents to fill those buildings in the -- you pick the number, 80s, 90s, 100s, low 100s and that just didn't transpire. So I think what you've seen this year is a realization that to compete against, I think what you're calling older buildings, what I would call well-located buildings in the infill locations, that the rents had to drop precipitously in those buildings and now, at a level where they're starting to get traction, which is good. It's good for the city, good for those businesses, good for the real estate market to clear some of the idle inventory. And I think there's been about 400,000 or 500,000 square feet signed this year with another 1.1 million square feet pending. So I think my point I was trying to make earlier is eventually, those buildings will fill up and when they do fill up, or at least get closer to full occupancy, then the job growth that the city is experiencing will be imposed almost directly on the existing inventory instead of now sort of arbitraged in the opportunities between existing inventory and new construction.", "James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. But I guess you had also mentioned, like the Coach Building, I assume you're talking about Coach new development.", "Marc Holliday", "I'm talking, about new construction. It is a whole -- I mean, I can through the list, but I would say it's -- there's many more buildings being built than Coach right now. I don't know if -- we can go -- we'll go through the...", "James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "No, no. I guess what I was asking is, or thinking about asking is that, if you're thinking the Coach Building gets underway, does that open up a whole new part of the city?", "Marc Holliday", "I'm talking about new construction in the non-infill areas of Midtown. There's probably 7 or 8 buildings that fit within that profile of buildings. Coach is...", "James E. Mead", "We're talking about the new Coach building, which is on Terra Firma, it doesn't require the platform to be built. So we don't consider it opening up of a new area in Manhattan because it's -- it doesn't necessitate the platform the rest of that development does.", "James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And along the same line, just where do you guys stay now in terms of concessions and tenant demands for buildout?", "Steven M. Durels", "I don't think it's changed in the third quarter versus where we -- what we experienced in the first half of the year. If you're smaller tenants, meaning, under 10,000 square feet, then we've been doing a lot of pre-build spaces or build-to-suit type of leasing. And if you're a bigger tenant, then generally, it's $65, $70 a foot where the space is raw on a long-term lease and the space requires full buildout. And then there's sort of everything in between. There's a lot of deals that we do, a lot of leasing that gets done where it's a contribution to retrofit space. But I certainly haven't felt that, nor have we experienced concessions increasing over the past quarter. And I don't see that trend changing -- I don't see a change in the trend.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.", "Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research", "You expanded the structured finance portfolio this quarter by about $100 million or so, seems like you guys continue to find good opportunities there but very little debt maturities until 2013. Does the book continue to expand towards $1.5 billion as you find opportunities? You looked to sell down some of these existing positions to keep it at the $1 billion level, plus or minus, how should we be thinking about that over the next 12 to 18 months?", "James E. Mead", "Well, we've traditionally had a sales-imposed 10% cap -- 10% of total market capitalization, which if put to $1.5 billion is sort of a level in which we're comfortable at and it's really going to be opportunity-driven depending on what we see out there and what yields are available as to whether we're going to take the existing balance up to that $1.5 billion level or not. But we definitely wouldn't see it going beyond that.", "Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then a question for Steve. Can you give us a sort of update on recent activity, et cetera and thoughts on 180 Maiden, Harper Collins, 280 Park?", "Steven M. Durels", "Sure. Let's start with 280 Park. We are in the early stages of the construction. We spent most of the year doing design developments, but if you've been by the building, you've some of the sheds and protection going up. We've got a marketing for it that's getting tuned up right now. We're exchanging lease proposals for a couple of hundred thousand square feet with tenants, which is encouraging. I don't think we expected to see the level of activity that we have given that it's expensive space and given that we're nowhere near to being unveiling any finished product yet. So we're still feel very bullish about the project. And I can tell you given these design concepts that we're building up, I think it's going to be a spectacular project.", "180 Maiden Lane, we're in the early stages of design and development. Everybody is anxious for it to see some renderings as to what we're going to ultimately do with the building. We don't get the space back from AIG until the middle of '14. But even there, where we have not commenced a marketing program, I would say we've had a lot of guys coming through, kicking the tires. And my biggest problem has been not having the space earlier rather than later. We've got proposals out for -- and I think there's sort of a less than 50-50 chance that we'll land any of the guys we we're talking to right now, but we've got several hundred thousand square feet of paper being traded with people. And I think the strategy there is to capitalize on the building's amenities that we're inheriting, meaning that there's a conference center, there's an auditorium, there's a cafeteria, there's a Goldman Sachs former infrastructure that was invested into the building. And the fact that we're going to be the lower price point alternative for glass and steel construction. And I think that's why we've seen people migrating towards us early in the fight.", "Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research", "And Harper Collins?", "Steven M. Durels", "Harper is -- they're out looking at the markets, they've made no decisions. They've looked downtown, Midtown, we've talked to them about staying. I think they're a complete unknown at this point in time.  But just to remind you, I guess, is that like 180 Maiden, we bought the building with the expectation that Harper would not stay so that if we're able to retain them, it would be big, big positive news for us. But we're expecting they'll leave. We're in design development there. We got that space below '14, and I think it's still early in the game.", "James E. Mead", "Yes, 10 East is one of those buildings that we've programmed for a substantial redevelopment, as Steve said, that's in the process of being designed and developed right now. That's a 2013 redevel, and the Harper counties, as I recall, is mid '14. So we're going to be delivering that space in '14, '15 at a much, much higher price point. And therefore, we when we do go into situations like that, we underwrite very high level of attrition if the rent goes up by a substantial margin in response to the redevel. So we'll see what happens.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Brendan Maiorana with Wells Fargo.", "Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I was wondering if you guys could give an update on the plan for 100 Church, given that you've got the lease that was out announced today and that asset's fully stabilized or is that at long-term hold or is that something you guys have looked to monetize?", "James E. Mead", "We put 10-year fixed rate down on the asset in June. So for now, that's in the long-term stable hold portfolio. We're going to be enjoying more than $26 million of NOI there on our basis, which is going to be probably less than $250 million when we're done.", "Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Question for Steve, I appreciate the pipeline. It sounds like it's up a little bit from where it was in Q2. It sounds like activity is good. Has there been any slowdown in terms of the pace of deal closing, so that -- or has that been pretty consistent with where it was earlier in the year?", "Steven M. Durels", "No. I think just the opposite. If you really look at it carefully though, the beginning of the year for us, we were sort of the opposite where the market was, right? The overall market was pretty slow in the first half of the year. We had record leasing and driven by a number of very, very large transactions in the portfolio. Now, as we came into the third quarter, there's this -- I think there's this perception out there that leasing is generally slow, and I think if you really stop and think about it, it's more slow relative to expectation coming off of a very busy year in 2011. But if you look at more of on a historical basis, sort of on a 10-year average, leasing for this year is only off by about 5%. And in fact, third quarter leasing velocity, market wise, is up over the second quarter. So we've got a good pipeline and had a good second -- third quarter. I think we're going to see good going into fourth quarter and first quarter next year.", "Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And so the pace is good and the rent economics. Your view is that there's any of the sort of commentary of sluggishness from brokers or just overall market perception that there may have been a slowdown. Leasing economics for you guys and pace of deal closings is still the same as you expected earlier?", "Steven M. Durels", "My feeling on brokers is that they are generally very good as sort of the thermometer of the moment. But they kind blow with the wind depending on where things head in the future. So no, I'm feeling like we're holding our own. I think the rents are holding. And to have a bigger conversation, you really start -- need to chop the market apart for various submarkets and various price points.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of John Guinee with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "It's getting late guys, so we'll give you a few easy ones, which means short answers. First, 3 Columbus Circle looks like the tenant, Young & Rubicam, bought that at about $670 a square foot. Does that result in any unusual accounting and/or is there a gain for SL Green based on that transaction? And then the second is, can you discuss the terms of the ground lease reset and what that does for you, both in the short and long term?", "Steven M. Durels", "Let's hit the first one.", "James E. Mead", "I'll take the first one, John. So we did close on the sale of the condo in the quarter. Your base assumption is right or your sale price assumption is right. The usual accounting, and of course, it comes with unusual accounting, is that we don't actually get to record a gain in the current period. We work into the deal an option to reassemble the building at some point in the future based on what happens with the leased premises in the building. The space that [indiscernible] our leases. That means, ultimately, a deferral of the gain until that option is resolved in some way, shape or form.", "Steven M. Durels", "It's worth noting that, that price point was for the weaker part of the buildings. They bought -- their condo portion is in the bottom of the building, so it didn't reflect the premium space at the top of the house, nor the retail.", "Unknown Executive", "We negotiated hard for that reassembly option, if you will, John. We didn't want them leaving the leased premises and owning just an orphan condo in the building. We wanted the ability to sort of put Humpty back together.", "John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then how about the 673 First,  what does that do in the near term and long term for you?", "James E. Mead", "Well, it's a 50-year lease extension. So to me, it's like a wholesale resetting of the asset. And it turns a medium-term leasehold into something that's almost fee or fee like. So I think from that perspective, it's a sizable value accretion. The lease has in it, and will continue to have in it, escalation provisions,  so they'll be -- those rents will increase over time. Matt, I don't know if the next increase is in our numbers you had coming, I mean...", "Matt DiLiberto", "No, there's no adjustment for it yet. So it just closed at the beginning of the month of October. But there will be an adjustment coming as the term with the bumps will require you to straight line the rents back, which will be about $500,000 a month or $6 million a year of incremental straight-line rent expense.", "John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "So you're going to go from $3 million to $9 million a year in ground lease?", "Matt DiLiberto", "That's about right.", "James E. Mead", "That's $9 million a year, which is going to stay flat for how many years.", "Matt DiLiberto", "The straight line, that will be the permanent amount.", "Marc Holliday", "But the cash amount will obviously be lower.", "James E. Mead", "The $9 million is some accounting straight line, but the cash number...", "Matt DiLiberto", "The new ground rent is just under $7 million.", "John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Got you, okay. And then the last question is you guys have essentially about $1.1 billion of structured finance average term of about 2.5 years. When you're doing these relatively short-term structured finance deals, are you able to reserve or have 100% of your income covered out of either current cash flow or the reserves? Or are there essentially interest earned that really isn't guaranteed, if you follow me?", "Matt DiLiberto", "It depends. I mean, it's really deal by deal. In the case of the deal that Jim Mead talked about, the old New York Times building, there -- that's a redevelopment project. So a lot of the interest was reserved at closing, and it's being paid out of the reserve as they lease up that project, invest capital to redevelop it. Whereas, the other deal I've talked about, the restructuring on the far west side, that covers debt service currently so that their interest is being paid currently. So it really depends on the profile of the asset.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Steve Sakwa with ISI Group.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "I guess this question is really for Steve Durels. As you kind of look at the deals that you're doing with tenants currently in the deals that are in the hopper, what are you seeing in terms of space usage per person? And I guess, to speak to Marc's point about job growth, to what extent does that job growth is being somewhat offset by less space per person?", "Steven M. Durels", "Well, I think that was Marc's point entirely, it that some the job growth is offsetting absorption in the market because there's clearly a sort of a generational trend that's here to stay for a while, which is businesses are working to move to more of an open plan layout with many of them adopting the benching concept of their employees working off the equivalent of the trading desk and densifying their occupancy so that they have less square footage per employee. And I think we're seeing that in a lot of different industries. It's not unique to Financial Services. We're seeing it in the other service businesses like accounting, marketing, engineering. We're seeing it in sales organizations. We've even seeing with the city. This is moving towards much more dense operations. So that's driving some of the decisions that are out there. I think it's healthy, overall, for business. There's no doubt about that, that businesses are being more prudent as to how they use the space and they're piling more bodies into it. It also makes it very difficult in the future if they're going to sublease the space. But I think that trend is going to be around for a while.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "It doesn't -- I guess as you guys think about deals, whether you're selling or buying, I mean, to what extent does that force you to potentially change your underwriting criteria as you think about rent growth? I mean, have you altered maybe how you think about the market improving over the next 2, 3, 4 years?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, think we did that back in December. We projected this year basically flat to what was it, 3% to 5% or 2% to 4%, and we're right in that stroke. So Steve, this is not a trend that's like snuck up on us. This is, I mean, you got to go back to December and listen -- roll back the tape on what we said about our expectations for rent and market velocity this year. We are somewhere between dead on target where we might even be slightly ahead. So it is something that we do take into account, it's something we have taken into account and we moderate that as market conditions change. Sometimes, we see a lot of embedded growth in the market and we put in more robust rental growth and often times, we don't and that has given rise to what I've stated on other calls where we often are 10%, 15% below a marketed process, a project that goes to market for sale because we don't put in a high level of growth into our models and haven't for some time now. And as a result, the vast majority of the activity you've seen us do over the past 2, 2.5 years has been kind of more off market, OP unit, opportunistic stuff, not fully marketed deals because our rental assumptions have been in line with the market. So I don't personally think rents that are up 2% to 4% a year is a bad market. It's a neutral market. We've been talking about market equilibrium and neutral markets, and that's where we've been in since we hit about 9%, 9.5%. And that's where it will continue to be until it absorbs further. So we haven't given any guidance at this moment for next year in terms of where we see absorption. And our rent projections headed in December, we certainly will share that. But this efficiency is not a new phenomenon. I mean, firms have been doing this for years and years. Some are satisfied, some will be highly dissatisfied and will rebuild their space again and may -- and go back. It's not -- when Steve says it's a trend, some of the financial companies who are under pressure to cut expenses, I think, are doing this. The majority of tenants that we lease to are not on a benching and trading desk platform. It's still conventional space -- conventional square foot per employee. So this is just something that is particularly for some of the larger tenants, they're looking to gain efficiencies of 10% to 20% of by squeezing more bodies into less space. It could work for them in the near term when they're under the gun to cut costs. It may be a harbinger of bad things to come when they have any whiff of growth or dissatisfaction because they're not going to have a lot of flexibility like they have in years past, and that could give rise to a very -- a very strong position for landlords on new rents when -- given that they'll be -- have no growth programmed into that space.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And I know you guys have touched on downtown a little bit and had somebody ask about 180. But just in general, given how much vacancy there is either downtown or coming downtown, I guess Steve, are using the landlords down there getting more aggressive on rents and making proposals for Midtown tenants?", "Steven M. Durels", "Well, I think there are a number of Midtown tenants that are exploring the downtown market because that's where the cheaper rents are. But that was no different than when we took over 100 Church Street and we saw midtown tenants visit that building as well. So midtown is still a pretty healthy market and I think there -- we are expecting to see, quite frankly, to see some of the Midtown South, Technology New Media tenants who would like to be in that market, come visit the downtown market. I think there's a good shot that we'll see some of that activity at 180 Maiden Lane and elsewhere in the downtown market because the natural place for that industry, which there's very little space available, is Midtown South. And the guys who need a bigger footprint are going to have no choice but to go push a little further.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "I'll keep it quick. There's been a few transactions, unstable actions at best [ph]  so 521 is helpful. I think you said 4.5% cap in place NOI, which I think in the South, you have about 85.6% occupancy. What would the cap rate be on a fully leased basis? Like what's the investor expecting the stabilized cap to be?", "James E. Mead", "I think between 5% and 5.5%.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "And just a more administrative quick one for Matt. On 521, that one's been in the non-same-store portfolio since 1Q '11. Any reason that hasn't made into the same-store portfolio? Is it sort of the transactions?", "Matt DiLiberto", "Yes, I would love to put it in same-store portfolio for all of our reporting. Unfortunately, the rules that govern how we report the same-store pool say you need to own it in the same manner for equivalent periods. And so since we've bought out our partner in the beginning part of 2011, it has not been able to be included in the technical definition of our same-store portfolio. That said, we do, when we present our numbers in our press release, adjust for that situation at 521 and also for 1515. So we do present numbers that reflect them in the same-store pool in our press release, the supplemental has to present it differently because we're governed by different rules in the supplemental.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Marc or Andrew, I'm just curious if you still plan to be a seller of assets beyond the stake in 521 as you had previously mentioned. And as part of that, just curious why -- maybe this was incorrect reporting, but we thought we had read that you were marketing, or planning to market Tower 45, which seemed curious just given the high vacancy there. So just curious, your thoughts on that.", "Andrew W. Mathias", "I think the 521 gives us -- getting that deal done at a value and a structure that we're really pleased with gives us a lot of flexibility to either sell additional assets or take our time. Tower 45, we are talking to several people about that asset and sort of entertaining some interest there that came unsolicited and prompted us to go through -- start a little bit broader process. But we're going to be patient sellers. And I still think, as we said on the last call, we think it's a decent point in the cycle to definitely recycle out of some assets, which we achieved through 521 and Tower 45 is one of many of the buildings that have seen unsolicited interest, sort of on an ongoing basis. And we're sort of always evaluating our various options with respect to most of the portfolio.", "Marc Holliday", "I would only add, if it's not that, it will be another one. I mean, well, the answer is yes, we'll sell more assets. We always do and we will. Probably, not this year because this was likely it for the year. But I'm sure in the next 3 to 6 months, we'll have hopefully something else that we can harvest and have good news about.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just last question for me would be, is it too early to talk at all about some of the future expirations? I think sometimes the press has written about Credit Suisse, Citigroup may be looking at other options when those leases expire and those are obviously quite large. Is there anything that you would sort of say about that today?", "Andrew W. Mathias", "Fortunately, we got a lot of term left with each of those tenants and I would say, we're in front of these guys. We have great relationships at the very senior level with all of our top tenants, certainly those 2 guys included. So we're in sort of constantly in dialogue with these guys. And as their needs and thoughts evolve, we're in front of them and we'll be -- stand ready to work with them and hopefully meet all their needs as they change.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I'll try to be brief. In the structured finance portfolio, there's about $600 million, give or take, maturing in 2014. How confident are you that you're going to be able to backfill that volume over the next 2 years such that the income coming off of that portfolio isn't lower if we roll the clock ahead 2 years from today?", "James E. Mead", "Well, it's tough to exactly predict the future. I mean, I would just note, that we had a bunch of repayments last year, Matt, 6 and 6 1/5 [ph]  and a couple of other very lumpy repayments and worked hard and we're able to rebuild the book up to where it is today. Right now, we're enjoying the position of dominance in this business in Manhattan and we don't foresee that changing. So we'd hope to be able to replace the investments. But we're always -- we're risk adjusted return investors, and if we don't feel like debt is the right place to play at that point, we think equity is a more interesting place to play, we may take their money and redeploy into equity, or we may redeploy them into more debt over -- as those assets pay off. It just really depends on what the investing environment is like at that time.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Is it fair to say that the improvement that you're noting in the CMBS market over the past 6 months works against you a little bit in deploying additional mezz and junior mortgage capital out the door?", "James E. Mead", "No, because they still -- the improvement has been solely in price. The rates are just falling through the floor. Their underwriting standards have not gotten more aggressive. And Moody's and S&P are still relatively tough in terms of where they're cutting off investment grade. So the competition among the lenders has really just been on price, not been on proceeds.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then really quick. Any comments on the assemblage you have on Vanderbilt next to Grand Central in terms of more clarity on the timing of the development breaking ground there?", "Marc Holliday", "I would say more to come later on that. Maybe in December, we'll have some more commentary. But at this moment, no change from what we have previously stated, which is in process.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies & Company.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "The question I had was just a follow-up to Ross' question. Just trying to understand the structured finance portfolio a little bit better and just again, you guys are getting some attractive yields on it, if that involves having to go lower in regards to lower tranches of debt to get the same type of yield, and if that's really changing the credit calculations of that portfolio.", "Andrew W. Mathias", "I mentioned very earlier, we've been very consistent in terms of our underwriting on this portfolio within the last 24 months and it hasn't changed. Were still finding our sweet spot in the 70% to -- 70% to 72% maximum loan to cost-type investing and acquisition deals.", "Operator", "Your final question is a follow-up from the line of Josh Attie with Citi.", "Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Yes, as a quick follow-up for Michael Bilerman, just sticking with Andrew, can you just talk about the composition of buyers for New York assets and whether that has changed at all over the last 6 months, particularly as it the rates on new financings have come down and has that driven any sort of other buyers and has it changed the composition at all?", "Andrew W. Mathias", "It's so hard to generalize, Michael, because it's -- and I go through the list of 450 Lexington was RXR, 350 Madison was RFR, it was a buyer we had not seen been active in the Manhattan market for some time and then all of a sudden, bought 2 assets, bought 350 Madison and 285 Madison. 575 Lex was a joint venture of Normandy and New York Life. New York Life was an insurance company we hadn't seen been active on the equity side. They bought 2 assets this year, 575 Lex and 1372 Broadway. 1411 Broadway was Ivanhoe Cambridge. 386 Park Avenue South was Billy Macklowe. I mean it's all over the board in terms of individual investors, domestic money, foreign money, it's always -- and every year, on Investor Day, I show you the slide with all the money flying in from all the different Porsche  [ph] sectors of the world. We're going to have, maybe, a new sector this year in December to be revealed. But it's very difficult to sort of characterize. There hasn't been a rush of buyers for the latest deals in any one sector that you can sort of generalize.", "Operator", "And that will conclude the Q&A session today, ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to turn it back to Mr. Marc Holliday for some closing remarks.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay, thank you for the elongated call for those of you that's still on, and we look forward to seeing everybody in December.

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Lacey, and I'll be your coordinator for today [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Heidi Gillette. Please proceed.", "Heidi Gillette", "Thank you, everybody, for joining us. At this time, the company would like to remind listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from the forward-looking statements that management may make today. Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the company's Form 10-K and other reports filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also during today's call, the company may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G.

To be added to the conference's e-mail distribution list or to be -- or to preregister, please email slg2013@slgreen.com. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. Heidi, thank you very much, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. We're going to try to keep these initial remarks somewhat abbreviated so we can get to the many questions we generally have on this call. Obviously, if it wasn't sort of apparent from the release itself, we were very pleased with the results that we announced late yesterday afternoon. We're running generally ahead of our December guidance in many of the areas we had outlined for investors about 6 or 7 months ago. And while we are running ahead, we're running ahead in a manner that, I think, is very much consistent with our expectations that have been communicated throughout the first half of this year on our last conference call and also at NAREIT. It's important to note that we've achieved this success in a wide array of areas, not -- no 1 single area: such as leasing, where you see the leasing activity and mark-to-market was very robust in the second quarter; investment sales, where we're executing on our strategy of monetizing gains and harvesting selectively, where we're finding best pricing; financing activity, such as the refinancing and upsize of 1552 Broadway and 1560 Broadway, which we did in this quarter; and certain operational efficiencies that Matt and Jim can expand on, which point towards the benefits of scale and the benefits of an improving market. Redevelopment efforts are well underway at projects at -- like 280 Park Avenue and also, our project at 635 Sixth Avenue. And in the pipeline for next year, we're finishing our design work on projects like 180 Maiden and 10 East 53rd Street, which we'll be commencing on those projects sometime towards the end of this year. But with those being some of the prominent areas, let me focus on a few key areas and identify the factors that I think are driving our success in those areas.", "Notably, on the leasing front, we had a second quarter achievement of about 770,000 square feet of leases signed and that represented about 12% mark-to-market. And there are really 2 factors, I think, that drove that mark-to-market. The first is good underlying core competition for space and increased asking rents by us and other landlords in the market. The second contributing factor was a higher-than-average proportion of renewal deals, where we can better drive mark-to-market on renewal deals than we can on new deals. So unclear whether we'll see that continue for the balance of the year but generally, we're still feeling very good about our original guidance in this area, and we are feeling very good about the direction of rents and net effective rents and velocity as this market continues to improve.", "Pipeline. We're, notwithstanding, 1.4 million square feet signed year-to-date. We still have over 1 million square feet in pipeline with most of that amount, the vast majority being either leases in negotiation or leases out for signature. So I think it's fair to say at this point that based on what we've achieved and what we can forecast for the remaining 5 or so months of the year, that we could well eclipse 2 million square feet of total leasing and may settle out somewhere around 2.3 million square feet, plus or minus, based on current activity.", "The other point to make here is that the activity is very broad-based, both in terms of types of tenants, price points, individual buildings and sub-markets. We're really experiencing that strength almost across the board, and it's good to see that these results are not being driven only by certain segments of the market, or only in certain buildings that have -- based on vintage price point or degree of redevelopment, but it really is a very broad-based recovery that we see.", "And looking at the market as a whole, the experience we have in our portfolio, I think is, you can extrapolate to the market at-large, where leasing activity was exceptionally strong in the first half of the year with 12.5 million square feet leased, representing an 11% increase over and above the same time period in 2012 and over 1/2 of that amount being new leases as opposed to new -- renewal leases. So all very positive. And Midtown, which I think has -- there's been questions about Midtown's velocity and viability in light of activity in Midtown South and downtown, but Midtown held its own and leasing activity was up 18% year-over-year and it led to 3 major markets of Midtown, Midtown South and downtown. So that was very positive by our estimation as well. Things that are driving that Midtown recovery is -- not the least of which is subleased space, which is back down under 2%, again, which is a very tight -- indicative of a very tight market, 450,000 square feet of space that was available at 1290 Sixth Avenue through AXA, has now been leased to tenants of -- such as Morgan Stanley, Sirius Satellite and R\u00e9my Cointreau. And there's other examples of that throughout Midtown, where we're seeing a winnowing of direct and available space through subletting.", "This -- it can also be seen in Midtown South, but it's already -- the metrics down there are much better to begin with. So it's a very tight market and there's not a lot of availability, direct or sublet in that market. So we see the spillover, largely headed downtown, and we'll probably get into that a little bit later on Q&A. But I think one of the more exciting prospects for downtown is largely spillover tenants from Midtown South, that Steve Durels is going to expand on more as kind of an emerging trend that we think we'll see over the next year or 2.", "The leasing activity, obviously has to be driven by something very tangible and it's the job growth that we continue to experience in New York. Private sector job growth is still trending positive at a rate which eclipses most estimates and certainly, our and the city's estimates. Net private sector job growth is running 1/3 higher than the same period in 2012, with 67,000 jobs having been created in only the first half of the year, office-using jobs accounting for approximately 8,000 jobs of that amount. Contrary to prevailing views, 1/2 of the office-using job growth came right from the finance, insurance and real estate sectors, within which securities alone added 2,000 jobs net. The big 5 banks reported first quarter results, showing strong profits with a 40% increase in investment banking revenues year-over-year and compensation set aside at these same institutions were up 16.5%.", "So these statistics continue to conflict with the refrain that I sometimes hear when I visit with shareholders regarding a perception of a very sharp reduction in the financial sector job growth, which by everything we see and by the statistics, just doesn't bear out.", "Looking at the investment market. The investment yields through the first half of the year we see are largely unchanged. Whatever modest uptick there's been to REIT, and I know there's been a lot of scrutiny and focus on the rising tenure. And clearly, rates have risen more on the long end than on the short end where movement has been relatively small to nil. These rate increases have been largely offset by investors' expectations of rising rents, leaving cap rates essentially unchanged, and we've taken advantage of this market by selling into it in a way that Andrew will expand upon shortly.", "But the notion that the recent backup in the tenure had any kind of material effect on investor appetite for good solid Manhattan commercial product, at fairly aggressive cap rates, I think is not substantiated at this moment. And notwithstanding the deals we've announced, as either being sold or in contract, we have other deals in the market. So I think we've got a pretty good look at realtime investor appetite and demands and targeted yields for product, and we still feel like that's all very, very strong and will continue to be as this market improves.", "Given these solid operating and investment results, we've been asked about revisions to our FFO and FAD guidance. Current run rate FFO seems to indicate an upward revision is in store, but we're going through and finalizing our reforecast now. I think it will be done literally within the next 2 to 3 weeks, and I think we'll likely address any upward guidance in FFO sometime in the near future. However, as it relates to FAD guidance, we have some identified capital savings, particularly in second-generation capital where the spend is running behind what we had originally projected. So we're ahead in terms of where we expect it to be, and we're going to be upping our FAD guidance by $0.20 for the full year 2013. Matt and Jim can expand upon that in the Q&A portion of this. But with that said, hopefully, that's a good overview of where we see the market, our portfolio, some of the drivers of demand.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Andrew for a little more color on some of the dynamics he is seeing on the asset side of the equation.", "Andrew W. Mathias", "Thanks, Marc. Our big announcement of the quarter was our contract to sell 333 West 34th Street, which we announced several weeks ago. This asset was acquired in 2007, strategic to our overall relationship with Citi, our largest tenant, and a year when a lot of people would look and say, it's a tough year to be buying assets back at the top of the last cycle. We stabilized the asset and retenanted it with a minimal capital program. And we're able to sell the asset for nearly a $20 million gain. So really successful execution by our leasing team and our construction and operations teams. This fully stabilized asset sold for $630 a foot to 4.4% going in cap rate, so it's an execution we were very pleased with.", "The quarter otherwise in the investment market was really characterized by huge deals, which were going down in the city. Just going through the list: 1211 Sixth Avenue; Worldwide Plaza; 237 Park Avenue; 75 Rockefeller Center; 605 Third; and 1345 Sixth Avenue; 650 Madison; 125 West 55th Street, just to name a few of the gigantic deals that were announced this quarter. So we're looking at a serious spike up in terms of velocity and sales volume. And these are all deals we've underwritten, taken a close look at. They all traded on the basis of a very strong expectation of rental growth, and we will be involved in the financing side in some of these deals but more to come on that in the future.", "On the structured finance side, we have a very solid pipeline in the business with $211 million of net originations year-to-date and more than $100 million of deals in application. The rising rates seem to be creating some opportunity for us to at least maintain, if not moderately increase our yield on our ultimate hold positions there. And we continue to be very active talking to all the buyers, that I mentioned, of those properties and more of the smaller properties that don't make sort of the big building list. And they're still in active demand from mezzanine and preferred equity and bridge loans. The continuing trend also in the city is residential values rising and a lot of office buildings being looked at for conversion to residential, a lot of land trades. The Park Lane Hotel went under contract reportedly last week, really record-breaking prices for any assets that have a reuse as residential, hotel or some combination of both. And that's a trend we expect to see continue as we -- the strength in residential sales across really all neighborhoods of the city and very strong residential rents are buttressing a lot of conversion plans and new construction plans on the residential side of the business, which is taking some office inventory offline. So helping to eat away at the vacancy rate, Marc mentioned, in Midtown and downtown. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Matt.", "Marc Holliday", "I think, Matt, is just going to -- just a quick statement on the FAD, Matt. A little more meat on the bone there as to the, what's behind the $0.20?", "Matthew DiLiberto", "Sure. As many of you noticed, our capital trend through the first 6 months of the year are trending ahead of what we expect to be and we're spending less, as Marc stated. This is primarily attributable to the Viacom capital that we focused on at the end of the year and again, in the first quarter. Recall, we had projected for the year around a $53 million spend. We don't control any of that spend. It's all through the discretion of Viacom. Through June, they had spent none of it, so we revised that number significantly lower. And also, to Steve's credit, the leasing that has been done through the first 6 months of the year has been -- has had less capital attributable to it than what we had originally forecast. So those 2, in combination, account for the $0.20 adjustment to FAD. I'm obligated to say, FAD is funds available for distribution. The difference between FAD and FFO are noncash accounting adjustments and second-generation capital.", "Marc Holliday", "Thank you for that clarification, Matt.", "Matthew DiLiberto", "SEC obligates me.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. So with that, we'd like to turn it over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I guess, Marc, just following up on your comment about landlords raising rents. Can you give us your thoughts on where you think rents are today on a net effective basis versus the bottom? And then I guess year-over-year and then how fast you think they could grow?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I don't have an answer for you, Jamie, on net effective. I can tell you nominal rents. Nominal-taking rents are up from the very bottom, I would say, on average about 25% off the bottom. Net effectives would be up greater than that. And I don't know, it's a very hard number because it's all over the place in terms of free rent and concessions and the degree in which people are paying out broker commission. So that's tougher, but -- and you have to amortize over the term [ph] leases, whether it's a 10-, 15-, or 20-year deal. So I can only tell you that nominal-taking rents are probably up 25% off the bottom and concessions are up -- would put that number up significantly more because you could see where concessions were at the trough, if you will, in '08 versus where they stand today in '13. And we've made significant improvement particularly on renewal rents. Renewals we're pushing, in some cases for bigger renewals, almost like new concession deals at the bottom. And now, I'd say, the renewal market is much more in line with what we traditionally see in terms of limited free rent TI and better achievement on mark-to-market.", "James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And then just some comment on rents as well.", "Marc Holliday", "Well, the outlook on mark-to-market, I haven't really changed our view from the beginning of the year, which was 3% to 8% in mark-to-market. I think, I said on the last call and I would reiterate on this call, that we're probably trending towards the higher end of that. I think year-to-date, we're probably, combined, 7% first and second quarter average. It's very hard to predict what we're going to achieve over the next 2 quarters because it really depends on which leases in particular are expiring at any given quarter. Sometimes you may have a tenant coming off of very high effective rents, sometimes very low. But on average, I think the high end of that range is still where we would target things. And I think looking out to next year, it would not at all surprise me if the guidance cracks into the double digits, 10% or more. So I think we're into that part of the market where you start to get above-average increases after a few years of kind of low single-digit increases.", "James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, and then my second question. There's a lot -- in talking to brokers, it sounds like there's the most concern over the Sixth Avenue corridor, especially if Time Warner moves. Can you talk about your outlook for that submarket if Time Warner does move, and kind of how you think your portfolio will perform?", "Steven M. Durels", "Well, remember, we've got 2 buildings on Sixth Avenue, one is 1350 and one is 1185 Avenue of the Americas. We have leases out on 1185 that will take the building to 100% and with no near- to medium-term rollover in the building. 1350 is equally pretty well locked down and we've got a little bit of space. We have some deals pending. So I think both those buildings are in a very healthy place. Overall in Sixth Avenue, you saw a lot of subleased space coming into market, and the best example of that is the AXA sublease. But that got pulled off the market very, very quickly. I think everybody was shocked by how quickly Morgan Stanley and Sirius stepped up, and at the end of the day 450,000 square feet was pulled away. And I think you've seen some other moves along Sixth Avenue where there's been reasonably good velocity, both on direct deals and on sublease deals. So from our perspective, we're not -- we don't think there's anything endemic about Sixth Avenue. It's sort of the way Third Avenue was a couple of years ago, where it happened to be a confluence of events where there was a lot of inventory that came on, and it's repaired itself over the last couple of years. And Sixth Avenue is going through that process as well. The nice thing about it is Sixth Avenue is seeing a good diversity of types of tenants that are doing deals over there.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of David Toti with Cantor.", "David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Given some of your early commentary on relatively stable caps, better absorption rates, the residential bids heating up, are you guys looking at more opportunities within your own portfolio for an acceleration of redevelopment or development? I would think that given a market that's looking a little bit more frothy, some of those opportunities might surface a little sooner than expected?", "Andrew W. Mathias", "You're talking about conversion to residential or...", "David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Well, just general site redevelopment, some conversions. I mean, the opportunity should begin to expand theoretically right in a frothy market?", "Andrew W. Mathias", "We've got a lot of redevelopment going on now. I mean, we're -- we have a -- with 10 East 53rd, 180 Maiden, 635, 641 Sixth, 280 Park, we're in sort of full redevelopment mode here. So I think we're looking certainly for properties that have alternative uses than maybe good sale candidates. And -- but in terms of redeveloping what we have, that's the path we've been on. I mean, we haven't bought a large office building since last March because we're completely focused on our existing portfolio, getting our buildings redeveloped and restocked.", "Marc Holliday", "Yes, there is -- Dave, I just want to be clear. I mean, we have more opportunity in the portfolio to mine. I think there is a prudent and physical limitation as to what we can and should be executing at any one time. I'd say right now, from my vantage point, we're full tilt, and you're seeing -- you're just starting to see the benefits of that effort starting to flow through into our earnings, which I do believe will accelerate into the coming years. And we've tried to be very specific in guiding people as to the 15 or so properties you're going to largely see that coming from. And we're generally on or ahead of schedule, with respect to all of those properties. So we're very focused on what you're saying. We'll execute kind of to the fullest we can. But at a certain level, you always have to run a bit of a hedge book, I think, and just in case, the unforeseen in a year or 2 or whatever, you don't want to get caught too far out, obviously. So we're right where, I think, we need to be in a balance between kind of redeveloping and mining and mining the internal opportunities.", "David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. My second question is a bit left field. Have you guys considered the Empire State building at all? That's speaking of froth, I understand that's been -- there's been sort of, an acceleration of bidding and potential outcomes there?", "Marc Holliday", "What -- I'm sorry, had we considered the Empire State building? Look, we look at everything and I wouldn't -- there's a fairly substantial portfolio of assets all comprising a part of what is potentially going to be a new REIT. Empire State, maybe being the most notable or notorious of the bunch, but there is a -- do I have it here? There is, I think, 18 total properties within ESRB and thank you, I got my notes right here. And I'd say 10 or 12 of those, from my recollection, in Manhattan, the rest in some of the suburbs, suburban markets that we deal in. And I think it's all very interesting. And we've been sort of watching it play out. Tony Malkin seems to be navigating the waters on his way towards trying to get something done and it seems that they're on that path. But like anything, when no different than us or anybody else, when you expose your assets to the markets, you're going to get a lot of interest from the private market as well. And I think there is generally a perception that the private market valuation for that portfolio probably exceeds what would likely be the public market valuation. That's my opinion only. But that's, I would say, it's an educated opinion from having looked at it. And I'd say the private market valuation, probably somewhere between exceeds or well exceeds public market valuation. But we'll have to just have to kind of wait and see how that deal moves along and where the ultimate IPO valuations come out and what kind of disparities exist. But you could be sure that in a market this efficient, there's somebody out there that's going to be looking at public versus private. And if there's a feeling that there is a disparity there, then there will be activity and you've seen that activity. People have sailed in, what I assume are unsolicited offers, and you'll probably see more of them.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Josh Attie with Citi.", "Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "What are your thoughts on the new supply that may come online, both on the West side and World Trade Center? It's greater now as a result of the pre-leasing that was recently completed. Has that changed your view of fundamentals over the next few years at all? And also what submarkets do you think will be most impacted?", "Marc Holliday", "Yes, I'm going to -- Steve Durels will sort of answer that. I just want to lead in by saying, I don't think the pre-lease, the leasing or pre-leasing adds to it. I think it's really -- subtracts to it from my vantage point because even though the pre-leasing hadn't occurred, the inventory was out there on the market, World Trade, Hudson Yards and whatever else that you referenced. So that space is starting to become leased in whatever building. It's not limited to those. We bought some properties building over on 8th or 11 Times or downtown or Hudson Yards. Any leasing of any of those projects that are being heavily marketed to tenants, I think is, in my opinion, a net positive because it takes space off the market. Obviously, with taking space off the market it might add to the market elsewhere. But net-net, most of these deals that you're seeing signed up tend to be new deals plus expansion. I'd say they're rarely contraction, although sometimes. And you have other space being taken off the market in terms of conversion to residential like 1107 Broadway, like the Sony Building on Madison, and like a whole host of other buildings. So you've got some new supply that I think has been known. You've got other supply being taken off. And net-net, you've got some pre-leasing, which I think, overall for the market is good. But as it relates to specificity, addressing the question, Steve?", "Steven M. Durels", "Well, just to build on Marc's point, the -- there's been a -- there was a drag on the market for the past couple of years because there's not a big tenant that was out there shopping the market that wasn't using out of the Trade Center or Hudson Yards as sort of leverage in a negotiation on pricing and forcing landlords to stretch to make deals. So the -- much like 11 Times Square for a considerable period of time and some other big blocks over the past couple of years, were drags on the market. So as those -- as that product gets leased up, it's a great thing for the health of the overall market. And combine that with the fact that in a 400 million-square-foot market, it's not a lot of inventory over a 10-year period. These tenants are going to move, these buildings will lease-up, that's a good thing. The overall market needs a certain supply of new -- of new construction, and the types of businesses that are going there are the few types of businesses that absolutely want new construction, doesn't mean it's right for all tenants out there. And I think it's -- overall, a positive thing for us and that's not going to force a lot of new supply coming on in the near future because the delivery of these buildings are still years away. So I think net-net, it's great news. I think it's great long-term sort of on a -- from a 30,000-foot level looking at what's that -- what makes it a healthy market and keeps us a world-class city. And I think from a supply-demand side, it's great because it gets the competitive product off the market and starts to shift some of the leverage back to the landlords as the big blocks get a little of the way.", "Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And you also mentioned, I think, a spillover from Midtown South to downtown, could you elaborate on that? And also update us on the activity at 180 Maiden?", "Steven M. Durels", "Yes, so as you can sort of answer that, the answer to both of those questions come in the -- at the same time. We are seeing more and more Midtown and Midtown South tenants both kick the tires and starting to negotiate deals downtown. Case in point, being World Financial Center and World Trade Center seem to be in legitimate, active lease negotiations for some big blocks of space with GroupM over at the Trade Center for about .5 million square-feet, Jones Day and Scotiabank for a combination of another .5 million-square-feet over at World Financial Center. It's something that we've said all along we thought was going to happen as far as downtown goes. We're early to the game at 180 Maiden Lane, but I can tell you, we've got 4 or 5 real proposals on our desk for blocks of space in that building, ranging between 70,000 and 150,000 square feet that we're not -- we don't, I would not signal that we have a chance of landing any one of those deals, but I think the fact that our -- that building is on the shortlist of some of these tenants, some of which are coming from Midtown, is indicative of where we think the building is -- where the demand is for that product. And we're seeing it from a couple of different types of industries, we're seeing it from nonprofits, we're seeing it in publishing, insurance, technology, and education. So we've got a good diverse group of tenants looking at the building, at the price points that we've been targeting for that product.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "As you guys look at both adding to your finance book and then you guys are obviously always in the market looking at buying a physical property, where in some of the spillover markets, whether it's outside of Midtown South, so maybe Garment District or Penn Station Area, or the in-between, not-quite downtown but heading down towards that way, do you guys see better opportunity on the financing side or on the direct side?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, there hasn't been a lot of availability, a lot of sales in South of -- on the way to financial district, as you put it. So yes, I think most of our activity has been financing. But we sort of take them as they come. And there have been some very good leasing deals made, particularly more towards the financial district, 101 Sixth has been very active, and the Soho area has been very active in terms of leasing. So that's where we probably see the better direct opportunities. Penn Station, we just -- we've sold 333 West 34th Street in Penn Station. So it's not been an area we've invested much capital in.", "Mariano Lopez Peliza - Center for Financial Research and Analysis, Inc.", "Okay. And then the second question is, just going to 10 East 53rd and 180 Maiden, just curious if you guys can provide some dollars that may go into these buildings. I don't know if it's normal TIs or maybe there's some bigger redevelopment, maybe not the grand scale of 280, but just some of your thoughts as the capital needed for both of those buildings. And then on 10 East 53rd, just because of the floor plate size and some of the park views, if you think there's any optionality of some of the upper floors to do something other than office?", "Marc Holliday", "I think that as it relates to any specificity on dollars on 180 and/or 10 East, that's probably going to be sort of front and center in December. Because it would be -- just be too speculative at this point given that we haven't nailed the designs down. And then once we get the designs, we got to send it out, do the CDs and price it. So I mean you can look at the amount of square feet that's available in both, and just multiply that by a TI and commission package. I mean, that is fairly easy to get your hands around, kind of a leasing cost aspect. But as to the redevelopment, I mean, we've got several different scenarios from modest to less modest to very aggressive and we just haven't decided. As the market is improving, it kind of encourages us to invest more, because we think we can invest more and then get more top-end rents. Especially at 10 East 53rd, I would say that's one where we've got a wide range of decisions to make and opportunities. We'll sort of finalize that, if you will, over the next, I'd say, 3 months is probably the right time frame. And then, sometime around November, December, I think we'll be able really, not only give you some numbers but get into what we're doing and who we're targeting, and the kinds of rents we expect to achieve. But again, those are -- we're probably just a quarter too early on those to give you guidance on the redeveloped portion. But again, the leasing cost portion is sort of just math to a certain extent.", "Mariano Lopez Peliza - Center for Financial Research and Analysis, Inc.", "Okay. What about any optionality at the upper end of 10 East 53rd, is that one of the potentials?", "Marc Holliday", "When you say optionality meaning...", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Like just take one [indiscernible] smaller floor plates, the park views that maybe...", "Marc Holliday", "By the way, 10 East -- the way we're looking at 10 East right now is it's perfectly positioned and it's going to be an excellent redevelopment for us. I mean, financially that's going to be -- I don't want to use a euphemism, home run, but that's going to be a very strong product for us. We're going to be marketing that product very aggressively as a lower-cost provider to some of the top-end rents that are being positioned in and around that area. And I think the question is, who are we targeting? And to what degree are we going to spend and orient the redevelopment to achieve those rents? And that's really what Steve and Ed Piccinich are spending a lot of their time on, and we're close to that conclusion. But yes -- I mean, Steve, at the top end of the building, what's your expectation of rents today given, let's say, the middle-of-the-road redevelopment?", "Steven M. Durels", "I think we're -- if the building were fully redeveloped today, I think the market for those top 7 to 10 floors is in the $110 to $115 a square foot range.", "Marc Holliday", "Yes. So well in excess of our underwriting, which is probably -- should be apparent just because of where the market has headed. And we're going to execute on that shortly.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.", "Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research", "Steve, can you talk about where the leasing stands in a couple of major vacancies in the same-store portfolio, 100 Church, 125 Park and 120 West 45th?", "Steven M. Durels", "I'm sorry, repeat those. 100 Church...", "Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research", "125 Park and 120 West 45th, which I believe are probably the 3 big vacancies in the same store?", "Steven M. Durels", "Well, remember, 100 Church has been fully leased at this point. You may not see it in the stats where the leases have commenced. But at this point, the -- we have -- we're at 99% leased as far as signed documents and we have leases out on the last 1%. So that's pretty good news on that one. 125 Park, we announced the deal today where we just signed a deal with -- 2-4 deal with Pandora Music for a little over 50,000 square feet. We have leases out on another 50,000 square feet, and we think we're on track to get that building pretty much stabilized, hopefully by the end of the year, assuming that we close the deals that we're working on. And Tower 45, which is a different kind of product, it's a small space building where we've had rollover that kind of started -- expirations that started last year and will carry through a pretty good roll over this year and next year as a result of D. E. Shaw, who was migrating out of the building to Sixth Avenue. That's basically come back to us. So we've been doing a lot of deals. I mean we've -- I think we've signed half a dozen leases in the past 8 months. We've got 4 or 5 leases out right now. And because it's small space, it -- you don't get a lot of ramp up time for it, its the kind of stuff that leases once it goes vacant and once we start to spend some dollars on improving the floors on. So we've got -- and we're getting good rents over there. That building is -- always shocks us as to how high the rents are on the upper floors there. We've been landing deals in the $62, $65 price point, and I think that's great for a size 3 building.", "Mariano Lopez Peliza - Center for Financial Research and Analysis, Inc.", "Okay. And then Marc or Andrew, can you talk about what the demand is for the Suburban assets these days given the price point and where yields are for the CBD stuff? You sold one, or are in the process of selling one. Is there a potential to sell additional assets at decent prices that are well leased at this point?", "Marc Holliday", "I think it's probably a little early for the Suburbs. The financing markets are still not terribly liquid and the sale markets -- there's not a lot of transaction activity. So we're still in a hunker-down mode out there trying to block and tackle and do as much leasing as we can in some very challenging markets.", "Operator", "And our next question from the line of Brendan Maiorana with Wells Fargo.", "Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Steve, your response to Rob's question about some of the lease-up in a couple of the buildings, is that -- can I read between the lines to suggest that you still feel pretty confident in the year-end occupancy number, which I think was in the high 95s?", "Steven M. Durels", "Yes, yes. I think we're on track to hit the number that we provided guidance to.", "Marc Holliday", "Yes, I think that number tends to be well ahead. It's just convincing Matt to actually show it in the statistics. He's got a fairly disciplined rubric between commenced, signed, leased, occupied, whatever. But the -- I would say, the actual activity as and when it properly shows up at year end is probably to the positive of what you might see looking at the portfolio as a whole at a point in time now just based on passage of time in order to get those reflected in the stats. Matt, maybe you have to advise your...", "Steven M. Durels", "I think what we're saying is that the leasing velocity is there, we're going to close enough deals. And if there's any kind of slippage, it's simply a function of timing because the deal signs today but starts 30 days later and it falls outside the quarter. But the velocity is clearly there to support the guidance.", "Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, yes, that's helpful color on the disconnect between the leasing activity and the occupancy change in the quarter. And then just, also this is probably for Steve too, but I think on the value add portfolio, my recollection was that you guys are expected to get some decent leasing done at 280 Park this year and 3 Columbus and I know you signed some leases in both of those buildings during the quarter. But can you maybe give us an update on the prospect list for the balance of the space that you have at both of those properties?", "Steven M. Durels", "Yes. 280 Park Avenue, we signed 2 50,000 square foot deals in the quarter. They were -- both deals were in the bottom half of the building, in the base. Both of whom were rents that were in the $92 to $96 starting rent, which were certainly on the high end of where we had underwritten that part of the building. Both -- one of the tenants was financial services and we've seen pretty good prospect towards coming through the building. The development side of it is well underway. We're on track to open up the Park Avenue lobby right about Thanksgiving time. So that when we do the Investor Conference in December, we should expect to have an opportunity to walk people through and really start to unveil what this building is going to be all about. And I can tell you that when we do tours over there, it is -- now the people could sort of touch and feel it, the brokerage community, the prospective tenants, they get why we think this is going to be one of the 2 or 3 best buildings on Park Avenue. 3 Columbus, we've got -- we're down to sort of a handful of spaces over there. We've got part of the second-floor, we did the big retail deal with CBS for the ground floor and 1/3 of the second floor, so we've got part of the second floor, a little bit of the 16th and 17th floors and we've got 3-tower floors. So we're kind of down to 150,000 square feet of office spread about the building. We think the top portion of the building will go to sort of a small spaced program to financial services, we just chopped up a floor and signed our first pre-build lease over there last week in a rent in the low 70s. And I think the middle of the building will continue to sort of attract the Y&R type tenant, the Young & Rubicam type tenant who's our anchor tenant, going more to the creative type industry. That's where were focusing our marketing.", "Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Yes, that's helpful. So just for clarification, 280 Park, would your expectation be that -- or should we assume that you get another anchor signed by year-end? Or is that more likely to be a '14 event?", "Steven M. Durels", "No, I think that's a next year event. I think there is a -- that building seems like it's, because of its price point, is likely to trade sort of on the 1- to 2-floor type of trade. It'd be nice to say we're going to get a big media anchor but I think, ultimately, it's -- we're going to knock it off in 1- and 2-floor type deals.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Can you talk a little bit about Citi at 388-390 Greenwich and just talk about when would you expect to know when they make a decision as to whether they stay or they go?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I don't know that we are in a position to answer that. I mean, they have 7 -- years plus on their lease. And like a lot of tenants, they're kicking tires, looking, talking with us, talking with others. But I don't -- I mean I don't know if it's imminent, next year or 5 years. I mean it's just -- I guess it's as and when they're ready to make a decision. But I don't think -- this early in the process it would be pure conjecture on our part.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Can you talk a little bit about the potential development that 42nd and Vanderbilt and where that stands from a timeline perspective, given your view on where rents may be trending in the city?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I think we're -- the timeline we put out there December is exactly where we are at. The pacing item before there's any real initiation there is the Midtown East rezoning proposal that has to be fully -- has to go fully through the ULURP process and then be voted upon at the end of the year, so that is step 1. And then step 2 would be project-specific, which would start towards the end of this year and approvals carrying over into next year. I think we -- that's consistent with what we had set out for people and I think we're still very much on that track. Recall that there is a Sunrise provision in the current iteration of the proposal, which doesn't really allow for the bulk of the construction to occur prior to the middle of 2017. So that hasn't changed. And although, maybe it will, we think it should. But that's yet to be seen. And so we're on track, but it's going through its necessary channels in order to first get the zoning in place.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Do you have a view in which of the mayoral candidates would be the most positive for SL Green?", "Marc Holliday", "No, not at this point. We're familiar and have dealt with many of them and there's several candidates that I think would be favorably inclined towards continuing the positive aspects of what has helped this city to be at the point it is in terms of business activity and quality of life and security, et cetera. So I think we're just going to continue to monitor and stay close and we'll see how it plays out.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Curious about the condition of the market. I don't know if this is for Steve, maybe. At what point -- and we sort of dance around a little bit, but at what point do you see the market becoming a landlord market again if you were sort to handicap it? I mean traditionally, we've seen -- and the market's been in kind of the state that it's in, large tenant A followed by large tenant B requirements in the market, act and then all of a sudden, we start to see a tightening. But I'm kind of curious, are those tenants around and/or what would it take for us to sort of see one of those tenants for these conditions to sort of change in your favor?", "Steven M. Durels", "Well, I think, you'd have to see availability down around 9% and -- but we're -- the fundamentals are certainly there, right? You're seeing these big chunks of sort of subsidized, low-rent type spaces getting pulled off the market, so that's fundamentally, that's a very strong thing as far as the supply side goes. You're seeing tenants out in the market, big tenants out in the market shopping and making long-term commitments. You're seeing a greater number of smaller type deals at $100 a square foot being done than at any time in the past. You're seeing an improving national economy and a very strong local economy. So I think the fundamentals are there and it's at a point in time that job growth continues to get us to a point of supporting the demand that we'll enjoy that spike in rents. We saw it a couple of years where rents certainly spiked 15% in 1 year because the way the market was trending. And tenants in the brokerage community certainly were counseling their clients that rents were poised to continue to spike for the long-term, and it's coming, but it may not be in the short-term but it's around.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "What -- along the same lines, what are you guys underwriting in terms of market rent growth in your submarkets as you see some of these assets crossing and even as you look to sell some of these assets in the next 2, 3 years?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, depends on the building. Depends on the submarkets so it's hard to generalize. But I think we're generally looking at somewhere between 15% plus, which is very conservative. So it's not -- it's not really -- it's a tough question because the better question is what's the market underwriting. And what I said in the previous call is that the market seems to be underwriting rental growth over the next 3 to 5 years of as much as 30% to 50%. I mean the fact that our bias tends to be a little conservative at the top and more aggressive at the bottom, that's just the way we execute the business. So if our estimates are 15%, 20%, 25%, depending on building, depending on market, with greater growth in some submarkets and less in others, and the market at large is 30% plus, I would -- I mean, you'll take from that what you want to take from that, as to who's right and who's wrong. The deals being brought today have very heavy rental growth assumptions and they're being capitalized in this equity that wants to stand behind very heavy growth assumptions. We're a little more conservative. We could be wrong, could be right. But I think more importantly, whether it's us or the market, there's a view that over the next 3-plus years there's going to be significant growth, just based on the job growth in the city, which is what I spoke about earlier and Steve just confirmed. If you have 100,000 jobs, private-sector jobs, added annually and a good proportion of those are office-using, you're going to drive down vacancy and you're going to drive up rents. So at the moment, it seems to be that the job growth fundamentals in the city are very good and therefore, people are very optimistic about where rents are headed. We have -- still have about half a dozen questions remaining. So I would -- if we've spent a lot time on the leasing in the market and we can do more. But if -- to the extent we're going to be starting to cover some ground we've already covered, if there are any other questions dealing with any other topic. If not, we'll just stick with the leasing.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Steve Sakwa with ISI Group.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "This should be very quick. First, Matt, on that $20 million of savings from the Viacom deal, is that just a deferral or is that natural savings of your part meaning they're never going to spend it?", "Matthew DiLiberto", "So the full $20 million, Steve, isn't Viacom. I would say Viacom is probably 3/4 of that. It's a deferral in that they still are entitled to the money. But again since we don't control it, I can't say whether -- when that is deferred until.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So it's more just a timing issue as opposed to the natural real savings.", "Matthew DiLiberto", "Accurate, exactly.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And then just for Steve, on that 1 million square feet that you have on the pipeline, I'm just curious, how much of that is early renewals, tenants coming to you like the teacher situation, and how much of that is actually for the roughly 5% vacant space that you have in [indiscernible]?", "Matthew DiLiberto", "It's sort of about 2/3 of new deals and 1/3 of renewals on a rough count.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of John Guinee with Stifel.", "John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And maybe this is something that you need to think about and get back to us on, and maybe Ed has this off the top of his head, but 1 thing that's incredibly interesting about the conversion from office to residential or hotel is that when you go from gross billable square foot to New York board of realtor's net rentable, you're actually leasing 110%, 120% of the building, but when you get down to a net salable square footage, it's much -- maybe 70% -- 60%, 70%, 80% of the gross square footage. So there's a huge gap between New York City net rentable office measurement versus salable. Then you've also got different issues in terms of what floor plate size works and what doesn't work for conversions. And then you also have a situation where you've got just incredibly different valuations for land to the extent that's available on the island. Is it possible for Ed or someone to give a very, very quick tutorial on that or is that something you maybe talk about offline?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, Ed is dialed in remotely because he is on a job site right now. But Andrew, you want to -- you've done a lot of the underwriting on the potential conversion and the -- what John is saying is accurate. There's an extraordinary loss of salable real estate in the conversion from commercial to resi, and that does act as a hindrance in some, but not all cases in doing that. So do you want to quickly...", "Andrew W. Mathias", "In a lot of cases, office loss factor is 26%, 27% generally, so the conversion back down to gross and then to sellable, a lot of times you're looking at between 30% and 40% shrinkage from rentable office to sellable residential. And I think that's pretty consistent across the deals that we've underwritten. It doesn't get much more efficient than that.", "John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And then what square footage is sort of the maximum floor plate for which residential or hotel might work?", "Andrew W. Mathias", "It sort of depends on where the core is and how much span there is from the windows to the core. The core depth, the city maxes out around 30 feet, the city code. So beyond the 30 feet, the space is technically not habitable. So you wind up with storage units or -- it used to be home offices but they really -- they discourage heavily home offices without windows that a lot of people treat as bedrooms. So you really, you want core-to-glass ratio -- core-to-glass depths of less than 30 feet. And generally side core buildings set up better for residential because you can put a hallway up the middle and sort of branch the apartments off of it. But it totally depends on the building. We've seen floor plates as large as 50,000 feet, probably, and obviously, smaller floor plates work great, generally.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Tayo Okusanya.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Just had a question about the structured finance portfolio and how we should think about yielding some of that portfolio and how large it could get, especially in light of our rising interest rate environment?", "Marc Holliday", "I think we've said consistently, we try to keep the books somewhere around 10% of assets, which is about where we are now. I think, there's always some fluctuation. In the [indiscernible] I think it went from 1 4 to 1 2 with a pay off, but we had some originations in the pipeline. I don't think you can always time things perfectly. But I think kind of within that range, somewhere, we're going to stay. And I think we'd not only [ph] keep deals either through kind of creativity taking down stacks and kind of breaking up pieces or, as you said, when yields rise, obviously it tends to get a higher yield. So I think we've been able to keep our yields relatively consistent. We think we'll stay in that range and in terms of outstandings, we'll kind of a remain in the range that we've been for the past couple of months.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then also, regards to the Midtown rezoning, it seems like there's been some news recently that, that may involve a bit more residential. Just wondering if that has any impact on 1 Vanderbilt and how you think about that development project?", "Marc Holliday", "I think that it's great to have the optionality worked in for us to evaluate, and there are clearly certain sites within the rezoning district that'll benefit more from residential than others. We happen to have what we consider to be an extraordinary retail and commercial site and location. And now, we'll assess separately the residential viability and compare it to what we've already underwritten, if you will. So I don't think we have the conclusions there. It's great. It makes sense, we think, for that flexibility to have been worked into the proposal because most of the successful submarkets we see today are 24-hour submarkets where you have live, work, recreate, and not just one or the other. And even by working it in, it's not that Grand Central is or probably could become a prevalent residential market given the -- just given the extraordinary inventory commercial space. But like I said, I think that having that option makes sense, obviously, enough people did say that the city went back and revised its proposal and we'll evaluate whether it has any applicability to our site.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "At the risk of asking another market-related question, just curious if there's something you think we should asking about that we haven't so far?", "Marc Holliday", "That's a good question. Well, why don't we turn it over. Jim and Matt have been a little bit sidelined in this Q&A today, which is not customary. So I'm going to turn it to you guys and if there's a particular thing, Jim, that want to get through on what I think is as important as everything else we're discussing but hasn't gotten a lot of play today, balance sheet, liquidity, metrics, Moody's [ph], things like that. What -- why don't we just cover that for Vincent?", "James E. Mead", "Sure. I think that if we were talking about the balance sheet, the balance sheet has come along in the same way that the rest of the company has come along. It's -- we've taken a number of opportunities over the last 6 months, year to really work on our maturity schedule to maintain our liquidity. We accessed the market for equity through the sale of 333 West 34th street, which was enormously efficient for the company. At the same time, we've been deploying capital carefully into high-returning investments, not just to add preferred equity but also investing in our redevelopment program. And so I think that as we look at where we are today, we have never been stronger from the standpoint of our balance sheet. As we talk to our lenders and we talk to the rating agencies, we've gotten across to them that the wind is behind us in terms of the market performance that the -- overall, we have no maturities, material maturities, coming up in the near term. We have very few maturities in the next couple of years. We've maintained an incredible amount of availability on our credit facility. I think we only have $40 million or something outstanding on it today to -- it's a $1.2 billion credit facility. And we've done a number of things to extend our average maturity of our debt portfolio, or of our loans that we have. So overall, I would say consistently with the evolution of our market and the improvement in our leasing and everything else, we've also, as well, put to bed any kinds of things you would think of as being important to address in our balance sheet, while maintaining liquidity and the ability to invest going forward. So I think that's substantially what we would get across, what I would get across in terms of our activities for the last 3 months and also the last year.", "Operator", "Our final question will come from the line of Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "I know your comment on cap rates for buildings are unchanged. But I'm wondering if the rise in rates has adversely affected the probability that you might sell the land fees at 885 Third and 2 Herald?", "Marc Holliday", "No, I don't think so. I mean I think it's often what you see in cases like this is the underlying rate rises and the risk spread or credit spread shrinks such that the overall rates of return people are looking for are not terribly unchanged. So I think that we have a number, not a number, but we had several deals that are out there in a somewhat formal or less formal way as we always do. We're a buyer and a seller and we're always looking for those points where we think we can kind of get the best execution on the margin relative to our goal. So we, I think, sell as much as any REIT. Certainly any of our peers out there where we are active buyers but we're active sellers. I think the fees today are still extremely attractive, notwithstanding a little run-up in the treasury. Because as I said it's...", "James E. Mead", "Some of the buyers were looking at diffusing the in-place debt. So those -- defeasance costs have actually gone down as rates have gone up.", "Marc Holliday", "That's a good point. So it's not as -- everyone likes -- well, not everyone, but a lot of people like to draw a sort a linear distinction between the 10-year U.S. Treasury in real estate. I think that's dangerous. I think it's not -- doesn't correlate all that well. And I think it's much more about, in some cases, with that kind of asset overall rate of return and kind of a point of view as to where cap rates and values and rents are headed. And in the near term.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "So I'll be rooting for a good price on this. And then last question is, just curious if you guys are feeling bearish about your acquisition volume guidance just given how competitive the marketplace is out there?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, say it again?", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Acquisition volume.", "Marc Holliday", "Acquisition volumes? Well, I think, we had broken it down to a few different areas, right? Retail -- office, resi and retail, right? I think of the 3 probably, office will trail behind the original guidance. I think resi retail -- I don't have the guidance here in front of me, but just knowing the pipeline and where I think roughly we had guided in December, we'll probably -- we wouldn't modify anything there. But on the office front, I would say, we've been a bit more careful and judicious in terms of how we're going to deploy capital in that asset class. And even though we're bullish on rents, a lot of that, as I mentioned earlier, is reflected in the cap rates and rates on return. I think that the market is balanced for office. I don't think it's heated, I think it's balanced. But we tend to look for value-add redevelopment off-market opportunities. And at this point in the cycle, there are fewer of those than there were 3, 4, 5 years ago. So our plate is very full right now in terms of mining internally the opportunities from acquiring those properties over the past 3 to 4 years. And I think that's where the focus will be, unless we see some compelling opportunities hit the radar screen.", "Okay. Thank you. It's -- we've made it through the queue.

Please proceed.", "Heidi Gillette", "Thank you, everybody, for joining us, and welcome to SL Green Realty Corp.'s third quarter 2013 earnings results conference call. At this time, the company would like to remind you that listeners -- during the call, management -- sorry, the company would like to remind listeners that, during the call, management may make forward-looking statements.

To be added to the conferences email distribution list, please email SLG2013@slgreen.com. [Operator Instructions]", "I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. Thank you, Heidi, and thanks to all of you joining us this afternoon. We would like to provide you with some color on certain factors influencing our market and on the third quarter's financial results, followed by your questions. Overall, we're still seeing very good market fundamentals, which enabled us to execute our business strategies that we've enumerated throughout the year, including new purchases like the retail, residential and commercial project known as The Olivia; redevelopment of growth assets out of that value-add portfolio like 280 Park Avenue, 3 Columbus, 635 Sixth Avenue, to name a few; sales and harvesting of hard-fought gains like the recently closed 333 West 34th Street; major leasing signed and commenced, like the new leases with Bloomingdale's and the law firm of Meister Seelig, which were signed in the third quarter; and structured finance originations, which exceeded $180 million in total and still provides a very attractive risk-adjusted return after we sell and syndicate out senior pieces of that capital stack.", "Underpinning these favorable market conditions is the continued strength, diversity and vibrancy of the New York City economy, which added another 88,000 private sector jobs this year through August, only through August of 2013. This is well ahead of the city's initial forecast for year-to-date, which was about 54,000 jobs, and I think you're likely to see a revision upward in November, ending the year somewhere right around that 88,000 total job creation number. While only 10,000 of these jobs are classified as office-using, that still represents over 2 million square feet of new demand and counters the refrain I sometimes hear about the shrinkage of the labor force in New York. This simply isn't the case, and hasn't been, since the recovery began in 2009.", "Of particular note, the closely watched FIRE sector is essentially flat for the year through August and Wall Street profits for the first half of the year was $10 billion, which was roughly on track with last year. While I think expectations are that the second half of the year will be less robust, it will still be a very profitable year on Wall Street, at least as things look at this moment.", "Switching focus to the leasing front, I read with interest last night some commentary from analysts that looked at 440,000 square feet of leasing as a deceleration and possibly a signaling of a slowing market. I don't think anything could be further from the truth, and I also think it's probably somewhat flawed to measure the leasing market in terms of signed leases in 3-month increments. I think it's better to look at the picture over year-to-date of 1.8 million square feet. Actually, 450,000 feet signed -- or 440,000 feet signed is on track with 1.8 million per year, that's not through 3 months. And looking out over our pipeline over the next 3 months, we see very encouraging signs, not the least of which is almost 100,000 square feet of leases already signed in October and then another 1.2 million square feet of leases that are either out for signature or in negotiation and pending. That's about as high as we've had our leasing pipeline at any point in the past year. And in speaking with the group, just prior to the call, it's our estimate at the moment that approximately 750,000 feet in total of those leases will likely sign in the fourth quarter, which would put it on track with last quarter's roughly 750,000 feet, which represents near all-time highs for the company in any quarter and would end the year at about 2.5 million square feet leased without any exceptional bias towards any one tenant.", "So I guess you'll read into it what you want to read into the third quarter's leasing results, but from our vantage point, and I presume that's why everyone's dialing in, is to hear our thoughts and commentary on the matter, we look at the pipeline as robust. We think the market is very balanced. And we think demand is reasonably good. And as this demand continues to clip along, there's going to be a need to look at how we're going to be able to house this new tenant demand into the future, and we get to the discussion about East Midtown rezoning. This is a very important rezoning proposal that's been put forth by the city to be voted on by the City Council sometime in the middle to end of November, of next month. They will be voting on a plan which would result in a limited number of sites receiving bulk and density increases beyond current zoning, including our site located right across the street from Grand Central station at what is known as 1 Vanderbilt.", "We believe the passage of this new zoning is essential for incentivizing the development of new buildings in one of Manhattan's most desirable commercial districts. The City's proposal is putting density right where density belongs, surrounding one of the busiest rail transportation hubs in the country, with over 1 million commuters and visitors daily. This establishment of a district improvement fund, from which developers can purchase air rights at a cost of $250 per square foot, subject to future increases, is being established to fund necessary transportation and other important public-realm improvements, which were unveiled by the city within the past few weeks.", "We've come this far and we certainly hope the Council will approve this rezoning proposal to encourage the selective renewal of East Midtown's commercial inventory. Another note on leasing, as we've commented on in the past, we continue to be engaged with Citigroup on an extension of their lease beyond 2021 at 388-390 Greenwich Street. We believe that we presented Citi with the most compelling offer, containing substantial economic benefits, flexibility, certainty of execution, iconic architecture and the most desirable neighborhood today, to live, work, play and eat, Tribeca.", "We're focused, very focused on making this happen, but at this point, we can't comment further on the status of any details associated with this particular transaction.", "So the combination of, I guess, all the factors I touched upon, including, primarily, leasing up the growth portfolio, same-store mark-to-market increases in rents, expense control, all have enabled us to guide towards a midpoint in earnings that is 13% higher than just last year. This earnings momentum, which we foresee continuing into 2014 and 2015, in conjunction with improving FAD and cash flow numbers, enabled us to reward investors with a sizable dividend increase, which Jim will speak to the rationale of the underlying -- the amount of that increase, a little later on.", "But for more color on the capital, the investment market, sales market and some of what we're -- how we're fine-tuning our strategy in light of very, very enthusiastic market conditions, Andrew is going to take you through the next few minutes.", "Andrew W. Mathias", "Thanks, Marc. Third quarter saw a continuation of the themes we've been seeing all year, all leading to a very strong sales market. Interest rates continue to be well under control, with the 10-year treasury again reaching 2.5%, leading to a liquid debt market. Spreads continue to be very stable. Some spreads, including on the floating rate, that seems to be compressing again. Note that liquid debt market, combined with enormous inflows of foreign capital, is creating an environment where assets are trading for untested, unseen numbers in all different parts of Manhattan. The latest example of this was 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza, where a large Chinese conglomerate bought the deal on an all-cash basis, signed a hard contract, beating out a litany of residential developers and other traditional sort of New York bidders. They all were topped by a Chinese conglomerate, which is the theme we've seen throughout the year. Chinese capital, Norwegian capital, other sovereign wealth funds, all targeting New York as their primary entry point to the U.S. and all targeting the U.S. as an attractive investment market where they want to increase their investment allocations.", "Additionally, alternative uses continue to drive a lot of these transactions, as the residential market, both rental and for sale in New York, continues to appreciate and continues to drive significant transaction volume. We participated in this frothy market with our sale of 333 West 34th Street, which Marc referred to. And further, we've put 1350 6th Avenue on the market to test pricing levels for a prime 6th Avenue asset. In addition to 1350, we're exploring other recapitalization strategies with respect to other assets in our portfolio, trying to find the exact right mix of deals to best improve our asset allocations. These transactions all serve to demonstrate a widening gap between our actual at the market NAV and market views of our NAVs, which in a lot of cases, including on 333 West 34th Street, badly trail the market prices we're able to achieve.", "We also continue to contract and sell properties in the Arden portfolio in Southern California, and sold a property in Stamford, Connecticut, this quarter as well.", "On the structured finance front, we have continued very strong originations in our portfolio. We have an active pipeline for fourth quarter and we continue to be the market leader in originating primary positions and syndicating both senior and pari-passu positions with great success and at great profitability to the company. For example, in August, we closed $160 million acquisition loan on a B-class asset on Madison Avenue. And in early September, syndicated $110 million senior mortgage, leaving ourselves a prime high-yielding $50 million junior position on that asset. We have more transactions like this in the pipeline and feel very confident about our abilities to keep our balances roughly where they are and keep our rates of return consistent with our current rates of return.", "We're also adding some fixed-rate positions with longer duration to help balance out prepayments over the next 2 to 3 years. We do view these yields as sustainable, given our 15-year track record of originating high-yield paper in the structured finance program, and look forward to continued originations and profitability.", "And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Matt, to talk about earnings.", "Matthew Diliberto", "Thanks, Andrew. The first 9 months of 2013 have obviously been very profitable for the firm. And with only 3 months left ago, we see a clear path to finishing 2013 with earnings well above the expectations we set out last December, even after taking several nonrecurring charges throughout the course of the year, including a noncash charge of around $7 million this quarter, relating to accounting balances of a tenant who vacated their space early.", "Based on the performance of the first 9 months and our view of the next 3, we took the opportunity last night to increase both our FFO and FAD guidance significantly. Our FFO guidance range was increased from $4.90 to $5 a share, to $5.12 to $5.16 a share. This increase is due to the performance of our real estate portfolio, which, in a strong and strengthening market, is performing in line to slightly ahead of our expectations. Certainly leasing, as well, outpaced our initial guidance.", "And due to the performance of our debt and preferred equity portfolio, or as Andrew alluded to, our ability to source new deals, has provided a relatively stable outstanding principal balance throughout the year, with still more pipeline left to close in the fourth quarter, while maintaining a robust average yield that currently stands at 11.2%. In addition, our earnings this year have benefited from some other income events, which are generally not provided for in an initial guidance due to their uncertainty.", "With regard to FAD, which adjusts FFO for GAAP-related items and second-generation capital expenses, are increasing guidance from $3.10 to $3.20 a share to $3.51 to $3.55 a share, not only reflects the increase in our FFO expectations but also takes into consideration the continued slow pace of spending by Viacom who, through the third quarter, had yet to spend any of the capital they provided under their 2012 1.6 million square foot lease renewal. We've layered in about $15 million of expected spend for Viacom in the fourth quarter of 2013.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Jim to touch on the dividend.", "James E. Mead", "Thanks, Matt. We announced that dividends would be increasing by 52% to the annual rate of $2 a share or a quarterly rate of $0.50, beginning with the dividend that will be declared later this year, for payment in January 2014. As many of you know, it's not really in our nature to pay out more than we have to, and we continue to have plenty of places to invest our capital. So the reality is that the increases, because our taxable income is increasing, and as Andrew said, we've got some asset sales planned that would also have gains that need to be sheltered. So while we are managing our taxes to have as low a dividend as possible, the $2 for 2014 is our best guess at the moment. And if anything may be light if we close on more property sales. And in that case, we'll have to revisit our dividend level unless we adopt other strategies to shelter or defer gains.", "What's clear, though, is that at $2 a share, we still have room to grow and we'll likely need to grow over time. Our payout ratio will be modest, in comparison to other office REITs. And as we move forward into 2015 and beyond, we expect to see sizable growth in our income stream from the lease up and stabilization of the portfolio of growth assets we purchased since 2010.", "I'm now changing topics for a moment. I also want to say a few words about an important achievement this quarter. We received an upgrade in our -- to our outlook from Fitch, which is the step that precedes receiving their full investment grade rating. The analysts at Fitch really understand us well, and in fact, they made their target ratios more accommodative earlier this year as they became more comfortable with the security of our operating cash flow and our focus on reducing balance sheet risk. So this is a great accomplishment for our team, led by Matt, and puts us right on track to get our second investment grade rating, having already achieved investment grade from S&P a couple of years ago. Thanks.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. So Heidi already went through some of the details for the upcoming investor meeting, right? So hopefully, that will be the next opportunity we'll get to make a fulsome presentation on these topics and a host of many, many other topics that we'll be preparing throughout November for a day that we consider one of the most important days for us in terms of our communications with our -- with you, folks.", "So we look forward to that, and I guess, at this point, we'll open up the line for questions and answers.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vincent Chao, Deutsche Bank.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Curious, just on the rent spread for the quarter, obviously, there was a big one lease that skewed it quite significantly. But just given the size of it, just wondering if you could provide some more color on what was going on there? I guess there was a bankruptcy replacement, but just curious what caused you to mark the rent down so much on that one roll over.", "Steven M. Durels", "Yes, that one lease was that 810 Seventh Avenue where we had a hedge fund that had a little over 17,000 square feet. And they had signed at the top of the market a few years ago, in the last cycle. And the rent was in excess of $100 a square foot. So we leased it at a healthy rent, but on a mark-to-market basis, it watered-down the averages for the quarter.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. You would replace it at market rent, though, you think?", "Steven M. Durels", "Yes, we replaced it at a full market rent, and I think it's arguably, probably, a below-market-concession package. Because we inherited a very nice installation, so we really just gave them some modest money to redecorate.", "Marc Holliday", "Yes. That deal, as I recall, Steve, was 0 TI. So, obviously, for a new tenant, that's dramatically below $40 to $50 average for a new tenant. And I think it was only 3 months free rent, which -- so there's no adjustment for -- on a net effective basis, it's actually much higher. So we stripped it out. So you can look at it both ways, with and without, take your pick. But if you look at it with that lease, understand that, that was a brand-new lease done with almost nothing in the way of new concessions.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And just -- I know you said the lease pipeline is very strong and very broad-based. I was just curious if you could just maybe provide a little bit more color on what you're seeing between the different submarkets in Manhattan in terms of demand activity, that kind of thing?", "Steven M. Durels", "Sure. The good news is like we said last quarter, is that we're continuing to see really no one pocket, geographically, drive the demand, nor one industry. Really, all across our portfolio we're seeing good demand at all price points. Sort of the value-play type tenant, that $45 to $50 kind of tenant, is active in the market. The very high price-point type tenant, north of $100 for top floor space, that seems to be back in the market, much more so this year than last year. And then, on the types of tenants that we're seeing, we have active either leases-out or term sheets being negotiated with tenants in technology and media businesses, transportation, financial services, legal, publishing and a good-size lease-out with a consulting firm. So no one user group is driving the demand, and I think that's one of the healthiest things. And last point, I think, worth making on that is a couple of the buildings that were laggards last year, for instance 711 Third Avenue and 810 Seventh Avenue, where we had very slow leasing last year in those properties, have good momentum this year, with active leases out. 810 Seventh is on track to be at least, until we get some more space back from future roll, up to a 95% occupancy. In 711 Third Avenue, half of my vacancy there has leases out. So that drives a lot of why we're encouraged about what we're seeing in the marketplace.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay and just last one, just in regards to the commentary about the 10-year. Obviously we had a spike there and it's pulled back again more recently. It sounded like you're exploring some other potential sales. Is that -- how much of that is driven by what's going on in the treasury markets today? Is there more buyers that have sort of -- does it help you from that sense? And how are you thinking about sort of taking advantage of this pull back here?", "Andrew W. Mathias", "And I don't think -- I don't think when it spiked out to 3, it didn't really have a material impact. And in fact, we printed 333 West 34th Street at just about the high of the 10-year treasury market probably this year. The buyers, as we've said, are just not that sensitive to relatively small moves in rates. So I'd define it as 25 to 50 basis points. I just don't think it makes a material impact. People have a view that the markets continue to tighten, rents are going up, and because of where spreads are, the cost of debt is still, from a longer-term historical perspective, whether the 10-years are 3 or the 10-years are 2.5 or 2, the all-in cost of debt is still very attractive, and that's driving these buyers more than month-to-month moves in the treasury.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee from Stifel.", "John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Great. Well done, guys. Kind of a big-picture question for you. It looks like your next mayor is going to be Mr. de Blasio, and depending on who you listen to, he's anywhere from a Clinton centralist to a very far left. Talk about what that's going to do to your business and also to operating expenses and how your operating expense increases may be mitigated by your lease structures.", "Marc Holliday", "I'm sorry, John, the question was?", "John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "The question is it looks like de Blasio is going to be your...", "Unknown Executive", "On expenses.", "John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Expenses. Just how property tax is going up, any other aspects of your business going up and how you might mitigate those increases by, vis-a-vis, your lease structures?", "Marc Holliday", "Yes, I don't -- I wouldn't equate the potential win by de Blasio in November as in any way, connected to real estate tax increase. I mean, I think everyone always has a theory, with incumbents and with new administrations, that real estate taxes become a source of potential revenues if other sources cannot be identified. But I think that the tax burden on the commercial sector is very full and, relative to other sectors like, particularly some of the residential sectors, arguably overtaxed. And because the real strength in the market right now is much more oriented towards residential rents and sale prices, versus the commercial rents, which are increasing but not to the same degree, I wouldn't necessarily conclude that real estate taxes on, for instance our portfolio, will come in to attack any more or less so than increases have been experienced over the past -- in this current administration, where taxes have gone up. Now a lot of that tax increase does get passed through to tenants until a date of reset, when that tenant expire or vacates. But -- so there is, certainly, a lot of interim protection on any kind of tax increases. But we do model very routinely, conservatively, these tax increases going forward. And I think we've got a very good handle on that and whatever increases occur get phased in over, generally, a 5-year transitional period and a lot of that gets passed through the tenant. So I can't speak to the very, very long term of where things might be headed, but certainly, I would say in the near term, near term as defined the next 3 to 5 years, I don't see that as a particular area of risk to us and particularly relative to other areas that may be more at risk.", "John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then a second and last question. If you look at your structured finance book, your originations run about $200 million a quarter and you redemptions run about $100 million a quarter. And during the last 5 quarters, your weighted average yield has increased 180 basis points. What are you doing differently to cause that yield to go up so much in a pretty competitive environment with a lot of people in the space?", "Andrew W. Mathias", "I think the average yield is skewed up by certain extremely profitable transactions that we've had, outlier profitable transactions like the Sony Building, which I think we did a case study on. And our average origination, I would say, has skewed up slightly to be more profitable. That's solely because the senior debt markets have gotten more liquid. So when we're originating that $160 million loan that I spoke about, there are simply more competitors for the $110 million senior mortgage that we syndicated and that drives down price. So whereas we used to be syndicating that senior mortgage at 400 over LIBOR, today, we're syndicating at 300 over LIBOR. It's literally that kind of spread compression. And we're seeing increasing amounts, particularly of German banks and U.S. commercial banks, coming into the floating rate, transitional loan sector, which is further driving down spreads, which is a terrific dynamic for us.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson.", "Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research", "You sold a couple of assets in the Arden portfolio this quarter. How much are you seeing value recovery there? And is there more harvesting that can occur near-term or were these select assets and much of the value harvesting out of that portfolio is that going to be further off in the future?", "David Schonbraun", "This is David. I think we've seen significant value recovery over the past couple months. Part of it is the market in general. Part of it is now that we have the right-size capital stack, we're leasing up the properties and kind of doing the right thing and creating value. So it's a combination of the market and us, together with Blackstone, creating value. So I think we've sold kind of well in excess of where we thought values were 1 year ago. We're going to continue to harvest the portfolio. I think, both of us intend to sell assets as they become ripe and we intend to cycle out of it over the next couple years.", "Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then, Marc or Andrew, I mean, given the commentary on Chase Plaza and competition for assets out there, I mean if you guys continue to harvest out of your own portfolio and sell deals, where does the capital go? Do you guys expand the structured finance portfolio, given the higher yields there? Are there still deals at the margin that maybe require some redevelopment that you guys -- or still could be competitive from a capital standpoint? Can you just talk about, from a capital deployment, how you see the next sort of 6 months shaping out?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I think, we're -- how you've seen the year unfold is probably a good indicator of where we would see things over the next 6 to 12 months, and that's with money going into kind of varied sources. A lot of it is headed towards redevelopment, because right now that is an enormously profitable place to be and a rising rent environment is improving your own building stock, which typically is not quite as costly as bidding for new product. And for $100 a foot or less, in many instances, we can move rental points $10 dollars a foot or thereabouts, or $7 to $10 a foot. So that -- we have an enormous pipeline of redevelopment for next year, which is very capital-intensive, including 10 East 53rd Street which, as the market gets better, I think our scope of program there continues to be upgraded towards the top-end rents. And that's an investment that we think is going to turn out really well if the market continues on its current trajectory. Then we've got 180 Maiden, which is going to take some level of repositioning and redevelopment after the AIG expiration in 2014. And we have a really exciting new plan developed by all the different group heads here, oriented towards kind of the technology and creative tenant base that we see spilling out of Midtown South, for which 180 Maiden is going to be a perfect candidate for. And the redevelopment, which wasn't envisioned that way initially, it was envisioned towards financial tenants, is now being redesigned and upgraded into something that's going to be pretty spectacular. And there are other examples of that. The Olivia, which we just purchased, we're going to be more aggressively renovating those residential units than, I think, prior ownership had done, which is a different philosophy of -- investment philosophy. And we're going to be trying to really upgrade our rents in that multiuse, mixed-use project over on 33rd and 34th Street. 280 Park will be completed next year, that still has a ways to go. You heard Matt talk about the capital that's still needed for the repositioning of 1515. And 635 Sixth, another extremely exciting and successful development where we've increased our underwritten rents and projected NOI, but we've also underwritten some additional capital to go along with that. So redevelopment is kind of right in the middle of the mix, along with some incremental increase in structured finance and new retail projects, both ones we've closed this year and ones that we have in pipeline, along with a continued interest in the commercial product type. But on that -- and you heard Andrew's comments earlier, where we're kind of in a neutral zone there to a net seller zone on commercial, until we see either greater rent increases, which would put it on par with these other avenues of investment, which are just more attractive at the moment.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of ISI Group.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "I guess, Marc, I wanted to tackle a little bit about kind of rent growth. And obviously, you're looking at a lot of transactions but not winning and haven't really bought a traditional office building in a while. And I guess I'm just curious, as you kind of look at where the bidders are winning and kind of where you guys have bid, is it a function of those investors getting much more aggressive on rent growth or just accepting a much lower IRR in your opinion?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I would say that if you see us, as you call, not winning a particular deal or not pursuing a particular deal, it's because we see greater opportunity elsewhere in the areas I just covered. So it's not to say any of these deals unto themselves are bad deals or unsupportable deals. We're -- we have a limited capital base and we're looking to optimize returns. And if we see higher returns on a risk-adjusted basis at any point along the spectrum, then that's going to necessarily make our pursuit of some of those bigger office deals just a little less frothy. But with that said, I think people who are winning those deals tend to be syndicating out that equity to people who have extraordinarily high visions of what rent growth is going to be like in Manhattan. And even though we're pretty bullish on where rents are headed, there's always a group of people out there who are more bullish. And those people now have capital and we can't say they're wrong. It's one of those things where if job growth continues at 75,000 to 100,000 private sector jobs a year and office-using jobs are in the 15,000 to 20,000 to 25,000 jobs a year, then there's going to continue to be significant demand, which is going to drive up rents particularly as some of the new product that has been a bit of an overhang for the past few years gets leased up in Hudson Yards, on the far west side and down in the Trade Center zone. So we see that getting better. Every new lease is getting tighter and tighter. There's no real new supply to speak of that's going to be delivered over the next few years. The jobs are there, so we do see rents going up. It's just a question of we've -- we already control 28 million, 29 million square feet of office. And I think right now we're looking to optimize and not necessarily looking to bring in that next incremental building unless it's strategic or we have a particularly good tax advantage situation or we need a 1031, in which case, the tax efficiency might drive us to do something a bit more aggressive to shelter corporate taxes for shareholders.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "So just, I guess, on the rent point. I think you had said this last year, you thought there would be cumulative 25% rent growth over kind of a 3-year period, and I assume we're kind of 1 year into the 3 year. So of that 25%, how much do you think has actually transpired?", "Marc Holliday", "Let's just go back in time. At around 2009 or '10, I don't recall, we -- I think it was the '09 December meeting, we said 25% over 3 years.", "Unknown Executive", "Later.", "Marc Holliday", "That was -- maybe it was '10 -- '11, '12, '13? I mean, we're way in excess of that. So if that's the question, we're we'll beyond that. In terms of additional increases, I had said earlier in the year, what are we projecting versus what the market is projecting? I said the market was kind of, on our estimation, projecting increases as high as 40%, 40% to 50% over, maybe, the next, I would call it more like 3 to 5 years, Steve. I don't if I -- I don't remember the 3-year comp. But I would say, easily, 40% to 50% over the next 3 to 5 years and we were more like 25%. But again, both are really aggressive and both drive cap rates that are going to be kind of right on top of borrowing costs, 4% or 4.5% cap rate kind of talk, and that is where the market is. It's interesting, we traded around 5 or 5 plus and the cap rates are below that and there's going to be record sales volume. I think Andrew mentioned earlier, it's like a $30 billion -- let's say record, record book for the peak in '07. So booked for '07, a $30 billion sales yield. So any notion, I think, that there's any kind of pull back in the market over interest rates or slack tenant demand or a feeling like rental growth isn't going to be very aggressive, it's just our version of aggressive or someone else's version of aggressive, it's really just we don't see that right now. We see a very, very good market and we're just trying to make the best allocations of capital.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Maiorana of Wells Fargo.", "Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I appreciate all the kind of leasing color on the pipeline. It sounds like it's progressing pretty well. Just was interested in kind of an update on that year-end occupancy target, which I think still implies a pretty good ramp in the fourth quarter in terms of the occupancy number. And then, secondly, kind of similar question with respect to same-store, it looks like maybe there's lower other income and higher operating expenses which are keeping the trend a little bit below that 4% target, which you guys had laid out for 2013?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I mean when you say below the 4% that we're currently at...", "Matthew Diliberto", "We're roughly 3%. We set out a goal in our guidance of 3% to 4%. I think we set a stretch goal of north of 4%. We'll certainly be within our 3% to 4% range by the end of the year. It's the way we're working at.", "Marc Holliday", "Yes, I don't think -- I would -- I don't believe we're below our range on a same-store NOI. I think we're squarely in the range of 3% to 4%. We're going to try to finish at 4%, and we'll do our best. But I think, seasonally, third quarter is high. So you may be looking at third quarter OpEx numbers that are traditionally high. Or maybe you're making a relative comment, which I'll leave to Matt and Jim to address. But I think we will certainly meet our target on same-store NOI. And your other comment about occupancy, my recollection is the goal was about 96%, which was a significant same-store increase, year-over-year, and I think we're at 95.8%?", "Matthew Diliberto", "Yes. We're at 95.8%. So, Brendan, just I'll go back, it's Matt, to the operating expense point first. Third quarter is traditionally the highest-expense quarter of the year, was right on top of our expectations for this quarter. And when you look at operating expenses, you got to look up to the revenue -- the recovery of that expense load as well, which came through in large part in this quarter, but the deal, as it relates to taxes, does lag a little bit, so you'll see a little more of that in the fourth quarter. And as it relates to occupancy, based on the leases we have signed, we are at 95.8%. In the commenced -- based on leases that have commenced, we are at around 94.4%, 94.5% but we would expect to meet our goal of 96%, based on signed.", "Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, that's great. That's helpful. And then, Marc, I know you don't want to give guidance in December, but I think I heard in your prepared remarks that you said you felt like the earnings momentum that you guys have shown this year, you think that momentum keeps up in next year, as well. I'm just wondering if you could kind of frame that up a little bit in terms of where the components...", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I can't really quantify that because then nobody would show up in December. So we're going to try to leave just something left on the bone here. But certainly, we've been flashing up on the screens at presentations and investor meetings the enormous profitability in that growth portfolio, which was acquired since 2010, which I think totaled about 18 properties, which we're now in various stages of repositioning, redevelopments and stabilizing. And that portfolio of real property, along with the structured finance portfolio and the enormous success we're having in the retail portfolio, are all converging to translate into the kind of sizable earnings increases that we have been projecting. So I think it's nothing more than we've been saying, but it feels like until people see it, it doesn't necessarily get fully credited for. And I do think, when we do get to 2014, on top of this latest earnings revision, we're going to be talking about, certainly, another healthy year next year, which is consistent with the kind of numbers we laid out there in December of last year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to touch on this -- Andrew's comments about the right mix to improve the asset allocation across the portfolio, and Marc you spoke to it as well, a little bit. Better opportunities in retail and resi, it sounds like. What do you view -- how should we think about the rent growth profile for resi versus, maybe, office?", "Andrew W. Mathias", "I think the reason that we like the resi assets that we purchased is that we're underwriting very modest growth there. But with capital investment into the apartments, we're able to achieve significant mark to today's market. We don't need big market rent growth to make attractive returns on the residential buildings we've purchased thus far. So that's what's attracted us to that asset class. I think Olivia is very much on that theme. I think the DFR assets that we purchased last year are very much proving that theme where we're beating our acquisition budgets pretty significantly with modest capital spends. And it's a better underwriting feeling we get from being able to sort of take today rents, grow them at, call it, 3% annually and still make compelling returns just by virtue of bringing rents to market as opposed to relying on market rent growth.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Okay. So more of a redevelopment play opportunity, it seems, in the resi space?", "Marc Holliday", "Well I would call it unit upgrades. I mean it's -- these are -- there's not -- there's no...", "Andrew W. Mathias", "In the case of St. Luke's, it's redevelopment. That's a full redevelopment. But mostly our assets we've bought are just unit upgrades, as Marc said.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then maybe for Steve. On the office side, I mean, it sounds like you're confident in seeing good activity and feel good about the office side, generally, although it's not necessarily translating into rents, which I think I understand why. But can you maybe give us a little bit of color in terms of what you're seeing from financial service tenants? I know they're not the whole market, but I'm curious at the margin, if you're seeing any differences there? And then just talk about the small tenants and if they're still driving the market somewhat.", "Steven M. Durels", "Sure. The -- on the financial tenants, they're out in the market, not the big investment banks but, certainly, the commercial banks are out in the market. There was a big deal that was just signed on Park Avenue 1 week or 2 ago for 0.25 million square feet with Cap One. So there's a couple of big commercial bank requirements floating around. There seems to be still good demand from the small to medium sort of hedge fund, private-equity type tenant, and that's the kind of tenant that we're seeing over at 600 Lexington Avenue and a little bit at 810 Seventh. It's certainly the profile tenant that we expect to be the dominant tenants when we bring 10 East 53rd Street to the market. And -- what you didn't note is, as compared to last year, sort of the big tenant is back in the market. There's a lot of requirements floating out there in the 100,000 to 250,000, 300,000 square-foot type user group that wasn't as prevalent last year as there is today. And the last thing worth noting is we have, in fact, been raising our asking rents, maybe not portfolio-wide, but certainly in a good chunk of the portfolio. And maybe the best case in point, and a very good barometer of the market, is the leasing activity at the Graybar Building. Whereas 1 year, 1.5 years ago, we would have been doing deals in the $39 to $44 price point, and today, we're doing deals, starting rents, really in the $47, $48 on the low side, to many of them in the $52, $53 price point. So that's -- to Marc's earlier statement, as there's -- we've realized that increasing asking rents already and then we think there's more gas in the tank.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citi.", "Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "It's Josh Attie, with Michael. Can you talk about the composition of the 1.2 million square foot leasing pipeline? Given that the lease rate is already pretty high at almost 96%, maybe how much of it is a renewal of future expirations, versus new leasing on some of your growth assets?", "Marc Holliday", "Sure, of the 1.2 million, it's roughly -- well, the vast majority is new. So -- leases out we're seeing, is about 340,000 square feet. And that's sort of evenly distributed between new and renewal. But then, on the leases in negotiation, I would say it's -- I would just say significantly skewed towards new.", "Steven M. Durels", "And in that new component is a big chunk of tenants expanding.", "Marc Holliday", "So when I say -- new, in that context, is renewal and expansion, as opposed to a straight renewal. So we don't have it exactly as per new. But I would say to you, at least 50% represents true net new leasing and probably more.", "Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And separately, when you think about residential, how large of a portion of the portfolio do you feel comfortable allocating to it if opportunities that The Olivia continue to present themselves?", "Marc Holliday", "I'm sorry, how much of the portfolio do we see...", "Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "How much of the portfolio do you feel comfortable having allocated to residential?", "Marc Holliday", "Residential? Well, it's -- I don't see it -- we've been asked this question, and I think it's played out the way I've said over the past 2 years. We see this as an opportunistic investment vehicle where we, through relationships or use of OP units, can get into a residential investment that, in many cases, has a retail or commercial element with it like the Frankel deal, like The Olivia deal, those being the 2 biggest. Or the build-to-suits down at -- for Pace, where we, through our network and relationships, we were able to lock up sites and do 2 net lease build-to-suits. So I'd like to say we'd allocate a fair amount to those deals because those are extremely profitable deals, either now or in the future, after we are done doing our repositioning programs. But I think the reality is it's opportunistic and, therefore, the reality is I don't think it's going to get all that large other than maybe 1 deal or 2 a year, as it's been over the past couple of years.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Marc, just a follow-up to Josh's question. If you're at 95.8%, including the leases that are not yet commenced, and you talk very strongly about this pipeline, especially with a big amount being new and expansions, where does sort of occupancy get to by year end or early next year? Could we be pushing sort of the past peak occupancies that you had?", "Marc Holliday", "So the question is, on the 95.8%, which is where our same-store occupancy is on signed leases, and then we've said there's another, let's say, 1,200,000 in the pipe where we might convert about 3 quarters or so. I mean, 750,000. Where will that take occupancy for next year? Is that the question?", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Well I'm just saying -- if you -- that amount of square footage brings your portfolio pretty fully leased. And so I'm just trying to picture in my head, are -- we get to...", "Marc Holliday", "I got it. Two things: one, the leasing in that 1.25 million isn't all in same-store assets. So it doesn't, therefore, affect -- all of it doesn't affect 95.8%. A lot of the leasing, definitionally, or at least in some cases, non-same-store assets, where there's a lot of development or -- and/or existing vacancy. So that's one. Two, you have to buffer the leasing pipeline with the expiration pipeline. We have leases expiring as much as we're leasing. It's not all one way. And my recollection is, for 2014, I think there's about 2 million square feet that is expiring. So we'll have to be tapping into that. And obviously, there'll be some attrition out of that portfolio offsetting these numbers. So those 2 factors: 2 million square feet of lease expiration next year, I think there's about 350,000 square feet more of lease expiration this year; plus, whatever portion of the 750,000 feet is new, as opposed to renewal, and making a differentiation between same-store and non-same-store. So the answer is, we think it will be [indiscernible]. I can't -- wait 'til December and we'll figure out how much. But I would not add 1,200,000 to 95.8%, that will give you a wrong number and too high a number.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "That's what probably -- we're just trying to figure out sort of -- because your commentary sort of points to a very healthy in the largest pipeline that you had, and we're just trying to parcel that out between how much is roll, how much is new, how much is...", "Marc Holliday", "We're going through our budgets right now. And if you can hang in there, 6 weeks, we'll have it all for you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "First, Bloomies is getting some good space at 919. Matt, question for you first on the ratings. Sort of curious, do you need to be long-term unsecured -- I mean, investment grade, or if you have 2 of the 3 being at the unsecured level having that investment grade, then that gets you to the cost savings and all the good stuff that you want?", "Matthew Diliberto", "Will certainly, I mean, our focus right now is on the 2 rating agencies, S&P and Fitch. We've spent a lot of time with them. One had a full investment grade rating on us, the other has now set a clear path to investment grade in the kind of 12- to 18-month range. We would ideally like to get all 3, but clearly, our struggle with Moody's kind of continues here. Getting 2 of the 3 is important. There is pricing benefit in it, because with 2 of the 3, you'd get into an index that's important for pricing. So I would say, our long-term goal is to ultimately have all 3 and we're still optimistic we could get somewhere with Moody's, but in the near term, Fitch was a great outcome and a testament to a lot of hard work on the balance sheet that the whole team here has done, and continue our relationship with S&P.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "So what about, Matt, the long -- there's the senior unsecured rating, where you're investment grade, and then there's the long-term rating where you're still BB plus across the 3? Do need the long-term rating to be up at investment grade as well?", "Matthew Diliberto", "I think you're referring to -- there are 2 ratings, there are several ratings. One is a senior secured rating and one is senior unsecured rating. And what we're focused on is the senior unsecured rating.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay, perfect. And then the second question is on the mezz portfolio, as you guys look at new opportunities, are you seeing -- with all the sort of condo construction coming, are you seeing pricing, better pricing on some of the condo activity where you're looking at paper? Or is the pricing really determined whether it's condo or office, it's really more LTV driven where the rate is really more LTV driven rather than whether it's a resi or a office product?", "Matthew Diliberto", "I don't think we've done any condo loans. We have no condo loans in our book right now, so all the returns you're seeing are on commercial, multi-family and retail.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of...", "Marc Holliday", "I think we're going to -- we'll take 1 or 2 more questions, operator. And then, unfortunately, we'll have to follow-up with others offline.", "Operator", "Okay, so you want another question?", "Marc Holliday", "Yes.", "Operator", "Okay, so your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum of UBS.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I was hoping you could help me out with some, hopefully, simple math. I'm just looking at your earnings guidance for the year, and you had earned $3.77 in FFO in the first 9 months. So at the midpoint, it suggests the number for Q4 of $1.37. So I'm trying to understand that, relative to the clean $1.41 you earned in the third quarter x the charge, and just what are the items that are causing it to slip from Q3 to Q4?", "Matthew Diliberto", "We had a tough time hearing you. It's Matt. I think your question was if you look at the midpoint of our guidance for the fourth quarter, you'd say that, that is a tick down from the third? Was that the question?", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Yes. Basically, your guidance suggest that the FFO is going to slip in Q4 from Q3, excluding that charge.", "Matthew Diliberto", "Yes, I think the primary difference -- we don't view it as a tick down, necessarily, but I think the one item, or one line item that we consciously don't project forward, because it's got a lot of uncertainty, is other income. And so if you look at our traditional run rate in other income, it's roughly $5 million a quarter. This quarter, it was around $9 million. That would be about the $0.04 I think you enumerated.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, perfect. The other question that I had was on 180 Maiden Lane. And is there a sense of the capital investment that you think you're going to need to put into that asset to reposition it? And then just talk to us a little bit about the marketing plan for the asset and why will that building potentially lease up before Brookfield Place or World Trade Center or the Rail Yards, given that, that's sort of the supply that's out there?", "Marc Holliday", "Ross, the second piece, Steve will elaborate on. The first piece, I would say was just about finishing with our budget, so I think it would be a bit premature, other than to say a base building program is likely to be about $50 million, plus or minus. What I don't have for you offhand is whether some of that is reimbursable or not out of insurance proceeds, because we took on some damage in the storm last year. And I don't -- and so some of what we're doing, as part of the redevelopment, is also restoration, insured and covered restoration as part of Sandy. So I just don't have that number for you. Just to give you a sense of magnitude, I think as a base-building number, that number is a decent starting point. And then, obviously, leasing capital on top of that. Steve?", "Steven M. Durels", "And then on the marketing side, remember that this is one of the better buildings downtown. It was an institutional-quality building built for Continental Insurance. It was 1 of only 4 glass -- true glass and steel buildings downtown. The floor plates are very efficient, the views are unobstructed from the sixth floor and above. And we're inheriting an amenities package from AIG that we're capitalizing on as part of the leasing program, which include a health club, a cafeteria, an auditorium space. So the package of -- and all of those are being renovated as part of our marketing program. So the package of amenities that tenants are receiving, I think, with the quality of the building and the infrastructure that Goldman Sachs had previously updated in the building, leaves us with a very, very strong product. And on a pricing point, if you sort of think of the Trade Center as kind of a $70-plus kind of product and Brookfield in the kind of very high-5s to low-6s kind of price points and we're in the sort of mid-4s to $50 price point. And so I think we've got a -- the right product and a price-competitive product.", "Marc Holliday", "I think we're going to take one last question and wind up the call. So, operator, this is -- we'll take one more.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Marc Holliday", "Jamie, are you still with us?", "James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Can you, guys, talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the suburbs?", "Marc Holliday", "Sure.", "Isaac Zion", "The activity in the suburbs so far has been pretty solid, actually. Year-to-date, we've leased close to 750,000 square feet. For the entire year, last year, we leased 650,000 square feet. The activity in Westchester is slightly better than Stamford. Historically, these are small tenant markets, but we've seen some activity. We signed a 67,000 square foot lease, a 30,000 square foot lease and a 25,000 square foot lease, all in the last month or so. And we've got a pretty good pipeline throughout the end of the year. I anticipate we'll probably be at about 850,000 square feet by the end of the year. And our occupancy started the year at around 80%, I think it will be closer to 81.5% to 82% by the end of the year. So while it's not the city, it's not close, things are definitely positive on a relative basis.", "James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And then just any thoughts on harvesting some of those assets? Or just how long do you plan to hold?", "Andrew W. Mathias", "We sold one, Jamie. We sold a building in Stamford last quarter. It's still not much of a capital market out there, so there's not a lot of transactions changing hands. And I would say, we're -- if we see a bid we like, we definitely -- we're happy to sell assets out there. But as of now, Isaac and his team out there, are doing a great job blocking and tackling, and keeping the occupancy as high as possible. So we're going to keep managing and keep running them and keep clipping cash flow until the investment sales market improve out there.", "Marc Holliday", "Thank you, everyone, and we look forward to speaking with you, all, in December.", "Operator", "Thank you very much.

Please proceed.", "Heidi Gillette", "Thank you, everybody, for joining us, and welcome to SL Green Realty Corp.'s fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings results conference call. This conference call once again is being recorded.", "At this time, the company would like to remind listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements.

I will now turn over the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. Thank you Heidi, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining in. Many of you listening in today also attended or heard on the webcast our December investor presentation, which for us is always an excellent form to give in-depth market color and discuss goals and objectives for 2014. So that presentation, which is always sort of a highlight for our year in terms of being able to measure performance and describe the shareholder strategies and objectives, was something as a great benefit to us. And from the feedback we got after the presentation, I think we're confident that most shareholders found it to be very useful and informative as well. So we're still happy to put the kind of effort that goes into that presentation in order to do kind of a full dissertation, if you will, on where we see ourselves in the market. So having that just recently behind that, it's probably 7 weeks fresh, I think today what we're going to focus on primarily is material events during that 7-week period since the conference. And with that, I think you can put a circle around the Citicorp deal, the Citibank lease extension deal, which for us is really a crowning achievement for the company, I think for all those who worked on it, I would say, it was a personal achievement and getting that lease concluded for the company, for our shareholders after 18 months of negotiation, structuring and documentation and everything that went along with it, we were extraordinarily happy sometime and I think right after mid-December to get that signed up and announced, which made for good holidays for us. So I can tell you that much. And it was a deal where we had to do all of what I just said, while fending off the approaches of many, many suitors who were trying to convince Citi to relocate to various other locations and buildings throughout the city. And I think it's a real affirmation and testimony to the relationship we have with that tenant, to the flexibility and ingenuity, I think, that we put into that lease in terms of structuring something that worked for us and worked for the tenant. I think it's a real affirmation of Tribeca, what has now become, I would say one of the most desirable residential and commercial submarkets in Manhattan, which won out over many other locations and buildings that were deemed less desirable. And we couldn't be more pleased to have that behind us so that we can now, with Viacom put away for term, with Citi put away for term, it just allows us to really focus very offensively on figuring out ways to maximize our opportunities, mark-to-market and income opportunities going forward with the balance of the tenant base.", "A little more detail, if you will, on the Citibank deal. I think that the deal is resoundingly successful for this company, both when measured against market conditions downtown and when just looked at in terms of absolute levels of investment returns that we and our partner, Ivanhoe Cambridge, will enjoy on this investment.", "On relative terms, I think we look primarily at the more recent deals, with GroupM and Jones Day, GroupM at 3 World Trade, Jones Day at World Financial Center. And in that respect, we have a -- we were able to negotiate for a gross rent beginning in 2021 that, depending on where OpEx and real estate taxes go, but assuming that's somewhere in the range between 3% to 4% increases over time than that gross rent is somewhere right around $80 a foot. And that compares against starting rents with the GroupM deal at $68 a foot, starting rent at Jones Day at $60 a foot, each of which has a $5 bump. So that in the one case, the Tribeca location was about 22% to 23% better than a comparable vintage building that what financial center was able to obtain and 10% better than what new construction in the trade center was able to obtain. So we feel the rent was very appropriate, if you will, given the physical plant of 388 and 390, which are exceptionally good for financial tenants, the 388 floor plate was determined through the process to be as or more efficient for new construction and a 100,000 square-foot trading floor sizes at 390 are basically irreplaceable in that downtown market today. So that combined with the location and the autonomy of control over that campus, if you will, I think, was a major factor in helping us secure this tenant on a renewal.", "And when you look at the concessions, I would say there too, we were on a relative basis -- fairly pleased with the outcome, if you will. Where -- I think we had TIs of about $51 a foot, which is as against roughly $80 a foot on a nonrenewal deal, let's say $80 a foot trade for a new deal, plus free rent, which based on that gross rent in 2021 was about 7 months free. And I think we've seen numbers in the market ranging from 16 to 34 months free. I think that 34 months free is on the Jones Day deal, if I'm not mistaken. So that, I think, speaks volumes also to the quality of this building, the quality of the location that Citi saw in this specific property. There were some reports additionally on some additional base building capital that we committed to this deal as part of the Citibank renewal. That's fairly standard for us. So I'm not exactly sure why in this instance it's called out as something unusual in the 1 or 2 reports we saw. I think there's about $67 a foot or so of base building capital that's going to go into the improvements of the building and the restacking of the floors to make them more efficient. And given that we had put $0 into the building over the past 5 or 6 years since acquisition, and this is the sum and substance of what we'll put into the building over the next 22 years, I think that $67 a foot amortized over 28 years of lease term is something obviously $2.50 a foot on a straight-line basis.", "So we put redevelopment capital into almost every big building we purchase. In some cases, a little less. In many cases, more. I guess Viacom deal being a little less and 100 Park Avenue repositioning probably being more. So we think this is completely within the level of what's appropriate to invest, not really in a form of the tenant concession per se, but improvement to the asset, which we think is ultimately a good investment for us, and those are the economics of the deal now. Measured in terms of return, which is mostly how I like to look at these deals. I think we had an average yield through 2013 of about 9.25%. And as a result of this deal, going forward through, I believe, through the option date, that's actually a double-digit yield of somewhere between 10%, 11%. And I guess, most important one in IRR basis, which I think brings it all home to roost, the IRR deal from acquisition through date of earliest option would be something in around 9.7% to 10%.", "Now I can tell you with certainty that our ability today to go out and find commercial space in prime Tribeca neighborhood, where we have a high-credit tenant net leased, triple-net leased and with only about 50% or 53% loan-to-value achieve 10% levered returns would be highly challenging and that may be an understatement. So the deal itself is something we look at as a real victory for the company, if you will. We -- our strategy of buying credit tenant, net-leased deals at the tops of market is filling us 2007 purchase proved to be the right strategy in so much as we were able to maintain a very high yield through the '08 and beyond downturn. And now we'll be able to enjoy a consistently high and rising level of revenue, notwithstanding our financing costs fell during the first 5 years of this deal from $60 million a year to $34 million a year. So that's, in a nutshell, I think, how we evaluated the alternative of entering into this deal, which on the one hand is a -- it's a lot of capital because it's a 2.6 million square-foot lease. So it's big building, it's a lot of return. I think our share of the return, of the net return, from inception through earliest purchase date is something like $300 million net profit. So this has been extraordinarily profitable enterprise, now we're happy to say, we'll continue to be so over time, although we will have to invest some more capital into the deal. But certainly, as it relates to, I think, downtown metrics and I think as to -- just the measures by which we have to deploy capital, then and today, it's worked out fine. We did have it as a backup to our strategy a residential conversion of the property, which we think also would have been quite exciting and quite profitable, which would have played out many, many years from now. But as it turned out, we were able to meet our objectives as Citi seems also to be able to meet their objectives with the lease renewal, and in our eyes, that was in the best interest of this company and our shareholders. So we were happy to get that done.", "Some additional information, not really additional, just a summary of information that we posted on our website, which contains basically the data that's been disclosed in the press release, the supplemental and the 8-K, kind of put it all in one place, so people have the right data in front of them. And we can obviously answer any other questions, if you will, towards the back half of this conversation. But other than that, I'm going to open it up for questions, I would just say that if I had to handicap the 7 weeks since our December investor meeting, we are somewhere between on or ahead of expectations with respect to some fairly aggressive stretch goals and objectives we put up on the day of the investor meeting, both in terms of leasing and [indiscernible] philosophy, we have a good pipeline of leasing as it relates, even though it's January, which is typically not the most bullish [indiscernible] of months. We have a pipeline structured finance. We're working on other new equity investment yields and the sales market is still robust. So on all levels, we still see this as a market that is very consistent with what we conveyed 7 weeks ago. I think we'll be able to execute our program this year and we made that much the better by having the Citi lease renewal in the rearview mirror.", "So with that, I'd like to open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America.", "James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So I guess it's safe to assume you guys are maintaining your guidance from the Investor Day. And if that's the case, are there any changes to the underlying assumptions?", "Matthew Diliberto", "Jamie, it's Matt. No, there are no changes to our guidance levels at this stage.", "James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then, I guess, just following up on the structured finance comments, can you talk a little bit more about the book and where you -- I guess if you look in the fourth quarter, it looks like your yields came down a little bit and your volume was a little lower. So can you just talk about maybe how you see that trending? And maybe timing on new starts or new initiations?", "Marc Holliday", "So, Jamie, yields actually, I mean, there are actually on the portfolio up quarter-over-quarter. I think you're talking about the -- maybe the originations in total are down, but remember we syndicate out some of those senior positions, and that takes our yield on the retained piece up. So the portfolio actually ticks up on a fairly static balance.", "Unknown Executive", "Well, otherwise said, I just want to make sure, I understand the question. The yield on the portfolio, I think, was up 20 basis points, 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter. And that was done on a balance that was roughly equal and a composition that was slightly more weighted like 400 basis points weighted to its mezzanine, so more ...", "Unknown Executive", "We had some bridge loans pay off in the fourth quarter, so that weighted the portfolio slightly more towards the subordinate paper in the portfolio.", "Unknown Executive", "Right. Separate and apart from that, there were new originations, quite a voluminous amount of which, I think it was $400 and some odd million, which averaged somewhere like 7, 10. So 10-point-something percent. If you're saying though that yield is less than the portfolio yield, if that's the question, that is true. But if you recall in our December investor meeting, we put right up on that screen, our expectation that we wanted to convey to you guys that we thought spreads would compress in 2014 and after almost 5 years, if you will, of spreads that were fairly well established. And there weren't a lot of market participants competing. That dynamic has changed. People have definitely come back in 2014 with allocations, with a desire to compete more for this business. And that's not hindsight. We did say that in the beginning of December, and I think, we actually modeled spreads as low as 800 to 850 over was our guidance back then. So I think we beat our guidance by a lot. But directionally, we're -- we have shed light on the fact that we see compressing spreads. And I think it's important that people on this call understand that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just got a question on the CapEx side of things for the Citi renewal. Just curious if this is like the Viacom deal where they choose the timing of the spend or just curious how much we should be baking in terms of the CapEx here?", "Andrew W. Mathias", "Well, it's not so much -- they have flexibility when they spend it. But there are -- there are stages as to when the capital is available to them. They get a little bit of money now and then it's spread out over the next 5 years as to when the balance of the money is available to them.", "Unknown Executive", "It's a combination of: One, when they're entitled to it; and Two, when they spend it. They've got to meet both those conditions, so that we try to stage the money in over time, which that's even a further point that I didn't make in my prepared commentary, most of the concessions granted in these markets are very much upfront weighted concessions. These concessions -- I don't have the exact schedule for. We don't know it because we don't know the timing of Citi spend, but there's a [indiscernible] component and benefit here to being able to spread it over 5 years and whatever the actual schedule turns out to be.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then, I guess, just curious if you can provide a little bit more detail on the option portion of the deal. I guess, starting in 2017, I think it is. I mean take a lot of the returns you discussed were sort of as of the early option date. Just curious what those returns look like if they don't exercise and what your thinking is currently on whether or not you'll take that option?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, there's really 2 parts to that. One is, if they don't exercise on the earliest date, but if they exercise on the latest date. And the second question is whether they going to exercise at all. The difference between earliest date to latest date is really small because on the one hand, there's a little bit of time value. On the other hand, we have rising rents due to CPI.", "Unknown Executive", "Yes, levered yield on the interim is right on top of the IRR.", "Marc Holliday", "So, I would say, we are somewhat indifferent between when -- if the options pull between 17 and 21 from a term perspective. Now if the option is not hit at all, our expectations are that it's certainly in this environment that would be accretive because their purchase option is roughly around 6 and 6.25 cap on projected NOI, if you will. And the cap rates today, we believe, would be less than that. However, depends on what the CapEx are at that point in time. But certainly, from an earnings standpoint, it's accretive. From a value standpoint, we think it will be accretive, but no way to answer that question until you're out there in 2021.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of David Toti from Cantor Fitzgerald.", "David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "We've heard some reports of increasing property taxes and some pressure on assessments. Are you guys seeing any of that yet into the end of last year. I know you are underwriting. Any pressure on that going forward given -- especially given the change in government?", "Marc Holliday", "Yes, the property tax rules are out and it's consistent with our estimates. So as Matt said, our guidance for the year captured what we expected for property taxes this year. And it's an area of increasing budgetary constraints within the city. So we don't expect upward pressure on property taxes necessarily to abate. We just work hard with the city on the individual assessments for each of our buildings, making sure we keep those in line with reasonable market values and not out of line. So generally, I think, we feel it's a well-managed area of the business.", "Unknown Executive", "Yes, and also given that portfolio is plus or minus 96% leased, a lot of the increases are absorbed by the tenants because these are gross leases with stops and that doesn't make it any less undesirable to see increases that are higher than the rate of inflation, which is what we've been experiencing recently. But it does at least take away the earnings that -- mitigates the earnings impact of this increase.", "James E. Mead", "It certainly will have a negative impact on cap rates either because cap rates, if anything, are down quarter-over-quarter. So...", "David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "And that kind of leads into my second question actually which is there haven't been a lot of large scale transactions recently. And the commentary that we hear from some of our industry contacts in the broker community is that cap rates are relatively stable and that the consensus for you is that cap rates probably won't compress much further. But I seem to be hearing otherwise from you. Do you have expectations for continued cap rate compression? Is that asset-specific or market-specific?", "Marc Holliday", "I think we indicated in December that we do expect cap rates to compress further, part and parcel, with rental growth over the next 3 years, that we're estimating it 20% to 25%. How -- and I think you'll see some trades that are in contract now that will close some on the value of land which continues to increase and then some on some stabilized office assets, which are continuing to push, I would say, average cap rates down.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Marc, last quarter, you sort of talked about the leasing pipeline as being very strong heading into the fourth quarter and nailed the leasing number. And it sounds again like the guidance for, or at least the pipeline for early this year, is pretty strong. You care to offer, I guess, as to what leasing might look like next quarter? Could it be as strong as the fourth quarter?", "Unknown Executive", "Next quarter?", "Unknown Executive", "Fourth quarter is going to be difficult. Citi was a little bit of an anomaly.", "Unknown Executive", "Let's talk about Citi, let's talk about Citi.", "Marc Holliday", "What did we do without a Citi -- look, we have 2 million square-foot signed lease goal for the year. So that would be roughly 500,000 square feet per quarter. I don't know if the world is that good where we can -- yes if we can get it down to 3 months increment, some of these deals are just -- we try to get them done at the wire, and some do, and some sign 2 days later, it trips to the next. So I don't know, I think the velocity is good. I think we're on our 2 million square foot. I don't want to say run rate because there are some things that have to go right to get there. But in a market like this, things tend to go right. And I think we will get there. And if we're not at the 7, 70, as we did this last quarter, which we probably won't be because that was that was exceptionally high, I have every reason to believe we'll be right around the straight-line average, of leases, 500,000 [indiscernible]", "Unknown Executive", "I think it's going to be like last year. It was choppy from quarter-to-quarter, but that was not necessarily because the tenant demand wasn't there. There were a lot of deals we had in the pipeline. We've got a big pipeline right now, where we have 59 leases that are being negotiated, it's covering 900,000 square feet. I can tell you that some of the bigger deals in that, that are -- won't get done in the first quarter because they're complicated and they just sort of long-dated type transactions. But I think it certainly gives us comfort that we'll hit our 2-million mark for the year. And I think it's going to be -- it's -- we're going to have the first quarter will be less than the straight line, second quarter will be bigger, but behind all that is what's happening in the marketplace, which is we continue to see good tenant demand across the board in all the buildings.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay, as a follow-up, any color you can offer around the new assemblage on Fifth Avenue?", "Unknown Executive", "Obviously, given the vague disclosure, it's a highly-sensitive and dynamic situation. So it's tough to offer much more color. We think it's a site with enormous upside. It's highly, highly underutilized. There are just some incremental transactions we're working on, which will allow us to fully exploit the value of the site. So we purchased it completely off market, and we're trying to keep the balance of our discussions under radar and off market. So more on that certainly later in the year.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Safe to say it's Midtown?", "Unknown Executive", "Safe to say, yes.", "Marc Holliday", "Next question, operator.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Josh Attie from Citigroup.", "Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "On 388, 390, I just wanted to kind of confirm what the total CapEx number was. And then also kind of better understand how it would be spent. So looking at the presentation you posted on your website, it looks like the 3 different pieces, the TI allowance, the base building and redevelopment all kind of add up together to around $118 a foot. And then if you add in the free rent, you get roughly to around $380 million. And my first question is, is that the right number? And my second question is, how is that treated if the purchase option is exercised?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I don't -- the number -- I'm not sure how to respond, the numbers are exactly as they appear in that 2-pager. Those are like to the dollar. So I don't want to characterize it one way or the other. Those are the numbers for this deal. What was the second part of the question?", "Unknown Executive", "How is it treated on the sale?", "Marc Holliday", "How is it treated on the sale? Well, most of these costs are expected to be funded or expended by the time of the closing of the option. So again, we're sort of modeling generally over the next 5 years. That takes you through '18. So there is, I guess, a slight chance for a mismatch. But if there is any mismatch, unfunded concessions would be credited.", "Unknown Executive", "Yes, Citi will get credit for that.", "Marc Holliday", "You can get -- assume the money spent and the option will be hit or not during the period, but it can be hit or not, but most of that money will be spent within the first 5 years.", "Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. So all -- the whole concession package, including the free rent, would be credited to the purchase price if the option is exercised?", "Marc Holliday", "The answer is yes, but you got a, yes, but almost the vast majority has been funded or expended. So the credits, if any at the end, are very minimal.", "The first closing can't occur until the end of '17, as I recall. And they could, but I'm not sure it's likely, I think there's lots of motivations why if anything it will close later than earlier, but who the hell knows? I mean that's something nobody has a good point of view on. But if you -- we're at the beginning of '14, the earliest closing is end of '17, most of the funds are expended, this is a tale that's not it will get credit.", "Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And completely separate question. On the Investor Day, you talked about having net growth in the retail and residential portfolio of around $750 million this year. Can you just talk about how the acquisition pipeline looks? And whether it's more skewed toward retail or residential today?", "Marc Holliday", "It's more skewed towards retail today. We are -- we're looking at some residential deals as well, but I think from what we're planning on locking down on the first quarter, it's definitely more skewed towards retail. There's a lot of properties trading, a lot of good opportunities and continued strong tenant interest in our highly trafficked prime trade areas.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line Erin Aslakson from Stifel.", "Erin T. Aslakson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "So $412 million was originated in the fourth quarter, but only about $80 million was actually kept on balance sheet. What were the syndication fees related to the originations there, which are recognized in the fourth quarter?", "Unknown Executive", "No, we didn't recognize any syndication fees, right? If we had syndication fees, those would be onetime. Generally, we will scrape a little bit or raise more fees and those get amortized in over the term of the loan. There are no onetime syndication fees in the fourth quarter.", "Erin T. Aslakson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So the 12 [indiscernible]", "Unknown Executive", "The effect of the positive [indiscernible] syndication is expressed in the retained yield on the $80 million, I think you said, that's the right number? And that's, hardly 1 million. And that's always been the case from day 1 in terms of how we recognize that income.", "Erin T. Aslakson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "All right. So the additional income recognized by the structured finance portfolio, the $5-odd million in the quarter was all related to interest rates? Interest rates...", "Unknown Executive", "There was one repayment in the quarter. That's the primary difference that you're talking about. There was a repayment within -- an early prepayment penalty that we recognized in the fourth quarter. Otherwise, the rest of it is interest income.", "Erin T. Aslakson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, how much was the prepayment?", "Unknown Executive", "Roughly $2.5 million.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Auerbach from ISI Group.", "George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. [indiscernible] ticked up quarter-over-quarter and spread looked a little bit better. Was this sort of a one-off result or anything that you think suggests that business in the suburbs is getting better?", "Isaac Zion", "I think, overall -- hi, this is Isaac Zion. I think, overall, the -- we've seen a lot of increased activity well-located buildings in Stanford and White Plains across industry lines, and I think going into early 2014, we've got some vacancies that we have to deal with, but I fully anticipate that occupancy will remain around that 82% and then start to tick up toward the end of the year as things get better and better.", "George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And just one question on 1 Vanderbilt. With the [ph] moved the assets that are sort of [indiscernible] on the site into development. Can you just remind us of the timing of sort of when you empty out those buildings, when you maybe demo those. And we talked about it a little bit at Investor Day, but any early conversations with the new administrators about East side rezoning?", "Unknown Executive", "Well, on 1 Vanderbilt, we moved the assets to development. We are still working on various ways of seeing how we can get this development going under East Midtown primarily, if that comes back this year, as the mayor has committed to do several times publicly. And we're also looking to see if there are alternatives to the project we had originally proposed that would allow us to go forward under different formats. So I think that the zoning was just voted down in November. So it's only been, let's say, 2 months or not quite. And we would expect this is going to be resolved over the next 6 months. So I think a few months from now, I'll have a better answer for you on that. But we are still moving ahead on all fronts with the expectation that this will be developed. The only difference being that, as a result of whether East Side zoning goes through or not, we may have to alter the plans. But I think we can accommodate that into several different scenarios, and that's what we're working through now. And I would say, maybe on the next call, we will have more color on that, certainly within the next 6 months. And that's our kind of time line maybe the next 3 or next 6 months to have this sort of fully figured out as to what direction we'll be headed once we get through the planning process.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson from Morgan Stanley.", "Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "So first, just shifting back to asset valuations, I think you'd consider yourself largely in harvest mode now, although it's a relative term. And I am sure you're regularly approached by others looking to buy, unsolicited or otherwise. So could you just provide any color on whether it's sovereign wealth, or pension money, et cetera, that's knocking on the door these days? Is the trajectory of inquiries up or down the past several months? And is it mainly for the trophy-type assets? Or do you sense there's demand out there across the board?", "Marc Holliday", "Yes. Vance, let me just give you the first part of that and Andrew can talk about the composition of the players and the trends. We are not in harvest mode. I mean we sell because we always sell. We sell every year. We sold last year. We sold 2 years ago. I think we've sold almost every year over the past 10 years, except for maybe in '08 or '09, that I'm not sure. But short of that, we sell when it's right for the asset, when we feel we've gotten most of what there is to get out of the asset and we can redeploy into more profitable new investments. We are -- we don't make calls on the market. I don't believe that we're in the business of only selling if we think the market is one way and only buy if it's the other way -- we moderate. We buy more early and we buy less late and vice versa, we sell more late and sell less early. But with that said, we are still finding a lot of good new investment activity. Last year, I forget the number, was well over $1 billion of new investment activity. A lot of that was equity. And while there was no major [indiscernible] acquisition last year, I certainly won't extrapolate that out to this year because there are a couple of interesting things. The way we create value is typically highly structured and off market. And if we can get those deals done, even in a market like this, which is a -- [indiscernible] tight market, there are opportunities out there. So you'll see us certainly sell some assets this year. And that's as we did last year. And we set those goals forth at -- in December, you'll see us buy actively. And we're going to be recycling money into new value-add deals because this is a good market to do value-added. The leasing market is getting much better. And I think you're going to start to see good mark-to-market rents that are at least on target with what we've projected. So I would not -- yes, I think people seem to be overly focused on interest rates. I would just make sure you're not focused -- not only you specifically, I just mean generally, people don't focus on interest rates, we spent focusing on rents because as commercial rents go, so goes value, so goes the stock price. I mean that's something I tried to put up on the screen in December to show the correlation between mark-to-market and value and stock price as opposed to interest rates, which has far less of a correlation. So, anyway, the first part Andrew....", "Andrew W. Mathias", "As is typical in January, we've been visited by many, many sources of capital over the first couple of weeks of the year who all have allocations for this year and are aggressively looking for new deals. So, you have sort of all the groups that Isaac went through in December at the investor meeting. The Southern Well Funds, the pension funds, the individual investors. And we've seen a lot of new entrants to the market, particular Chinese capital, which we highlighted on Investor Day, but also in Noreastern [ph] and Norwegian and all of these guys are flush again with allocations for the year and are actively looking for deals. So we expect transaction activity to be healthy in the first quarter.", "Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. That's very helpful. And then any update or thoughts on the potential re-purposing of certain assets that you've mentioned in the past, the potential to tap into retail, residential or hotel demand? Do you think we'll see some of that down the road? Are you moving more in that direction on any assets?", "Marc Holliday", "Yes, I think -- we're always evaluating highest and best for any of the assets. Right now, our big redevelopment focus is 10 East 53rd, which is an office redevelopment. But that project is launched, and we're going to be bringing it to market top-of-the-line Class A space in a great floor plate on 53rd street. That's a prime area of redevelopment focus right now.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Maiorana from Wells Fargo.", "Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "So probably for Marc or Andrew, but with 2 of your biggest assets kind of put together and put to bed in terms of the tenants you have there with Viacom and Citi. Does that -- are you thinking about being more aggressive in terms of doing value-add deals? I know you talked that they're attractive, but you've got a growth portfolio, that's -- call it, $3 billion or so. Might we see that number move up because you've got some pretty stable assets that don't have a lot of risk in your portfolio now?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I think that's a reasonable assumption given our view of market rents, which we talked about earlier, that you'll see us continue to add growth assets, that where we can move the bottom line. And if we look to sell, it's going to be mostly stabilized bond-type assets where we've done our redevelopment work and we've executed our business plan, and we think we can take the money and reinvest into higher returning investments.", "Unknown Executive", "I would say also on the rental side, with coming expiries, it gives us the ability to, I think, push terms harder than we otherwise would if you had 2 major exposures out there. So with those put to bed, I think we can really try to help, meet the market, if you will, and push the terms and see if we can't benefit from what seems to be a market that's got a lot of job growth. 94,000 jobs last year. The stats say not a lot of office using as in prior years, but it was still positive absorption. And I think that number sort of belies the economic impact of 95,000 new jobs in New York City last year. That is an enormous amount of jobs that puts the total job count at over 4 million bodies. The city is projecting another 50,000 or maybe 45,000 or 50,000 new jobs, private-sector jobs for this year. And I'm not -- it would somewhat seem understated relative to last year's tally, and with the general feedback we're getting from tenants right now whose businesses seem to be doing on average extremely well and tenants seem to be growing in almost all sectors except financial row -- commercial banks. So I think we can push rents, we can push terms and we can be more aggressive as Andrew said on -- I mean in evaluating assets.", "Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "That's helpful. Just switching gears question, probably for Jim. If I look at the mortgage on 388 390, it looks low from an overall principal. Now is there with the lease done now, is that something that you would think about refinancing? And could that be a source of funds as we think about over the next year or 2?", "James E. Mead", "Yes I mean, the answer is maybe. I mean, we're looking at it now, and it's got a high credit quality, very stable lease on it for the long term. So it would appear to us to be an enormously good candidate to look at for refinancing. So the answer is, we're looking at it, of course. We tend to concern with finance our properties and don't really drive leverage in our property level financing. So we're going to take a close look at it over the next few weeks and months.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Knott from Green Street Advisories.", "Jed Reagan - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Jed Reagan here with Michael. Just wondering if you could talk a bit about the leasing pipeline in terms of how that splits out between the high end of the market and sort of the more value-oriented price point? Are you seeing more momentum in one than the other?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, if you measured it from the last couple of weeks or so, where all of a sudden we got a slew of offers in on the higher price point stuff. You would think that it was shifting towards that part of the market. But I think, in reality, it's much likely said at Investor Day, there's good demand across all price points as compared to 1.5 years ago, where it was all about the bottom end of the market. Today, it seems to be firing at both the bottom end and the top end of the market. Some good examples of that is 3 Columbus, where we're doing some deals in the tower of that building, the annual rents with $78 to $80 range, 600 [indiscernible] we've got 5 or 6 offers that we're negotiating in that building, and that's one of the boutiques, one of the higher price points in the portfolio. We just closed the deal a few days ago with 280 Park for 25,000-foot tenant. The bottom of the building rents there are still is been very, very heavy for that product. So we're seeing it across the board, but I think in particular, there's a continued improvement in the higher end of the market.", "Jed Reagan - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Sorry, if I missed this. But, can you just clarify leasing commissions for the Citigroup lease that's included in the TI numbers presented in the supplemental? And if not, can you just share how much additional cost that represent?", "Unknown Executive", "The leasing commissions that we pay are shown in the -- on the FFO FAD page that shows the amount of capital expended related to the Citi deal, expended in 2013.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Just 2 really quick ones. First, is Citi putting in any of their own money into the renewal in addition to the TI that you guys are providing in the base building? Or they are putting in -- what are they putting in as part of this, if any?", "Unknown Executive", "Well, we're not in a position to respond to that. Citi is going to do, I guess, what it decides to do. We're lead to believe they're going to invest capital in the building to lease back, make it more efficient and potentially make some improvements beyond our base building. We've seen situations where they do, and I think they are plans where they don't. So, we're just not in a position to address that.", "Unknown Executive", "They have announced that its going to be the new global headquarters, though, and it's reasonable to assume.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. I guess we can ask Citi their call. Second question is, on the West 34th Street you bought out 2 adjacent -- I'm sorry, you sold out 2 adjacent properties both earned in joint venture, but you retained some development rights. Can you just comment on what your plans are for those development rights?", "Unknown Executive", "34th Street, we sold -- the stabilized retail condos and retained the air rights. We don't have any imminent plans for those air rights. It's in an area where there is a lot of new developments going on, and the future store houses a value. We wanted to save and didn't feel like we could get adequately paid for today, so we sold the income-producing portions of the property. There's no immediate plans for the air rights.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "And Andrew, how transferable are the air rights like what -- how far of a radius can you transfer those around?", "Andrew W. Mathias", "The block, which is a big -- between Fifth and Sixth is a very large block. So, there's a lot of potential between 34th and 35th Street there on the north side of the block.", "Marc Holliday", "Operator, we have time for one last question, and then we are going to -- have to take others in a different form.", "Operator", "All right, I understand, sir. Your last question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum from UBS.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Can you guys talk about just an update on 180 Maiden Lane, as well as 280 Park Avenue in terms of different, I guess, time frames in terms of repositioning there? Just give us an update on how those are going so far.", "Unknown Executive", "Let's start 280, being the most advanced of the 2. Steve, why don't you?", "Unknown Executive", "Well, we profiled it at Investor Day, so the construction there continues to advance. We think we'll be materially done with all of the base building work by the end of the summer. We have a couple of moderate-sized leases that are in negotiation right now, and we just closed one for 25,000 square feet on the third floor of the building. We made some of the papers, we didn't put an announcement out. But, we continue to see that in our primarily financial services are the tenants that are coming through the door, and I think we're on track as far as both the lease of schedule and the rents that we're achieving.", "Unknown Executive", "The finished lobby on Park looks I think spectacular. If anyone has an opportunity to go pass and see it we kind of -- our aim and goal was to have the nicest lobby and presence on Park Avenue. I think we've achieved that. Top 180?", "Unknown Executive", "On 180, the redevelopment plans, we're working with the city to get the necessary approvals. AIG is finishing up their occupancy, and we're working with them on phase out. And we're actively showing the building to tenant prospects. So it's got lots and lots of showings, lots and lots of interested tenants. I think some of the dynamic of tenants being priced out of Midtown South is definitely starting to occur, and we're starting to see some of those tenants look downtown in the financial district. We expect that to be a big positive impact on the lease up there.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Andrew, do you have your arms around a capital budget for the repositioning of that asset yet?", "Andrew W. Mathias", "It's still in, I would say it's still in formation because it somewhat reliant on city planning. The City Planning Commission, which has purview of all the public space, which a lot of that building, the ground floor is public space. But by next quarter, we will have much better color.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. Thank you, everyone, for dialing in today. And we look forward to speaking to you again in April.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may all now disconnect.

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sheena, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions]", "As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.", "And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Heidi Gillette. Please proceed.", "Heidi Gillette", "Thank you, everybody for joining us, and welcome to SL Green Realty Corp.'s first quarter 2014 earnings results conference call. This conference is being recorded.", "At this time, the company would like to remind all listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from the forward-looking statements that the management may make today. Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the company's Form 10-K and other reports filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "Also during today's conference call, the company may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G.

I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. Thank you, Heidi, and good afternoon, and thank you to all, everyone dialing in to join us today. It pretty much goes without saying how happy we are with our first quarter achievements and the subsequent transactions that we announced yesterday. Our results and achievements had something for everyone and certainly sets a strong early foundation for what we expect to be a very good 2014.", "First and foremost, our Manhattan leasing results exceeded our expectations both in terms of leases signed and mark-to-market. The substantial leasing volume is reflective of accelerating demand as private-sector job growth continues in New York City at a historically rapid pace. Over 20,000 private sector jobs were created in the first quarter of 2014 alone, continuing last year's torrid pace of job growth, which neared 100,000 private sector jobs last year. Most of this growth in the first quarter took place among professional business services companies, which accounted for a quarter, probably slightly more than a quarter of the total growth. So clearly, from my perspective, job growth being the metric that has the greatest impact on tenant demand is clearly continuing at a strong pace, at historically significant pace. And at this point, it seems relatively unabated in it's job creation ability in these various sectors, notwithstanding financial services in the first quarter was down marginally. So again, these achievements were being done by all the other sectors that we've spoken about at length on these calls and in December.", "Complementing our leasing activities, was a typically busy quarter on the investment front as well. Year-to-date, we entered into agreements to acquire over $1 billion of real estate in 4 separate transactions, highlighted by our agreement to buy out our partner in 388-390 Greenwich Street. I consider the lease extension of Citigroup in December combined with the sizable buyout of our partner to be among the most important and impactful events in this company's history. These transactions served to derisk significant future lease role and also created substantial earnings momentum, which we'll be able to realize this year and value creation, which we'll be enjoying over the coming years.", "But while our investment volume for the year was front-ended, we were very conscious of making sure that we sold into this market, this market being exceedingly strong right now given high levels of investor demand, plentiful levels of debt and equity capital and as a result, we are able to achieve $586 million of sales and also 4 transactions. So that's over $1.6 billion of investment activity, 8 different transactions, the fourth month of the year is not even behind us, and that's not including another $160 million-plus of debt and preferred equity originations that we also were able to accomplish in the first quarter. So that's not to say we're by any means done for the year. We've got a substantial pipeline on leasing of about 1.4 million square feet. So we expect second quarter to be pretty much on par with first quarter on leasing in the range of 500,000 to 600,000 square feet, which would make for another outsized quarter putting us on target or in excess of our target for the year. And we do have further pipeline on the investments and sales front. So clearly, we've got a lot of work cut out for us for the remainder of the year, but I don't think I could have asked for a better start or a better market at this point to be conducting it in.", "The sales in particular, produce a significant amount of net cash proceeds and capital gains, gains being on those 4 transactions alone greater than $225 million of capital gains on those 4 deals, and those are noncore value-add kind of deals, which I think just continues our tradition and reinforces our pedigree of being able to create these double-digit returns in a highly competitive market.", "So for more color on that, let me turn it over to Andrew Mathias.", "Andrew W. Mathias", "Thanks, Marc. The core areas of investment activity was highlighted by 388 Greenwich, which Marc touched on. In addition, we announced several other acquisitions and dispositions continuing on our theme of accretively recycling capital. In somewhat of a pair trade, we sold our leasehold position and what is probably the last remaining IPO asset at a 4.7% cap rate, 673 First Avenue, and we'll reinvest the proceeds of that sale into a fee position at 635 Madison Avenue. Although, the going in cap rate is a bit below the cap rate we're selling 673 for, we're getting an enormous upgrade in terms of location, upside and long-term value in the fee position at 635 Madison. Our returns on 673 are truly incredible, a 13.6% unlevered IRR over the 16 or so year-period since our IPO. They speak for themselves.", "We also announced several deals in the retail program centered around SoHo, the city's hottest submarket. Those deals were off market and featured in-place rents that are 50% and more below market and more opportunities to develop the space within those actual buildings.", "Combined with our strategic investment into 530 Broadway, which closed during the first quarter, 115 Spring and 121 Greene Street give us some of the scale that we're targeting to achieve in the SoHo market. Again, continuing with the recycling theme, we also closed this quarter on our sale of our interest in 21-29 West 34th Street, booking a 55% levered IRR on our investment and we expect to close on the sale of our interest in 747 Madison Avenue shortly as well. As we continue to take profits on interest in retail assets we own across the portfolio.", "With that, I'll pass the microphone onto Jim to dive into the numbers.", "James E. Mead", "Thanks, Andrew. I'm going to touch on the financing activities and our liquidity position and then turn it over to Matt to go over some of the numbers. We closed $1.4 billion in 3 financings this quarter, including mortgage financings on our office property at our 100 Park Avenue, and at the retail property at 724 Fifth Avenue. And notably, we took advantage of the demand from bank lenders for funded loans to expand our bank term loan facility by $383 million to a total $783 million, extending the maturity date and lowering the pricing of the facility by 25 basis points. This was an excellent execution that achieved a LIBOR spread that we believe was at least 10 basis points lower than any REIT at the BBB- credit rating. As we look forward, we'll be refinancing 388-390 Greenwich and expect that there will be sufficient proceeds to fully fund the entirety of the acquisition of our partner's interest.", "So that, in combination with the other investments and dispositions we've discussed, leaves us in excess of our targeted $1 billion in liquidity. And so without any need to tap the equity markets for funding any of these activities.", "Thanks. Let me turn the call over to Matt now, please.", "Matthew Diliberto", "Thanks, Jim. Obviously, we're very pleased with our first quarter results and outlook for the remainder of the year. We came out of the gates in 2014 with a flurry of activity that Marc, Andrew and Jim just spent some time walking through, which puts us in a position of raising our 2014 FFO guidance by $0.26 a share at the midpoint to $5.90 to $5.96 a share only 4 months into the year, equating to FFO growth of nearly 15% over last year.", "In the first quarter, we saw operating performance as measured by occupancy and NOI in both the existing Manhattan and suburban portfolios that was in line and certainly ahead of our expectations. Renewed vacancy is nearly 100,000 square feet at 711 Third Avenue and 88,000 square feet at 810 Seventh Avenue. We put pressure on our first quarter occupancy in NOI but the strength of recent leasing helped alleviate that pressure and actually resulted in our first quarter same-store Manhattan occupancy exceeding our budget, putting us well on track to achieve an increase in our same-store Manhattan occupancy by 150 basis points by the end of the year.", "And our same-store NOI growth of 1% on a cash basis and 2% on a GAAP basis was right in line of what we expected giving us confidence that we'd be able to meet our stated goal of achieving 3% to 4% cash in same-store NOI growth for 2014 as comparable NOI builds in the back half of the year.", "The real catalyst to our upward guidance revision is the volume and timing of our real estate in debt and preferred equity investment activity. From an earning's perspective the most impactful real estate transaction is clearly the acquisition of our partners interest in 388-390 Greenwich Street which we anticipate closing in mid-May with financing in place.", "Net of a one-time charge of about $4 million that we will need to take at closing, for an amortized cost related to the previous financing and acquisition of this size at this yield is an early highlight of the year and contributes roughly $0.14 of net FFO accretion in 2014 and even more in 2015.", "In the debt and preferred equity portfolio, following a robust 2013, the first 4 months of 2014 have continued to provide a significant pipeline of opportunities to make new investments earlier in the year and at better yields than we originally projected, while the portfolio seismic fluctuate during the year, based on the current flow of activity, we projected the portfolio ends the year between $1.4 billion and $1.45 billion, roughly, where we anticipated. But the front loaded investment timing at better yields than the 8.5% we projected will be impactful and should result in $0.08 to $0.10 of accretion to full year FFO.", "We expect to fund our incremental investment activity in part with further property sales, tapping into embedded equity at the asset level. Included in our initial guidance with the sales of 21-25 West 34th Street was closed in the first quarter and 747 Madison, which is expected to close during the second quarter.", "While we have other opportunities to prove in the portfolio at attractive pricing had risen on the heels of the unbudgeted sales of the Arden portfolio in the first quarter and the sale of 673 First Avenue, which we expect to close in the next 30 days. We have several other assets currently out in the market for sale and anticipate being able to close at least 2 to 3 more dispositions before the end of the year. These sales will offset the FFO accretion for our investment activity by $0.03 to $0.05 per share.", "Finally, during the first quarter, we recognized previously unaccrued interest income on a mezzanine investment that was roughly $7 million, or $0.07 a share greater than what we provided for in our initial guidance. This income was required to be accelerated based on the expected sale of the underlying property at a price well north of our last dollar of exposure.", "With that brief summary, I'll turn it back over to Marc.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay, so we wanted to give everyone a brief overview today of our assessment of the quarter and the activities within, but we wanted to leave ample time to get into questions. I think, just to put a spotlight on it, the ability for us only 3 -- 4 months, I guess, 4.5 months after December investor to be able to come out with a guidance revision, and a guidance revision of this magnitude, I think is very telling about our feelings and belief about the momentum in the leasing market primarily in the mark-to-market, the accretion that we're realizing from our acquisitions and on basically, primarily if not exclusively, on a self-funded basis. The debt and preferred equity program, which continues to perform on kind of market-leading -- on a market-leading basis in this New York City market I think we're far and away the leader in subordinate. Debt provision, both in terms of volume and in terms of return to net business. And when you bring that all back, we felt that we had enough confidence in this market, and in the direction that the portfolio is going to come out with this earnings revision this early in the year. And as I said earlier, there's -- we have $1 billion-plus of liquidity that you've highlighted that will hopefully enable us to continue this momentum throughout the year.", "So with that, let's turn it over to questions-and-answers.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] This comes from Jamie Feldman, Bank of America.", "James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I was hoping you guys can just provide some more color on the leasing market. Just some more granularity in terms of, what size the tenants you're seeing the most activity from, whether they're small, they're big, they're start ups, they're established. They're looking for high rents or low rents, especially with supply coming online downtown out on the West side. Just how should we be thinking about what's really the sweet spot of the market right now?", "Steven M. Durels", "Jim, it's Steve Durels. The good news is I don't think there's a single theme to the demand, that's out there right now meaning that it's not limited to one part of town or one size of tenant the way it was a year or 2 ago. We're seeing tenants of size, large tenants that are out in the market, some driven by growth, some driven by expirations, some driven by consolidations. We're seeing higher price point tenants and within our portfolio, good examples of that are some of the pre-built spaces that we've done at 3 Columbus that have been leasing well. Some of the space is 600 in Lexington Avenue, which is one of our higher price point buildings. Where we had very good leasing activity this year. I think probably the best demand we've had since we've owned the building. And then continued activity on the lower price points as reflected down at the number of tours that we're getting at 180 Maiden Lane, where we're seeing a lot of Midtown tenants, shopping lower price points downtown. And then, the Midtown South market continues to be on fire. You saw the release today, where we had a corporate goal of leasing the penthouse at 635 Avenue of the Americas and we succeeded with that by leasing the top floor at $101 a square foot on a starting rent. Other than new construction at the highest price point that we achieved for a Midtown South building. So it's a little bit of everything all over town. I think it's driven by tenants who are hiring, tenants who feel good about their businesses and it's not limited to one industry.", "James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, and then we'd -- Marc had mentioned a leasing pipeline. How does that shape up in terms of the same question.", "Steven M. Durels", "Yes, we've got demand right now from probably 5 or 6 sectors, I would say. We've got leases out with tenants in the finance world, marketing, legal, engineering, fashion, transportation. Those are probably the biggest demand we've got. I'd say the tenants that we are not in active negotiation with, but who we're seeing a lot of foot traffic from, in particular, are law firms right now probably more so than we saw last year. So it's -- though it seem to be there, at least within our portfolio, the big tenant demand.", "Operator", "And next is George Auerbach from ISI Group.", "George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Andrew, you talked about the capital recycling so far in 2014. Do you get the sense of activity you'll see? And the market we'll see will be better this year than last? And if so, why do you think that's the case?", "Andrew W. Mathias", "How are you defining better by total volume? Or by price per foot or...?", "George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "I'd say volume and opportunity. It seems like in the first quarter and even in the fourth quarter, there was just more for you to do in both acquisitions than dispositions?", "Andrew W. Mathias", "Yes, I think it's extremely competitive out there and the pricing certainly in terms of price per foot I think this year will hurdle last year in terms of a better market volume, yet to be seen. So you got to see sort of what's going to come to market in the second half of the year, but we had the sale of the mobile building, which went to contract a couple of weeks ago to an individual entrepreneurial-type investor at really record-breaking price for a leasehold and a very large scale deal, the contract price there is rumored to be around $900 million. So I think year-to-date, we have seen $7.5 billion close, $9 billion under contract and about $5 billion more so on the markets. So it's very active out there. We're winning our fair share of deals. Most of our deals are off market like 388 Greenwich, like the retail deals I spoke about, but it's a very healthy environment for us right now to have a lot of success in.", "George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Thanks. And also any color on the competitive landscape in the origination market? It didn't really impact yields in first quarter, but do you expect to see yield compression over the next 6 months?", "Andrew W. Mathias", "Let me ask David to answer that.", "David Schonbraun", "I think we've had a good run this quarter. And I think based on our pipeline, the next quarter or 2 may be as robust, or more robust that yields looking in line or even above, where we are. So I think just through our existing relationships and kind of be aggressive with capitals back and taking the whole thing down, we kind of have the same success we've had in other years. So I think we're comfortable with that even though there are more entrants into the marketplace, still I'd like to keep that competitive advantage and put out money at these returns.", "Operator", "Next, we have John Guinee, Stifel.", "John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Steve, at the lower price point of the market, 180 Maiden Lane, a few other assets you might have, are you getting any competition from Jersey City? Is anybody considering actually going over to the other side of the Hudson?", "Stephen L. Green", "As best I can tell, most of the larger tenants that have been looking at Jersey City mostly used it as a stocking horse. We've seen a couple of big tenants, meaning 150,000, 200,000 square-foot guys, come through a door at 180 Maiden and been told that it was a discussion between the east side of downtown, the west side of downtown and Jersey. And I think in every one of those cases where we've seen those tenants, they ultimately turn their focus to stay in lower Manhattan. So, I mean, I've not heard or sensed that there's been much flight to the Jersey side.", "John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then second question also for you, Steve, we got to Page 42 of the supplemental and it looks like a lot of roles in both your consolidated and your JV portfolio, a little bit of a potential rent, roll down based on asking rents in the consolidated portfolio, but a sizable rent roll up in the second quarter, 972,000 square-feet and the consolidated 254,000 square-feet in the joint venture. If you could just give us a little more color on what's happening with these sizable tenants?", "Steven M. Durels", "Well...", "George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "If it's proprietary because you're in negotiations, just say so.", "Steven M. Durels", "No. Our biggest explorations, where we think that we're likely to lose the tenant or there'll be any material change in the rent, we sort of already been through those. It was Cranes at 711 Third Avenue, it was Draft at 810 Seventh Avenue -- 919 Third Avenue and it was PLI at 810 Seventh Avenue. There are no other really big guys out there, that I can recall other than AIG and Harper Collins, which, I guess, in my mind have already -- that was sort of a last year event, where we knew they were leaving and that's one of the reasons we bought those 2 buildings. But the rest of the portfolio, at this point, it's really about filling the vacancy that we already have. I don't think there's anybody expiring between now and the end of the year of any size so we don't expect to keep and see a rent increase on.", "Operator", "Next, Vincent Chao, Deutsche Bank.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just wanted to go back to rent spread this quarter which was quite strong. Just curious, just given your commentary, I think I know the answer, but just curious how broad-based those increases are, was there anything sort of maybe deal specific that kind of drove that number and how are you feeling about the 5% to 8% for the year?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I think, we -- in our guidance, we increased that yesterday to 7% to 10%, so we're feeling having come out of the gates, little stronger-than-expected. I mean, I wouldn't read too much into to it because I don't think we're expecting mid-teens in the second quarter, but we didn't expect in the first quarter either so, it's a little bit of a crystal ball. But I think if you look out over the second quarter, you'll see mark-to-market that's probably more in line with our revised guidance. And too early to tell third and fourth quarter. But again, if we have good visibility through the first half of the year and that average for the first half of the year is up around 10%, that caused us to raise the guidance up to 7% to 10%, which is a pretty significant movement because 5% to 8% which it was previously was already aggressive for, I think, by any measure for commercial companies in its market. So we're -- we'd be happy to end the year and be able to report that we are within that strike zone and I think that based on the $1.4 million of pipeline we have in place, where we can at least better estimate where those numbers are going to be and for all the deals that are really not yet known that we'll be doing in the third and fourth quarters of this year, the market feels like that's about the right level where we'll be. There's no outlier deal or 2 that contributed to that 15%. We just -- every quarter, that number is going to bounce around based on what's expiring so it's not a -- I wouldn't read too much into it, other than I'd read more into our guidance of 7% to 10%, then I would read into the 15%.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And then just going onto the pipeline of investments that you guys -- that you mentioned. Just curious if you could give us some color on sort of the composition of that pipeline, and what are you looking at? It seems like retail was pretty active on the retail side here, but just curious what the pipeline looks like.", "Marc Holliday", "Our focus continues to be on retail. That's where we're seen in the best rent spreads and finding the most fertile ground for off-market deals. So I think you'll see some more retail deals executed. And looking at some office and residential deals too, but those areas are very competitive.", "Operator", "And next is David Toti, Cantor Fitzgerald.", "David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Marc, I kind of want you to step back and talk about your structured finance portfolio, a little bit now that it's approaching about $1.5 billion. Can you just remind us sort of a guiding criteria if there is any, relative to return hurdles? Are you seeking to ladder in specific way? Or is it really just asset and relationship-driven?", "Marc Holliday", "So -- the last part of that question, David, just I didn't follow the last part.", "David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Sorry, I guess, I'm just trying to understand that there's a -- if there's kind of a structural map as you build the portfolio out? Or is it more really opportunistic relative to the asset, the relationship and the return?", "Marc Holliday", "I mean, I think, this -- we're in 16th year of this program. And I would say that it's reasonably well defined from our perspective in terms of the kinds of assets we target, the kinds of return hurdles were looking for, which in today's market, I think, we had forecasted spreads, or yields on subordinate paper of about 8.5%, which we've been exceeding to date, so exceeding is a good thing. But I would always go with our guidance, rather than the actuals I think our guidance is our gut and feel as to where the market either is or will get to, throughout the year. Although we've been finding the ability to outperform that. The volumes are pretty much are on target, if you will, is what we have projected I think it was somewhere around $1.450 billion, $1.5 billion. In the past, we've talked about limiting the amount of investment in this particular business line to about 10%, which would be up close around $2 billion, so we're well within that, it always had been. I think we generally fluctuate somewhere around 5% to 6% maybe 7% or 8% at the high, and that really hasn't, except for some extreme moments in time, that's been largely consistent over the 15-year period. And we get -- we originate couple of hundred million dollars a quarter, but we get repayments. So I think the return hurdles we established based off our funding sources, so the funding sources for this are at slightly more expensive than for the equity component, but they're pretty efficient today in terms of the amount of equity and debt capital out there, looking for yield product, yield product is very much in vogue today. This is yield product in some of the best collateral out there in terms of how you can generate these returns nationally. I think our experience in Manhattan has been just heads and shoulders above most of the markets. And therefore, we're fortunate to be doing this in this market. We love the collateral pool we have. We have, I would guess the best relationships of any subordinate lender in town by far, which is why -- which is what keeps that business going at such a strong pace. Our market share, as an office owner is high, our market share as a lender it's even higher. So one business complements the other. And I think, that the collateral the target is pretty well specified, our relationships are strong. Our track records excellent and the returns are a couple of hundred basis points above the returns we look for in straight real estate because it is -- subordinate loan is a levered product, but I would say in terms of actual achievement, the returns in this business have been solidly well over 10% and I would say that represents excess return.", "David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just a follow up on that. Given the sort of the growth of that platform and, again, I apologize I'm probably pulling questions out of my 2004 question list, but would you ever consider applying some of this business to sort of more of a broker concept where you're participating in maybe securitization, a machine of some sort? If you have the relationships and the absolute volume...", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I mean, that's are -- we do syndicate. And securitizations is just another form of syndication, as far as I'm concerned. So we are active, active syndicates. I think last year, I don't have the numbers in front of me, I think, we originated something like $1.7 billion originated, and we sold $1.3 billion and held, I guess, $400 million. So we love to syndicate. It's -- we prefer that we're not a securitization shop. We don't want to be a securitization shop, but having the ability to source and syndicate has an extraordinarily -- a shortening amount of indirect and direct benefits. Direct benefit is we -- it's profitability and higher yields on what we retain, but the indirect benefits are by delivering product to our relationships. We get product in return. It gives us broader access to the market, which helps the business grow and gives us more prominent names. So securitization, I would say, no, but to syndication efforts, definitely, yes.", "Operator", "Next is Manuel Coltron, Citi.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "It's actually Michael Bilerman. Marc, you talked about the exceedingly strong transaction market. Clearly, being able to sell into this market and glad being able to liquidate assets, and you talked about 2 to 3 more assets and I'm just curious, wholly-owned? Or joint venture? And sort of size because a Manhattan asset, especially, in your portfolio, it could be quite smaller, could be quite large. I'm just trying to get a sense of the total volume of proceeds? And potentially, how more aggressive you could get beyond 2 to 3 assets.", "Marc Holliday", "I think, it's -- Michael, it's pretty consistent with the guidance from the investor conference. We've got a couple of other deals we're looking at, which are generally wholly-owned, non-core, but of the smaller size. I mean, small is relative, there's nothing -- nothing in the portfolio that's small, but certainly on a relative basis of a smaller size, and whether we transact or not, on one or both, this year, we'll see. Obviously, we know we test the market. We try and get optimum pricing because these assets are hard to come by, so when you sell, you want to make sure you're -- you want to feel as if you're getting the right price and feel good about selling knowing that the next buyer is, obviously, buying with the expectation of making money. So we're very careful with it. We feel no pressure with it. We'll probably hang 2 properties out there. If we get our price, we'll transact it. If we don't, we don't. We've already done, I guess, close to 600 for the year. So that's probably somewhat in line with our guidance. Yes, net-net. I don't think you're going to see anything -- there's no statement coming down the road with a large scale billion dollar-plus kind of assets, but there is a continued focus on trying to prune and improve the portfolio and take money out of lower growth assets and then redeploy into higher growth assets.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then, maybe just coming back to Durels, just sort of on leasing. As you think about on lifting occupancy by the end of the year, I'm just curious, does that sort of exclude AIG and Harper Collins from what the current baseline? But even so, where is the growth coming from? And you think about the asset you're sitting in today, that occupancy has declined 660 basis points, big asset, I'm not sure if there's leasing going on there. I don't know how much of its 3 Columbus Circle. I don't know how much of it is sort of re-tenanting 7-Eleven, Third or 810 Seventh; where is the uplift coming that you're expected to drive through year end?", "Steven M. Durels", "It does exclude 180 and 10 East but the rest of the portfolio is rapidly filling it's a vacancy. The biggest chunks that we have of vacant space, where we feel good about -- if not filling all of it, filling a big chunk of it is 919 Third Avenue, where we have a 150,000 square-feet and we have active term sheet negotiations covering all of that space. 3 Columbus, where we have 150,000 square feet and we have either leases out or term sheets covering half of that space. Contrary to what the numbers may reflect, Graybar has actually been our most active building. It just doesn't reflect it in the Lease Commenced category yet, because of that deal we did with Metro-North for 260,000 square-feet and we have another 30,000 square feet of expansion space pending with them, and those leases just haven't commenced yet. Of that 260,000 square-feet, half of it was expansion space and my availability at Graybar today is down less than 2%. Hard as that may be to believe, Graybar was probably one of our weaker buildings 2 years ago, and is now our strongest building. We've raised rents in Graybar 3x over the past 6 months and are doing deals today in the mid-50s a square foot, whereas 1.5 year ago, we were doing rents in the high 30s, low 40s a square foot. So that's a little bit of granular response and then on the bigger side, we're seeing demand in the entire portfolio for vacant space, so I think that's where the lift is coming from.", "Operator", "Next, we have Jordan Sadler, KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Curious to sort of harken back a little bit to a discussion at the Investor Day regarding sort of tenants in the market. I mean, I'm hearing your comments, Steve, on the demand you're seeing. Things sound and seem to feel pretty good. Large tenants in the market, the guys that you guys had identified in one of your slides, a number of them from financials, legal and the TAMI sectors, and I know of or have heard of Macy's and Google, some others being added to the market, how is this dynamic affecting the market right now? I know there are some availabilities and some potential developments, et cetera, but are we setting up for a potential spike in rents or a broader spike in rents in Manhattan?", "Marc Holliday", "We're not underwriting a spike, most of our -- I'd say most of our competitors are and they're underwriting spikes that we see on the loan submissions, that are between 25% and 35% over the next 3 to 5 years, so very aggressive rental spikes. I mean, our whole way in which we've oriented this portfolio is about repositioning and leasing of vacant space and creating hundreds of millions of dollars of kind of identifiable earnings, without regard to any kind of rent spike. Rent spike would just be coming on top of that. So the earnings increase today is without regard to any rent spike or any rent increase from where we are today. We don't see a rent spike at the moment. However, the market would tell you that the next 2 to 3 years, given this dwindling amount of space, our portfolio being, I think, typical of that should push rents certainly higher than 3% to 5%, which is what it's been since the trough and, I guess, you could create a scenario for a couple of years about size increases between 5% and 10%. Rental increases, in certain product type, it is happening today, right? So the lease at 635 Sixth, which no one's mentioned yet, tripled, maybe Steve did. Yes, tripled -- $80 a foot for the regular floors, over $100 a foot for the penthouse space. I mean, that's clearly rent spike kind of material, and I would say, other of our Midtown South properties are increasing, not at 3% to 5%, but at probably, you can measure it, 10% to 20%. It does depend on which properties, which buildings, but we are looking at 27 million square feet, overall. And in that regard, we're modeling that out at returns that we think -- at increases that'll probably be at or exceed 5% for the next couple of years. So we have been talking about another 25% on top of the 25% we've already realized since the trough, to get back to and ahead, in certain cases, of peak level rents. We are there in certain properties, I think we will be there in most to all of our properties the next year or 2. So it's a good market and it's a good market, notwithstanding the overhang from the West Side, which has taken a couple of big tenants. But we sign, probably, 250 leases a year. So in the past 2 years, let's say, last year actual, this year projected, 500 leases, I can count on one hand the number of conversations where Hudson Yards was a main competitor for those tenants because the meat of our market, which is maybe anywhere between 10,000 and 50,000 feet, as \"the average,\" it's just not looking at multi-floor tenancy in new building Hudson Yards says, at their option. So we still feel it's a very competitive market. It's a good landlord market and we're still projecting 96% overall occupancy for the same-store portfolio, which started the year, I think, at 94%, Matt?", "Matthew Diliberto", "94.5%", "Marc Holliday", "So that's 200 basis points of positive increase in the same-store portfolio that we're projecting, which is a lot of leasing.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "I appreciate that color. I had one another. At the other end of the spectrum, on 635 Madison, what's the play there? It's a little bit of a head-scratcher for me. I remember -- I think, the last time you guys were buying, encumbered fees were -- it was 2007, maybe. I'm just kind of what's the play on that deal?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I think it's across the street from an asset we own at 625 Madison, so -- and the lease holder on 635 happens to be the fee owner on our asset at 625, so there's some potential synergies there. It's a very good receiver for our significant gains from 673 First Avenue, and it's a prime corner. So there's a significant revaluation. The rent on the existing position is significantly under market. So it's a revaluation opportunity in sort of the medium term, but it's our job to go out and create value in that position in the shorter term.", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Is the GAAP cap rate below the 4 7 [ph] that you referenced on the sale or that's the cash gap?", "Marc Holliday", "The GAAP cap for both -- both are below, GAAP and cash are right on top of one another because the rent is flat until the next revaluation under the fee position.", "Operator", "Next is Vance Edelson, Morgan Stanley.", "Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just going back to the rent spreads and the higher mark-to-market expectations in Manhattan. Could you touch on pricing strengths by submarket? I know you mentioned it's hard to pinpoint any specific drivers in terms of overall demand, but does anything stand out when it comes to pricing, when we think about Midtown versus Midtown South versus downtown? Or is that also just strong across-the-board?", "Steven M. Durels", "Broadly, I would say it's strong across-the-board. I think, downtown, you've seen rents rise, I think, to a lot of peoples' surprise, rents have been rising kind of disproportionately, as a lot of the big blocks have gotten soaked up and as the World Financial Center is starting to lease up and there's a lot of the big blocks on the East Side of downtown, have found tenants or starting to find tenants from Midtown tenants, Nature America, Revlon, being examples of that, who've gone downtown looking for price relief-type space. But as that inventory gets soaked up and space diminishes and the rents are starting to escalate up. Midtown South, the demand is insatiable. So if you've got the product and you're putting the capital into the building, then there's a ready supply of tenants that are willing to pay for it and it's not just the TAMI market, the technology guys. But it's really traditional Midtown tenants who want to be cool Midtown South tenants, and they're willing to pay the price. The problem there is just a lack of supply of space or lack of buildings with large enough footprints or enough inventory that rationalize an investment to take advantage of the opportunity. And lastly, I think, Grand Central is starting to get a lot more traction as far as tenant demand and rents are increasing in Grand Central slowly. The best barometer of that being the Graybar Building, as I mentioned earlier. But Grand Central, which is probably a laggard over the past -- in 2013, that and -- oh, I see, that's Sixth Avenue. Sixth Avenue, today is, tremendous amount of activity on Sixth Avenue. If we had inventory at 1185 Avenue of the Americas, I can rent it for $10 a foot more today than we were doing deals last year. I just -- the buildings pretty well locked up. We're talking a few tenants about trying to recapture space in order to take advantage of the tenant demand. So it's a bit of a shotgun approach, but broad stroke, there's good demand everywhere and pricing is increasing. In certain some markers, more than others, but I think most landlords have a view and most brokers share it, that rents are on the rise.", "Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, and that's very helpful. And then, shifting gears, could you just touch on the suburbs and the improvement you're seeing there, occupancy starting to move up, months of free rent was down a bit. Maybe just bring us up-to-date on how you feel about the suburbs, in general, right now?", "Isaac Zion", "This is Isaac Zion. There's continued improvement across-the-board. In Westchester, in particular, we're seeing more demand from the health and health tech sector and biotech. In Stanford, it's financial services, general corporates. The activity levels in the 5,000 to 10,000 square-foot range are clearly improving, and we anticipate into the next quarter to have probably about 150,000 to 200,000 square feet of leasing as well, and mark-to-market to be about the same, flat to up a little bit. So things are generally positive, it's just the pace is a little bit slower than the city, obviously.", "Operator", "Next, we have Brendan Maiorana, Wells Fargo.", "Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "In guidance, original guidance, or in your current guidance, I think, Matt, you laid out that $0.14 is higher from 388-390 deal offset by $0.03 to $0.05, or, call it, $0.04, the midpoint of dispositions, that sounds like maybe later in the year. And so, I guess, if I think about that, it's $0.10 up in terms of net property acquisitions. And some of that is driven by, timing with the 388-390 deal early in the year. Some of it is probably cap rate arbitrage, where you've got a higher cap rate on the 388-390 deal versus what you sell. But it seems like there's probably an expansion in the asset base, also. So, I guess, the question is, are you comfortable funding that expansion in the asset base with incremental debt? Or do you think, at some point, ATM issuance or an equity would be needed as you think about the investments for the year?", "Marc Holliday", "I mean, I think, right now we're focused on liquidity as a benchmark of sort of whether we are adequately funded and from a liquidity standpoint, and remember, the sales of assets that we're talking about also released large capital or large gains, as Mike had pointed out. So I think, from an overall liquidity standpoint, with the financing of 388 effectively paying for the acquisition and with the other things that we're doing, we have ample liquidity through the year. That doesn't -- so we're not -- we don't need to go to the equity markets to raise any money for liquidity purposes. We'll look at the market and look at what our need is, going forward, as we go through the year. And that will determine our stance on new equity, but I think the important takeaway here is that we really don't need equity to fund the plan that we have in place.", "Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then, just a question, probably for Andrew. But the retail deals, it seemed like the details in the press release yesterday were a little light. Just wondering if you can provide any color on size of those acquisitions and maybe current yield or longer-term yield expectations?", "Andrew W. Mathias", "We're unfortunately limited by contractual obligations until we close up those deals, which are expected to be this year, one of them in the fall and one of them later in the summer. So we'll be able to release further details at the time we close those deals.", "Operator", "Next, we have Michael Knott, Green Street Advisors.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Curious if there's anything to read into the slightly shorter lease terms this quarter? And then, also, Steve, just curious if you can comment on the trends in lease concessions?", "Steven M. Durels", "No, you shouldn't read anything into it. It was a -- we had a number of tenants that -- it was a hodgepodge of reasons. We know, in one case, we intentionally were lining up expirations on the floor, so therefore, we held the term back. In others, it was some tenants that wanted to do short-term because they had some growth expectations. But there's no broad trend that you should take away, just the opposite, quite frankly, is that we're more pushing just to reject short-term deals of late, in favor of holding out for longer-term deals, because we think the market and the leverages is our side to demand that. In concessions-wise, I think, if it's people who are trying to tighten it up, I think there's greater willingness of tenants that is to pay higher rents, in exchange for not taking it -- a reduction on the concessions. But I think the free rent's slowly getting tightened up a little bit. I think, there are fewer a build-to-suits where the capital sort of exceeds the typical allowance for wall space of $60, $65 a foot. So you see more deals where capping the capital, but it's -- that's still a tough fight right now. I think there's a greater ability to push rents as opposed to rein in concessions.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. That's interesting and somewhat backwards from what the normal course is, correct?", "Steven M. Durels", "Yes. And I think, that must be the world we're coming out of, where -- tenants who are capital sensitive. After the recession, it's certainly contrary to prior cycles but coming out of the recession where businesses were capital sensitive, there's a little bit of hangover of that mentality.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "And then, Andrew and Marc, just curious, the pricing on 673 First seemed pretty attractive. Seems like cap rates have been trending down further. Just curious if the fact that it's a partial user sale contributed sort of pricing now? Or should we read into it that cap rates in Manhattan have continued to trend lower even just over the last couple of months?", "Andrew W. Mathias", "I think, both. I mean, there's an incentivized buyer here, but I think that was roughly a market transaction for them. I don't view that it would have been a materially different result one way or the other had we taken it to market. There's a grab out there for good solid well-leased assets. This is one of those. It's non-core for us, just given its size and location. But for a lot of buyers who are kind of structurally priced out of the large scale Midtown Manhattan office market, this would be a highly attractive asset with great credit tenants and the ability to finance that project accretively well below the 4 7 cap rate would probably support a price right around there.", "James E. Mead", "If you look at the pricing on the Mobil building, in fact, that as well is a long-term leasehold and that is supportive of this kind of levels or even a little tighter.", "Andrew W. Mathias", "In that, obviously , Mobil was not a user. So you have 2 great, fresh data points all over the past week or 2 to go by. I think that we could conclude that there's a great investor demand and there's also big institutional user demand from -- which we've been saying, from the hospitals and from the schools.", "Operator", "And next, is Ross Nussbaum, UBS.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Marc, on the retail deals that you just announced and the ones that you might have in the Hopper, are you going to be partnering with Jeff Sutton on those? Or you going to be flying solo on them?", "Marc Holliday", "Yes, on the Greene Street deal, we'll partner with Jeff. And the Spring Street deal, likely not. Although we haven't had decided the full capitalization of those deals quite yet.", "Steven M. Durels", "As we've said in the past, it's really case dependent. Generally, most of the retail we own, we are partners with Jeff. We continue to partner with them on deals like 650 Fifth and which of the 2 here -- Greene Street deal. We're going to be partners with Jeff, so that's still -- that joint venture continues to produce great results and a great relationship. But not every single asset fits the matrix for us, or for Jeff, so occasionally, as in the case of Spring Street, well, that one we're purchasing ourselves whether we JV it down the road or not is, I guess, an issue for a later date.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And on the leasing front, we've been hearing that Bank of New York and Time are potentially close to taking 1 million square-feet around the World Financial Center. I'm wondering if that's what you're hearing, and then, if that's true, it would seem to open up your prospects for 180 Maiden taking off the far west side of downtown, if that's getting leased up, make's your life's a lot easier.", "Steven M. Durels", "I would agree with everything you just said. And add to it that, as they're finding -- if they make those 2 deals, I think that, basically, we'll lock up all of their big blocks of space at the World Financial Center, and the word is, that they're raising their rents in the center, which can only help things further as far as the east side having even that much more of a competitive advantage from a pricing perspective it.", "Operator", "And next, we have Alexander Goldfarb, Sandler O'Neill.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Two quick ones. First, Matt, you addressed the extra investment income from the acceleration on the mark on that sale. The other property income that was $14.5 million was up considerably from the historic run rate. Was there anything -- what was in there? Was there one-timer stuff? Or was that a run rate for this year?", "Matthew Diliberto", "We had a promotive of about $7 million recognized in the first quarter coming into the year. We provide in our guidance for expected promotes or lease termination income, as best as we can project them, so that's what's in the first quarter.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay, so you guys got a double positive there in the first quarter, on that side --", "Matthew Diliberto", "Both are positive, yes.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "You got the promote and you got the acceleration on the preferred position, so that was good. On 1 Vanderbilt, how comfortable are you guys sort of emptying out that assemblage and starting demolition ahead of getting approvals?", "Marc Holliday", "We've made no such -- we're in the process of getting the approvals and we're certainly in dialogue with the administration, trying to get that. We've set the building up and there are selected areas we have begun termination proceedings, but I would say, it's been very slow, very measured. And we'll just have to see how that plays out through the balance of this year in terms of the entitlements. That building will be developed or redeveloped, there's no question that we will do that. I think, the question is, what will be built there and when, is the question we're still grappling with and that'll weigh in heavily on the timing of the actual vacate to the tenants.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay, so the point is that you wouldn't look to sort of emptying it out and demo the site before approvals. You're going to sort of keep some income there until you get approvals.", "Marc Holliday", "You know what, for reasons, I can't get into on the phone, I can't get into that exactly.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "I got you.", "Marc Holliday", "What our strategy is going to be, what our timing is going to be, we have a definite decision to move ahead and develop or redevelop this property, that's happening. And the timing is going to be largely predicated on the receipt of the entitlements, but with that said, we are -- we have every expectation of building this building at 1 Vanderbilt. We're optimistic we're going to get the zoning, it's part of East Midtown, or work through some other mechanism and we're very much focused in on it and it would be a great thing for Grand Central. It'll be a great thing for the city, for the MTA, to see this building built and everybody that we presented it to, with the administration, the civics, the neighborhood community, I think, everybody seems to be very much in favor of having a new building built, not just on the West side, not just the World Trade Center, but one right smack in the middle of Grand Central where you have one of the 2 busiest commuter hubs in New York City and it's only getting bigger with East Side Access. So -- and the thing we have to face is building that without subsidy, whereas, a lot of the other developments are with subsidy, makes it, certainly, more economic and easier, but we are prepared to move forward on a full market rate based development, on a site that is perfect for the building we've designed, with a lot of -- with a lot of benefits for the city and MTA, and it's a very special occasion. So we're doing it, but the granularity of when and how and what kind of income will be in place this year, next year, we can't really get into that.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Whitley, and I will be your operator for today. At least this time all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder this call is being recorded for replay purposes.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Heidi Gillette of SL Green Corp. Please proceed.", "Heidi Gillette", "Thank you, Whitley. Thank you all for joining us today.", "At this time the company would like to remind all listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from the forward-looking statements that management may make today. Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the company\u2019s Form 10-K and other reports filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "Also during today\u2019s conference call the company may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure discussed and the reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found on the company\u2019s website at www.slgreen.com, by selecting the press release regarding the company\u2019s second quarter 2014 earnings call.", "Two items before turning the call over to Marc Holliday, Chief Executive Officer of SL Green Realty Corp. First off the company yesterday in its earnings release announced that it will host its annual institutional Investor Conference on Monday December 8th, 2014 in New York City. To be added to the conferences email distribution list or to pre-register please email slg2014@slgreen.com. Secondly I ask that those of those of you participating in the Q&A portion of the call please limit your questions to two per person.", "Thank you. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead Marc.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. Thank you, Heidi, and good afternoon, and thank you dialing in today. Continuing on the heels of our strong first quarter showing we have now completed an excellent second quarter which is reflective of the vibrant New York City economy, strengthening commercial office market and successful execution of our strategic plan. The foundation of our success begins with the strong New York City economy and expanding jobs market.", "The New York City seems like it may be on track to add approximately 100,000 private sector jobs for the year with 50,000 jobs already created through the second quarter. Office using employment one of the key statistics for our industry also showed significant gains with almost 10,000 jobs added primarily in finance and professional business services. So clearly a bit of turnaround and departure from last couple of years. If this trend continuous we would be on track for an approximate 100 basis points reduction in the vacancy rate for calendar year 2014 and I estimate that based upon approximately 20,000 jobs a 200 square feet per job of net absorption.", "Further evidence of this employment activity can be seen in our pipeline of lease transactions. Our current leasing pipeline has grown to 1.6 million square feet with approximately half of those deals out for signatures or pending and another 800,000 square feet in the term sheet stage. This 1.6 million square feet being negotiated, represented about a 200,000 square foot increase to the statistics I gave you on the last quarter we call and that\u2019s also net of the approximately 275,000 square feet we leased during the quarter and another 50,000 some odd square feet that was leased in the first three weeks of this current quarter.", "To-date we have signed up approximately 900,000 square feet of Manhattan office leases with an expectation that we will convert out of 1.6 million square feet another 1.1 million square feet of that pipeline into signed deals over the remaining quarters to hit our ambitious target for the year of 2 million square feet of leasing over the next, I would say five months.", "We have been \u2013 we have experience an uptick in our Suburban portfolio as well. Those leasing stats show occupancy climbing to almost 83% portfolio wide and positive leasing spread of about 3.2% mark-to-market on replacement leases. So this continues a trend that we have highlighted over the past four or five quarters and we hope that that\u2019s trend that will continue and our projections at the moment for the remainder of the year are showing such.", "One of the hallmarks of this company and something that was very evident in the press release you read last night or this morning is our willingness to sell mature properties and non-core assets in order to take advantage of favorable market conditions like we have at this moment and we demonstrate the success of our value add approach to investing. So far this year we have executed on five separate sales transactions involving a total of $1 billion of gross consideration with even more under consideration for the balance of the year.", "Excluding 673 First Avenue which was an original IPO asset these transactions had holding periods ranging from two years to seven years with a weighted average of approximately 4.7 years. So you can see that the game plan that we execute on these value add assets generally buy, improve reposition and lease and then try and convert within the three to five year window those sales into capital gains clearly held true with four of those five assets and the returns exceeded about 25% on those four assets on a $1 billion of gross sales and total profits approaching $300 million.", "So this is very much in line with our previous results on prior assets sales with the bulk of those asset sales recurring at the better part of the last cycle of five or six or seven. I think at this point we probably sold more assets then most of our nearest competitors own. So it is a demonstration of our \u2013 even at 28 million-29 million square feet owned we have you know we have shown over luck to grow for market share sake but rather continue to award our shareholders with the kind of profits that can be achieved when capital rates go to a 4% to 5% level where they are now and there is an incredible demand for vacancy. So you should expect that to continue.", "Many analyst that we\u2019ve spoken in the past 24 or maybe 18 hours have expressed to us that these sale prices have far exceeded what was been carried in their respective NAV models. So hopefully these sales have the added benefit of illuminating the substantial embedded value in our portfolio and the voracious demand for well-located and well positioned commercial Manhattan assets.", "We have sort of put an exclamation mark behind the fact that we have these two business buy, improve and hold and buy, improve and sell and in the non-core sale portfolio we do generate these capital gains, they are fairly recurring to greater or lesser degrees over time. And in the reports we see that there is this distinction made between underlying recurring earnings and capital gains which has taken on the nomenclature of noise. The reality is capital gains is nothing more than the monetization of those future earnings. And it\u2019s pretty easy to get your hands around whenever we sell an asset what the earnings diminution is from the sale of the asset relative to the price we achieved. And whenever the cap rate is below the earnings contribution rate that\u2019s an accretive sale and that\u2019s something that\u2019s hugely beneficial to our shareholders.", "So I think if you look at most if not all of the sale we achieved, they\u2019ve generally been local sales that are accretive to NAV it\u2019s not just the monetization for monetization sake but it\u2019s where we feel that we are getting a price that exceeds the earnings contribution of that asset going forward. And I think that rather than trying to dial out cap gains to get to core earnings we would encourage people to look at both of those as highly rewarding and almost the capital gains in some sense are more important because it is \u2013 it takes the mystery out of what something is worth when you have the market trade and these sales were all done at levels that I think are very supportive of asset pricing for our portfolio and assets in the city market wide at levels that probably exceed where many people have those levels pegged.", "So we are happy to have gotten those done. There is certainly more to come. Andrew is going to expand a little bit further on those sales with some details but also talk about our active acquisition campaign that\u2019s been going on as well, because as we\u2019ve been selling we\u2019ve also been buying. And not only identifying very good 1031 receivers but identifying basically the new product that we will be looking in some cases to monetize in three to five years from now and hopefully generate these similar kinds of gains.", "So with that said let turn it over to Andrew.", "Andrew Mathias", "Thanks Marc. As I sales we announced yesterday that Marc mentioned the investment sales market continues to take material steps forward. The Third Avenue site was purchased in December of 2012 and following a frantic 18 months of deal making, via air rights purchases, lot mergers and proceed sharing agreements lo and behold the company was able to turn a $32 million profit in those 18 months. Major credit to Managing Director, [Brad Herschenfeld] who led the charge on this investment.", "The 2 Herald sale bring us to conclusion a highly successful investment originated in 2007. One can\u2019t use highly successful when describing too many 2007 investments in the real estate industry, but this structure which stood the test of time in the real estate cycle and returned a cash IRR to SL Green of over 17% on what is a senior fixed income position which would normally earn 6% to 7% as levered. Our returns on this investment almost tripled those normalized returns.", "At 180 Broadway another deal purchased in 2007 where we created an enormous value vacating several buildings and constructing a state of the art dormitory for Pace University and investment grade retail box at the base. We sold the building for 4.3% cap rate and it\u2019s easy to see in these kind of numbers how demand for high quality fixed income real estate is accelerating in the Manhattan market. Across this backdrop of our individual transactions I would expect to see significant market transaction volume continue in to the second half.", "In the face of all this activity we continue to pick our spots on the acquisition front. We announced three new retail deals at NAREIT, before NAREIT in June as demand for retail properties continues to hit new heights we continue to scour the market for off market deals where we can get better than market returns and take advantage of growing retail rents. And with an interesting pipeline on the office front and the residential front for the balance of the year we would expect acquisition to top $1 billion this year making it one of our most active years in terms of acquisition in the last couple of years. We are actively evaluating the next potential asset sale candidates as well as we continue to view this market as an excellent time to monetize as well as to make new investments.", "The structure finance program was on track with our guidance and expectations with several scheduled pay offs occurring in the quarter and new originations slightly more than offsetting those pay-offs. Yields in that portfolio are holding steady and we have a very high quality pipeline in that portfolio as well and would expect to announce some exciting new deals in August. Structured finance continues to be an important part of our overall strategy.", "We look forward to a very active second half of the year and with that I guess we\u2019d like to open it for questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Please proceed.", "James Feldman \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thank you. And good afternoon. I was hoping you guys could talk a little bit more about your outlook for Midtown. We know of leases that are going to be moving out either go Downtown or the west side. I think if you talk to brokers they\u2019ll say they are not expecting really much in terms of rent growth and even minimal net absorption. I am curious what you guys are seeing from your perspective in thinking about your business over the next 12 to 18 months?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, we are not seeing that Jamie. So I don\u2019t know exactly which brokers that\u2019s coming from. I think the activity and statistics prove otherwise. We\u2019ve got, we are projecting still as we sit here over the next five months occupancy gain mark to market gain, we have tremendous activity. Steve Durels can kind of walk you through properties where in Midtown where we have vacancies like I don\u2019t know 280 Parks, 600 West, [inaudible] 3, 8 and 7, 3 Columbus all of which have lot of activity. So I\u2019d say anyone that\u2019s describing the market as stagnant is wrong, or off. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s opinion, I think that\u2019s factually incorrect.", "If they\u2019re talking about what they are projecting for the future I can\u2019t speak to that. But if they\u2019re talking about what is taking place now, I\u2019d say we have 900,000 square feet leased to date, a 1.6 million in pipe. And we are projecting a 100 basis point pick up in occupancy between now and end of year. Our rents I think are up 13% or 14% mark-to-market over the first six months. So I put that in one of the better markets we\u2019ve operated in since our IPO in \u201897. There has been better markets but there has been many that have been worse. So I\u2019d put this in the top third of those markets. And we think it\u2019s getting stronger for the reasons I tried to set forth at the outset with respect to the job growth we are seeing and increased demand in Midtown.", "Steve, you can \u2013 why don\u2019t you add to that your thoughts.", "Steven Durels", "Sure. Just to add a little more color to it. Of the 800,000 square feet of leases that we have out 740,000 square feet of that are Midtown deals which certainly speaks to velocity that we are seeing within our portfolio. And I would point you to the end of last year where we got lot of questions and there was lot of reporting about Midtown Grand Central Terminal, 6th Avenue in particular about how everybody was leaving and there was trouble on the horizon. And in reality what we\u2019ve seen since the fourth quarter last year through all of this year, is that there have been a number of very large deals done in Midtown particularly on 6th Avenue, White and Case, [Neuberger Burban] being very good examples of that, where it is a cyclical market and each of these submarkets are going through changes right now. And as much as Downtown is the beneficiary of those tenants who are price sensitive, whose businesses are low margin businesses, than that brings us to the Downtown market. But they are only going Downtown because rents are stable to rising in Midtown. And while there is a big rent difference between Midtown and Downtown that creates market relief. And we are seeing good velocity throughout the portfolio. So I think we all remain very bullish on the Midtown market.", "James Feldman \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch", "And I guess Steve, while we have you on, what are your thoughts as we do start to see some of these larger vacancies in the market? How do you think that plays out?", "Steven Durels", "Well, I mean give me a specific concern.", "James Feldman \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch", "Right on\u2026", "Steven Durels", "Yeah. So [Condinas] has got obviously time left while there are out shopping in that space, they have got a very heavy rent that they are looking for on this space, a rent that\u2019s substantially above what Condinass is vacating, for the simple reason that the big blocks in Manhattan and in Midtown in particular are in fairly short supply. But I think if you ask the \u2013 who own that building, they are seeing a lot of velocity in their portfolio, they have time on their side and quite frankly they are kind of marketing off the backs of the port who is paying the rent on the Condinas space after Condi moves Downtown.", "So they are confident that there is going to be strong demand and it\u2019s going to likely come from probably one of two industries. It will be either law firms or it will be financial services because those have been the big drivers for the Midtown leasing. The other one that people throw around is the Time Warner and again that\u2019s so far off in the future, it\u2019s years off in the future as to not be competitive against anything that \u2013 certainly for our portfolio that we\u2019re competing against.", "James Feldman \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then secondly can you talk a little bit more about 7-19-7 what do you guys envision there in cost?", "Marc Holliday", "7-19-7.", "Andrew Mathias", "All right. The intention is to vacate the building take it down and build a retail box similar to what we\u2019ve done on several other corners in Time Square. So I mean, it\u2019s a very small site, it will be a single tenant occupant that we\u2019re looking for and I would expect cost there to be in the neighborhood of $30 million or so of construction.", "James Feldman \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay. All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John W. Guinee with Stifel. Please proceed.", "John Guinee \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Company", "Great. All right thank you very much. Marc or Andrew how should we look at the valuation on the City building 388-390 Greenwich, how you are guys thinking that plays out?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I mean in terms of yeah, we don\u2019t do valuations per se let me start with that. So we don\u2019t put valuations on the properties and hang them out there. With that said we would look at this as I think the rental contribution as it currently sits, I think is about a $150 million net rent. So and yeah we\u2019ve got probably remaining maybe $250 million or so of capital between now and 2017 or 2018 that we\u2019re going to put into the building and then there is either an option that city may or may not exercise after that I think sometime between \u201817 and \u201820 or \u201821 which if exercised the value will be capped at $2 billion which I don\u2019t have the number \u2013 we did this on a protocol John but it produced double-digit kind of returns from inception back in 2007, which again Andrew sort of highlighted as making big profits and double-digit returns on 2007 deals are few and far between.", "We obviously did it on 2 Herald and 180 Broadway and we would do it on 388 if they hit the option. If they don\u2019t hit the option then you can apply whatever cap you want to apply to that rent and get to whatever value that would bring to you which would likely be at least $2 billion, possibly more. But that sort of depends on A, what is the rent then because it is subject to a CPI adjustment annually. So we can\u2019t sit here today and tell you what that rent would be in \u201817 or \u201818 it\u2019s dependent on CPI.", "And two, it depends on what cap rate is at that point in time. But certainly in today\u2019s world I think that\u2019s every bit of a five cap today not less.", "John Guinee \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Company", "And then a second Herald Square is to me just sort of a fascinating deal. Looks to me like you sold your fee or your land position for a shade over a $1,000 or right about a $1,000 per net rentable square foot for the building. A couple of questions what\u2019s the buyers plan for that building or what\u2019s their plan for the fee position or the land position. And then two what kind of gain would you \u2013 what kind of tax gain you would have on that and how would you \u2013 are you able to roll that sort of gain into another asset on a 1031 basis?", "Marc Holliday", "I\u2019ll answer the first part and I\u2019ll leave Matt to answer the second part, John. Buyer is a life insurance company and the tenant under the lease does have an option to buy that fee position in 2027 which we sort of highly expect that they will exercise that option as does the buyer. So the buyer is basically looking at it for the fixed income stream it will produce between now and 2027 and you are right on the square footage there, the building is around 365,000 rentable square feet. So Matt?", "Matthew Diliberto", "And John to the tax side of the things yes we do the gain will be significant but we certainly have the ability to roll that into a 1031.", "John Guinee \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Company", "Thank you very expect.", "Marc Holliday", "Yeah we expect to fully have that deck shelved is our current planning.", "John Guinee \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Company", "All right thank you.", "Marc Holliday", "Thank you John.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Hi good afternoon everyone. Just curious if you can maybe elaborate a little bit more on the additional assets sales which you are contemplating, maybe just order of magnitude what kind of size are we talking about and given your comments about suburban markets picking up here over last couple of quarters if there\u2019s any potential that, that would be included?", "Marc Holliday", "The sales we were referring to at the outset are sales of additional Manhattan assets. They would likely be assets that we consider non-core which I think if you look at the five we sold this year and I think last year we did one court and a couple of others that there is a consistent theme there which if you look at remains in the portfolio, you can kind of pick through things where we stabilize non-core assets, we make good trading candidates versus other kinds of core [fortress] type buildings that we think there\u2019s a whole another round of profit opportunity as we will lease it there in hopefully double-digit mark-to-market environment that\u2019s highly compelling.", "So order of magnitude don\u2019t really have a number on it. Let\u2019s say over the next 12 months another few hundred million dollars worth of sales growth at least. So whether any or all of that concludes in the balance of this year, who knows because there is nothing that we\u2019re actively underway on and these sales typically take four to six months. So more likely than not they are deals that would be very end of this year or first quarter of next year.", "But that was \u2013 that\u2019s a rough description of the kind of things we\u2019ll be looking at. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re looking at another billion dollars per se but 300 million plus is certainly on the table.", "Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay and on the suburban side, is that perhaps conditions improving to the point where that might more be part of the \u2013 this story?", "Marc Holliday", "I mean the answer is yes, it\u2019s in that direction. But I think those assets are most ripe when you get the occupancy levels that are probably closer to 88%, 90%. I think that\u2019s where we can probably get our best execution. And right now we\u2019re around 83% and I think we\u2019ll end the year hopefully at 84%. So it\u2019s strengthening in the right direction. There may be individual assets that fall into that category ones we would consider no different than having an asset for sale. But I think as I said on the last call getting closer to a market where we can look to certain of those assets as contributors to equity and liquidity for new deals but maybe not just yet.", "Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS. Please proceed.", "Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS", "Hi good afternoon guys. Marc are you surprised positively to the strength of what\u2019s been going on in the New York Street retail scene particularly in the revenue in the quarter?", "Marc Holliday", "I think the rents, no, the rents have been consistent, I think the number of participants who are willing to pay kind of extraordinary prices and price per square foot for grade level retail has surprised me. It was over the years the domain of a new and now there is a number of other new entrants to the market that is creating more pricing pressure which is flattering our existing portfolio, makes it harder to add to that. With that said I think we\u2019ve done about five or six deals since December so we are still very active but there is \u2013 the relationship between net rent to price is really no different than we see in the office markets. These deals are traditionally deals that are bought at whatever cap rate it could be 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, cap rates going in but we deploy then to stabilize call it 6% to 7% or 6% to 7.5% range which is not too dissimilar you know from where we are.", "I just find that people are making greater leaps of faith in the ability to that market happen quickly and significant buy out monies involved, it is a little more risk in executing our plan but the rewards as you have seen are pound for pound far greater than we are experiencing with office right now. Office rents we are talking about 10% mark to market. These retail assets you are talking about 200% to 300% market to market. So there it\u2019s night and day in terms of opportunity profile and people are paying extraordinary process for that we are taking response hopefully wisely and so far it\u2019s proven to be a major contributor for the firm. We are going to stay active there and we do have a pipeline of retail properties for the balance of this year already identified.", "So right now it\u2019s one of the great pieces of our overall program is that retail real estate platform.", "Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS", "Okay. I appreciate that. Second question is on your structured finance book. There was a footnote there that was trying to figure out which is you reclassified just under $100 million of a then preferred to equity investment you guys did in the first quarter into unconsolidated joint venture. So I am just curious for some color around what prompted that what\u2019s was that?", "Matthew Diliberto", "So it\u2019s Matt that\u2019s accounting and only accounting. There is an equity kicker feature in that deal which we do often get in preferred equity positions, that is structured in such a way that it falls in to a virtual no man\u2019s land of accounting rules and for that simple reason it\u2019s put into a JV category versus the consolidated and preferred equity book. It doesn\u2019t affect the income stream, it doesn\u2019t affect the income it will get on a go forward basis for the term or anything else, it\u2019s simply an accounting treatment.", "Marc Holliday", "But it is what we would otherwise characterize as a piece of structure equity that\u2019s right. Structured finance like mezzanine preferred equity with terms and you know remedies and all the rest it just happened to be in the equity books we got.", "Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS", "Okay. Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of [Brenon Maron with Wells Fargo]. Please proceed.", "Unidentified Analyst Thanks, good afternoon. Hey Matt another really strong quarter in terms of bottom line FFO. Did you guys contemplate revisiting the guidance given how strong it\u2019s been in the first half of the year, I know you raised after last quarter and if not what should we sort of think about is some of the things that would bring the run rate down pretty significantly in the back half of the year to kind of get where your current guidance midpoint stands?", "Matthew Diliberto", "So we certainly look at where we think we are going to close out the year all the time so we did have to close the quarter as well but I think we are comfortable where we sit now, we are trending within the guidance range and then certainly could see ways to get above that. But that said we are always evaluating things we never sit still. There could be asset sales which Marc just touched on a little while ago there may be other opportunities to source capital. The refinancing market is strong and we always evaluate opportunities to accretively refinance in place mortgages or other corporate financing sometimes those involve taking charges.", "So that\u2019s potentially on the table for the rest of the year and the sales that we consummated which weren\u2019t necessarily a factor in updating our guidance into the first quarter now play in. So deals like 2 Heralds where we will have effect on earnings as well. So I think as we\u2019ve said today while there could be in and outs the rest of the year we feel comfortable leaving our guidance as is at 590 to 596.", "Marc Holliday", "Yeah with that said I think we have a feeling where we sit now that the guidance would be at the higher end of the range possibly even little in excess but\u2026", "Matthew Diliberto", "Somebody else was before for about like volumetric sales. So sales by one way, earnings momentum price the other and we are finding the right balance of the two but for the moment we are just going to leave where it is.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I understood. Makes sense. As you guys highlighted really great execution on three sales that you announced last night, just when I was kind of doing the back of the envelope map net proceeds of $240 million that seemed I was getting a number that seemed it will be a little bit higher than that based on the gross sales proceeds and that and your interest. Was there any promote fees that were due to any of your partners or anything like that that would cause the net proceeds to be down relative to what I would have thought.", "Matthew Diliberto", "It\u2019s Matt there is one component that maybe throwing numbers. We don\u2019t have any promotes due to anybody else we don\u2019t have those in any JV so I\u2019ll make that point. There is in place debt that will need to be decreased and that will be our cost and so that comes off the top as well.", "Unidentified Analyst Okay, so what was your \u2013 what were magnitude of differential?", "Matthew Diliberto", "I think it was around 25 million or something like I think I estimated\u2026", "Marc Holliday", "That\u2019s exactly the amount.", "Unidentified Analyst", "That\u2019s great. That makes sense. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of [Alexander Gofarb] with Sandler O\u2019Neil.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good afternoon. Just some quick questions here. As you guys look at the investment market for doing more stuff. Can you just talk a little if you are seeing anything on the residential side that maybe of interest or maybe that market has just gotten too pricy and second the weather Brooklyn is looking more attractive or if there are some structural things, developmental things that need to go on downtown before you get a lot more activity in that market.", "Marc Holliday", "Well on residential we are looking a lot of opportunities now. We see a lot of good opportunities and we I would say almost certainly will convert on some between now and year end. So yeah it is a competitive market but it\u2019s been a profitable one for us so far and we expect to kind of proceed at the pace the we\u2019ve been proceeding, and we\u2019ve been guiding people too and I think towards from now to year end that we will have maybe one or two deals to announce there. As to Brooklyn, Matt\u2026", "Matthew Diliberto", "We had a lot of success at the Williamsburg property where we just signed up a term sheet to make loan on other property in Brooklyn and we are evaluating other opportunities as we learn the different markets. There is explosive growth a lot of rental growth and value growth going out there. So we are certainly actively looking and trying to identify other opportunities out there.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And then the second question for Steve. Down at 180 Maiden, you just give us a sense for where you thought rents would be when you guys originally underwrote the building when you required it and where rents are today where you think you actually signed deals just given the strength in rebound downtown, just curious how much it\u2019s moved on your underwriting?", "Steven Durels", "Well we underwrote the building in the $44 depending on where you are in the property top to bottom and a lot of the activity \u2013 there has been two sides of the market down there. There has been a lot of big deals going on the west side, there has been a lot of good sized deals in small traffic on the east side but the east side has generally been at the lower price point. The best news of all is the low price product has largely been taken off the market at this point and I think the market is on our side so that\u2019s, we are going to, we will see the lift in our pricing compared to underwrites but I think it\u2019s got \u2013 we got to get some momentum going first. We got one deal up right now that right on our underwrite numbers, we are getting a lot of tour activity in the building.", "I would say two-third maybe more of the tenants are midtown, midtown south tenants and the profile of the type of tenants which are creative, marketing, information technology type of tenants which is exactly who we you know anticipated to the building as a result of our redevelopment plan and is exactly what we were shooting for when we underwrote the acquisition. That\u2019s we are seeing confidence that as we are further along with the construction we are going to start to see some good velocity down there.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Saddler with Keybanc Markets. Please proceed.", "Jordan Saddler \u2013 Keybanc Markets", "Hi. Good morning. Good afternoon, rather sorry. I\u2019m curious thinking back to the retail question a little bit that Ross was asking about. It seems to some extent the number of players have come in to the space and the valuations it\u2019s kind of have changed your thinking somewhat on the underwriting of the space and I am just curious as you think about it, does it change the potential hold period of these assets or are they still \u2013 is there still tremendous value or there is really no change just curious?", "Matthew Diliberto", "We just I mean we just announced the sale of lot of retail assets. So we sold assets on 34 Street, we sold 747 Madison, we sold Third Avenue which was a retail and we sold 747 Madison. So that should give a pretty clear indication of the fact that we are going to take advantage of what we see is a very aggressive bid for retail out there for sure.", "Marc Holliday", "Otherwise said we have sold more retail than probably anybody this year. So we are, we like this market to sell into but there are \u2013 we are looking to buy value add in retail and in office and particularly with retail which is less core than office sell for capital gain which these kind of cap rates we think it\u2019s great.", "So I mean if your question is does competition change our underwriting, the answer was no. It doesn\u2019t change All that changes the underwriting really is, is cost of capital that may indirectly be linked to what you are talking about and/or demand for space which is reflect in west. You know so whether there is three people we were just ambitious on these three or four \u2013 less participants as today the only thing with more market participants just makes it harder to find those assets. If they go outside of our underwriting we pass the deal. So it doesn\u2019t change our underwriting. We don\u2019t stretch to make the deal. A good example of that I think was 625 Madison which was largely a fee driven, I am sorry retail-driven exercise if you will which went beyond or well beyond our parameters this year so we passed. I mean that\u2019s the way it is", "There are other deals as probably six deals that we bought this year where they felt right within the parameters and we bought them but I\u2019d say that underwriting if you will a way we are modeling the deals sort of without regard to what other people pay other than if that drives the cap rate down low enough we\u2019re going to sell which we have.", "Jordan Saddler \u2013 Keybanc Markets", "Yeah I mean I was thinking are you maybe a little bit better for sale today than you would have thought at the beginning of the year your investor day outlook where you thought you were maybe a little bit better for buy as a result of just valuations going on roughly?", "Marc Holliday", "No, I wouldn\u2019t come off the call thinking there are all great opportunities in the retail sector, I think there are \u2013 those five deals we bought I look at each of them as a great opportunity. So my guess is I don\u2019t have the numbers in front of me probably exceeded our December goal already here we are in July, right I mean those are \u2013 what was our math, or do you have that Andy. We set out some retail acquisition target I believe and my guess is we\u2019ve exceeded that, $500 million between resi and retail so yes I think we have exceeded that entry I guess, likely yes and there\u2019s more pipeline. So it\u2019s when you have an abundance of low price capital in certain sub-markets, extremely strong rents that\u2019s a great market. That\u2019s a great opportunity set so we\u2019re having participants but if it folds outside the balance of targeted returns then we pass.", "But we still found ways to make our spots. A lot of those deals SL OP unit, components, and again that\u2019s a differentiating factor which I\u2019m not sure everybody, I hope everybody on the call gets credit to which is the SL Green OP Unit currency has been utilized to a very high degree as something that\u2019s very attractive and you unique for sellers of retail and office product and residential product.", "Jordan Saddler \u2013 Keybanc Markets", "And then lastly, any color you can offer on 5th Avenue retail assemblies?", "Marc Holliday", "No change in status there yet.", "Jordan Saddler \u2013 Keybanc Markets", "Okay do we know when that\u2019s or how long that will, the redevelopment will take place over or is it just open ended at this point?", "Marc Holliday", "It\u2019s open end I mean it\u2019s in process.", "Jordan Saddler \u2013 Keybanc Markets", "Okay alright thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi. Please proceed.", "Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup", "Yeah good afternoon. Just thinking about now the development and the redevelopment pool, page 35 of 3.8 million square feet now that you\u2019ve rolled 180 and [inaudible] 53rd in there, almost 3 billion gross of real estate, how should we think about I guess additional funding that would come as you redevelop those projects, number one. Number two, the NOI effectively perhaps dipping before it gets any better. It\u2019s obviously much bigger part of the company, these assets at this point, so maybe talk about certain goals that you have or the benchmark that we\u2019ve to think about for it?", "Matthew Diliberto", "Well let me answer the first part with respect to capital some of these projects that have been moved in may have significant value comprising the three point whatever billion of assets that you identified or identified on the page, but with respect to the capital going into those deals there they are not that significant by our standards.", "The redevelopment at 280 Park is largely finished. Although that probably is still in redevelopment place we\u2019ll come out at some point in not too distant future. 180 Maiden is underway but the redevelopment there is order of magnitude maybe $60 million plus or minus of which we\u2019re 50%. So it\u2019s we have enough liquidity in flow for that kind of project. That\u2019s not a significant kind of capital planning project and the same is sort of true of [inaudible] 53rd.", "So I think when you talking about development properties where we have \u2013 you have to have significant and well thought out funding plans it\u2019s 1 Vanderbill. I mean I mean that\u2019s it. The rest are I would I would almost manage out of cash flow you know I am saying for the bulk of other projects but 1 Vanderbill is the kind of project that we think long and hard about and as we get closer to construction date and that would after we get full approvals because we currently embarking on the new build process so you got first things first we get approvals in 2015 and then embark by then we will have a capital plan. We will be able to kind of walk you through that but at this point there is no capital, no significant capital for 2014 on that project.", "So that\u2019s not a current issue. No, it is something we are we are putting a lot of effort behind and next year we will be putting a lot of effort behind.", "Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup", "Alright. And then just", "Marc Holliday", "Michael just to clarify the $3 billion you are looking at I think that\u2019s a gross value we own 50% of the major development there. So for our balance sheet it\u2019s not $3 million it\u2019s significantly less than that.", "Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup", "Yeah. And just thinking about the 3.5% cash combined same store NOI in the quarter. What is the associated occupancy, same store occupancy that ties to that 3.5 and you know what would it be without sort of 3 Columbus, 100 Church and 180 Broadway which obviously boosted the overall pool? I\u2019m just trying to distinguish between the two.", "Marc Holliday", "The occupancy that ties to that pool Michael is 949 which is the same store occupancy we reported inclusive of the signed, as yet to be commenced leases. The pool is consistent what we guided to in December at the Investor Conference and the projection of 3% to 4% cash NOI growth is based on that pool. Clearly 3 Columbus as it\u2019s getting further leased up is contributing significantly to that. It started last year. It\u2019s building this year. What it is without those three properties I just don\u2019t have the numbers that precisely.", "So, you know the other properties not just other three properties are obviously contributing we got occupancy pick-ups in the Manhattan portfolio last year, we\u2019re growing that occupancy again by an expectation of 150 basis points. So that alone will drive organic growth. I just don\u2019t have at in my fingertips would it be without three specific properties that you mentioned here.", "Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup", "The 94 is just a consolidated not the total so, well can follow-up offline, fine.", "Marc Holliday", "949 is inclusive of JVs.", "Matthew Diliberto", "So 949 is combined.", "Marc Holliday", "Is combined, right.", "Matthew Diliberto", "Want to make that clear before we hop off this. If that\u2019s not consolidated that is combined.", "Marc Holliday", "That is absolutely, right.", "Matthew Diliberto", "Combined same store?", "Marc Holliday", "Correct.", "Matthew Diliberto", "Not consolidated.", "Marc Holliday", "Correct.", "Matthew Diliberto", "So, I think that\u2019s the most accurate number that we have but we can \u2013", "Marc Holliday", "Yeah. And that\u2019s what we guide towards.", "Matthew Diliberto", "Certainly we can take it offline. Next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with ISI Group. Please proceed.", "Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group", "Thanks. Just as it relates to street retail, are you guys looking outside of Manhattan I mean to the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queen\u2019s make any sense just wanted your thoughts on that.", "Marc Holliday", "Yeah, we did our Williamsburg residential project started out we just bought the retail counter there and a had lot of success, leased up to HSBC and Walgreen so, we down a couple of other sites in the Burrows and are looking at additional sites in high traffic areas for sure.", "Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group", "Just curious how kind of returns and pricing maybe compare in competition?", "Marc Holliday", "Competition is certainly less, returns are higher although as you get to the very high traffic areas there is increase in competition as people get sort of chased on Manhattan.", "Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Knott of Green Street Advisors. Please proceed.", "Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors", "Hey, guys I agree with you optimistic take on Midtown but just curious if you comment on the signed leasing volume and seemed a little low I am just curious did that surprise you in any way or was there something that maybe fell out or just curious your thoughts on that. And if there is any impact to any of your full year goals?", "Marc Holliday", "No, I mentioned earlier that we are still on $2 million feet, it didn\u2019t surprise us but for maybe one or two deals that will get done early Q3 and late Q2.", "Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors", "Okay. And then congrats on selling 2 Herald I would presume that possible the Lipstick land side is also possibly in the to-sell bucket?", "Marc Holliday", "So it\u2019s under consideration based on the execution on 2 Herald.", "Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tayo Okusanya, Jeffries. Please proceed.", "Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jeffries & Company", "Hi Jeff. Good afternoon. Just two quick ones. First of all, I may have missed this earlier on but apart from street retail just curious about the appetite for more multi-family assets going forward?", "James Mead", "Yeah, I mean we\u2019re actively looking at a couple of different multi-family situations. Our existing portfolio is doing great. We opened leasing at 1080 Amsterdam which is a big redevelopment. We did up in Harlan and it\u2019s been highly, highly successful so we\u2019re looking combing the market for more off-market assets there.", "Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jeffries & Company", "Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And then second thing, just the swap rate on the $504 million of mortgages", "Marc Holliday", "What\u2019s the question Tayo?", "Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jeffries & Company", "The swap rate\u2026", "James Mead", "3.8%.", "Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jeffries & Company", "3.8%. Great, thank you.", "Marc Holliday", "That\u2019s the swap we had on the previous financing that carries over to the new financing.", "Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jeffries & Company", "Okay, perfect. Thank you.", "Marc Holliday", "Sure.", "Thank you for whoever has remained. I look forward to speaking with you in three months time.

Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time the company would like to remind listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from the forward-looking statements that management may make today. Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the company\u2019s Form 10-K and other reports filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "Also during today\u2019s conference call the company may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure discussed and the reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found on the company\u2019s website at www.slgreen.com, by selecting the press release regarding the company\u2019s third quarter 2014 earnings.", "Before turning the call over to Marc Holliday, Chief Executive Officer of SL Green Realty Corp I ask that those of you participating in the Q&A portion of the call please limit your questions to two per person. Thank you. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead Marc.", "Marc Holliday", "Thank you, and welcome to all of you that have dialed in today. It certainly goes without saying that the easiest and most enjoyable investor conference calls follow earnings releases of the type we posted yesterday. On many levels the quarterly and year-to-date results illuminate the underlying strength in the New York City economy and the way in which our active management of portfolio and value-add investment strategy is continuing to pay off for our shareholders.", "We are generally on or ahead of plan with respect to our core operating metrics and at the moment market fundamentals appear to be improving on an accelerating basis. Demand for commercial space and resulting office leasing activity in our portfolio and the market at large should really not come as a surprise to those of you who have been dialing in to our calls through the year. We have been emphasizing three major factors contributing to a positive outlook that we\u2019ve maintained on prior calls. First and foremost is the continuation of a robust job creation environment. Important data shows that New York City is on track for the fourth straight year of plus 2% job creation with 85,000 private sector jobs added just year-to-date.", "Notably over 25% of such new employment is in office using job sectors like professional and business services, finance and the [TAM-E] sector. This equates to nearly four million square feet of incremental demand and the year is obviously not over. A second major leading indicator foreshadowing our substantial leasing results was the extensive pipeline of deals that we discussed throughout the year on prior calls. Even as our buildings are trending towards full occupancy, we still have 1.1 million square feet of leases in current pipeline of which over 700,000 square feet are either signed or ready in Q4, out for signature or pending in negotiation.", "The third significant factor driving space absorption is the relatively limited amount of near term new supply that will be delivered to the market over the next two years. While larger tenants of 500,000 square feet or more are planning for their space needs many years in advance the bulk of the market is made up of tenants below a 150,000 square feet and focusing mainly in the affordable commercial rent part of the rental spectrum and generally making leasing decisions within a much shorter time frame which bodes quite well for falling vacancy rates through 2016.", "Above average job creation and limited near term supply should sustain double digit mark-to-market rental uptick on expiring rents and combined with the debt of SL Green\u2019s leasing pipeline will drive growth in net \u2013 operating income now and we think throughout 2015 and on from there. These were just some of the topics we will delve into in much more depth at our investor conference in December but I wanted to highlight these items in particular here today I believe that our announced results are not an indication of a change in direction of Manhattan fundamentals but rather a continuation of a steady and protracted recovery that began approximately four years ago.", "With that we wanted to get right into the Q&A but we \u2013 as you noted in our press release last night we did raise guidance. So before turning over for Q&A we want to have Matt go through some of the major items and components underlying that guidance change and before turning it over to Matt I also want to note that this past Monday the planning department certified that the application for 1 Vanderbilt is complete and ready for public review to the ULURP clauses. This is a seven month statutory review process that should conclude in May 2015 and we have full intent and hopes of concluding that ULIP process with the issuance of a special permit to go forward with the 1 Vanderbilt development. So that quite an exciting moment for us after two years of work and design and predevelopment and environmental impact to get to the point of certification. So with that said let me turn it over to Matt.", "Matthew Diliberto", "Thanks Marc. As Marc said we announced last night we have increased our FFO guidance for 2014 to $6.06 to $6.09 from our previous guidance range of $5.90 to $5.96. We are giving [inaudible] related to the $300 million refinancing of 420 Lexington Avenue. This equates to a new NAREIT defined FFO guidance range of $5.82 to $5.85. The increase in our guidance range is a result of continued strong performance in both the real estate and then preferred equity portfolios through the first nine months of the year and our outlook for the remaining few months.", "In Manhattan our leasing volume is on track to meet the 2 million square feet objective we set out for the year, while the mark-to-market that Steve and his team have been able to achieve is well in excess of our original expectation. From an earnings perspective the 280,000 square foot lease renewal of [inaudible] provides a meaningful benefit to 2014, given its significant increase in rent which will be straight line to earnings starting now and the leasing commission that we recognized in the third quarter. The additional revenue from our Manhattan leasing activity is coupled with the operating expense savings we have realized as a result of more moderate temperatures in particular in the third quarter which is traditionally high expense quarter and the continued cost containment measures employed by our operations team.", "In the then preferred equity portfolio we saw the balance strength in the third quarter as we received the repayments we projected. However our new investment activity has been brisk and resulting in an average balance that has trended above our initial expectations throughout the course of the year and more significantly the yields we are achieving on new investments remain in excess of the 8.5% that we originally estimated.", "Looking to the balance of 2014 we have a pipeline of debt and preferred equity activity that we expect to close in the fourth quarter but we will also be keeping our eye on repayments in particular one large investment which could potentially repay this year. On the corporate side with our second investment grade rating which we obtained from Fitch a couple of weeks ago and an attractive treasury yield we will closely evaluate the opportunity to raise more efficient corporate capital to replace higher cost legacy debt. As you have seen in the first three quarters sometimes these refinancings result in one-time charges.", "With that brief summary of our guidance revision I want to remind people that our investor conference is being held on Monday December 8 in New York City. To be added to our email distribution you can email us slg2014@slgreen.com we expect to get invitations out over the next 24 to 48 hours. With that I will turn it back over to Marc.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay, thanks Matt and operator we\u2019re ready to open up the lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "All right, great. (Operator Instructions). Our first question here comes from Jamie Feldman from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "James Feldman \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch", "Hey thank you, good afternoon. I just hoping to get some more general color on the leasing market, what did you see this quarter that picked up so much and what are you seeing going forward?", "Steven Durels", "Hey Jamie its Steve. We really saw a continuation of much of what we have seen from the beginning of the year. Just to remind everybody we ended very strong last year. The market overall last year was a very good year almost close to a record setting as far as velocity goes and that momentum carried through the holiday and certainly didn\u2019t slow down over the weekend. I think the differentiator between what we are seeing today versus a year ago it\u2019s not just the story about the lower end of the market as far as price point goes but it\u2019s a story about big block deals being 100,000 square foot leases or larger, it\u2019s a story about the high end of the market coming back with a greater number of $100 rents being achieved today than we saw in last year and we continue to see good demand across the board from a wide range of businesses, whether it\u2019s financial services, law firms, accounting firms, business services and Jamie the whole advertising media information services sector is not slowing down by any sense of the imagination.", "So it feels like we\u2019ve got very strong momentum that is going to carry us through the balance of the year and going into next year very strong.", "James Feldman \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay, and then I guess to follow-up. How much are you guys impacted by the change in oil prices in terms of operating cost especially in some of your older buildings? Will you see a benefit from that?", "Matthew Diliberto", "On the margins we may see a benefit we do pass through a lot of our expenses so whatever benefit we would see is going to be shared with the tenants as well.", "Marc Holliday", "I mean clearly the common area charges, it\u2019s really question of where do we see the utility rates headed as a result of the oil drop. And I don\u2019t know if you have an update in yet to make a statement on that. We are in the process of locking in electricity rates for next year and it\u2019s a very good time to do it. So I think in the summer we didn\u2019t lock in as much as we usually did with the hope that prices would retreat a little bit on advice from our consultants which turned out to be fortuitous because oil has gone down and the price of electricity is we feel close to bottomed out, so we are locking in a lot of those contracts.", "James Feldman \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay great, thank you.", "Operator", "Okay. Our next question comes from John Guinee from Stifel.", "John Guinee \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus", "Great couple of questions. First, when you guys are looking at your mark-to-market, if it\u2019s say 10% on a gross basis what is it on a net rent basis? And then second what sort of effect to your NOI that you see from the inevitable property tax increases given a variety of things that are happening in Manhattan?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, let me answer the second question and then we\u2019ll come back to net to the extent we have that number at our fingertips. But the increase over the past probably five or six years I am going to say have been quite substantial. The mill rate has not increase all that much but our assessments have grown significantly and those increases are phased in, I think typically five years or so.", "So the property tax increases we are going to see over the next couple of years are really baked in from years prior at the transitional amounts coming to play but in terms of going forward I think that whatever property tax increases might come into play in future years that they may not be as targeted on the commercial sector as they have been in the past because I think commercial has borne well more than their fair share over the years and we\u2019re hopeful and we\u2019re obviously supportive of efforts to try and have a more equitable allocation of those real estate taxes among all property classes not just commercial so that if there are increases going forward that they would not be any more than they have been in the past and our hope is actually that they will be quite \u2013 the increases would be at a much lower rate than in recent past.", "So we don\u2019t see that at the moment as an area of risk or unanticipated increase for the company but we\u2019ll keep our eye on it and we actively are involved in trying to make sure that the taxes for our buildings are fairly assessed and reflective of the capital we have to put into it and they can see that do occur from time to time. So I think we\u2019re okay on property taxes for now but we\u2019ll see what \u201815 brings next fiscal year.", "As to the net recall that when you are comparing the gross rent on a newly signed lease we\u2019re comparing it to the escalated rent on the previous lease. So those escalated rents do reflect all the expense increase over let\u2019s say a period of a 10 year lease, that reflects 10 years of expense increases. So I think it is a proper comparative to look at new gross rents to old escalated expiring rents and look at that delta as reflective of the true real not nominal but real growth in rents, lease over lease for that particular lease. I can\u2019t necessarily extrapolate for the rest of the portfolio because you just dealing with the sample of leases expiring in any one given quarter but for those leases I think the 17% increase that we posted for this quarter is accurate in terms of where the older leases as escalated for expenses had risen to. Is that okay thank you, John.", "John Guinee \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus", "Great, perfect. I will get back in the queue. Thanks.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay, we\u2019ll speak again.", "Operator", "All right. Our next question comes from [Nick Urico] from UBS.", "Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS", "Hey its Ross Nussbaum here with Nick. Two questions first is what prompted the decision to sell 180 Maiden Lane versus going through the lease up process and monetizing it after that?", "Andrew Mathias", "Well it\u2019s Andrew, Ross. The short answer is the offer that we received was in our valuation too attractive to hold on to the property and go through the redevelopment because when we ran our financial analysis on the building the capital that we were going to invest and the rents that we projected receiving when we value the building somebody just frankly offered us more than that value. So we saw an opportunity to take that capital, redeploy it into a higher yielding deal on our valuation and to build Tower 46 on 46 Street and decided to pull the trigger on the sale.", "Marc Holliday", "Yes we\u2019ve gotten that question Ross couple of times and I think our shareholders want us to think like that. I mean that\u2019s our \u2013 our view is we redevelop a lot of property and it\u2019s sort of easier to just go with the plan, if you will and spend the money and hope you hit the market right but we are in the business of optimization. That\u2019s why we sell at all forget about why 180 and why sell at all, it\u2019s to basically optimize profits, reinvest in higher yielding deals that we see out there and then do it again and again and again.", "So we are not really married to any particular deal, 180 Maiden we thought was an excellent property. I think it will lease well and I think the redevelopment plan we came up with is a smart one that will appeal to this market. With that said we saw less chance of rental uptick on the upside coming out of 180 which had we thought a $45 to $50 price point versus Tower 46 which we think has a price point that that is $90 to $100. So higher margins, we think higher opportunity for lift in a rising market but 180 is a good building, it\u2019s a good redevelopment plan and we think the buyers will execute and do well. It\u2019s just doing well unfortunately this market for us is not enough, it\u2019s doing \u2013 I think that was the, as Andrew that said beauty to the trade if you will.", "Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS", "Okay, I am sure you saw that NYRT is evaluating options. Do you guys have any thoughts on that one?", "Marc Holliday", "Nothing in particular that we would speak about, just couple of the properties we know well in that portfolio and I would say we get our interest like any other situation would, but nothing more notable then that to discuss.", "Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS", "Okay, I think Nick has a quick one.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yeah, I just want to go back to the 2 million leasing goal you have the year. I think there was a couple of hundred thousand budgeted for 180 Maiden. So if you are saying that you still going to feel good about hitting the 2 million leading goal and on reality are you surpassing your goal for the year now?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, is that question to Steven Durels or the rest of us?", "Steven Durels", "Let me answer it, just let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves.", "Marc Holliday", "Let\u2019s take a vote who says we don\u2019t move the bar on 2 million feet. The show of hands around Nick is unanimous that we keep the bar 2 million feet notwithstanding the reduction of the couple of hundred thousand feet of 180 Maiden.", "Steven Durels", "Just like affirm it\u2019s a quarter of that.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Just and Steve you mind just providing a little update of 280 Park and Harbor [Column]. Thanks.", "Steven Durels", "Sure, so, 280 park we just closed a couple of small to medium size deals over at the building, one of them was a 30,000 square foot lease for part of the 14th floor with a starting rent of $120 a foot. The capital project is at this point I would say 90 plus percent complete. We are about ready to open up the mid-portion of the lobby which is \u2013 we haven\u2019t been over the building recently is really dramatic space, I think it\u2019s coming up better than any of the [inaudible] that we have shared with people. And we have a large lease that\u2019s in negotiation for about 125,000 square feet. So I think we are going to end the year very strong on that building at rents that are at or above underwrite.", "At 10 East 53rd Street the redevelopment work is flying. It\u2019s really going fast. All the windows have been replaced. The building\u2019s fa\u00e7ade has been recolored, the lobby is on track to be completed close to the end to the year, maybe early next year. The tour activity has been very strong. We have got leases out on our four floors which puts us four floors ahead of expectations. I really don\u2019t think we\u2019d do any leasing into early next year because of the size of the tenants and the rents are on top of our budgeted numbers. So we are feeling like we are in a really good spot with that building. We got a tremendous feedback from the brokerage community.", "Marc Holliday", "In deference to those winning patiently in the queue we are going to have to go for a ruling on whether two people from the same firm aggregate to four questions. We will come back with that ruling shortly. But thank you and next question, operator.", "Operator", "All right. Our next question comes from Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank.", "Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Hey, yeah, good afternoon. Just wondered if there is any additional color you can share with about the announcement from this morning about the Brooklyn site?", "Marc Holliday", "Sure, we purchased in partnership with Kushner organization and entrepreneurial Brooklyn operator called the LIVWRK which incidentally there was some confusion is not the same as We Work. This is a business that buys and renovates buildings in Brooklyn and it\u2019s a not fractional office provider. So there is no fractional office plan at the site as of now just to clarify any confusion. It is a prime site in Gowanus, which is an area we have heard from a lot of retailers we speak to, is sort of very target market for them.", "So we have an enormous amount of bulk. It is a very large site and the existing zoning, we have a very interesting as of right plan and a potential upside plan if we do decide to take the site through we can a rezone. So we are going through those discussions internally now and sort of deciding what ultimately how much bulk we want to put on the site but the development there will be retail-oriented primarily and then there are interesting commercial and residential opportunities combined with community uses for the building depending on how much bulk we put on the site.", "Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Got you. And just on the [inaudible] side of things I mean do you have a general sense of the size of the development in terms of dollar value?", "Marc Holliday", "It\u2019s 280,000 square feet as of now, so you will be looking at a $150 million to $200 million development as of now.", "Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thanks. And just one question on the ULURP process you mentioned the seven months process at 1 Vanderbilt, is it just sort of radio science for now until then or is there other benchmarks we should be looking for between now and May?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, this is the seven month is the beginning of public process. So this project will be reviewed by the community boards, department planning, planning commission and ultimately the city council as well as other stake holders like [inaudible] I think you will see a lot of discussion and the discussion has been extremely positive to-date from all different constituencies, [inaudible], the labor unions, community and city administration, so I think you will see a lot of discussion and but it will be basically presenting more formally that which has already been presented.", "Operator", "All right, great. And just as a reminder folks please limit your questions to two per person. And our next question does come from Steve Sakwa from ISI Group.", "Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group", "Hi, it\u2019s just one person, I\u2019ll just ask my two questions.", "Marc Holliday", "Hi.", "Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group", "I guess for Steven Durels, could you maybe just comment a little bit about sub-market performance, kind of you are seeing the greatest demand in terms of the portfolio? Where are you seeing the best pricing power, is it kind of the Midtown South, is it Grand Central, is it the 6th Avenue Corridor or just as you kind of look around the portfolio where are you seeing the best rents?", "Steven Durels", "Well, a couple of things you know the Midtown South Corridor is still on fire, lots of demand but still too small to really satisfy the overall market demand. I think the rent stay higher there because more over stock of building are going through repositionings. But I am not certain there as time goes by that market is going to continue to escalate with rental growth beyond where the market kind of top outright now maybe go a little bit but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u2013 we are not going to go from reposition building being at $80 a foot to the average being $100 rents. I think there is a lot of Midtown rent growth that\u2019s going on right now.", "We have seen good demand in the Grand Central sub markets, there was a lot of commentary at the end of last year that Grand Central was particularly slow, and there was a lot of inventory that hit the market last year on Sixth Avenue and we said at the Investor Conference a year ago that our feeling was that both those sub-markets would come back strong this year, in fact they have. Sixth Avenue has sort of returned to its historical norm as far availability and there has been a lot of deals in the Grand Central area. The renewal that we did just a couple of weeks ago extend the Schulte release for 300,000 square feet I think is a very good testimonial to the fact that tenants still want to be on the East side, they still want to be in Midtown and they are willing to pay rents that are commensurate with some of the best buildings that are out there.", "So I think as an opportunity and an expectation as to where there will be more proportionate increase in rents I think it\u2019s going to be the Midtown and the East side of Midtown in particular over the next 12 to 24 months.", "Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group", "Okay, and then I guess Marc just in terms of kind of looking for opportunities I know the market is highly competitive as you kind of look over the next year, do you think the best opportunities will be in residential, retail or office? I mean are you focusing on any particular area or do you feel there are more opportunities in one versus the other?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I would say two things first, I would think going forward we\u2019ll have to look and feel very much of what we\u2019ve done this year, which was quite voluminous, we think in many cases quite opportunistic but also quite varied, high ticket retail, down to middle retail, couple of big three big office deals and a little bit of resi, but some resi in pipeline as well. So I don\u2019t know that you\u2019re going to see any heavy emphasis on one versus the other. I\u2019ll have to say generally our experience has been and probably continues to be that pound for pound if you can buy the right retail projects at, not a reasonable cost because there is like nothing reasonable but at a cost where you can make your returns with a potential to make outside returns by working the tenancy more aggressively than your pro forma that\u2019s where the largest mark-to-markets are.", "So while office is great, office rents have been up for us about 15% mark-to-market over expiring leases. Retail rents you can generally measure as a 100% of more mark-to-market, when they expire for the kinds of deals with low embedded rents that we\u2019re finding. So those are probably on average the highest return deals that we\u2019re buying today but that doesn\u2019t mean the other sectors that we\u2019re focusing on aren\u2019t also high returns in themselves with debt and preferred equity being a good example of that, the portfolio originations for the quarter were in excess of 10% return on core product in New York City and that is something that we continue to have fairly high volumes originations, such that the balances at the end of the December are likely to going up above where our current balances were at the end of the third quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brendan Maiorana from Wells Fargo.", "Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Well Fargo", "Thanks good afternoon. There certainly been a very \u2013 even the bids for assets in the city, particularly office have accelerated through the this year, lots of foreign capital and even seems like maybe JV deals are priced as aggressively or even maybe more so in some cases then simple outlet sales which seems like a sort of fits right in the wheel house of what [inaudible] does well. So how do you guys think about maybe monetizing some additional assets, do you feel like maybe look to do more given the strong bids for prices?", "Marc Holliday", "In terms of fee versus leasehold?", "Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Well Fargo", "No just overall answer it just in terms of thinking about where \u2013 how prices have accelerated this year, do you think about monetizing more to harvest some of the gains that you have within the portfolio and then maybe realize some of the embedded growth in the stock price relative to NAV?", "Marc Holliday", "I think we\u2019ve had a very active year on the sales front and I think you\u2019ll see that continue in the fourth quarter. It is definitely our intention to monetize some of the value we\u2019ve created in some of our longer-term holds and a couple of our shorter term holds. You\u2019ve seen us putting some very large gains thus far this year on our sales. We still have the sale of 2 Herald closing in the fourth quarter and we intend to keep selling. We\u2019re just limited in terms of taxable gains and our goal which has been to retain as much capital as possible.", "Steven Durels", "Yeah there are different philosophies out there about what you should be selling into this kind of market. Our stated philosophy has been this way for many, many years has been in this kind of market the cap rates for non-core and core compress to where they\u2019re almost on top of each other. So our view is that\u2019s a bit of an arbitrage, in bad markets they gap out and cores maybe a 100 basis points or more inside of non-core but in a tight market they are on top of each other. So we like to buy core in bad markets and sell non-core in good markets.", "And I think that for us we prefer to retain those core holdings, in some cases do joint ventures, to kind of optimize or maximize our equity but where we see core holdings that have still a significant amount of NOI upside whether it\u2019s mark-to-market or re-development potential we want to keep as much of that for the REIT as possible and we\u2019ll continue to hold those assets which we think have the highest ongoing earnings velocity but non-core profit has generally bought redeveloped leased and sold to act as our currency for future growth and that\u2019s nothing new that I\u2019m saying there.", "That\u2019s been our ammo I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see any different in this market. So we will accelerate sales. Those sales will typically be of non-core assets, maybe some joint venturing of some of the higher quality core assets but we\u2019ll have to sort of see how that plays out because we\u2019re looking for cap rate differentiation to justify those moves. But right now there\u2019s not as much quality differentiation we see from that.", "Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Well Fargo", "Okay that\u2019s great, helpful. And then just can you guys give some color on the Gem Tower in terms of timing of when you think you can stabilize the asset and then return outlook or yield outlook?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I think we\u2019re pretty embolden right now by the fact that we haven\u2019t even closed on the building and we already have two offers there on space. We\u2019re expecting a third offer. The types of tenants that we\u2019re showing the building to are exactly in line with what we expected, which are financial services and law firm tenants. So I think we\u2019re expecting to do more leasing sooner than what we underwrote. We had a pretty sizable amount of downtime in our underwrite, given the fact that the building needs to be repositioned and really re-introduced to the market because it\u2019s a bit of an unknown product to the brokerage community but I think we\u2019ll probably have more on that hopefully by Investor Day to give an update as to progress made.", "Unidentified Corporate Participant", "Hi, this is [Isaac]. Once that leasing is done I think the anticipated stabilized yields are in the low 6% range in our total return basis. We\u2019re targeting IRR\u2019s on this deal probably in the 12% to 15% range so that\u2019s those are the expectations on this particular asset.", "Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Well Fargo", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Bilerman from Citi.", "Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup", "Great good afternoon. Steve a question for you just on the Schulte lease with the tenant having expiration 2021. I got to assume that they were out in the market place and I\u2019m just curious if you can share a little bit how aggressive sort of Westside and downtown developers are in terms of targeting tenants, in terms of what sort of incentives they are offering and the improvement packages and then conversely and keeping the tenant and signing the extensions starting 2021 can you share a little bit about how the 73.50 will compare to what the fully escalated rent is in 2021 because I think the 73.50 charge then and $60 is in the stock is the current cash rent. So just trying to understand how you thought about economics and de-risking out the future?", "Steven Durels", "Their rent will escalate a great deal between now and what would the expiration would have otherwise been because there are fewer pass-through on buildings operating expenses real estate taxes. So maybe it escalates another five or six bucks above the escalated rent today. As how the deal unfolded it\u2019s pretty interesting. It started with a conversation of hey one of our clients happens to be one of the partners on Hudson Yards and they really want us to move over there and we\u2019re like, great let\u2019s sit down and talk about renewal. And they went back and forth.", "They looked at the market, they kicked the tires, they understood exactly the kind of deal they can make on the far West side and the partnership overwhelmingly voted to stay on the East side, and that ultimately what drove their decision and the economics were basically looking at where we saw the value of a big block of space which has a slightly different values versus smaller spaces in the overall market because the big blocks are tightening out and for a 3,000 square foot tenant we saw that as sort of high $50s maybe $60 rents today and then put on a growth factor over the next several years. We netted up some of the concessions and ended at a starting rent of 73.50 a foot with $50 in TI and no free rent and we think that\u2019s a very fair number. Obviously tenants endorsed that but I think as if you stack that rent up against the deals that are being signed around town particularly some of them on the far west side or downtown and some of the newer product for delivery in 2020 or 2021 that 992 is a very good building and the rents reflect that value.", "Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup", "That\u2019s helpful. And then I don\u2019t know if Andrew or Marc can talk a little bit about 605 West 42nd in terms of the total construction cost and sort of the capital structure I think there is about a $540 million senior construction loan U.S. 50 and mez, I wasn\u2019t sure if there was other sources of capital outside of just pure equity and how much equity is being contributed into the project?", "Unidentified Corporate Participant", "Sure this is David. This was a project that the Moinian Group\u2019s owned for a long time. So when we invested they already had a couple of hundred million of equity in the deal. The construction loan is $539 million. About a 100 we took out existing land loan, there is about $430 million of hard and soft cost that are needed to complete the project. We invested an additional $50 million in the deal really to cover any overrun in those GMP on the deal. So likely our money will only even be needed for the project, goes for more security.", "I think we got into the project well past foundation when they were already a couple of stories vertical. So they are probably going to top it off in the next maybe 12 or so months, so it \u2013 we\u2019re kind of well through the construction project we started and all of the equity was already invested.", "Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup", "And your 20% option cost you what in terms of further capital if you exercise it?", "Matthew Diliberto", "Well we can\u2019t give you specific number at this point other than to say we\u2019ve negotiated for a kind of a present day number that escalates pursuant to a formula based on additional contributed capital and cost to a number where in the future we will have a look at kind of the final capitalization of the deal and the market at that time, and the leasing projects at that time and decide whether or not to exercise that option.", "Sitting here today I would assume that option gets exercised because we think it\u2019s a great deal Joe has been a very good partner for us, it\u2019s a very good project it\u2019s an ability for us to get a bigger footprint in midtown multifamily. With that said we really won\u2019t cross that bridge for some time. So there is really no decisions to make at the moment.", "Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Okay our next question comes from [Jed Regan from Green Street Advisors].", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi guys. So you got the good pricing on 180 Maiden, in fact you were able to kind of shift your redevelopment focus there to another project. Just wondering if that good execution kind of makes you reconsider the game plan for a project like 10 East 53rd and that sort of put a quick flip on the table for that asset?", "Marc Holliday", "No, I think it\u2019s a bit of an apples and orange comparison. The profile tenants that was going to 180, the rents that the market would support, the amount of capital had to be invested are two different animals. 10 East is a very high project quite essential boot seek building going to high priced tenants who are in a sub market where there is limited supply. So it\u2019s a different repositioning exercise with an entirely different kind of redevelopment plan. And if we could find three more 10 East 53rd Street I think we would be all over it\u2019s a great, great opportunity.", "Andrew Mathias", "It\u2019s Andrew Joe I would just add [Inaudible] flip offers for 10 East 53rd which we have rejected. Again we see the returns on that project significantly exceeding the offers we received.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay that makes sense. And also you guys and some of your competitors getting more interested in the outer boroughs and just wondering if you could see a Brooklyn or Queens becoming a material portion of your portfolio overtime or you think it\u2019s going to continue to be just kind of smaller one-offs at this point?", "Marc Holliday", "Well I think with $28 million feet Manhattan, I don\u2019t know that was much of anything we could do that will become a material portion of the portfolio overtime but I guess the question of whether we are going to expand our footprint in other markets, outer boroughs Brooklyn in particularly Andrew could address that.", "Andrew Mathias", "Yes I mean look we\u2019ve had terrific success with our residential project in Williamsburg and our office building at 16 Court. So based on those successes we are definitely actively looking in those markets for additional opportunities. The scale of the deal size is obviously significantly smaller than Manhattan. So both by dollar volume and by square footage as Marc points out I don\u2019t think we are never going to get a critical mass say the structure finance program in Manhattan but we are definitely actively in those markets looking for additional opportunities.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, thanks guys.", "Marc Holliday", "We have one, two, three, four more, five more. So we\u2019ll take five more questions it looks like and try and end at around 3 O\u2019clock because I know a lot of people on the call have a lot other calls they got to jump on to. So we try and finish up in the next 10-15 minutes with these next five calls.", "Operator", "Okay. And our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O\u2019Neill.", "Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill", "Great, thank you. Two questions. The first question is, on 1 Vanderbilt, can you just comment on the $210 million of infrastructure that\u2019s being discussed that you guys would fund can you discuss how this impacts the yield? Just because obviously you guys don\u2019t get the tax incentives that the far West Side gets, so just curious how this affects the yield.", "Matthew Diliberto", "No that\u2019s something we haven\u2019t discussed yet and probably won\u2019t be getting to that level of detail until after we know we have the approvals at the end of this ULURP process because it will be premature without the approvals, we don\u2019t go forward with deal. So I think step one is obtaining the approval, step two is we will talk about capitalization of project and then three will be far enough along we will have greater visibility into the rents and the projected rents that we will be able to pass along some return data. But I can tell you that the scope of the MTA project is something we\u2019ve been working on for quite some time and the cost have been included in the overall budget.", "So it\u2019s not something that adding to or taking away from our development returns it\u2019s part of the project it\u2019s known and it is there is a lot of complexity to the project a lot of cost and as you know there is no subsidy. So we have to do this completely right but I would say to-date we feel like we have a great design it\u2019s the right kind of transit oriented development sitting right next Grand Central station right at its doorstep essentially. So we are very happy with the project we\u2019re going to take it incrementally in terms of the kinds of questions you were asking.", "Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill", "Okay. And then the second question is, on the Gowanus deal, between the three partners, you guys obviously bring a lot of experience and financial. Kushner has a lot of real estate experience obviously. The LIVWRK guys, they\u2019ve done the Domino Sugar site and the Mercedes so they understand that challenges of it. Can you just help us understand how the three of you guys are going to work together? Is there one driving partner or is it all three working together, or each entity has a specific focus and capital contribution?", "Marc Holliday", "I think it\u2019s going to be a collaborative between the three I mean I think we are the dominant equity player given relative scale but in terms of day to day Rob Schiffer spearheads it from the SL Green side. And he is working closely with Jared and Asher on the development plan and you know we are going to approach it collaboratively.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya from Jeffries.", "Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "Yes, good afternoon. Just some news hitting the rides recently about JP Morgan considering moving to Manhattan West in the next few years. Just wondering you know if you can kind of give us any color on that and what that could potentially mean for kind of classic Central Midtown if that happens?", "Marc Holliday", "Well I don\u2019t think we have any color then we could share with you on the JP Morgan\u2019s intentions or they are not attendants of our about us or what ultimately happens there I mean Tayo every every significant tenant of size over the past three-four years has checked the tires on Midtown and Manhattan West, Downtown we went through that with 5 common city group as you may recall and you know time and time again I think it\u2019s been shown that if you have the right building in the right location retained tenants we have done that very successfully so I don\u2019t know what JPMorgan\u2019s intentions are going to be or not going to you know what we have been what we have heard that is that if they were to pull out and relocate that\u2019s something where the vacancy impact of that would not be felt until early to middle of 2020 it\u2019s possible is 2025.", "Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "Okay.", "Marc Holliday", "For the full impact of their vacancy. So you are talking very long-term. I mean I am really focused on four million square feet or more of net absorption over the next two to three years or so maybe we will [inaudible] 12 million square feet of demand over the next two to three years that hopefully is going to focused right in our real house and will always be you know sort of watching decisions and preferences about where they want to be but you have to assume by necessity if New York City is creating a 100,000 private sector jobs a year the city\u2019s inventory will have to grow. We don\u2019t want to lose tenants.", "So the question is going to be over the next five or ten years where can that growth can occur and then clearly each Midtown which is being considered to come back on the board to put to allow for more development in and around Grand Central as well as having options on the west side makes a lot of sense and we will see how that plays out. But I think you should assume any big tenant of a couple of square million feet or more going to looking at very option in the city and sometimes outside the city.", "Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "That\u2019s very helpful color. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jordan Saddler from Keybanc Markets.", "Jordan Saddler \u2013 Keybanc Markets", "Thanks. I just wanted to bring it back to office fundamentals at Manhattan real quick. Marc I mean you characterized this is recovery that has been taking place over the last four years and I can relate to that, I guess but the 15 plus percent mark-to-market year-to-date feels significantly better than kind of what we were led to believe might happen last December. So it feels kind of like it\u2019s surprise to the upside and I am just I am curious on thoughts in terms of how things are shaping up as we look forward or things just continuing to get better in our rent headed significant higher?", "Marc Holliday", "No, I think our contention has been since the end of last year, yes. There was \u2013 we saw one cycle of growth from 2010 to 2012 and then we kind of saw the second cycle \u2013 of and that was almost getting back to even let\u2019s say you are getting close to even and then there is this second cycle of growth which I think you saw at the beginning of this year and we think will take rent to new heights you know next year and I don\u2019t think there has an normally given that this growth has been steady for the last years, but you are seeing the mark-to-market now, because for the first several years you were kind of recouping losses and filling vacancy, remember office vacancy got as high 13%-14% now it\u2019s down around 10%.", "So a part of that growth was filling space and couldn\u2019t really drive rent but when you start to get to rent 10% and clearly at 9% at the low then you will see that reflected in rent which are appropriate. I mean there has been expenses increase there has been cost of construction increase there has been valuation increase. So I mean the fact that rents are finally catching up if you will in my mind is really nothing more than that, a catch-up to get back to normalized and I think you will see that this year and next and because we have some low embedded rents in our portfolio that is going equate to mark-to-market but on the demand side I don\u2019t think we have seen a large year-to-year variation. You are just seeing the effect of inventory getting to a point where the next effective rents can start to be like\u2026", "Jordan Saddler \u2013 Keybanc Markets", "And as we look forward into next year you think we\u2019ll cross the threshold back toward sort of more of the landlord dominant market sort of sub 9% vacancy?", "Marc Holliday", "I don\u2019t know about sub 9% but that will be a big move but I would say it\u2019s sub 10% and that will be a healthy \u2013 I mean we are not looking for extraordinary rental moves. People are underwriting that because remember we lend to a lot of these folks and we see there is a lot of people have some pretty lofty growth projections in their numbers, we try to be a little bit more restrained that. I think it\u2019s best overall for the city to have stead growth I suppose to spiking growth and that\u2019s what we have experience to-date. Hopefully that steady growth continues into \u201815, that is what we see, for the reasons some which I had communicated earlier and we are on track with that but if that changes I think we are the leading indicators to see when that change occurs and if so communicate that to shareholders. But at the moment 2015 is shaping up to be what we think is one of the better years.", "Jordan Saddler \u2013 Keybanc Markets", "As a quick follow-up does the structure finance book is that exclusively focused on New York still these days or would you look to the outer boroughs or otherwise to sort of maintain the origination at these yields?", "Marc Holliday", "And we do consider that as part of the New York, for the record.", "Jordan Saddler \u2013 Keybanc Markets", "[inaudible] this in New York.", "Marc Holliday", "We are sympathetic to all boroughs but I would say if the [inaudible] is billion well, no I think we own a very small retail piece of property in queens you know that will worth a couple of million bucks but so I would say the building outstanding the vast majority is Manhattan. Yeah we probably have some positions, yeah a couple of positions spoken.", "Jordan Saddler \u2013 Keybanc Markets", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Great. Our next question comes from Brad Burke from Goldman Sachs.", "Brad Burke \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Hey guys, just one question follow-up on structured finance. The investments that you made or yielding over 10% which is you noted better than the 8.5% you guided this to and this is not an environment where we are seeing the interest rates compress, we are seeing credit spreads compress so I am just hoping you give us some color how you are still able to get these really strong yields and whether we should expect it to stay near these levels on the new originations you are making going forward?", "Marc Holliday", "I think the quarter was a skewed a little bit because the 605 was 42nd Street investment is an extraordinary yield and yield that was really reflective of us assembling that entire capital stack for the borrower. We continue to take advantage of tightening debt markets on the senior side to level up our yields on the subordinate paper and that\u2019s how we have been able to beat our estimates and our expectations a bit but overall the market has tightened and continues to tighten and we still think average of 8.5 going forward is reasonable in the right expectation.", "Brad Burke \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "I appreciate it, thank you.", "Marc Holliday", "Thanks. Okay, we have time for one last question operator.", "Operator", "Right. Our next question comes from Vance Edelson from Morgan Stanley.", "Vance Edelson \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Terrific, thanks I\u2019m under the wire, could you just follow just following-up on the earlier question strength by sub-market could you give us some feel for the variability around the pricing on the 42 office leases signed at Manhattan, the 17% overall mark-to-market on replacement where they notably lower markets in some sub-markets maybe south of 10% being offset by even greater strength, maybe north of 20% or 25% in other or is it generally a tighter range than that throughout Manhattan.", "Marc Holliday", "It\u2019s because the mark-to-market is really compared against the rents of the prior leases, escalated rents, I don\u2019t think we can really comment as to whether it\u2019s driven by sub market per se, just happens to be what you are dealing with for the last lease coming off. It\u2019s not particularly good as an indicator of the strength of any of the overall sub markets.", "I can tell you that my sense is where we have the greatest rent appreciation and no surprises where the rents have been beaten down the farthest, so Grand Central we\u2019ve seen the rents are really good indicator of that, is the Graybar Building. Graybar Building has now got availability of 1% for this building. This building has got 300 tenants, with tenants that are leasing from 300 square feet to 300,000 square feet and the rents that we are citing today are the deals that are in the pipeline, I would say almost typically are $58, $59 starting rents as compared to a year and a half, two years ago, where they would have been $38 to $40 dollars. So as a percentage increase Grand Central beaten down, Graybar being a good barometer and there are some hard [inaudible] to where we have seen, we have experienced rent appreciation.", "Vance Edelson \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then just one last one on the structured finance. Could you comment on the level of new debt and preferred equity investments brought on board, just a little bit lower this quarter than the past two anything driving that or is just naturally lump and do you think it could pick up going forward?", "Marc Holliday", "I think it\u2019s naturally lumpy and I think we\u2019re probably ahead of where we projected to be at the end of last year. It\u2019s just the nature of other people closing those deals kind of makes is lumpy. We have a robust pipeline and we are adaptable.", "Vance Edelson \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Great thanks.", "Operator", "All right, that\u2019s all the time we have.", "Marc Holliday", "Thank you everyone and I guess we will \u2013 we look forward to seeing hopefully all of you in little over a month\u2019s time at the investor conference.

Thank you.", "I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay, thank you and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to have the opportunity to give all of you our perspective on the state of the market now that we are nearly four months into the New Year. And I can sum up our excitement for SLG\u2019s year-to-date performance in essentially two words: leasing, velocity. As of today, we have concluded over 900,000 square feet of commercial leasing in over 60 individual lease transactions. Most notable among these by size are the leases to Bloomberg at 919 Third Avenue; Franklin Templeton, a new advisory at 280 Park Avenue; and WeWork at 315 West 36 Street, a balance of financial, media and technology uses. It seems likely that having completed this amount of transactions in less than 4 months, we are on track to exceed our full year leasing projections.", "The Manhattan office and retail leasing teams are taking full advantage of vacancies in the growth portfolio and rolling up markets \u2013 rolling up Winston market in the stabilized portfolio and also by taking advantage of our deeply embedded mark-to-market in our retail portfolio. And by doing this, it should allow us to meet or exceed this year\u2019s goals while laying the foundation for a strong future growth in 2016 and beyond when these newly signed leases generally will kick in. Clearly, this market is benefiting from overall Midtown vacancy rates of under 9.5% on leasing activity that is on pace for between 35 million and 40 million square feet of new and renewal leasing this year.", "From an employment perspective, the first quarter of 2015 was the strongest quarter since the year 2000. New York City added 16,400 office using jobs and the distribution of jobs among the three primary office using sectors: professional and business services; financial activities; and information were about equal. Usually, professional and business services accounts for most of the increase in office using jobs of late, but you could see now that\u2019s equally distributed between the three main office using sectors.", "The good news for our shareholders is that the leasing pipeline also remains robust even after coming out of the gate strong in 2015. We now have over 500,000 square feet of lease documents that are either out for signature or are pending and being negotiated. That compares with about 575,000 square feet at the same time last quarter and to the fourth quarter. And you see how we were able to convert these opportunities into signed lease transactions and then some. These leasing achievements helped to drive a 3% same-store NOI increase in the first quarter that was actually ahead of our budget and is expected to be exceeded for the balance of the year, such that we feel on track to meet our goal of between 3.5% and 4% for the full year.", "On the investments front, we were active closing out year end deals, like the additional ownership interest that were acquired in 800 Third Avenue and the closing of the Stonehenge residential portfolio, along with a successful disposition of 180 Maiden Lane and the net new origination of about $145 million of structured finance investments. This net investment activity, along with the un-encumbering of 711 Third Avenue enabled us to access the ATM and DRIP for modest amounts of equity, issuances that were completed to continue to improve our balance sheet. This steady improvement resulted in an upgrade in credit rating to investment grade for Moody\u2019s and an outlook upgrade from S&P. For the balance of the year we are expecting to rollout several assets for sale, which will be used in large measure to fund our pipeline of investments for the year without reliance on larger equity issuances.", "Turning now to other main objectives for the second quarter and balance of the year, we continue to move forward through the approvals process in support of the Vanderbilt corridor rezoning and to obtain a special permit for the development of a new commercial tower at One Vanderbilt Avenue. The project has the support of the Borough President, Brewer, City Planning Commission and our partner organizations at the coalition for a better Grand Central. We are now before City Council, who is expected to vote upon the project in May at which point the land review process will be concluded. And we hope and expect that we will receive this special permit that we have been working on for some period of time now as most of you know.", "Other company recognitions just to make note during the year \u2013 I am sorry during the first quarter. Actually, this was just in the past three months. SL Green was recently recognized by the U.S. EPA as a 2015 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year on Monday, April 20, during its award ceremony in Washington, D.C. And we got that award for sustained excellence in energy efficiency and the development of market leading sustainability programs. So we are very proud of that, not only proud of the performance of the company, the balance sheet and then our stock price, but proud to be able to achieve all of that while doing it in a very responsible environmentally sustainable way, which has now been recognized at a federal level. Also as I think many or most of you know at this point, we were given admittance, if you will into the S&P 500, which I think is basically a confirmation of the strategies and direction that we have taken with this company over the period of years to grow and diversify, but diversify within our market and create a level of size, stability, performance and return that we think is now on par with some of the best and biggest public companies on the New York Stock Exchange. And for that, we are very pleased and proud.", "So that is a quick snapshot of how we are looking at this market as its shaping up now. I would say it\u2019s basically on par or slightly better than our comments to you back in December at the investor conference, which you remember we have focused on basically 10 drivers of growth. I think those drivers of growth are evidencing themselves in significant degree. And I think we have called the market fairly correctly for our shareholders, which obviously we try to do because we look as much as we are in this market, we view that may be we only have maybe a 6 to 9 to 12 months advantage over people not as deep in this market. So we always want to be as transparent and as early with you on how we see market trends developing. And I think, as I said the first four months of the year, I think we have called it pretty well, so we are happy about that.", "And with that, we will take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nick Yulico with UBS. Your line is open.", "Ross Nussbaum", "Hi. It\u2019s Ross Nussbaum here with Nick we are going to tag-team you. At One Vanderbilt, are you guys contemplating doing a joint venture on that project ahead of putting shovel in the ground or can you talk a little bit about how you are thinking about the long-term capital stack for that asset?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, the answer is yes. We are considering JV alternatives for that asset. And I think the question will just be when shovel is in the ground already. I mean in terms of just starting some interior demolition. So the big money spend starts in probably 2017 and beyond. And by then, I think we will have determined our capitalization of the project with or without JV partner, but obviously, it\u2019s high consideration right now. We are just sitting here in early 2015, it\u2019s being financed right now out of cash flow and it\u2019s not something that needs to be in our opinion dealt with right now, nor should it necessarily be, because I think there is real value be created between now and call it the next 12 to 24 months.", "Ross Nussbaum", "Thanks. Yes, Steve, could you just give us a little bit of update on the leasing market in the city in the first quarter, not just your activity, but how you are thinking about the whole market. I mean, it seems like there is now some bigger trends in the market looking for space, small space trends seem pretty positive as well and maybe relate back to your portfolio, how you guys might benefit from that over the next year?", "Steven Durels", "Well, if you break apart the various submarkets, you have seen strength across the board, both on the small space type tenant, but also on the big tenants and on the high price point tenants. I would say from the tenant profile perspective, financial services seem to be more active today than anytime in the past couple of years. As we look at our leases that are out right now, 9 of our 10 largest leases that were negotiated are financial service related businesses. And there doesn\u2019t seem to be a pocket in town, where there is a dearth of activity. It\u2019s really guns blazing across all submarkets. And we have been pushing rents up sort of every 30, 45 days as far as where our taking rents are in most of our buildings. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unique to our portfolio. I hear the same thing back from the brokerage community, which I think is one of the big things to understand that the brokers are out there telling their clients that the balance is shifting towards the landlords that the market is rising and they don\u2019t see it slowing down in the near to intermediate future.", "Ross Nussbaum", "Just lastly on the 919 Third in the Bloomberg lease, can you give us some perspective on the rent mark-to-market there and is that replacing an expiration in coming years? Thanks.", "Steven Durels", "We are under pretty detailed confi with them on that. It replaced several tenants that draft, which is part of Interpublic, had rolled out of the building over a year ago. So, they took five of their floors and then we ended up three floors of tenants, whose leases will be expiring over the next immediate to year or so. So, it\u2019s a pre-let on that. So, it\u2019s a combination of floors.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from John Guinee of Stifel. Your line is open.", "John Guinee", "Great. Thank you very much. My two questions may expand a bit, so but very quick answers. Weighted average share count increased by 2 million shares, a little background information on that. Other assets also popped this quarter, any color on that? And third, can Andrew or David talk about why, how the underwriting for your structured finance investments has changed over the last 2 years as capital has become readily available in that part of the world?", "Marc Holliday", "Sure. Matt?", "Matthew Diliberto", "Yes, John, it\u2019s Matt. I guess the first two, so Mark alluded to in his commentary the use of our ATM and the DRIP plan to issue equity during the first quarter for some investment activity and repayment of the 711 Third Avenue mortgage. So, that was \u2013 that\u2019s the increase in share counts. As to other assets this quarter, we booked the popular FAS 141 adjustment for 388 Greenwich, an acquisition we did last year. As you know that bifurcates the real estate asset into real estate and then other. And so that\u2019s the increase in other assets.", "Marc Holliday", "On the structured finance side, I would say the underwriting parameters for subordinate financing have held pretty stable. We are benefited by the fact that a lot of the buildings that are being purchased are redevelopment type opportunities without a lot in place cash flows. So, where you have seen lending get a lot more aggressive is where the significant cash flow in place on assets, most of the assets that we are financing are lease up, lease to market, redevelopment type opportunities. We have been able to hold our underwriting standards pretty static from last year and the year before.", "John Guinee", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Yes. Just a quick question on the suburban markets, again when you exclude Long Island, you still have fundamentals that seems to have weakened a little bit versus prior quarter. So, I was hoping you can expand on what you are seeing in the suburban markets?", "Isaac Zion", "Hi, this is Isaac. That was really driven by one particular lease. The year end was obviously very strong. The first quarter, we saw robust leasing activity of over 200,000 square feet. We are wobbly outperforming the market. Our occupancy is about 85% on signed deals in both Connecticut and Stanford. The overall vacancy is about 23%, 24%. So, that mark-to-market, if you exclude Jericho in that one particular deal, on commenced deals, it was actually positive 4.4% and on signed deals about 1%. So, fundamentals are still while not the city, they are still improving.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Yes, that\u2019s helpful. And then just another quick question on TIs and leasing commissions going forward, how should we be thinking about that for other development projects you are working on? Should we think of them as potentially being as high as 280 Park or there is something very unique to 280 Park?", "Isaac Zion", "Well, it\u2019s generally a function of direct more so than development or not. We could do a development deal downtown and we wouldn\u2019t be offering the kind of concession packages that you might offer at 10 East 53rd and 280 Park. So, I think you sort of have to look at it as we look at it and I am sure shareholders look at it on a net effective basis, the higher rent, the higher margin deals and the bigger deals were savvy tenants are going to traditionally carry higher TI levels, so Steve, at 280 and 10 East, where would you peg those kind of new TI deals.", "Steven Durels", "On the high side, they have been as much as $75 to $80 a foot, but typically, they are more in the $65 to $70. And to add to the logic of that, one it\u2019s a function of price points of big rents therefore support a bigger TI contribution, but also the profile of the tenant that\u2019s going into those high rent paying buildings have extraordinarily expensive build-outs. So, they will absorb a bigger rent, but they need some level of added support as far as TI contribution, because their build-outs aside from what the landlord maybe contributing, they could easily be putting another $100 a foot into the build-out on top of our contribution.", "Marc Holliday", "Yes, you have to look at lease term, obviously. I mean, some of those bigger deals are 15 years terms, so there is 50% more term, but there is clearly not 50% more TI associated with those deals. So, it\u2019s actually doing a $75, $80 deal on a 15-year basis is better than I guess a $60, $65 deal on a 10-year base. You have to adjust for term, you have to adjust for rent and rent margin. And construction costs are going up. I mean, you hear that from everybody in New York City. So, real TI is sort of holding flat to maybe contracting a bit, so real TIs are actually going down as construction costs go up.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Jamie Feldman", "Great, thank you. I was hoping you could spend a minute on the Street retail business and just demand, I mean, we have got Westfield and Brookfield opening, their space up downtown. It sounds like Times Square will have some vacancy with Toys \"R\" Us and certainly with stronger dollar and tourism slowing a little bit. What are you guys seeing just in terms of tenant demand in the pipeline and which submarket seem to be standing out?", "Marc Holliday", "We are seeing very good demand in Times Square. I mean, we just had a smashing success with our space at 1515 Broadway with the leases to Skechers and Swatch. We are seeing very strong demand in Soho and we have a lot of active discussions on our vacant or available properties in Soho. We don\u2019t have any vacancies. We have some future availabilities, which we are talking to tenants about and prime Fifth Avenue and Madison continues to be strong as well. I mean, we did the Diesel lease at 625, which we spoke about in the last call. So, we really haven\u2019t seen any abatement of tenant demand due to stronger dollar or any impact on tourism. Thus far, there is still a lot of strong tenant activity.", "Jamie Feldman", "And then speaking with retail, what about on the underwriting side and capital flows and asset values, is that changing at all?", "Marc Holliday", "Continued strength, incredibly competitive to get sites, both leased and available sites anywhere and we would continue to see values escalate.", "Jamie Feldman", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Vincent Chao", "Hey, good afternoon everyone. Just curious if you could just comment on sort of capital flows you are seeing into New York, obviously the markets are strong, clearly still seeing some capital coming in, but just curious what your thoughts are over the balance of the year particularly from the foreign capital side, do you expect that to be higher than last year and in \u201915 and just thinking about that in relation to the dollar move things like that?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, we are continuing to have a very strong volume of incoming calls looking for opportunities. I would say the Chinese are very much making their presence belt. The purchases of 717 Fifth, the office portion of that tower which traded to a Chinese company, I would say was a real bellwether type transaction. And they are following that up with a lot of interest in other projects. There are voracious demand for residential and development type opportunities. And Isaac, I don\u2019t know if you have anything to add to that. I mean we have \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if this year eclipses last year, given the amount of \u2013 there is a lot of deals on the market right now and there is an enormous amount of capital chasing and so usually that leads to record capital flows.", "Isaac Zion", "Yes. I would just echo it\u2019s the Chinese, I think the Koreans are looking at the market stronger than they were last year. There are more groups searching more conversations that we are having. The sovereign wealth funds from all over the world as well, particularly from Norway and the Middle East are also very, very active looking for yield and have lower cost of capital. So that\u2019s \u2013 they are going to be very, very aggressive. And this city is relatively cheap compared to other markets around the world.", "Vincent Chao", "Okay. Thanks for that. And then just one on the accounting side here, just other income looks like it\u2019s up from where it\u2019s been the last couple of quarters, just curious if you could provide some color on that?", "Marc Holliday", "It\u2019s really just the timing of fee income. We have recognized fee on one of our projects in the first quarter it was around $3 million. Otherwise, it\u2019s really recurring stuff, there is probably $1 million dollars of lease termination income in there as well.", "Vincent Chao", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.", "Alex Goldfarb", "Thank you. Good afternoon. Two questions, first Matt, on the exchangeables that are currently in the money, can you just give us an update, are these already reflected in the diluted share count or how should we be thinking about these, presumably the holders of these would convert them given how they are in the money?", "Matthew Diliberto", "So, to answer your first question, they are not in the diluted share count based on the nature of the instruments. They remain at their face value in debt. They accrete up to their face. They are slightly discounted to face on the balance sheet. They are convertible. At this point hey are convertible. Last quarter they are convertible. This quarter the view is people won\u2019t exchange those because ultimately you end up at equivalent yield in a more junior position to where they are today. All that said it\u2019s a 2017 maturity. We have been focused on attending to \u201817 maturities if we can early. So we are considering alternatives.", "Alex Goldfarb", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. The second question is on the Street retail Page 47, in the prime retail section a number of the near-term maturity leases, the mark to market doesn\u2019t look to be too different to where \u2013 the in place doesn\u2019t look to be too different from where the market rent is, in contrast you go out further and there is definitely a meaningful mark. So are the near-term maturities in the prime JV Street retail portfolio, are those assets that are going to be repositioned so that the mark to market is actually higher or just surprised if there is really not much of a mark there. And again, this is on the JV Street retail, the near-term stuff?", "Marc Holliday", "Alex, I have got to go through the specific properties underlying those assumptions and come back to you with a more specific answer. Looking at the table, we don\u2019t give addresses. So I would have to go through and take a look specifically at that trend.", "Alex Goldfarb", "Okay. Well and then if I can just ask one more just to replace that, Matt was there anything in the first quarter operating margin why the margin was meaningfully higher than last year?", "Matthew Diliberto", "Obviously, we had seasonal expenses, first and third quarters are higher than second and fourth. And reimbursement revenues don\u2019t track proportionately to increased OpEx, so our OpEx was the high in the first quarter as it has traditionally been particularly high given New York had another cold, wet winter. The reimbursement revenues bleed in on a lag basis. And so I would say that\u2019s really the only trend there, nothing unusual in line with our expectations as Marc alluded to earlier, both on a same store and absolute basis in term of margins for this quarter.", "Alex Goldfarb", "Okay, thank you. And Andrew we can follow-up afterwards. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.", "Steve Sakwa", "Thanks. Good afternoon. Marc, at the Analyst Day you guys talked about I think releasing spreads of 10% to 12%, yet you don\u2019t have pretty successful New York City number at 17, I realized the suburban number is a little bit weak, but any thoughts as to kind of where that number may be. And is there anything in the leases that may be Steve is talking about today that would suggest there was some aberration in that 17 or that the ones currently being negotiated or lower or is that just likely to move higher throughout the year?", "Steven Durels", "I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 we just gave this guidance like 3.5 months ago. So in prep for today\u2019s call, we do not go back through all of the goals, if you will, to reassess. So I can\u2019t sit here now and say whether \u2013 you are saying its 12% was it \u2013 usually we give a range. So is that 10% to 12%. So is the 10% to 12%, as we sit here high, well, first quarter was I guess 17%, so that\u2019s clearly higher. I don\u2019t think we are projecting 17% as run rate. So clearly it sort of depends on what rolls when, some of the leases we are signing or we are signing for vacancy, not for replacement leases. So I think at this point, we are going to stay with 10% to 12%. It certainly seems like there could be upside to that number, based on the velocity and based on the first quarter\u2019s result. But other than just a hunch, I couldn\u2019t tell you that we have gone through each of the remaining 200 and some odd leases. We expect to sign for the remainder of the year and figured out, A, which one of those are in the mark to market pool and B, how it will affect the first quarter. So it certainly seems like there could be some upside there, but it would be premature of us to say that. And we will just \u2013 maybe by mid-year, Steve we will have like better feel for that. We start to forecast for the balance of the year. And I think we will have a better sense. But this early on, I would say if nothing else trending towards the higher end of that range.", "Steve Sakwa", "Okay. And then I guess your comment about asset sales, clearly the capital flows are extremely strong, I am just wondering what sort of dollar volume could that posses and where does the suburban portfolio sort of fit into that mix, does that need to see more leasing before you would think you can bring it to market or do you think buyers will be willing to in effect pay for some of that vacancy?", "Steven Durels", "Well. We gave some guidance in December. And I think Matt if I am not wrong, it was about $600 million for commercial office.", "Matthew Diliberto", "Correct.", "Steven Durels", "And we are talking about dispositions, right and $100 million for suburban. So I think we feel good with those numbers. That\u2019s we have several assets that are just now, one in the market, several more that we intend to introduce into the market. All extremely good assets, but again these are assets where we look at the sort of average growth trend in these assets over the next 5 years to 7 years to 10 years, 3 years to 5 years. And we compare it against some of the more opportunistic or value add opportunities that e are looking at. And in those instances, we try to cycle out of the more mature properties and into the less mature. It\u2019s hard to call any property mature in this market, because anything that\u2019s been sold over the last 2 years or 3 years likely is being sold today, certainly has the potential for significant appreciation in the next 3 years to 5 years. But maybe not at the same rate as the opportunities we are looking at. And that\u2019s how we are culling out the portfolio.", "So on that basis, we will probably look to do some complete dispositions and/or strategic JVs of assets that we think will get us up to or over the $600 million guidance for the year. I think our plan still is to meet or exceed that. And I would say the same for suburban. So, we didn\u2019t put those numbers out there without some forethought as to which assets we intended to try and dispose of and the timing that we thought would be the optimal timing to do so, because in some cases, we are trying to get some leasing done right at the wire before we introduce to the market. So, I think we are still on that kind of trajectory. And again, we can revisit mid-year once we have a better sense of the reception to the market that the prices will be at.", "Steve Sakwa", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Bilerman of Citi. Your line is open.", "Manny Korchman", "Hey, guys. Manny Korchman here with Michael. If we look at the leases you have under negotiation or out for signature, could you just drill down on that a little bit for us? How much of that is existing vacancy pending \u201815 roll or the acceleration of future years and maybe how much is office versus retail?", "Steven Durels", "Look, on the \u2013 we have got \u2013 it\u2019s almost 50-50 between renewals and new leases. And of that, the dominant type of tenants is financial services and on the new leases, it\u2019s I would say the majority of the square footage under negotiation is filling space that\u2019s currently vacant as opposed to pre-leasing space for future vacancy.", "Manny Korchman", "And how much of that is retail?", "Steven Durels", "And retail is a small percentage of the square footage that\u2019s out right now.", "Manny Korchman", "Then Matt, given the big non-cash sort of jumps in 1Q, does any of that benefit FFO for the quarter that we should be thinking about on a run-rate basis?", "Matthew Diliberto", "In the first \u2013 I mean, for as much as comes on generally rolls off. So, we had an adjustment for the first quarter that has a little bit of 2014 in it for 388, but a few million dollars. Otherwise, for the balance of the year, I would expect it to be pretty close to what it has been historically. That\u2019s for our FAS141. On a straight line basis, the straight line adjustment will be higher this year. And that\u2019s simply a function of Citi\u2019s free rent at 388 Greenwich, which is going to be in the neighborhood of $80 million to $82 million a share.", "Manny Korchman", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Brendan Maiorana of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Brendan Maiorana", "Thanks. Good afternoon. Steve, maybe just an update in terms of a couple of the office assets, where you have got leasing in the growth portfolio, Tower 46, 10 East 53rd? And then can you just provide an update at 280 Park or you had potentially put the bed there, I know in the supplemental, it\u2019s 65% occupied, but I think it\u2019s higher from a lease percentage basis?", "Steven Durels", "Yes. So, 10 East we have leases out on five floors right now. We have signed a couple of leases in the past quarter. At the end of last year, we have already done four floors of leases. The capital project there is 90% complete. The lobby will be 100% done in about two weeks. Elevator cabs will follow on over the next month or two after that. And the plazas will be done in about 45 days and all the infrastructure is already complete. So, we are rocking and rolling as far as leasing velocity and tour activity and active lease negotiations at that property. Tower 46, we have got a lease out covering a floor and a half and we are trading paper with another very large tenant that it\u2019s way early to handicap as to whether there is any life to that are not, but very strong tour activity. That\u2019s going to be one of those buildings we are going to take some time to build up some momentum, because it was kind of out of sight, out of mind for the brokerage community, even though it was a brand, newly constructed property, but it was off most brokerage radar. So, it\u2019s been a big effort to-date to reintroduce it back into the brokerage community and get everybody through the property, so they understand what it is that we are offering. And 280 Park Avenue is quite frankly is on fire right now. We have got several leases out at big, big rents and we will be down to \u2013 by the end of this year that building would be from a leasing perspective, it will hit stabilization.", "Brendan Maiorana", "Okay, great. And then probably for Matt although maybe someone else, just I am not sure if you can share any details on the WeWork lease, but \u2013 and I know they have got a lot of space with a number of other REITs that are out there. But just \u2013 are there a lot of capital dollars going into the space? And how do you guys get comfortable or how did you get comfortable with the credit and the dollars that go into the space with that lease?", "Matthew Diliberto", "Well, look I mean we are pretty excited about WeWork as a tenant and as a business. We have spent a lot of time with their principles and their people and at their facilities looking at their business model, which caters to this co-working community and the types of tenants out there that have high demand today, these TAMI-type and technology tenants. And their menu of kind of added, value-add services, we think differentiates them from a lot of other companies we see in that space. It\u2019s a unique offering. They have substantial amount of cash in the bank. They have substantial institutional backing. And we got comfortable that for this kind of building, where we think their community of people want to be in this building, it was a perfect fit. So, I think where this is a joint venture, we own probably a third or so of the equity and not just us, but our individual partners were all very excited about this lease both in terms of whatever capital is entailed by it and excited to have them in our stable of tenants. So, it\u2019s a good lease and great for us and we think WeWork is going to do great in the building.", "Brendan Maiorana", "Okay, great. Thanks for the time.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Burke of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Brad Burke", "Hi, good afternoon guys. A follow-up on asset sales and sources of capital, should we think about those sales as completely funding your investment program for the rest of the year? And if it doesn\u2019t how are you looking to fund those between debt and equity?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I think we generally match fund over the years. So, I think that\u2019s a good assumption. I can\u2019t say exactly, because we have a pipeline of many, many buildings and we are talking about selling a number of buildings. So, there is timing issues and everything else, but the goal is certainly to try and fund the new acquisitions predominantly with the net proceeds of sale on a tax efficient basis, doing 1031 where possible. And then either tweaking up or down with debt or equity if necessary based on the timing in the volume. So \u2013 but I mean, that\u2019s \u2013 I think that\u2019s the way we have always done it. So, there is no change in that front. Traditionally, we have been net growers, so it has required on a net basis some amount more of debt and equity, but in ratios that will now decidedly keep us in the range of the investment grade rating that we have obtained.", "Brad Burke", "Okay, but no clear preference at this point for debt and equity to fund the balance?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I mean, it\u2019s not a question of preference per se. I would say, the plan is to fund the majority of it with asset sales and then depending on timing and volumes look to tweak up or down with debt and equity if necessary.", "Brad Burke", "Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And another follow-up actually on structured finance, I just wanted to get an update on how you are thinking about the outlook for income for that business? How much you would like to grow the book? How you are seeing competition shape up for the year? And also how you are thinking about origination yields at this point going forward?", "Marc Holliday", "Sure. I think in terms of the size of the portfolio, I think at the end of last year, we said we would be up about $250 million kind of year-over-year. I think that still holds. If anything, we are kind ahead of budget right now, but we know there is lot of repayments coming in the second half of the year. Yields have in the market generally, I think they continue to compress. We have been able to kind of outperform the expectations that we set at the beginning of the year and at the end of last year, but it\u2019s kind of too early to tell what the entire year is going to look like. There is a lot of competition out there, but through relationships and kind of the different approaches I have laid out at the end of the year, we have been able to kind of keep our volumes up and we are very bullish about the forecast for the rest of the year.", "Brad Burke", "Alright, I appreciate it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Vance Edelson", "Terrific, thanks. Back on the WeWork lease and let\u2019s throw in Bloomberg as well. Just given the overall shortage of large blocks in Manhattan, how much was the pricing on those leases reflective of that, was it demonstrably stronger, in other words are prospective tenants acutely aware that there is just not much out there?", "Matthew Diliberto", "Well, a couple of things. There are two different products as far as the building that Bloomberg signed at. But I can tell you is broadly speaking, the availability of large blocks of space and let\u2019s define that as being 250,000 square feet or more, you can count on one hand. And if you are looking for 0.5 million square feet, then maybe there is two of them in Midtown. So the big block premium that tenants are confronted with to pay from a rent perspective is definitely back in the market. And I would expect it to sort of excel as the year goes by because there is not going to be a lot of inventory coming online for a big block space. WeWork is building different animal side street and it sort of fell into the fringe area of Midtown South kind of the hotspot where TAMI type businesses want to be. And that\u2019s become look and feel that WeWork likes the associate themselves with. So I can\u2019t really comment specifically to the rents, but I would tell you that the rents that we got on the building were well in excess of underwriting when we bought the building and well in excess of what we would have budgeted 18 months ago.", "Vance Edelson", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then I just wanted to give you a chance to comment on Betsy being added as a Director earlier this month, maybe just share with us why she is the right person and then what she brings to the table?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, we conducted a search to add a Board member kind of on heels of Andrew\u2019s ascension to the Board in order to keep what the governance committee felt was a proper balance between independents and insiders. So we wanted \u2013 that was one of the motivating forces to add a Board member and Betsy just sort of stood out to everybody on the Board as perfect for the role. She is seasoned. She has been involved with a lot of big company boards and brings a level of experience that\u2019s different from the traditional local finance and real estate experience that probably exists on the SL Green Board. She really comes out of the technology sector, if you will and venture capital sector. And given the amount of importance we put on those sectors in today\u2019s market from a tenancy perspective and nothing else, we think that she can add a lot of value in terms of her role as a corporate governance Board member, but also in terms of her knowledge and relationships and ability to access the kind of tenants in this market where we would like to have a bigger presence with. So on a whole number of fronts, she stood out as a great candidate and was appointed.", "Vance Edelson", "Okay, it sounds like a great addition. Thanks.", "Marc Holliday", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Weissman of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Ian Weissman", "Yes, good afternoon. Just a quick follow-up, Steve to a comment you made earlier about the strong demand at 280 Park, maybe if you can just talk a little bit about the retail demand there, I saw an article the other day about The Four Seasons Restaurant considering its options. I just wanted to get a sense what the demand is today, what you thought the lease up opportunities and the rents were?", "Steven Durels", "Well, let\u2019s put it in perspective, the retail on that building is not the driver of NOI. Part of our development plan was to create either one large or two medium-sized restaurant spaces. There are side street locations as part of the building. And we have had discussions with Four Seasons. They would have been a wonderful addition to the property if they were to come that way. But we are certainly not counting on them, coming over to the building. We are out in the market talking to a number of restaurateurs and now that the development work is essentially complete at the property and we are well down the road on the office lease up, we are turning our attentions to try and find the right restaurateur or restaurateurs to fill those two spaces. So we view it more as a element of the development plan to add the right look and feel and amenity to the building at street level as opposed to a typical retail addition to a property, which is a big NOI contributor.", "Ian Weissman", "And rents?", "Steven Durels", "It\u2019s quite frankly it\u2019s going to depend on the tenant. If we get a world class tenant that we think really adds to the \u2013 to what the building is all about, then we will skew the transaction to be more of a less base rent, more percentage rent type transaction. If we get a more mid-line type retailer that has still a high design with good look and feel, then we will expect more base rent. And I think the market value on this basis probably $100, $125 a foot.", "Ian Weissman", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Steven Durels", "You bet.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jed Reagan of Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.", "Jed Reagan", "Hi guys. I am wondering if you can share any pricing details on the transaction of 803rd in terms of cap rate or price per pound and maybe what the strategic thought process was about increasing that stick there?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, it\u2019s clearly \u2013 it\u2019s a core asset for us that we have a lot of success within leasing. Lease up there has been terrific. So it\u2019s an asset we wanted to consolidate additional interest in. We \u2013 the pricing on the new interest is around $700 a foot, for the asset. And post the acquisition, we own just over 60% of the building.", "Jed Reagan", "Okay. And where did that land in terms of cap rates, can you share that?", "Marc Holliday", "Yes. It\u2019s between 4.5% and 5%.", "Jed Reagan", "Okay. Thanks. And maybe a question for Steve, just curious what you are seeing in terms of rent growth momentum in Midtown so for this year, I mean are you pushing rents at a pace that\u2019s sort of consistent with your expectations as you kind of set out the year and then if there are any other submarkets that surprising you on the upside or the downside?", "Steven Durels", "Well, rents across the board are going up. And I always like to use the Graybar Building as sort of the great parameter of where the Midtown market is. Every lease that we are negotiating, where the negotiations started in the past call it 60 days, is in the low-$60s a square foot. And if you compare that to the height of the last, top of the last market cycle, Graybar got to a point where for a week or two weeks we did like a couple of deals like $61 a foot. And here now we are at the point where Graybar is \u2013 the typical deal is being signed, $61, $62, $63 starting rent. So I think that speaks volumes as to where the trend line is on rent growth.", "Jed Reagan", "Okay, thank you.", "Steven Durels", "You bet.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Mailman of KeyBanc. Your line is open.", "Jordan Sadler", "It\u2019s Jordan Sadler here with Craig. Just maybe a little bit of color on the investment opportunities you are seeing in front of you today, be it on the office side, retail, resi or sort of better opportunity today?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I would say we are actively looking at all three of those sectors. I mean you have several large deals on the market in 11 Madison and the Trinity portfolio. Those are two big office deals in the market. There are smaller office deals as well. Retail, most of our focus continues to be on off market deals. We don\u2019t really chase and bid marketed deals much on the retail side and thus we think we have are very specific and unique angle on the deal. And then residential, generally, I would say we have been looking at structured type deals, similar type of off market deals, the market of retail deals are very difficult for us to compete on. But opportunities like 605 West 42nd Street, which we closed up the end of last year and the Stonehenge portfolio, which we closed up in the first quarter of this year are getting most of our attention. So we are sort of agnostic as to what sector we deploy that capital. And we look more in terms of risk return for any individual deal and match them up with each other. We are not willing to take lower returns really in any of the sectors. We are trying to get the highest return on the capital we deploy. So, wherever we can find those high returns across all the sectors plus structured finance is where we will focus the capital.", "Jordan Sadler", "And what about submarket or I would rather say borough, are you looking in Queens and Brooklyn still? Are there some good opportunities there? Would you go beyond Brooklyn or Queens?", "Marc Holliday", "We are definitely actively looking in Brooklyn and obviously Manhattan. We have not done much in Queens and not much has crossed our desk in terms of investment opportunities that pretty granular markets out there. But we are actually seeing some opportunities in Harlem, none that we are I would say actively pursuing, but that market is also picking up as usually the case when Manhattan gets hypercompetitive. You start to see demand push to some of the outer areas. So, I think Brooklyn and Manhattan are still our main focuses.", "Jordan Sadler", "Okay, thank you.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay, I think that concludes it for questions, operator. The queue is empty.", "Operator", "Yes, I am not showing any further questions in queue at this time.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay, thank you very much everyone calling in and we will speak to you soon.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference.

This conference call is being recorded.", "At this time, the company would like to remind our listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from forward-looking statements that management may make today. Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the company's Form 10-K and other reports filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "Also during today's conference call, the company may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC Regulation G.

Thank you.", "I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.", "Marc Holliday", "Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome. Just to confirm, you are dialed into the SL Green third quarter earnings call and what a quarter it was. We had an enjoyable summer executing on nine different disposition transactions that were part of a designed and deliberate strategy to take advantage of favorable market conditions that exist currently, reduced structural complexity where it exists and reduced overall leverage and back fund the closing of the acquisition of Eleven Madison Avenue in $2.6 billion, iconic asset located on Madison Square Park and housing the U.S. headquarters of CS and Sony.", "In total, these transactions aggregated to $1.7 billion of activity which upon closings will generate almost $680 million of net proceeds to the company and most importantly the Manhattan sales were transacted at an average cap rate of 3.3% on current cash NOI. That's less than the 3.5% cap rate bogey we had set forth to shareholders in June. This should dispel, in my opinion, for now any notion that macro external forces have reduced or repressed the desire of international investors to covet prime Manhattan real estate assets.", "And a list of very recent transactions that I will run through right now and this recent is defined as the last three or four months since the end of Q2, was the purchase of a substantial interest in the Trinity portfolio by Norges, a Norwegian investor, a recently announced deal in excess of $5 billion to acquire the Stuy Town residential complex in combination with Canadian Investor Ivanhoe Cambridge, Alliance's recapitalization of 114 Fifth Avenue, a German investor, 520 Fifth Avenue acquisition by a Chinese investor done not too long ago, 370 Lexington was purchased by a Japanese investor and in the list of dispositions I mentioned earlier, there were two specific transactions that involve foreign capital.", "So clearly that market still seems to be, in our opinion, very much there, very much alive. And while we were busy negotiating and documenting the terms of these dispositions, we also managed to take advantage of several value add opportunities such as our acquisition of the SoHo building at 110 Greene Street, the development assemblage of 187 Broadway and the development assemblage on the Upper East Side. I hope our shareholders will join me in extending my compliments to the men and women on the SL Green team that worked with urgency throughout the summer to bring about this extraordinary result.", "The net result is that we will meet our funding goals for the $3 billion of 2015 acquisitions, obviously inclusive of Eleven Madison upon the sale of just one more asset, 1745 Broadway which we have just introduced into the market and the completion of several pending refinancings. Notwithstanding these achievements, we will continue to sell additional assets in order to accretively fund the significant pipeline of investment opportunities that we are currently working on.", "When we look at asset sales of the kind that we are executing right now as being the absolute best form of equity capital to fund this opportunistic pipeline and in looking at how the cap rate, the resulting sale cap rates relate to our portfolio and the valuation of our portfolio, I am always interested by the fact that at $120 a share roughly, where our stock price trades today, that's an implied cap rate on Manhattan assets of 5.3% and to get right to it, if you were to value that same portfolio of Manhattan assets at a 4% cap rate, that would be $153 share and at a 3.5$ cap rate, that's $173 a share. So that's not an opinion of NAV per se. One way or the other, it's simply a straight math that results when you apply the kind of cap rates that we routinely see not just in the deal that we have executed on during the last three or four months, but really, if you look back over the last year or two, the kind of results we get when we put out prime stable Manhattan assets for recycling, these are the kind of results we get time and time again.", "So however gets digested, we wanted to bring that to light. And I want to turn out to the leasing side and the leasing should not at all be overshadowed by the enormous volume of activity on the transactional side because the leasing results for the quarter were once again exceptionally strong and in line with our increased goals for the year. We continue to achieve approximately 15% mark-to-market on new Manhattan office leases and in fact that number is higher for the same-store leases we have executed during just the first three weeks of October. So in total, we have leased 63,000 square feet in October in the first three weeks, some of which were same-store, some which were not.", "And more importantly, we have a pipeline of leasing activity totaling 1.4 million square feet, which is substantially higher than each of the last three quarters. I would say each of the last three quarters averaged about 1 million square feet of pipeline. We now sit at 1.4 million square feet of pipeline of which 750,000 square feet of leases are either in negotiation or out for signature. Most of that's in negotiation. But as I have said before, the leases in negotiation have a very, very high probability traditionally of closing and we would hope to close most if not all of that 750,000 square feet, although not necessarily all by year-end, but that pipeline is growing, not shrinking. So I am sure we will be asked to expand upon that activity during the Q&A portion of the call, but the takeaway I would hope is a vibrant leasing market that did not take a pause during the slower and more volatile summer months.", "So with that, I am going to turn it over to Andrew Mathias, who I think is going to give you a little more insight into some of this activity, as well as the structured finance activities for the quarter.", "Andrew Mathias", "Thanks Marc. Our big announcements this quarter were the sale of our fee position at 885 Third Avenue and our new student housing development at 33 Beekman. 885 brings to a close the last of the 2007, 2008 fee positions we purchased. Our returns in this program were extraordinary, taking highly secure senior positions and assets, applying appropriate fixed rate long-term leverage and letting the positions appreciate. 885 will generate an IRR in excess of 10%, combined with over 17% IRR on 2 Herald and 15.5% IRR on 292 Madison, extraordinary returns for our shareholders on AAA risk type positions. Don't think this business line has discontinued as we continue to actively look for additional opportunities to complement 635 Madison Avenue and 562 Fifth Avenue in our current fee portfolio.", "At 33 Beekman, on Tuesday our team joined Pace University's senior management team to cut the ribbon on what we believe to be the tallest student housing project in the country at 382 feet. I am very proud of our construction team for delivering this ground up project on time and on budget, successfully navigating the many complexities of the site. Pace is thrilled and Wednesday we announced a contract to sell the asset to a foreign buyer at a very compelling cap rate of 3.9%. In addition to an extraordinary return on our investment, with a projected property level IRR in excess of 40%, we expect to receive a promote on the deal in excess of $10 million when it closes early next year. Needless to say, we are hard at work identifying new sites to continue this business line as well where we have had extraordinary profits in our student housing division. We expect more news on the sales fronts in the fourth quarter as we continue to take advantage of great market conditions in Manhattan.", "On DPE, debt and preferred equity, net originations slowed down a bit this quarter as several repayments we anticipated rolled in over the course of the quarter. That said, we have a very full some pipeline for fourth quarter and debt market dislocation, which shook things up a bit in August is giving us an extraordinary opportunity to maintain or in some cases even increase retained yield on positions in that pipeline that we would expect to close the year on target and with extraordinary profitability and high relative returns.", "With that, I would like to turn it over to Matt.", "Matt DiLiberto", "Thanks, Andrew. Our third quarter results showcase the strong performance from both our real estate and debt and preferred equity portfolios as well as the successful execution of our publicly disseminated real estate disposition and reinvestment strategy. Taking into consideration these results and looking ahead to the fourth quarter after just increasing guidance back in July we are again increasing our NAREIT defined FFO guidance range to $6.34 to $6.37 per share, putting us on track for almost 9% FFO growth year-over-year.", "Looking through the third quarter results in the real estate portfolio, the effect of the acquisition of Eleven Madison on August 18 and 110 Greene Street at the end of July contribute to an increase in several line items on the income statement as well as cash NOI, partially offset by the sale of an 80% interests in 131-137 Spring Street on August, 4. Excluding the effects of those transactions, our property operating results continue to see the benefit increasing portfolio occupancy in Manhattan which now stands at over 97% on a leased basis in the same-store portfolio and mark-to-markets in excess of our expectations, coupled with the continued containment on operating expenses. Historically operating expenses are much higher in the third quarter than they are in the second and that is what we saw again this year with a much more modest increase than expected. All these factors have contributed to same-store NOI growth of 4.6% through the first nine months and put us on a path to end the year well ahead of our goal of 3.6%.", "In the debt and preferred equity portfolio, our balance decreased to $1.5 billion and we received repayment totaling $262 million during the quarter, which was consistent with our expectations. As Andrew outlined, we have a significant pipeline of new originations for the fourth quarter at yields that exceed the 8.5% we expected to achieve in 2015. This pipeline of activity which is weighted towards the back half of the quarter will bring our portfolio balance to between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion by the end of the year with the overall portfolio yields remaining lower than 10%.", "In other income, the FFO from our real estate and debt and preferred equity portfolios was complimented by $5 million reduction in the prior year tax obligations of our taxable REIT subsidiary. This benefit comes as a result of an enormous amount of analysis by our tax professionals who reviewed the cost-sharing structure between our TRS and our operating partnership, including the reimbursement of corporate overhead by the TRS. As you all know, we are very focused on creating efficiencies through tax structuring and strategy in everything we do. So kudos to our tax director Mike Barber for his efforts in this regard.", "Also included in other income during the quarter was the recognition of lease termination payments totaling about $4 million. As we have said in the past, we don't view lease termination income as nonrecurring, since historically we have recognized some level of lease termination income virtually every quarter. This is simply the accelerated recognition of lease income that we otherwise would have received overtime.", "On the expense side, given all of our investment activity during the quarter, highlighted by the acquisitions of Eleven Madison and 100 Greene, we recognized a significant amount of transaction costs, somewhat more than we anticipated. As always, we are conservative in our view of transaction costs given that we are so active and that conservatism remains as we head into the fourth quarter with a full pipeline of activity ahead.", "All things considered, we are very pleased to be raising guidance for the second consecutive quarter. I think we are set up very nicely headed into 2016. We are excited for the quarters ahead and we look forward to unveiling our 2016 earnings guidance in early December.", "In that regard, before I turn it back to Marc, I want to remind everyone that our 18th Annual Investor Conference is being held on December 7 here in New York City. It is hard to believe we have been holding this now for 18 years. It is a full day event, choc full of information and maybe even a bit of entertainment. Invitations will be going out in the next couple of weeks, but if you would like more information in the meantime, please email us. The email address is in our press release, but it is SLG2015@slgreen.com.", "With that, back to Marc.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. Thank you, Matt. And we are going to open it up for Q&A. I just do want to echo Matt's sentiments that we certainly hope everyone listening in will be able to make it to the shareholder event in December and that's where we are going to really get into not so much a review of the past, but really a look forward to 2016 because we are extremely excited as we are sitting here now about the development opportunities, embedded growth within the portfolios and all the other things that we have lined up and we are going to be ready to talk to you about in 2016. So look forward to seeing you in December.", "And with that, we will open it up to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Manny Korchman of Citi. Your line is open.", "Marc Holliday", "Can we switch back to any other?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ross Nussbaum of UBS. Your line is open.", "Marc Holliday", "Ross, are you there?", "Ross Nussbaum", "I am here. Can you hear me?", "Marc Holliday", "Yes.", "Ross Nussbaum", "Okay. You can hear me now?", "Marc Holliday", "Yes. Go ahead.", "Ross Nussbaum", "Okay. Thanks. Can you talk a little bit about the structured finance book? In particular, it sounds like you are actually pretty bullish about potential originations here stemming from some of the turmoil in fixed income markets, but I am curious how you think about whether what's gone on with the fixed income market has been a bit of a canary in the coal mine and perhaps should use it as an opportunity to let some of the portfolio roll off and derisk that part of the business a little? And how do you balance those two views?", "Marc Holliday", "Yes. I think it's more of an opportunity to get better risk-adjusted returns, which means either charging more for capital at a similar position in the capital structure or taking the opportunity to move more senior in the capital structure and charge same as we were previously getting for junior. There was quite a bit of dislocation in the CMBS market in August and every time there is that kind of dislocation, we find extraordinary opportunities shaking out where you have capital structures that are short proceeds, because people get caught back in the CMBS market. So I think it's less -- we view it as less time to pause and more time to take advantage but make sure that we are increasing our risk-adjusted returns at whatever portion of the capital structure we are lending at.", "Ross Nussbaum", "Okay. I am going to let Nick Urico ask our second question.", "Nick Urico", "Yes, thanks. So I was hoping you could a little bit more about in New York City. Where do you think the overall market is right now for rent growth? There is debate whether it's 5%, whether it's lower than that, whether it's 10% for the best buildings. Maybe if you could just talk a little bit about what you are seeing in the market for rent growth and how it's trended this year and how you think it might move into next year for the overall market? Thanks.", "Marc Holliday", "Well, you could slice and dice it 20 different ways depending on the quality of the building, the submarket, the base versus the towers, the various sizes of tenant requirements and then the profile of the requirement itself. I would say, generally speaking and let's focus on Midtown, because Midtown has been extremely active this year. Rent growth this year has been strong across the board. We haven't really seen any let up in demand on whether it's the bottom or the top or on the more price sensitive, versus the high price point product.", "I would say that overall, Midtown has got more opportunity for rent growth than does Midtown sell at least in the near term because there is more inventory available and the demand is going to follow where the supply is. And we see a lot velocity is deals in the pipeline for Midtown right now. So to put a number on it, between now and 12 months from now, I would be very surprised if we didn't see at least 7% to 8% of rent growth.", "Nick Urico", "All right. Thanks. That's helpful.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Manny Korchman of Citi. Your line is open.", "Michael Bilerman", "All right. It's Michael Bilerman. Can you hear me now?", "Marc Holliday", "We got you, Michael. Yes.", "Michael Bilerman", "All right. Two questions. One for me. Marc, in your opening comments, you talked about a pipeline of accretive and you called them opportunistic opportunities. I am just wondering if can share or may perhaps Andrew can share what does that encompass in terms of sizing but also the types of deals that we should be expecting from this pipeline?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I think that -- I don't think we want to completely give it away. So we generically describe it as this kind of stuff we have been buying to some extent. So it's a mixture of high quality office and more opportunistic mixed-use, meaning either a resi-retail or office-retail products in the Midtown South market. So I think it's a combination of those two types of profiles. That's just on the equity portion. I am not speaking to the structured finance pipeline, which Andrew spoke to separately, or can add more commentary to separately. But I am just talking about fee opportunities that we are working on currently that is being set up with the right process and right pricing could result in some additional acquisitions over the next three to five months.", "Andrew Mathias", "But I just add, Michael, if you look at 110 Greene and 187 Broadway, the two transactions we announced in the quarter, those are completely off market deals. Never marketed, one-on-one negotiations and structured deals where we were able to deliver the seller equivalent or more net proceeds without them going and taking a full cash price from the market. We are still seeing those types of opportunities as we always have. They are just longer lead time and they mature as they are ready without the pressure of a marketed process. So we still do have a lot of those types of deals in the pipeline.", "Manny Korchman", "Hi. It's Manny here with Michael. If we look at 885 Third deal, can you just close in as to how they were structured and why there was such a big preferred equity component? And on the preferred, if you could just give us the term and the rate?", "Marc Holliday", "Sure. I think the preferred equity term is five years. The rate will wind up being in the high-5% range. And I think our thinking there was the structure contains a lot of variability in 2020 and part of the motivation for selling the asset now was to have certainty as opposed to that variability of outcome in 2020. So us providing the preferred would have allowed us to get a good cash return in the interim and not the first in line, depending on what happens with the asset in 2020.", "Manny Korchman", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Tony Paolone of JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Tony Paolone", "Thanks. Good afternoon. This week there was some concerns that have emerged around tech tenancy out on the West Coast and with TAMI having driven a lot of the growth in New York, can you give us some views on how you see that space, particularly as it relates to tenant credit and venture funding and how you guys think about that right now?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, you have got to remember, Tony, I don't have the number in front of me. I am going to guess we have 5% or less exposure to pure tech tenant. And certainly the type of TAMI tenants that you are talking about, which would be credit concern tenants, I think it's a very small portion of the portfolio and traditionally we have had very little loss in that segment, even when there were times of distress back in 2000 and 2001, et cetera. So I think that the way we think about it is kind of the way we run the business, which is oriented towards companies that are largely investment grade, established, bigger companies.", "We have made some investments in the Midtown South area like 635, 646. But even in that building, which has a fair amount of tech tenants, they are all very high-quality like Infor, Microsoft and Yelp. So I don't know that that doesn't raise any red flags for us on the credit side of things. I think we have sold properties in the past where we felt there were some credit exposures to try and head off what may be coming down the pipe. But I would simply say that just look at the supplemental with the disclosure of our tenant profile and you will see that regardless of how that market develops over time and there is always going to be ups and downs and what's essentially a cyclical and an emerging kind of industry, I don't see that having any impact, any material impact on the portfolio as it has in years past.", "Andrew Mathias", "I think a very small fraction of the 5% of tech Mark referred to is at all reliant on venture funding, which I think maybe 1% almost. I mean 1% of the 5%, maybe, not even 20% of the 5%. I don't think venture funding is at all relevant to our tenancy whatsoever. The tech tenants we have are large public tenants and we took a measure this quarter to sell the 36th Street asset, which had an exposure to venture funded type tenant.", "Tony Paolone", "Okay. Got you. Thank you. My second question on One Vanderbilt, can you give us a sense as to how you think about depth of market for tenants at that price point? I think there is some other product going up at a fairly similarly high price point? And then you have sort of the alternative of the West Side or downtown at a much lower new construction price points. So as you guys move forward with that project, how do you think about just the pot out there that you can go get at that price point?", "Marc Holliday", "Yes. Tony, I think we are going to go through that in an extensive amount of detail in December. And I would sort of urge you to wait till then to hear from Steve and some of the brokers we have working on deal will take you through the building, the special aspects of the way it's designed, the way it's monetized, the kind of tenants it will appeal, the way in which we are marketing, we will begin marketing that building, it really I think when you there is other buildings going up of a similar, is really almost none.", "There is maybe 425 Park, although the majority of that is anchored and what's left is very small floor plates. So I actually don't know anything that is going up that will be delivering in 2020 that I would call competitive product in AAA location. And the tenants that will be looking for large blocks of uses between 500,000 and a million square feet and over on the West Side really don't even enter our target market for the most part, because we see this building likely be tenanted by tenants ranging anywhere from 50,000 feet to 250,000 feet looking for very high-end, very highly monetized, very high design, very well located brand-new office space with views that are sort of unparalleled in Midtown, because of the height of the building.", "So I don't think there is a lot of competition. That doesn't mean we don't have to think long and hard about who is that tenant base and how are we going to attack them. And that we will go into in great detail in December, but suffice it to say the reception to the building from the tenant community so far has been excellent. And if anything, given that it's only 2015 and we are talking about occupancy in 2021, 2020 possession date for occupancy in the end of 2020, 2021, for tenants in that 50,000 to quarter million square feet range, it's a little early, which I would say is obvious. But I just wanted to state that. But the reception generally has been excellent and I don't think the price points we have established for the building are going to be a resistance level for these types of tenants.", "Tony Paolone", "Okay. Got you. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Vincent Chao", "Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I just wanted to go back to guidance for a second here. Understanding that there is a second quarter roll of raise here, but given the magnitude of the beat here in the quarter and some of the drivers there, I guess I would it would have rolled a bigger raise. So I was just wondering if you could provide some more color on sort of what the key drivers of the upside here are? It does seem like you are tracking well ahead on the same-store front and leasing velocity sounds very strong as well relative to your expectations.", "Marc Holliday", "Yes. With only months left to go, I feel like our visibility for the end of the year is pretty solid at this point. A lot of what we reported in the third quarter was expected off the balance and otherwise slightly ahead on a handful of things that put us in a position of generally increase sequentially two quarters and there is really outperformance and there has been. But by and large, the stuff that we saw in the third quarter was in line with expectations. A lot of the leasing momentum that we have when I say we are excited about 2016, that's really going to have an impact in 2016 and beyond, not for the last two months, three months a year.", "Vincent Chao", "Okay. So the real estate tax what was contemplated, I guess. Okay. I guess just another question in terms of the total overall demand that you are seeing. We talked about the tech component of it. I am just curious if there is any other shifts or changes that you have seen in sort of where the demand is coming from in New York?", "Marc Holliday", "Financial services is really, what was missed in the last conversation was, it's not so much about where TAMI is, even though that was the big story for last year. The difference this year is that financial services has been the driver of leasing activity across the Manhattan market. Certainly within our pipeline, we have got lease out 100,000 square feet of that is financial services related and in the term sheet stage, we have got almost 300,000 square feet of deals pending with financial service type tenants. So strong demand there.", "The other driver, healthcare continues to be a big push in Manhattan. So does education, the administrative side of education. We are seeing some large leases come in the pipeline off of that as well.", "Vincent Chao", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "John Kim", "Thank you. I had a couple of questions on retail. This period you signed a high rent deal at 125 Park Avenue. Can you provide some color on the kind of tenant you signed there? Whether or not this was conversion space? And if it was conversion space, how many other opportunities do you have to convert officer lobby into retail?", "Marc Holliday", "I guess at 125 Park, I think we signed two deals this quarter. Haworth, which is the showroom tenant on the ground and second floor and then we did convert a bunch of basement and storage space into retail, combined that with the unit on the first floor and signed a major fitness operator into the space to open a gym. So I think that is very indicative of the work day in and day out our retail group is doing, diligence-ing the assets we own in addition to the asset we are purchasing to try to find areas where we can expand the retail footprint and convert lower revenue generating space into higher revenue generating space. So there is a lot more of that opportunity in the portfolio.", "John Kim", "Do you have an estimate as to how much that may be?", "Marc Holliday", "We had put up a slide in December.", "John Kim", "Right.", "Marc Holliday", "But that will have to be modified, because some of the leasing has taken place this year. But the slide in December that I recall, was something like $160 million of incremental NOI over the next five years, our share, that represents our share coming strictly from retail assets. Now in that regard, there has been retail leasing, but we have added retail assets. So we will have to do that reconciliation for you in December. But suffice it to say, it's enormous. I look at that number as coming from the retail which is not a segment of business we have a lot of capital devoted to like we do on the office sector, much more capital devoted there. So pound-for-pound, that kind of NOI lift over the next five years coming from that segment is enormous. But I can't tell you at the moment the exact amount of NOI expectation we have from retail over the next five years. We will have that for you in December.", "John Kim", "Okay. And then my second question on retail is the potential releasing spreads going forward. I am looking at slight 50 and your asking rents estimates. It looks like it actually went down for three or four retail buckets you have compared to the second quarter. And I was wondering how much of this was due to the mix that have changed compared to maybe more conservative views on retail and maybe some softness on the retail market?", "Matt DiLiberto", "John, it's Matt. It's more a mix in that portfolio. We sold some stuff based on occupied space. So depending on when space rolls in and rolls out, that could change. But certainly our view of retail has not changed.", "Andrew Mathias", "We are not seeing rental declines in any of our retail assets.", "Marc Holliday", "The mark-to-market that was associated with the presentation I was referring to just earlier generated $160 million or so of incremental NOI, had a mark-to-market, as I recall of about 100%. So I don't know where how that compares to the supplemental.", "Andrew Mathias", "That's all in the same [indiscernible].", "Marc Holliday", "About 100%, right. So I think it's fair to say, on average there are some properties we have in well-built prime and the prime retail segment where rents may be marking 200%, 300%, 400% literally to market. And then there is other aspects which are 20%, 30%, 40% but on average at least as of with December, it was about 100% and as Andrew said, we have not reduced retail rents I don't think anywhere in the portfolio. Did we reduce it anywhere? No. So it has to be solely mix or the occupancy that is coming up in any given year some has higher mark-to-market, some lower. But again, I would look at it more portfolio basis, as opposed to any individual quarter or year. And on that basis that 100% embedded growth.", "John Kim", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Hi. Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. Good quarter. Matt, just a quick one for you. When we do think about the sources and uses of funds over the next few quarters, again the slight gap you still have left to fully fund Eleven Madison, could you talk about how large that is? And whether you expect all that to come from the debt refinancing that you are talking about? And if that isn't indeed is the case, if you do end up with excess proceeds, is the idea to continue to delever going forward?", "Matt DiLiberto", "So Mark talked about the incremental asset sales over and above 1745 as now being sources of capital or other accretive opportunities. Just speaking to, what we like to call the Eleven Madison rubric, the totality of the acquisition and sales that [indiscernible] into it. Fund percentage is 45%, the sales have all been completed, consistent with our plan. So that leaves us with financings and refinancings that are in process that generate incremental capital to the program.", "Marc Holliday", "Great. And just to expand on that, in June we put up a presentation, which showed a funding plan for Eleven Madison, but also for $400 million of additional acquisitions. We are about $200 million of equity through that $400 million. So we will sell more assets likely beyond 1745 Broadway, as I mentioned earlier. And those will go to fund those incremental acquisitions to fill out 200 and then possibly beyond that as well, because we will go beyond. But if the question is just to close out the Eleven Madison, I think what I said earlier was 1745 plus the refinancings closes out Eleven.", "Matt DiLiberto", "And as the delivering tile, obviously we closed Eleven Madison using our corporate liquidity and corporate facilities. So now with every sale that we consummate that will go down too as part of the [indiscernible] that will go back to repay those facilities taking a leverage write down.", "Marc Holliday", "But if you look at where we started the year and where we finished at the end of consummating all the transactions, all of our leverage ratio is based on 2015. EBITDA is right back in line and then in 2016 improves as we expect 2016 EBITDA to exceed 2015 EBITDA. So we should have improvement in all those ratios, notwithstanding the enormous acquisition that we were able to achieve by ourselves without partner, without issuing any common equity and obviously as markets improve, the ATM becomes an option down the road, but clearly at the levels we had experienced, we have been relying solely on the asset sales and that's proven to be an excellent strategy, we think.", "Tayo Okusanya", "That's very helpful. Thanks for clarification.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Jamie Feldman", "Thank you. Just focusing on the leasing pipeline. Can you talk about how much of that pipeline is new versus renewal? And then also maybe break it out into the different sizes you are seeing? I think you mentioned there is a 200,000 square foot potential financial services users. And then just thinking about the different corridors, are you seeing more demand for high-end Park Avenue, Sixth Avenue, Midtown South?", "Marc Holliday", "Of the leases that are out, the majority of it is new deal. In the pipeline of deals that are being negotiated, it's probably sort of 50/50. As far as locations, the majority of deals that we are working on are all Midtown. It's kind of all spread downtown or Midtown South, but the majority of it is Midtown. And what's interesting is that a good chunk of, I would say a very large percentage of the deals that we are working on, both in pipeline and/or leases that are out, are for spaces that aren't becoming available until 2017, whether those are early renewals or whether they are forward commitments for space were space that we know we were getting back in 2017. So that's where a lot of our attention is right now. We have very good visibility, obviously, through the end of this year and for most of 2016. But we have got a deal roll in 2017 and the good news on that we have got some very large deals in the pipeline that are going to knock the pieces off the board.", "Jamie Feldman", "Okay. And are you seeing any shift in terms of the different avenues or parts of Midtown in terms of where people want to be or what they are willing to pay? I know you signed a Bloomberg deal earlier this year on Third Avenue.", "Marc Holliday", "Park Avenue is good, the rents are up but the supply is way down. Park Avenue has got one of the lowest availability rates right now in town. Right around Grand Central is compared to a year ago. There has been a lot of leasing velocity in the Grand Central submarket. But I really can't point you to say that the demand is focused on one avenue, one submarket or one size or type of tenant. Interesting to note that two years ago, we would have been talking about how Third Avenue had a lot of supply. Now all of a sudden, Third Avenue has returned to its historical norm as far as availability. And if you take our building at 711 Third Avenue, where we have number of deals that we are negotiating, the rents there, which is probably our most commodity light building where you would think would be the sort of weakest as far as rent growth, we are seeing a good $10 increase on rents on a number of the deals that we are negotiating today versus where we would have been a year ago.", "Jamie Feldman", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Great. Thank you and good afternoon. First, Marc, just going back to 885 Third. If my math is right, it looks like your preferred equity is between the 60% and 90% LTV. And I think you sell that preferred--", "Marc Holliday", "No. Not right. How did you get it? I don't want to -- just as part of efficiency. 90% LTV? How did you --", "Matt DiLiberto", "What are you using for asset value?", "Alexander Goldfarb", "I was using in your press release, the $453 million and then deducting the mortgage and then deducting the --", "Marc Holliday", "Alex, it's a fee position. It's not -- you have only got like half the equation.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay.", "Marc Holliday", "There is a leasehold behind the fee. We own the fee. We traded the fee. The fee is a partial interests of the overall value of that property. There is a leaseholder out there that would like to think they have sizable, sizable equity value behind the fee position. It's actually of over $100 million of institutional debt and then there is over $100 million invested equity and whatever it's worth, its worth. But this is no 90% of value. This is like, I would equate it almost to a AAA bond. Right? Does that make sense, Alex?", "Alexander Goldfarb", "It makes perfect sense.", "Marc Holliday", "That's why I wanted to sort of just closure it there. I don't want those 90% number flowing around. This is a very secure fee asset with a lot of subordinate equity below in the form of a long-term operating leasehold position owned by foreign entities and that are institutional in nature and I think they have a ton of equity value in that field.", "Matt DiLiberto", "Right. I guess the reason the fee position is traded for the price it is traded is that it has limited upside because there is a fixed price repurchase option.", "Marc Holliday", "Yes. So I would look at this more as a low leverage mortgage bond that we traded. I mean that's how the deal. This was a testament to Andrew. He structured three of these deals back in 2005, 2006, 2007. 292 Madison, Two Herald, 885, where we took kind of low LTV fee positions and gave out of the money purchase options that I think were generally 10 or 15 years forward. So two of those deals we fully resolved. We made very significant returns on Two Herald and 292. Now this deal, upon closing fully resolved, we will have achieved essentially at 10% to 10.5% IRR on what I look at essentially as a AAA bond position.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay. That's helpful and that explains. I appreciate that. The second question is, on the originations in the quarter, the 7.2%, is that just a reflection of going after some senior mortgages and therefore we should expect more of the 10% going forward? Or do you think that because you guys maybe going more senior, that 10% may come down more towards 9%?", "Marc Holliday", "I would expect to hold positions to be more in the overall average of our book in the 9%, 10% range, it is reflective of the fact that we have put a mortgage on the books and haven't syndicated the senior portion of it yet.", "Matt DiLiberto", "There again, I would just like to raise the point, as you talk about 10%, for earnings purposes, we model 8.5% not 10%. In the world of that big difference. So we had been achieving 10%, because we have been outperforming our projections. Our target, just so we are on the same page, is not 10% but the guidance in any case is 8.5% on a blended basis between whatever the profile book of mortgage is for the debt has been, as Andrew said and that's likely to continue. And if it does, then we should meet or exceed 8.35%, hopefully 10%, but I just wouldn't of course view on using that as sort of your target.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Perfect. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. As a reminder, please limit yourself to two questions. Our next question comes from John Guinee of Stifel. Your line is open.", "John Guinee", "Folks, John Guinee. Thank you. Two quick ones, which are going to sound like three. First, when you first announced the Eleven Madison, my recollection is, you gave a laundry list of assets that you were going to sell and forgive me for not being able to keep track. But were any of that original laundry list not yet announced, i.e., didn't happen? Second just out of purely idle curiosity, who is the lender on a $1.4 billion 10-year loan? And then three, what's the magnitude of the advantage of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York relationship?", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. Let's take him off.", "Matt DiLiberto", "I believe that's three questions, John, right after the operator --", "Marc Holliday", "Yes. But he asked them all at once. So maybe --", "John Guinee", "I am not an accountant, though. So it only looked like two.", "Marc Holliday", "All right. So in terms of the first one, I don't think we put a list out there.", "Andrew Mathias", "We didn't publish a list of assets. We published an aggregate sales volume.", "Marc Holliday", "Look, we had an internal list, I would say, that was all the assets we are selling and then some, because we were kind of that triangulating market, if you will, to try and figure out of a universe of assets, which is larger than what we sold where could we get the best executions and we think we hopefully achieved that. So the answer is, no list. All the assets we sold were within the universe of what we intended to sell and we think we sold the ones that we could get the best execution on relative to our internal assessment value. That's one.", "Two, the lender on the building?", "Andrew Mathias", "It's a three-handed CMBS deal with three major market banks. They are doing -- they do a single asset deal, David?", "David Schonbraun", "Part of it was put in a single asset and the rest were put into separate conduit deals.", "John Guinee", "Okay. And the home loan bank award?", "Matt DiLiberto", "Look, I think we have been running a captive insurance for over a decade now and as part of that, we have access to the Federal Home Loan Bank, which provides us a very efficient capital to finance some of our structured positions with. So we are going to take advantage of it and it allows us to, instead of selling A-notes originating more senior positions and finance them and have higher retained yields. So I think we may do more of it later. But it's a big advantage to us on a go forward basis.", "John Guinee", "Thank you.", "Marc Holliday", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Sullivan of Cowen Group. Your line is open.", "Jim Sullivan", "Thank you. First of all, just to go back on the 885 and I know it's a very complicated structure that was put in place there. But Andrew, I think when you describe the pricing on the transaction, you talked about achieving a 10% IRR on the investment. As I recall, at the 2020 reset on the lease is an option that I think you referred to earlier. And I thought that option was price to delever up and unlever the IRR of about 7.5%. Do I have that right?", "Andrew Mathias", "It's 7% unlevered which levers up to 10%, yes. So it's north of 10% as a levered IRR.", "Marc Holliday", "Yes. We always on equity type deals, we only pinpoint unlevered returns. This type of investment where we don't have the operating position and it has a stated yield and a takeout in 2020, we look at strictly as a structured investment akin to something that would be almost in a DPE portfolio and we are looking at IRRs on cash out the door. So a 10.5% IRR is equivalent to essentially like a 10.5% we would achieved on an investment DPE. This just happens to be not DPE. It happens to be a structured leasehold and levered by kind of a low advance rate first mortgage.", "Jim Sullivan", "Well, the mortgage on the leasehold wasn't that at a pretty high coupon? Wasn't that over 6%, I want to say?", "Marc Holliday", "Mortgage on our fee or the leasehold?", "Jim Sullivan", "On the lease.", "Marc Holliday", "We don't hold the lease. It was purchased by a group that put a mortgage on it. I don't honestly recall or know what the rate is on that leasehold mortgage. But that leasehold mortgage is junior to us.", "Jim Sullivan", "Okay. And then the second question for me on the structured finance book. This is a modeling question, but the average weighted outstanding actually went down quarter-over-quarter. I think the coupon went down as well. And yet the income went up and maybe in terms of helping us to model this going forward, what accounts for the higher yield on the lower balance and the lower coupon?", "Matt DiLiberto", "It's Matt. When we receive repayment, there is an exit fee that hasn't been amortized in, that's the case where the positions that got repaid this quarter that will be reflected in income in the quarter of repayments.", "Jim Sullivan", "And so I am thinking about it for Q4 we should assume a similar kind of premium level yield on the book?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, the run rate yield would to be consistent with what we have shown on average or the last several quarters. The income stream will be affected by the lower balance that we are leading off the fourth quarter with. That trend is upward as we originate more deals towards the middle to the back half of the quarter but the portfolio yield remains fairly consistent. I said we will end the year just north of 10%.", "Jim Sullivan", "Okay. Very good. Thank you.", "Matt DiLiberto", "I think it's mostly a function of us not controlling the timing of repayments. So if we can anticipate them and try to model them coming in, but you don't know when exactly they are going to come in and some of the exit fees are variable in amount depending on timing of repayment.", "Jim Sullivan", "Okay. Very good.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Brendan Maiorana of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Brendan Maiorana", "Thanks. Steve, you alluded to 2017 expirations. I was wondering if you could maybe handicap what's likely with Omnicom at 220 East 42nd, where you have got a big expiration in 2017?", "Steven Durels", "We are in term sheet discussion with them about retaining some but not all their space.", "Brendan Maiorana", "And it looks like rents are mid to low-40s. How does that compare to market?", "Steven Durels", "There is going to be a massive mark-to-market in the building.", "Marc Holliday", "Whether it's with Omnicom or replacement tenant.", "Brendan Maiorana", "Sure, yes. And then just second question, occupancy level of 97%, I think it's kind of an all-time high. Your portfolio quality is higher than it's ever been as well. But is 97% occupancy sustainable? Or should we expect that to migrate down a little bit over the next couple of quarters?", "Marc Holliday", "We are telling our guys, it's not nearly enough. So I don't know. There is a lot of square footage between 97% and 100%.", "Steven Durels", "Thanks for asking.", "Marc Holliday", "So the answer is no, there is pockets of vacancy we are not happy exist. We are attacking those, albeit diminishing and we have acquired new vacancies that's not in that same-store portfolio like Tower 46 and let's hear for the Fir Tree transaction. It seems we got a little loss today. But that was a great inaugural deal with the Tower 46 building, good tenant, good terms. We are happy to kick that building off successfully with that rent and we have got a lot of really good-looking prebuilts that basically are done, Steve?", "Steven Durels", "Two weeks.", "Marc Holliday", "Two weeks away from done and we hope and expect when those prebuilts are done that they will be a hot commodities in a very good building. So I think there is still upside within that portfolio, but the upside really isn't just leasing up a vacant space. We got a lot of development pipeline. We have got vacant space pipeline in the growth portfolio and that's not in the same-store and we have got big, big mark-to-market in the office portfolio and then massively more so in the retail portfolio. So I don't think we are suffering from a lack of areas to identify for where the growth is coming from which is why I think we are very, very optimistic about where we were headed for 2016.", "Brendan Maiorana", "All right. Well, look forward to those goals in December. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Mailman of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Jordan Sadler", "Hi. It's Jordan Sadler here with Craig. I will ask the first one. Did you guys have a look at Stuy Town this time around? Was that on your radar?", "Marc Holliday", "Short answer, no. I think a project of that scale with the political complexities there and our sort of historical experience there did not make the top of the list.", "Jordan Sadler", "Okay. That's fair. Craig has one.", "Craig Mailman", "Yes, guys. On the decision to sell the Fifth Avenue retail, just thoughts there as you guys historically had kind of taken the opportunity to make the money on the lease and this one you guys blew out a little bit earlier, before you really did any work? Is it something specific about that site? Or I guess just general thoughts on that?", "Marc Holliday", "I think it was more the -- we usually make the money on the lease but we can make the money we are going make on the lease without building and doing the lease, then it seemed like a good opportunity to take money off the table and take advantage of an extraordinary buy which rather the retail team made and not have to build.", "Steven Durels", "Yes. 180 Maiden Lane is a good example of that same strategy. Most of what we buy we execute as in the case with 180 and these properties don't fit. Sometimes you get an offer that's so compelling. So on to the next. There is a lot of property out there to reposition.", "Craig Mailman", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jed Reagan of Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.", "Jed Reagan", "Good afternoon, guys. Other than 1745 Broadway, can you give any color on other assets that are out in the market today and maybe bracket how much you think you might build and sell in the next six to nine months on the top of the 1745 and what you have already announced in the last couple of months? I mean is this another $1 billion kind of territory worth of stuff? Or maybe just some color there?", "Marc Holliday", "Yes. I think we will cover it in December. Right now the focus for us for the past four or five months has been on executing a very deliberate plan that we put forth in June. We are at the tail-end of that. We are now putting in place our new plan, if you will, for the next batch of investments that we have been mining and we think are coming to fruition and how best we are going to fund those and from which assets we are going to be selling or capital we are going to be raising in the form of JV equity, as to the capital raised in today's environment that we look at as an alternative to selling existing asset to JV-ing of new assets. We liked very much what we bought this year. So we didn't JV any of that product, right. SoHo has came as JV but we didn't take any partners there or Eleven Madison or on 187 or the East Side portfolio. Correct?. So we can only use that, the ability to access private equity partnership as a means of moderating what we sell or don't sell to fund those kinds of deals. So that hasn't been decided nor does it need to be at this point, but will be over the next three to five months as we execute on those opportunities.", "Jed Reagan", "Okay. That makes sense. And I guess sort of related to that. You guys made some bullish comments in the opening remarks about demand from overseas investors in Manhattan. Just curious, are you seeing any select sovereign wealth buyers that are taking a step back or getting less aggressive? Or just any evidence that bidding tents might be fitting? So marginal buyer too is on the sidelines now?", "Marc Holliday", "I don't think anything we can point to. Is there anybody? Isaac, David? No? Nothing we can point to, Jed.", "Jed Reagan", "Okay. Fair enough. Thanks.", "Matt DiLiberto", "Okay. Thanks.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. Thank you, everyone. That is it for the queue. So for anyone who is left on, we appreciate you hanging in there. Hope that we can see you in December. And that's it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program.

This conference is being recorded.", "At this time, the company would like to remind our listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from the forward-looking statements that management may make today. Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the company's Form 10-K and other reports filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "Also during today's conference call, the company may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G.

Thank you.", "I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. Thank you and appreciate everybody calling in this afternoon to review our fourth quarter and full-year 2015 results. Before we jump into it, I just want to mention that Andrew Mathias is going to be joining in by phone from the orthopedist's office with cell phone in hand because he suffered an injury, but wouldn't let that hold him back from the call. And Steve Durels also calling in remotely, but available for Q&A, as I guess the stress and tension of a active year-end and beginning of January took a toll on him physically as well, but wouldn't keep him from the call either.", "So we are all here, and just want to express our enthusiasm about the operating performance that we ended 2015 on a relative high note. As I think most of you had an opportunity to see at the Investor Conference in December, we're feeling very good about the fact that our buildings are extremely well leased and generally well leased with below-market rents that are ticking up 15% to 20%, in some cases, in the recent quarters. We have a modest amount of lease expirations in the coming years, and that is matched with a modest amount of debt maturities, both of which were actively managed over the years to make sure that, leading into markets where things are more uncertain, we have good tenure of lease maturities and good tenure of debt maturities.", "We are substantially complete with our redevelopment projects at 280 Park, 10 East 53rd Street, small project over at 16 Court Street. The important aspect there being: a, the buildings are all well positioned now like the rest of our portfolio; and b, all that capital is now behind us. And speaking about capital, the remaining capital to fund for the Viacom and Citi leases are now reduced in the aggregate to under $200 million, which will be spread over the next few years. So that number has also been mitigated to a great extent over time.", "First, what I'd like to do is hit some of the questions and topics that have been raised in some of the analyst notes that we've seen in the past 24 hours or so, and then open it up to Q&A.", "So, I guess, beginning with Manhattan leasing market, office market in particular, we ended the quarter with 416,000 square feet of leasing at mark-to-market rents that were up around 20%. So obviously, a big end to the year; we're very happy with that. I think that was sort of on or ahead of schedule. We slightly exceeded our 2.2 million square feet of velocity for the full year. But you should recall that we did advertise a pretty significant pipeline of leasing activity during the Investor Conference, and obviously now we continue to capitalize on that pipeline not only through December, but also in January. We've announced some leases as of yesterday, some big deals. And a good way to kick off the new year with Omnicom, Music Choice and Nordstrom's, along with some other leasing in January, that brings the total for the first month of the year to about 310,000 square feet of leasing in January. So clearly, that is us executing on that pipeline and now, obviously, we're very focused on continuing to build that pipeline for future quarters.", "As a footnote to the Omnicom deal, because we got the question, it does represent a reduction in space at The News Building, but we are actively working on a lease to absorb the remaining space. So I think we feel pretty good about where we are positioned with that space and that asset at this time. Even after that December-January activity, the pipeline still stands today in excess of 1.1 million square feet with more than half of that amount consisting of leases that are either out for signature or are in advanced stages of negotiation.", "So that leaves us this year with about 800,000 square feet left to lease on a portfolio of nearly 30 million square feet. That's obviously a very small and manageable amount for us to be handling this year. Therefore, a lot of our attention, a lot of Steve's attention, his team's attention will be focused on the expirations in 2017, where at the moment expiration stands at about 1.7 million square feet. But I do want to add that the pipeline I mentioned earlier consists of about 650,000 square feet of leases that expire in 2017. So, obviously, one month into year, we're already working hard on mitigating and reducing 2017's exposure. In 2018, we go back to a more normalized or below-normalized expiration amount of 1 million square feet. So I think we feel very good about 2016, 2017, and 2018, where we stand in terms of availabilities, pipeline; our portfolio is 97.1% leased over that extraordinary amount of space, which I think is a real achievement and a real testament to this team to be able to keep these buildings at such a high level of performance.", "With all of that said, we look at the current market environment and look at how we think it may affect job creation going forward and how that may in turn translate into demand for space. And I would say that those two, which are highly connected, we expect to see a bit of a rollback in job creation for the first time in the past four or five years in New York City, and I'll get into some stats on that and, in turn, that that will have an impact on leasing velocities, which we do expect will begin to slow sometime in the second half of the year. So I think as far as we are concerned, with the guidance we had given about 45 days or 50 days ago at the Investor Conference, we still feel like all of that was somewhere between priced in or forecasted into our goals and objectives for the year. And we still feel very good about where we stand both for leasing velocity for 2016, about 2 million square feet mark-to-market, which we set a very high bar for ourselves on same-store NOI and leasing velocity.", "Looking at the portfolio, where we stand almost a month into the year, we feel good and can affirm those levels for sure. But we do see headwinds that we think are fairly -- should be fairly expected for an economy that has been producing greater than 2% job growth for five consecutive years. That far outpaces the numbers nationally. It also far outpaces historical normatives in New York City. And whereas last year, 2015, there was about 87,000 or 88,000 private sector jobs created in New York City, about 30,000 of which were office-using, we would expect that number to still be significant, but probably be more in the order of 50,000 to 60,000 jobs created this year, and hence, 12,000 to 16,000 office-using jobs created in 2016.", "So by historical standards, in excess of 1% job growth is still a very good number. But it does reflect a slowing of this unprecedented rate of growth as, I think, businesses sort of catch their breath over a very four, five-year significant expansionary period. But with these numbers, we do think that absorption will stay positive, and that we'll be able to maintain our rent spreads and our occupancy levels.", "Looking at the retail leasing market and what we've been able to accomplish there, we're joined today by Brett Herschenfeld, who will field some comments. Brett, as you'll recall, you saw in the Investor Conference, leads our SLG Retail division and will have more to say. But I think that the retail is generally still very positive aspect and positive part of our strategy for 2016. Although as we had said, and probably for 12 months to 18 months now, we do see signs of slowing sales in certain corridors, in certain of these submarkets, most notably some of the luxury branded retailers, maybe on Fifth and Upper Madison, are experiencing sales that would prevent these rents from continuing to rise. Whether or not there'll be any pullback in rent is yet to see. But our embedded retail rents across the board are about 100% below market. That's a number that you should recall from the Investor Conference, 100% below market. So whether the rents stay the same, go up a bit, or even pull back 5% or 10%, I would say to you that there's still significant, significant upside in the retail portfolio. We're still very bullish about the prospects of meeting our growth objectives, which last year was $30 million in the growth portfolio, this year is about $32 million in the growth portfolio. And then I think for the five years thereafter, we projected something in the order of $45 million or so incremental, mostly out of the growth in retail portfolio.", "So that, I would say, is still highly achievable whether the rents are at market or there's a slight pullback in that market. We still have very good demand in retail, as you saw with that 40,000 square foot-plus Nordstrom lease we were able to sign at 3 Columbus. I think that's a great mark. You saw we got the Armani deal done back in end of November, beginning of December at rents for Upper Madison \u2013 Upper East Side, Madison that are very, very reflective of today's market rents.", "So, I think is kind of a tale of two areas. Some of the product along Broadway is probably losing a little bit of velocity. But on the side streets, where we focused, on Greene Street and Spring Street and elsewhere, we still see very, very good demand from the smaller retailers for those kind of boutique and unique spaces. And I think we'll have more to say about that this year as we continue to lease up assets like 110 Greene Street and...", "Unidentified Company Representative", "And 102 Greene Street.", "Marc Holliday", "And 102 Greene Street. So those are real bright spots. I don't think we really have a retail exposure of any note other than 650 Fifth, which we continue to work on, have been to the finish line a couple of times on that, but haven't yet crossed the finish line. So that's one asset we hold in a joint venture out of the myriad of assets we own in retail, where we'll be working hard this year to get it leased. But the rest of it, I would say, is either put to bed or has significant, significant upside given our low bases in those assets and the low rents in place.", "Looking at the investment market, 2015, you'll recall Isaac Zion saying that we had record volumes. I don't have the number in front of me, but I want to say it was in excess of $60 billion of commercial transaction activity through the date of IC, and there was more transactions that rounded out the year in December.", "And I know our constituency likes to look at just what's up at the moment, not what happened three or six or nine months ago. And in that regard, I would point you in the direction of four sort of interesting transactions, all of which we believe are either \u2013 well, all under contract, for the most part. I don't think any are closed yet, is 1285 Sixth, which is a deal that Scott Rechler is doing, which is I think a very good down-the-middle deal for Scott. It's a 4.4%, 4.5% going-in yield and stabilized yield, so it's about a 4.5% cap going in. It's under $1,000 a foot, $950 a foot for a Sixth Avenue product, and a large transaction \u2013 showing that large transactions of $1.7 billion or more can still get done and capitalized in this market.", "787 Seventh, there again, going-in yield of about 4.5%, 4.6%, which is similar to the yield that we were able to achieve on 11 Madison. But here, we look at 787 as having above-market rents. And we think that there'll be pressure in execution to keep those yields at those levels as opposed to an 11 Madison deal which was contractually there with upside and no downside. The per-foot there was $1,150 a foot for that deal on Seventh, and that's $1.950 billion purchase price.", "Then we have two other deals, which may not be quite as well known or appreciated by our shareholders, and these are very recent. 850 Third Avenue is a deal that's being done, at least our \u2013 what our reconnaissance tells us at around $875 a foot, a sub 3.5% going-in yield. There'll be real work there to kind of rework that tenancy in order to get up to a 5% or 5.5% or so stabilized year, but that would be sometime out, probably five years or more out in time. And that's a deal that's about $460 million of price.", "And lastly, 405 Park is rumored to be under contract at a purchase price of $240 million, but more importantly at a price per foot of $1,450 per foot stabilized basis, we project it'll be closer to $1,600 per foot. That was about a 3% going-in yield. And I would say, this transaction doesn't just flatter 280 Park, it picks it up and puts it on the pedestal.", "So the investment market, as evidenced by those four deals I would say, is still alive and well, although like with the leasing market, I'm going to put a caveat here, we do expect a slowdown in the transaction volume. We certainly do not expect the record levels that we saw last year or anything close to it. In part, that's going to be particularly due to what we think will be some softness in the areas of condos and hotels, where we think that this market will probably take a more strict view of pricing with respect to those assets.", "However, just to draw a distinction, we do think that well-leased and well-located commercial assets will still be in demand. I would even use the words 'high demand' because they're still few and far between and there's still a lot of equity looking to invest in this market. They're just going to be very particular now about the kinds of assets they want to be in. And for those high-demand assets, I think cap rates will remain exactly where they were, in that 4% to 4.5% range or, even in some cases, 3.5% to 4% to 4.5% range for the best assets. However, further on these commercial assets, there are the transitional types of assets that require significant redevelopment, reposition, and leasing execution. There, we would expect hurdle IRR \u2013 hurdle rates, not cap rates, but IRRs, to increase maybe 50 basis points, 75 basis points, maybe even depending on location 100 basis points in threshold returns for these sort of transitional assets.", "So, clearly, I think that the deals I just rolled you through and our view of the market flatters the 11 Madison deal. Even more so, I said in the Investor Conference, I thought it was one of the best deals this company has ever done because it's a high-quality asset with high-quality tenants. The financing was put away long term at 4%, limited downside, and very significant long-term upside. Not only that, but it allowed us to get out of some of these transitional assets where I think that there'll be more market headwinds this year. So our timing, I think, was excellent both on the buy, I think our sells were well-executed. And all in all, I think, it certainly bears out the strategy that we've laid out for everybody.", "Look at acquisitions and dispositions now for 2016. I just want to address this issue. I've seen a lot of reports about net acquirers. We tackled the question in the Investor Conference. I want to hit it on here, I'm sure I'll get it again in Q&A. When we put up numbers for those, those are gross numbers, gross numbers, gross means gross of joint ventures. So, $1 billion of acquisition is $1 billion of product, if not $1 billion of wholly-owned product. As you know, we do wholly-owned and we do joint ventures like Tower 46, a joint venture. 10 East 53rd was a joint venture. Those are two of our more recent office asset buys.", "So, when you see $1 billion of acquisition and $700 million of disposition or $750 million of disposition, that does not imply $250 million of equity issued nor debt leverage up. It just doesn't. What it implies is that we believe that during this year, we might see one or two interesting opportunities, to exercise on them, maybe. And if we do, we'll do it in a way where they are either funded entirely by sales or with JV equity, period. There should be no ambiguity about that even though we continue to read about expanding the balance sheet or levering up or issuing equity, none of which we did as part of last year's what we called rubric, nor would it be part of this year's business plan. I don't think we've issued equity since the first quarter of last year. So, that's been a concern. I would sort of take that concern off the table in terms of whether or not we're going to be net acquirers or not. I think it's going to be a neutral position. And whether we do the full $1 billion or not, that'll sort of be dependent on the opportunities we see in the market. It's easy to say, well, when the market gets tight, don't do anything. We don't exactly agree with that. We think that you have to moderate your investment approach.", "Recall that the Citibank building, 388-399 Greenwich was a deal we closed on, I believe, in December of 2007, okay, and we made a lot of money on that deal, both in terms of current return and capital gain. So, you have to be choosy, you have to be creative, you have to make sure it's well-capitalized. But I think a blanket statement that no deals get done would be inconsistent and not the right thing to say, nor is anyone implying that this is an expansionary market for SL Green. We're going to be very, very discerning on our purchases as we always are at this point in the market. In 2007, I think we did literally two deals, that one and a small other. 2008, nothing. In 2009 or 2010, again, because you can't just sit on your hands, we did 510 Madison Avenue debt deal, which turned out to be one of our most exceptional DPE assets we ever did. We were first, we were early in that sort of cycle of upswing.", "So, I think we're doing the right things on the acquisition side, and I think there's the opportunity to make good deals. But if we don't see them out there, then you won't see the acquisitions cross the tape, and we'll be focusing, I guess, instead on simply dispositions. So, on the dispositions front, there's one in particular to take note of that 388-390 Greenwich, which we talked about at the Investor Conference as being, a, highly likely to occur and, b, part of our capital plan. I did see in one or two reports the word, surprise, surprise exercise, by Citi. There can be no surprise. There can only be, what we say in that Investor Conference about, the high likelihood of Citi exercising in December turned into an actual exercise in January. And the reason why we are fans of that deal, a, it allows us to close out a very profitable investment position we took in the asset, but, two, it'll result in a reduction of indebtedness gearing of one full turn.", "So, between the $1.45 billion of debt in the $350 million of net equity pay down or there about net equity proceeds, there'll be about one full turn of debt reduction associated with that resolution of asset. Not a surprise because we put that there as kind of a pro forma investment as to how the gearing gets, not only to where our leverage levels were in 2015 at the beginning, which were already reduced, but gets reduced further.", "Second, we have other sources of equity that we would look to capitalize on this year, either for reinvestment or further debt reduction, beyond 388-390. And clearly, Eleven Madison, again, no surprises, I said on the call right after we purchased it that it was one particular asset that we might JV \u2013 re-JV after purchase. If we do that, there is no tax impediment to a joint venture. It's set up as a tick. So, it's relatively easy to joint venture that asset and still maintain the tax protection that we structured in the balance of the investment. And it's the kind of investment that has attraction in good markets and bad. There are other assets we are looking at now that we can sell in this market that will still receive a very good reception from foreign and domestic investors that I think you will see us execute on as part of reaching our goal for the year.", "But on one hand, while the market orients you to those kind of assets in terms of dispositions, it'll make us choosier and pickier in other assets where there's more execution, and this may not be the right time to opt and resell those assets, in which case, we'll just continue to hold those for the future or execute upon them ourselves.", "Lastly, before I open up for Q&A, I know this is an unusually long introduction, we have One Vanderbilt. There were literally questions about whether there's any update in leasing status from what we did 45 days ago. I don't know what to say to that other than reiterate what I said in December which is, this is an asset that tenants will be taking possession of sometime generally in late 2019 and 2020. Therefore, at the end of 2015, beginning 2016, it's far too early for most of these tenants to make that kind of space commitment. Most of the larger tenants today are looking for space commitments at around 2018, early 2019. And One Vanderbilt is not intended to be designed for the million square foot user. It's more in line for the 50,000 to 400,000 square foot user. Those kind of users make their decisions later in the cycle, generally two to three years in advance of possession dates, such that the meat of the leasing for One Vanderbilt will likely be in 2017 and 2018. So, that's where we are in that.", "In terms of funding plan for One Vanderbilt, we laid out a funding plan in December. I was asked whether we changed our funding plan. So, the answer is no, we haven't changed the funding plan. It is still our plan to obtain construction financing in the first half of this year and then joint venture financing in the second half of the year. I would imagine 45 days from now I'm going to say the same thing, although obviously we do adapt as the markets adapt.", "However, I want to just go a little further not only on the plan, but on the numbers, to give you a sense of how confident we feel in the execution on One Vanderbilt. Given the monies we already have invested in the project, all the monies, through the end of 2015 and the $230 million some odd that we project to expend out of cash flow in 2016, we should need to fund beyond that no further equity into the deal once we obtain construction financing and JV financing.", "We have modeled it in a way such that the balance of the project, which is the bulk of the construction, will be funded out of a conventionally-structured construction loan and roughly a 50% JV partner. That would require not only no money invested into the deal after the end of this year, but actually would result in money back to SL Green as kind of profit, if you will, over and above our invested basis. So, that is what we'll call plan A.", "The plan B would be a construction financing. We sell other assets and we would have the ability to fund the remaining equity over the ensuing four or five years essentially out of cash flow. There would be no need for equity issuance or lever off the Omni construction loan to fund the equity portion because we generally fund out of this company $200 million to $250 million or more of redevelopment or development capital annually. And that would be an amount sufficient over that period of time to fund the balance of the equity in the event we couldn't or chose not to JV the asset. However, the reception we believe in the market for partners for this asset is exceptionally strong and therefore we think plan A is far more likely than plan B.", "So with that said, it takes more questions on that in the Q&A section, but that is how we see having that One Vanderbilt project funded in a way that puts no liquidity pressure on the company whatsoever.", "So with that, I'd like to open up for Q&A. [Operator Instructions]", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from David Toti with BB&T Capital Markets.", "David Toti", "Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Just a couple of questions. Marc, it's an unusually cautious tone from you relative to the tone that we heard in December. What are some of the indicators that are giving you a bit more pause at this point in the year?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I mean, in terms of a cautious tone I would say it's more market-driven. If you look at the last 45, 50 days in the market, there's obviously concern I'd say \u2013 I think predominantly about potential bank exposure to the energy sector and what that might mean in terms of earnings visibility and whether or not that will result in some kind of people contraction.", "So, I think the investor sentiment in general has degraded substantially over the past call it 50 days or so, even though the property metrics, if you will, have not. There's still \u2013 we see very good access to debt financing. So we think better projects will be refinanced in this market. There's a lot of equity capital out there, still looking for investment, and the tenant demand for the first month of the year was good. And the pipeline remains.", "However, I would say for, well, I'll say out of favor, more secondary, tertiary assets, either asset classes or transitional assets, I think as the financing becomes tougher to obtain for those kinds of projects, you're going to see those kind of projects back up a bit. But I don't think that's going to affect our portfolio in almost all respects.", "David Toti", "Okay. And then if I could just ask a follow-up. If we extrapolate that view of the market in the coming year to the transaction markets, does this speak to relatively stable cap rates and property values in your mind in the Metro New York City market and particularly for your asset type?", "Marc Holliday", "Again, I think you really got to parse asset type, which is what I tried to do in those opening remarks. I think that for the well-located, high-quality assets, the answer is absolutely in the 2% treasury environment, the kinds of returns that can be made on these core assets are still going to be, we think, very attractive to real estate investors, and demand will remain high for those assets. There are other assets, because real estate is a broad term in New York City, there are other asset classes and/or other asset profiles which I think will, you'll see cap rates and/or certainly IRRs increase \u2013 maybe IRR thresholds increase 50 to 100 basis points for hotels, condos and I'd say commercial assets with a lot of execution to redevelopment. But I think this is where quality gets parsed. I don't think it affects our portfolio because our portfolio, by and large, retail and commercial is extremely high quality. And I think we'll be a net beneficiary of that market.", "David Toti", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ross Nussbaum with UBS.", "Nick Yulico", "Thanks. This is actually Nick Yulico here with Ross. Can you just go through what's going on with the sale process for assets right now, whether you're still looking to sell 1745 Broadway and what's the status on that?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I think that given the notice that we received in January on the sale of 388-390, we're kind of reevaluating all of that as it relates to reevaluating our whole disposition program for the year because that one is so sizeable. With that said, 1745 is in the market. We're negotiating offers on that deal. And I guess we'll have more visibility on that during \u2013 in between now and the next call \u2013 and by the next call with that and other assets that we are in dialog with that we think would be the best asset to sell in this market because, again, there's a lot of demand out there, but the profile of what you sell changes somewhat, because we're always looking to sell not just sell for the sake of selling, but sell at whatever we think is accretive to our NAV, which is monstrously accretive to stock price because the stock price is a fraction of NAV.", "Nick Yulico", "Okay. And then just, I guess, on overall sales and you're thinking about getting money in or you're debating doing an acquisition or using that money to deleverage. I guess how you're weighing those two options based on your outlook now for the overall economy and the investment market? And then also on the Citi sale, how are you thinking about that? You talked about you could deleverage from that process, but you're also going to be losing NOI. So, how you are thinking about the FFO dilution impact there?", "Marc Holliday", "I mean, FFO dilution, you're taking a 2018 trip there because the FFO, I mean, that sale is scheduled for the end of 2017, so it's certain it's money in the bank, but it's \u2013 I mean, there's a lot of growth in this portfolio. I mean, I hope that came across in December the amount of embedded growth we have in the office portfolio, the growth portfolio, the retail portfolio. So, we're only now talking about 2016. I assume and hope we'll have additional growth in 2017 and 2018 such that whatever the diminution is from 388 as a result of paying down the mortgage and proceeds to pay down the line is sort of just a factor of our overall plan as we continue to increase NOI in all other assets and keep overall growth trajectory going forward. So, I don't think any 2018 dilution from Citi is factoring into our decision today to use all those proceeds for debt reduction which I mentioned earlier to you would be about one full turn of gearing of reduction. What was part B to the question? I didn't...", "Nick Yulico", "It was just, as you're thinking about \u2013 if you have a bunch of assets potentially earmarked for sale this year, how do you think about that money as it comes in, weighing deleveraging the balance sheet today versus buying an acquisition?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, the same way we always will. We want to \u2013 we've set goals for deleveraging. So, the way we presented that plan is we'll continue to pay down debt with asset sales where we can most efficiently, meaning there's no major tax impediment in doing so. Sometimes we have significant capital gains that you can't simply do without having to pay out, I guess, a stock dividend, which is an option and something we would look at, but something we haven't done in the past. And then, when we get to levels we feel are the right gearing levels at the end of the cycle, then we're looking for very opportunistic investments. So, the thresholds rise. You're looking for very opportunistic investments which we always generally are.", "And they're few and far between. I know people like to think in shopping markets. That means there will be a plethora of deals. It's just this market is so solid right now generally and you saw it a lot in 2008, 2009. Over half the inventory is owned by 12 or 15 of the best capitalized players in the Citi, so you just don't get these sort of highly distressed situations. So my point is if you see one or two this year or next year, it doesn't matter, if you see one or two really solid deals, then you act on them because they just don't come along that often. But I guess the default assumption is that most of the money raised through capital-raising activities is going to reduce the line of credit, which was there, is our source of liquidity to grow the portfolio and take advantage of the market over the past four or five years.", "Nick Yulico", "All right. Thanks, Marc.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.", "Vincent Chao", "Yeah. Good afternoon. Marc, just going back to the kind of the change in tone here for December to today, I mean, it is quite a bit more bearish, but I thought I heard you say that you're not really moving away from the outlook that you projected back in December. I'm just curious why that is given the much more subdued tone out there and expectations of a slowdown in the back half.", "Marc Holliday", "Well, you'd have to look at each of the metrics. But, I guess, because we still think we're going to be able to achieve the metrics, I mean, it's \u2013 the mark-to-market on leasing I think we've pegged around 13% to 16%, and we still feel we're going to end up there. So, I guess, the question would be, why would I \u2013 you can't really alter that if you still think that's where you're going to end up. I mean, looking at the mark-to-market, we have $1.1 billion in pipeline, it's very significant, probably in excess of that.", "And looking at same-store NOI, which we put out there, is a very healthy number. I think it was around 6%. We feel good about the 6%. So I think you are \u2013 I wouldn't take these comments about the market generally and sort of the \u2013 where I think there'll be differentiation in the market with our portfolio and product on the right side of that differentiation as any indicator or reason that we would be modifying or coming off of the achievements \u2013 the financial performance we think we'll be able to achieve this year. So, I guess, we're not modifying. We still feel confident in where we sit.", "Vincent Chao", "Okay. Is it fair to say, though, that your outlook for the market has deteriorated since then? So, I mean, the conditions under which you made that outlook was somewhat different from a market perspective?", "Marc Holliday", "I would say \u2013 I think the market has deteriorated, and I think that we see a differentiation in this market. And because of that, we see opportunity both in the DPE program maybe down the road one or two asset buys.", "I had described the $1 billion of acquisition, which was an aspirational goal at the time, as one or two opportunistic investments. So I don't think that's changed. I mean, that's how we looked at it. I think that the composition of what we may sell will change because I think different assets will sell better in this market. So that may change, but the aggregate volumes we're not revising.", "And from a \u2013 most importantly, I think from a portfolio and company performance level, when we're looking at things like expenses, margins, leasing volumes, occupancy, mark-to-market, NOI, we feel very, very strong about that. So, remember, New York City projects 60,000-plus of new job growth. That's a very positive market. I just want to \u2013 it's not a \u2013 I would not use the term bearish market if the city is going to grow by 60,000 private sector jobs. That would, in most markets, be in most time periods for New York City considered very solid and enviable. It's just not at the same level it was last year. Those are stats we've recently come across. And I've always said that we tend to look at the job growth that is kind of a leading indicator. So, with that, I think it is a precursor, if you will, or at least a look into what'll still be positive absorption but potentially a slowing leasing market in the second half.", "Vincent Chao", "Okay. And just maybe one other question on the investment, Marc, it's obviously the less core assets that you [indiscernible].", "Marc Holliday", "I think out of fairness, we have a huge queue here.", "Vincent Chao", "Okay. I'll follow up.", "Marc Holliday", "I'm going to ask you sort of jump back around and, of course, [indiscernible] we've got a lot of guys in the queue.", "Vincent Chao", "No problem.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jamie Feldman", "Thank you. You had a very active quarter on the D&PE book. Can you talk about the spike in volume in the fourth quarter, especially given your more cautious comments about the market? And then also, it looks like your exposure per foot rose meaningfully for the junior mortgages and mezzanine debt. Just how should we think about your appetite for risk and volume in that book if we are heading into weaker times?", "David Schonbraun", "Look, I said \u2013 it's David Schonbraun. I think I said at Investor Day, sometimes the results are lumpy and in Q3, we had very low originations and Q4, you just saw a normalized kind of origination levels kind of look for the year. So I wouldn't read into Q4 volumes as anything happened other than Q3, we had a bunch of deals that didn't close in Q3 and they slipped into Q4.", "So, from a level standpoint, I think we're running exactly where we always have and I think the type of products has been consistent. I think we did a lot of \u2013 for most of the loans we did were a whole lot of originations where some of that we sold off senior pieces, some we held. I think we have tended to stay more senior in the capital stack and take less risk and maintain our yields, which I think has been a stated goal of ours. And I think that's going to be consistent in this year.", "So I think we have a pretty healthy pipeline right now. I think yields have held firm, but we've really tried to go consistent with last year and take a little bit less risk while maintaining yields, and not try to outperform on yield to get kind of the 8.5-plus-percent yield while taking the minimum risk to get there.", "Jamie Feldman", "And then how should we think about your exposure per foot for the junior mortgages and mezz? I mean, it's up meaningfully. Does that mean you think asset values are higher, or it's a mix?", "David Schonbraun", "I think it just depends on what we originate, so I wouldn't read into it. I don't think it \u2013 it may be because we did a couple of retail deals that drive the values. I think if you look at it as a homogeneous pool, it's a little tough. I think we probably did more retail plays in the fourth quarter, which is a sector, as Marc and Brad said, we love. So I think those have higher per foot, but probably may have less inherent risk, so you may just be seeing that come through.", "Jamie Feldman", "Okay. And then just thinking about your risk appetite, it sounds like you are more willing to pull back than get more aggressive here?", "David Schonbraun", "Actually, it's been consistent with how we run the program and consistent with what you saw last year, which is it's all about risk-adjusted return and us finding the right \u2013 what we think is the most mispriced piece in the stack, if that's mortgage, senior mezz, junior mezz, that's where we look to play.", "Jamie Feldman", "Okay. All right. Thank you. [Operator Instructions]", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Guinee with Stifel.", "John Guinee", "Okay. Hey, thank you. The question, I guess, is you guys have been on the FFO treadmill for a lot of years now, also doing pretty well on the value creation. If you can only go one way, are you going to continue to push FFO, or are you going to focus more on value creation?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I mean, John, I think we're always pushing value creation. I mean, FFO, I think, is a by-product of that. But we're in the business of investing capital and making money. We try to do it in a way to have recurring and replicable FFO, and I think we've done that about as good as anyone in the sector with an FFO that will be approaching $7 a share this year, and the lion's share of that coming from stabilized commercial portfolio. So I don't think we invest to create FFO, but obviously we invest to create cash flow and profits and FFO as a result of that.", "But I think we're always trying to be very selective about what we buy. I think that's why we have the portfolio we have today, which is I think second bar none in terms of quality and positioning. And we also are probably the most active recyclers of capital so that we're always generally looking first to monetizing gains and reinvesting them to drive value, which in turn drives FFO. So I think we're very connected, if you will.", "But the DPE book is always a constant as it relates to the aggregate amount of our real estate portfolio. And those proportions don't really \u2013 haven't changed over the years and don't change much. And if we're going to invest incremental capital this year, it'll be done very selectively, whether it's in commercial assets or the DPE book to make what we think will be outsized returns or \u2013 and then only once we are at the sort of the leverage levels that we have set out as targets.", "John Guinee", "Great. And then refresh my memory, where are you in terms of total cost for One Vande and cost per square foot? Have you given guidance on that yet?", "Marc Holliday", "Yes. Give me a second because I have that here. I think it's sort of an interesting stat. So One Vanderbilt depends \u2013 there's book balance, there's cash balance. The asset is carried on our books at a grand total of $133 per gross square foot, and I think that's $227 million. That's the book balance.", "In terms of invested capital to-date or I should say through 2015, that number is $433 million, or $250 per square foot, both of which I think I hope you would agree is a very, very attractive basis for us to own that land. It gives us complete flexibility, if you will, with respect to the future because we have a very low basis in it. We don't generate cash flow from it, so there's nothing in our current or future numbers. That's an important point actually. In all the growth numbers we've shown, we've never shown any incremental NOI growth from One Vanderbilt.", "So the project will either be capitalized in the way I mentioned earlier, which would require essentially no further out-of-pocket from SLG, or build it out of cash flow, which I don't think we'll ever be in a position of having to make that decision, or you could sit on it for a time without any pressure or effect. Not many developers have development sites with that kind of inherent flexibility with no debt and no joint venture pressure to have to perform or meet, and no earnings they have to support. So it sits on the balance sheet at very low levels. It has an investment balance at very low levels, and it gives us free flexibility, which is why we're very comfortable with it.", "John Guinee", "And your total development cost, is that $1,500, $1,600, $1,700 a square foot as of today?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I don't see \u2013 I think we \u2013 Rob Schiffer is not here at the moment. We put up a development budget at the IC and I want to say it was about $1,000 a foot for construction cost and you can obviously add to it what we have sunk into the deal, which is the numbers I just gave you. And then there's some soft costs and leasing and everything beyond.", "John Guinee", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Marc Holliday", "Yeah. Next?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tony Paolone with JPMorgan.", "Anthony Paolone", "Thanks. Marc, in an environment where you think leasing may slow in the second half of the year, do you think office rents for the market end up flat, down? Where do they go from here?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, as long as leasing absorption stays positive, I would say, at a minimum, it should be flat. I would have otherwise said up, except you have incremental supply so that would keep \u2013 you have incremental demand, incremental supply, so that should keep rents I think for at least 2016 at the levels they currently are, which is why we're modeling a mark-to-market consistent to 2015 \u2013 with last year as opposed to something higher.", "Anthony Paolone", "Okay.", "Marc Holliday", "Does that make sense or\u2026", "Anthony Paolone", "Yes. It sounds like \u2013 it sounds flattish, I guess?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, it sounds \u2013 well, again, it sounds flattish because of the incremental supply, but yes. Because the point is where you would look to declining rents would be when you have significant job loss, which is not at all being forecasted as part of this cycle right now.", "Anthony Paolone", "Okay.", "Marc Holliday", "But yes, I would say flat. It could be up, it could be. I mean, if you said it'll be up 3% to 5%, that wouldn't surprise us. That's possible. So it's sort of property-specific. Because we're so leased, we'll have the opportunity to push those marginal rents higher than we normally would because we have very little space available and not a whole lot expiring. And a lot of other landlords are in that same situation. So we will certainly be responsive to the market, but we're also holding our rents and can push those rents.", "Anthony Paolone", "Okay. And then second question. Both 3 Columbus and 280 Park, I know you have partners on those, but they both seem to be rounding the corner then now. What do you guys want to do with those? Do you keep them? Do you try to sell? What are the plans there?", "Marc Holliday", "I think both assets are long-term hold. So I don't \u2013 it's not a part of the current thinking on asset dispositions in either of those two events.", "Anthony Paolone", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.", "John Kim", "Good afternoon. Marc, just given where your stock is trading this year as well as your CDF spreads on your debt, are you considering deleveraging further than the 8 times debt to EBITDA that you projected by year-end?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I think the projections we put up with Citi had us below 7.6 times. So, I guess, the answer is, yes, because that's what we put up in December was I think 7.5 times or 7.6 times, Matt.", "Matthew DiLiberto", "7.6 times.", "Marc Holliday", "So I would say that's still the target. We could go below that as well. But the target is not 8.0 times. It's 7.6 times.", "John Kim", "Right. 7.6 times is pro forma 2017?", "Matthew DiLiberto", "2016.", "John Kim", "But I was wondering if there was any thought of deleveraging quicker than that?", "Marc Holliday", "Yes. I mean, I think that certainly if we wind up reinvesting or utilizing all the proceeds of our expected sales to retire debt, then it will be quicker than that and further than that, if you will. So the answer is, it's certainly something we would do and could do based on the assets we sell. And again, the only sort of asterisk there is to what degree is the tax implications of what we're selling. Some assets have modest tax implications. Others, we've created such enormous embedded gains that they tend to \u2013 it's more efficient, if you will, to reinvest in a 1031, the way we usually do. Because selling assets and paying down debts works if you're not making any money. But if you're making sizable capital gains, then you got sizable taxes to pay.", "John Kim", "Okay. And then you commented on the potential increases in IRRs for traditional type of assets, but I was wondering if you had any comments on trophy assets as far as exit cap rates because I think, earlier this year, exit cap rates were being underwritten at 50 basis points higher than going in for trophy type of assets.", "Marc Holliday", "I think you're going to see no change in trophy cap rates.", "John Kim", "Even with the job growth slowing?", "Marc Holliday", "Even with job growth slowing. These are \u2013 I mean, trophy assets to me are the premier assets in the city, which generally are well leased and long-term lease. So, an incremental job growth in 2016 is sort of meaningless for the asset. There are people that just are looking to put core money to work. The interest rates are low. I mean, this is a dead market \u2013 the spreads have gapped out but swaps and treasuries have declined, plus that financing rates are still extremely low relative to those cap rates and IRRs. And because of that, we still see at the moment pretty heavy investor demand. I think the message is that I'll keep repeating, so hopefully people come away, which is that we'll be selective and the best assets I think will still continue to be at kind of these record levels, if you will, or most desired levels throughout the year. Unfortunately, our portfolio falls primarily into that bucket.", "John Kim", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Manny Korchman with Citigroup.", "Michael Bilerman", "It's Mike Bilerman with Manny. Two questions. The first just on One Vanderbilt. And Marc, certainly appreciate your comments that, in option one, using joint venture equity as well as a construction loan, you wouldn't have to put any more capital. And I'm just curious as you are thinking about that project and investing that extra $1.7 billion of capital, at what point do you make the decision to move completely forward? Is it a pre-leasing level, or is it at a date because I do think that there is, even if you use joint venture in a construction loan, still some concern in the marketplace that you are going to move forward with an extraordinarily large development in an uncertain market and one where clearly your more subdued comments today would give people more pause. And so I think just trying to understand when and what sort of environment you would fully move forward with this.", "Marc Holliday", "Well, the environment into which \u2013 today is really not the environment in which we're leasing into. So you really have to look at what's the environment in 2017 and 2018 when we would expect the bulk of the leasing to be done. So, with regards to a go, no-go, to me, it's about capitalization and risk mitigation. So to the extent you've got long term and low-cost construction financing in place that gets you into the 2020s. So, I mean, this market becomes like an asteroid to the relevant market for this asset, which is five to six years forward and you have your JV equity in place such that we would have no further equity commitment.", "So, without a financing risk and without any further equity component that makes it an easier call to move forward than not.", "So, I think that the level of leasing will be known in 2017 or 2018, so I would say, at least on a spec basis, that's the date on which we'd be reassessing or assessing the project. But I'm very confident that that project is going to be met with extraordinary demand on both the debt equity and leasing market. The meetings we've done to-date have kind of codified for us, if you will, just how well-received this product is going to be. But again, it's for a much future market so I think the issue is predominantly capital risk mitigation which is really in the form of equity, bringing in a JV partner.", "Michael Bilerman", "And the second question is just in regards to NYRT. You guys made a comment to the press last week that you're not in negotiations to buy the company. And I wondered if you can just clarify does that mean you're still part of the process where you're not the active lead bidder in the final negotiations, or does that mean you're completely out from acquiring the entity? And how does that then translate ultimately to potentially coming back in as a bidder or potentially financing another bidder from a DPE portfolio?", "Marc Holliday", "Michael, you're like...", "Steven Durels", "Clear violation of the [indiscernible].", "Marc Holliday", "You're like reading \u2013 you're going way too deep into this. I mean, if we make a statement we're not in discussions with a company, I would hope that that's just sort of...", "Michael Bilerman", "Was it negotiations? So I didn't know how to take negotiations as a word.", "Marc Holliday", "All right.", "Michael Bilerman", "And you know...", "Marc Holliday", "You can use the word discussion. I know what you want to use, but I have nothing further to say on NYRT. We're not at liberty to get into it. You can speak with them. And I think I wouldn't read so much into it.", "Michael Bilerman", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Hi. Yes, hi. Good afternoon. Two questions here. The first is, over the past several years, we've had a number of market swoons where there's been extended volatility whether it's last August or previously back in 2013. Given large financial firms haven't really been active growers, so it's been either smaller financial or the social media or advertising or other industries. Can you just give a sense of as far as tenant discussions, how right now is different that's made you more subdued versus what happened last August when people panicked over China or in prior sort of market melt downs?", "Marc Holliday", "Steve Durels, are you [indiscernible]", "Steven Durels", "Yeah. Let me \u2013 you got to put things in context. Marc was commenting as to where there are headwinds and speculation as to what we may face throughout the year. That's one point. But as we sit here today coming off of a very strong fourth quarter and going into the first quarter, we haven't seen any let up on the leasing. So, we've got a very full pipeline. And we've probably got as better diversification on the types of tenants than we've seen in any time in the past. Of the million \u2013 100,000 square feet of pipeline transactions that are active either in term sheet negotiation or leases out, it runs the gamut of big deals with insurance firm, healthcare, advertising, legal information services and financial. So, a very, very broad spectrum of tenants that we're in active discussions with.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "So, as far as the leasing slowdown in the second half, that's just a general market observation or, Steve, that's based on your conversations with tenants, you're sensing more of hesitancy by people who normally would be in discussions at this point for second half where they are not in those discussions?", "Steven Durels", "Hasn't infected yet the conversations at my level. I think we're looking more forward down the line saying, if there's going to be moderating job growth, if there's sentiment out there that will lead people to pause then that's later down in the year. But as we sit here today, the only kind of hesitancy we've seen is on some of the financial service guys as you would expect, whenever we've seen big gyrations in the stock market then all of a sudden you get some of those hedge funds, some of those financial service guys say, you know what, let's just pause for 30 days., 60 days and see where the world shakes out.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay. And then, the second question is, on the finance book, what percent of the book are residential or condo conversion opportunities? If it's like an office building where you lent and that person wants to do condo conversion or something that would be like that and then what's the split of rental on the residential on your finance book?", "David Schonbraun", "The answer is as it sits today, we don't have loans on active condo projects in any loans that we have that are transitional, either work as office buildings or work for us as multifamily. So, we don't tend to make condo loans. The only time we really lend our residential is we think the fallback is multi-family works. So we're not really along condo product as condo products. We're not really along any real construction as it sits today. We have some land loans that I think sponsors want to go to condo but that's our basis works out with a very different business fund.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay. So like Sony building type things. How many other Sony-type buildings are there?", "David Schonbraun", "Sony building as it sits today is an office building.", "Marc Holliday", "Yeah. That \u2013 so Sony is not \u2013 our loan on Sony does not allow for a change of use. So, I wouldn't put that in residential bucket. That's an office building.", "David Schonbraun", "It's an occupied office building.", "Marc Holliday", "It's a collateral as office. So when you talk about a conversion loan, those are loans where you're providing the capital to convert to a change of use and at the end of the loan term the use has been changed. That's not Sony loan and that's \u2013 I'd say that's not most of our loans. We may have, up to 30 somewhat positioned, maybe 1 or 2 or bridge loans with an intent to condo or not, I don't even know.", "Isaac Zion", "There's a couple. There's very few that are bridged with intent to condo but our loans that allow them to go vertical.", "Marc Holliday", "Right. I guess the point is they didn't go vertical so there's no exit in terms of like condos sellout exposure. We have none of those.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Lewis with SunTrust.", "Michael Lewis", "Yeah. When you first laid out your 11 Madison Rubric, there was about $12 million of early debt extinguishment as part of that. You have a bunch of sales in the first quarter. Can we expect to see those charges in the first quarter, and are they in your guidance?", "Matthew DiLiberto", "Hey, Michael. It's Matt. We actually structured the refinancing such that we don't need to take that charge. So we put it on the original Rubric. It's not in our guidance and we won't be taking such a charge.", "Michael Lewis", "Okay. And then my second question, I might be wasting it, it's about New York REIT. The stock went up pretty significantly when it was reported that you weren't involved. Michael, just asked you if you might still be involved and you kind of couldn't answer or didn't really answer. Can we just say right here that you're not going to be buying New York REIT in any way, shape or form, or can we not say that?", "Marc Holliday", "I mean, we're going to pass on commenting on that question.", "Michael Lewis", "Okay. Understood.", "Marc Holliday", "I mean for just \u2013 not for \u2013 just we're not in a position to answer that question.", "Michael Lewis", "It feels like maybe it puts you back where you started before you commented for him.", "Marc Holliday", "I've got to move on to the next. I'm sorry.", "Michael Lewis", "All right. Thanks.", "Marc Holliday", "But I appreciate the question, Michael. Sorry, Michael. Steve Sakwa.", "Steven Durels", "Operator, move on.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.", "Steve Sakwa", "Thanks. Marc, just one question. I guess given the large discount that you stated at your Investor Day you were trading 10 AV, would you entertain doing a much larger asset sale and doing a special dividend something on the order of what EQR did in order to try and help return cash to shareholders and recognize that value?", "Marc Holliday", "Yeah. I think that's completely on the table if we get to a point where we think that's the best use of funds for sure. Yeah. I mean, I think it made sense. The asset portfolio at \u2013 I think the numbers were a 4.5% cap was about $154 million, 4% cap was $175 million and we're looking at the screen today of sub-100. So, if there's \u2013 I think one thing we've done a good job with in particular in the past couple of months is illumination of asset type. We've generally been able to sell into this market at numbers that are far, far in excess of people's models and everything, but consistent with our NAV, which gives us confidence. It cements our confidence in our NAV. So, I think that the implied trading right now is somewhere around 7% to 8% cap, which I think is somewhat absurd. And therefore, you'd have to look at that \u2013 what you outlined there, Steve, as a strategy is definitely possibility. The alternative is you can do the same thing, pay down some debt, and do a stock div as well, sort of different executions but related.", "Steve Sakwa", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sumit Sharma with Morgan Stanley.", "Sumit Sharma", "Hi. Marc, thanks for taking the question. And thank you for the color on the market. So, assuming that these negotiations on the spaces that are coming due, and this is not SLG space, but to your market commentary in general, assuming that they started happening at least 12 months in advance, is this your cautionary tone more on smaller tenants or are larger users also taking a pause? I mean, I guess do you anticipate TIs and free rents and concessions going up in 2016 because of the softening demand?", "Marc Holliday", "I will let Steve sort of handle that because I don't think we have it as finely parsed as large tenant/small tenant. But Steve, do you have a view?", "Steven Durels", "Yeah. I think it's \u2013 our commentary was in response to an inquiry as to whether rents would go up. The question wasn't whether the rents will remain healthy or not. We have a very strong market. We've had strong velocity in the fourth quarter. Midtown in particular had a very strong leasing quarter in the fourth quarter. Our pipeline and the overall velocity in the market remained strong. So, I think, from our perspective, the question isn't whether or not there's going to be erosion. It's just a matter of how good it's going to be. And if it's not great, it will still be a very solid leasing market for the year.", "Sumit Sharma", "Got it. Understood. Actually, another follow-up on the investment sales side at this point. Have you seen any sort of receding demand from foreign buyers of sovereign wealth funds?", "Marc Holliday", "Isaac, do you want to...", "Isaac Zion", "Hi. This is Isaac. We're still actively meeting with sovereign wealth funds from all over the world, maybe see a little bit of an uptick from folks in the Middle East trying to get some money out. Some of the European funds are also focused on the city. You got to remember, those are much longer-term players. Their view of the market is very long dated. So, we haven't seen any pullback from those players in terms of looking for assets.", "Sumit Sharma", "Thanks for the color.", "Marc Holliday", "Thank you. We'll take a couple of questions.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital.", "Jordan Sadler", "Hey. It's Jordan Sadler here with Craig. Just on the CMBS market dislocation we've seen over the past six months, but in particular over the \u2013 since your IC. Any thoughts ahead of risk retention coming into play later this year and what that portends for either New York City real estate values or for your structured finance business?", "Marc Holliday", "Andrew, are you \u2013 I hate to [indiscernible]", "Andrew Mathias", "Yeah. I think the \u2013 everybody is talking about risk retention, for sure. And nobody is \u2013 there's still a lot of uncertainty in terms of how the rules are actually going to play out. I think it'll have less of an impact frankly on large New York City assets and a much more direct impact on financing costs for typical conduit product where today that market have gotten rather efficient, and you don't see a lot of conduit loans in New York City because they're all large loans either single assets or they're sort of dominant pieces of bigger securitizations.", "I do think debt dislocation, something we've been highlighting since the fall does create opportunity in our structured finance book and as sizing of senior loans changes due to higher costs and more conservative underwriting or less players in the market, it does generally improve the subordinate debt market and we're either taking less risk or able to charge more for our capital. So, I'd look for it to have more impact in the structured finance book than on New York City assets. But I think there's still a very robust commercial bank market, there is a robust CMBS market for large assets and I don't see risk retention really playing that much into those assets.", "Jordan Sadler", "Okay. That's fair. Thanks for the color.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors.", "Joseph Reagan", "Hi, guys. When you talked about leasing velocities slowing this year potentially, you mentioned big banks as one group but that might hit the pause bottom. Are you expecting a slowdown from the TAMI crowd as well and then as you kind of look out into 2017 and 2018, as you sit here today, you mentioned the back half of the year could be tough. I mean, just generally speaking, are you expecting a continued slowdown in the rent velocity environment going into 2017 and 2018?", "Steven Durels", "Well, I think it's hard to predict whether it's going to be where \u2013 which industry will experience any kind of slowdown. I think the big banks in particular, the investment banks, we haven't seen them grow in the market obviously. We've seen them lease space in the market. And they're in the market right now, but mostly through consolidations or because they're attending to lease explorations.", "And being able to, quite frankly, forecast where I think any other industry is going to see any slowdown, I don't think I've got that crystal ball. I can only say that as we sit here today, every one of those industries whether it'd be financial advertising TAMI, the whole the biggest sectors in the market, we've got deal flow from those sectors. But I think only time is going to tell as to who feels the pain and if there's a slowdown at all.", "Joseph Reagan", "So sort of underpinning your kind of outlook for job growth later this year is kind of more of a broad-based impact?", "Steven Durels", "Yeah. I think that's a big view on a 400 million square foot market, what it does to the overall leasing market and how are we suited to be able to respond to that. And the reality is we've got very little vacancy. We've got a year of very little lease expirations. So we're well-defended to handle whatever happens in the marketplace and we're forward-looking by really attending to a lot of our 2017 expirations as we sit here today.", "Joseph Reagan", "Okay. Thanks. And you guys mentioned a tougher underwriting environment for lower quality assets and buildings with execution risk. Couldn't that make the bidding tenant pricing environment for doing a JV deal on One Vanderbilt tougher? And then how much do you think, if you were to compare, say, your suburban assets versus say an opportunistic deal in Manhattan in terms of kind of vulnerability on pricing \u2013 any comments you can make there?", "Marc Holliday", "I don't \u2013 I'm not sure I understood the second part of the question, Jed. But as it relates to the ability to JV One Vanderbilt, I think it's going to have an excellent reception and I think we'll be successful there. And I think that people are excited by the asset and most of the calls continue to be inbound. I don't know what the suburban asset opportunistic, I didn't follow that.", "Joseph Reagan", "No. I'm just trying to sort of parse out if you're saying that kind of lower quality, kind of lower opportunistic deals might be under more pressure in terms of underwriting expectations. Which area do you think is more vulnerable, say, a suburban portfolio that you own or a deal with hair on it in Manhattan?", "Marc Holliday", "Yeah. I mean, so \u2013 I don't know \u2013 there's no deals we own with hair on it. So I mean, I can't \u2013 that's a hard one to answer. I would say that there's generally core and non-core. Non-core is not hairy deals. It's just not of the highest caliber of trophy deals. So there you may see IRRs widen out to 50 basis points, 75 basis points, 100 basis points, I said that earlier. Suburban portfolio I wouldn't extrapolate anything to that because they never participated really in the uptick. I don't think they're going to participate in the down tick. That's a very sort of steady state market. So, I don't think anything we've talked about the data would extrapolate to the suburbs.", "Joseph Reagan", "So you wouldn't expect a similar widening of IRR expectations on the suburbs?", "Marc Holliday", "No.", "Joseph Reagan", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the question-and-answer portion of today's conference. I'd like to turn the call back over to our host.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. Thank you very much. And we will look forward to speaking again after the first quarter is done.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation.

Thank you.", "I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.", "Marc Holliday", "Thank you. And, it's an absolutely glorious day here in New York City. The sun is shining and the stock is up, and we're glad you joined us for our first quarter earnings call. Andrew Mathias is back in the saddle and with us today after this surgery. And, we look forward to answering all of your questions. But, first a few comments on the quarter and the outlook for New York City market. Our Q1 results by any measure were outstanding and indicative of our company there is firing on all cylinders. But, in my count, we've done over 70 of these earnings calls since IPO and they were none that I can remember with the earnings results, we're so complete and so satisfying.", "On this past December 7, we set out for ourselves a host of intentionally challenging and specific goals and objectives with the hope and expectation of meeting all of them in 2016. On January 27 of this year, against global market headwinds, we reaffirmed our guidance evidencing the confidence we have in our company, ourselves, our market to continuously deliver superior results on both in absolute and relative basis. This is because our discerning approach to investing in assets with significant growth opportunity and the constant recycling of our portfolio enables us to generate market leading earnings growth while also assembling the highest quality property portfolio in New York City.", "These activities have resulted in a steadily increasing funds from operations from just a $1.70 per share in our first year of being listed on the stock exchange to a normalized amount of approximately $7 per share estimated for the 2016, a rate of growth that is unsurpassed in our industry sector. Overall, New York City remains extremely solid, notwithstanding the dislocations we saw in the financial sector in December, January and the first half of February, volatility that has since leveled off.", "New York is often perceived to be heavily dependent upon the financial services sector for jobs and office space demand. The reality however is that New York is by far the most compelling, diversified and resilient commercial property market in the country, possibly the world's and continues to attract businesses, and investment capital notwithstanding where we are at any one point in time in the market cycle. Further New York City dependence on the financial services industry has been reduced as other industry segments have proliferated such as media, technology, education, and healthcare. In fact, the financial services industry's contribution to incremental leasing absorption, has fallen in recent years from 34% of square footage leased to 24% of square footage leased over the last five years, thereby, reducing the occupancy risk if that sector were shed jobs, though we have not witnessed any material shutting.", "Population, tourism, and job growth continue in New York City, with industry profiles more diversified and less reliant on any one sector than ever before. The first quarter numbers coming out of the Bureau of Labor Statistics was surprisingly strong for the first quarter as New York City added net new 38,000 private sector jobs, 11,000 of which were in the office using sectors of business services, fire, the fire sector, and information, and that's just in the first three months.", "Obviously, if that pace continues into the second quarter, the city would have to revisit its 2016 forecast, for a private sector job creation, which was reduced by then to a still healthy total of 50,000 net new jobs earlier in the year, when they \u2013 when they revised that number. But as I said earlier, almost all of that job creation has been experienced just in the three months. While the city estimate is lower than the record-setting growth rate for the last five years, millions of square feet of positive office space absorption are still expected, and we have come out of the gate strong in 2016, with 850,000 square feet of Manhattan office leases signed in the first quarter alone, at a remarkable 39% cash rent mark-to-market. Furthermore in the first 21 days of April, just three weeks, we have leased an additional 72,000 square feet of Manhattan office space and the near-term leasing pipeline is similarly growing with 1.3 million square feet of Manhattan leases in active leasing negotiations out for signature or advanced stages of term sheets.", "We are also very pleased to see that asset values in New York continue to hold up from their record levels in 2015 and demand from both domestic and international equity investors and commercial lenders remained strong, as evidenced by recent activity which exceeds $6 billion so far, notwithstanding the market pause that we saw in January and February.", "Investors will be more discerning this year and certain asset classes like residential condominium projects, hotel and land will see values fall as investors concentrate on well-located income producing assets with embedded growth opportunity, the kind of assets that dominate SL Green's portfolio. Non-core or transitional office assets may see some downward pricing pressure but as money continues to flow, the quality, Manhattan commercial assets, it is likely that their values will remain relatively steadfast.", "From an overall investment capital perspective, we are seeing a continued flow of money from foreign investors, sectors that we'd highlighted over the past few months and on the last call, Japan, China, Korea, Germany, Canadian money and still money coming from Middle East. These are investors and nations that regard New York as the safest and most attractive place to invest and diversify their holdings. A number of overnight reports made reference to our Q1 results being evidenced of a solid New York City market, and certainly that is a major contributing factor, but the much bigger story in my opinion is the way, in which we have positioned SL Green to be dominant force with this market and sector and to drive earnings and increases in shareholder equity, while running an aggressive \u2013 investment grade portfolio and investment grade balance sheet that represents less than 40% loan to value on a consolidated basis.", "We've strategically fortified our company by upgrading and diversify our portfolio through selective acquisitions and dispositions, expanding business lines, but within our market and by operating a portfolio with a focus on long-term leases, high occupancy levels, lower annual lease roll and high credit quality tenants.", "Despite our many successes, one significant frustration that we share with all of our investors is a stock price that does not merely reflect those accomplishments, does not correspond to the current value of our underlying assets, and undervalues the substantial additional growth embedded in our portfolio. For our shareholders, we will work relentlessly to illuminate value, continue our earnings progression, invest opportunistically, manager our liabilities and build substantial liquidity.", "I want to thank you, and we'll open it up it for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Manny Korchman with Citi. You may begin.", "Manny Korchman", "Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Marc, if we just look at the \u2013 the forecast and the actual job creation, do you think they were just sort of light on the forecast and maybe do you have any idea of why they would have been in light of the forecast early in the year, was it just scare because of volatility or were there other deeper trends going on and now you think that those have abated a little bit?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I think that there's \u2013 the environment as it's played out was probably different than when the forecasts were being made and they might have been a little too conservative going into it. So, we'll see how it plays out, the year is only three months over. But I think, they were looking at downward estimates of GDP, they were looking at what the effect of the minimum, $15 minimum wage was going to have on jobs in the city.", "And I think that they \u2013 you have to \u2013 remember at 50,000 jobs it's still by most accounts an extraordinary \u2013 extraordinarily high number. So, I don't think they were looking at it as being conservative or fearful or concerned. I think that was maybe misinterpreted on this call three months ago, that a 50,000 job creation number in the private sector, is somehow a number that is \u2013 has a negative connotation to it, the contrary it's a strong number.", "Now, will the city exceed that, clearly if it stays on the path it's on, it will not just exceed it, it will blow it away. But these things have a seasonality profit to it, and you have to let more than three months past, to see exactly where things level off. But clearly sitting here, through what hopefully was \u2013 will be the worst part of the market for us, having seen that kind of robustness not only evidenced in the jobs numbers, but in the leasing statistics, gives us much better confidence as we sit here today.", "Manny Korchman", "And then maybe switching to One Vanderbilt, I was hoping if you could give us an update on where you are in discussions for both the JV on that project and construction financing and maybe a leasing update as well if you have anything?", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. Let's cover One Vanderbilt. So, we will bring in Steve and Andrew and others as part of the conversation, but I just want to lead it off by saying, in general I want everyone on the phone to understand this is a spectacular project that has been extraordinarily well received by lenders, brokers, perspective tenants and perspective JV partners. There is an intense amount of scrutiny for this one investment and understandably, because it's a large development but, I would say to you that, this is going to be the premier project, probably in the city, maybe the world, when this is completed. That's how we feel about this project, and that's the kind of feedback we've got in from every single player we have presented this to.", "Now in terms of the financing, the financing is going exceedingly well, we still are on track for what we hope will be a closing in completion by the end of this summer, which is what we said on the last call. And then following that we will focus in on equity capitalizations from JV partners, understanding that we get called daily on this, we have a queue of potential interested investors that's not measured in the \u2013 that doesn't and its measured in the 50 to 100.", "And it's a matter of us being very deliberate about -- going about this very long-term project and make sure we get it exactly right and the first order of business is the financing and completion of the demolition and the beginning of excavation, which starts this summer, the finalization of our marketing materials which are spectacular and which many of our investors will get to see in December and then getting out on the road and finding the right equity investor for us, we're committed to finding a partner for this project, I'm confident, we will have more than one party to choose from at the end of the day and we'll be basically just bidding terms for who we think brings the most of the table, beyond just capital at the end of the day.", "So, with that, let me turn over to Steve on the leasing side, what do you \u2013 what's your update there?", "Steven Durels", "We are presenting the building on a very regular basis to tenants. It gets rave reviews at the end of every presentation. I don't think, we've ever been involved with the project, where the presentation to perspective tenants is so well received. Our single greatest challenges quite frankly is that, we're five years out as far as being able to deliver.", "So, that's very early in the timeline for tenants to be able to make decisions, notwithstanding that, we've presented this building to significant size tenants, if not once a week, sometimes as many as two times to three times a week. The majority of those tenants are either financial service related type businesses or very high-end international headquarters type companies. And I think that as \u2013 as time will tell but we have three tenants or four tenants that are doing active diligence on the building and I feel personally very, very confident about where we stand in the lease of process.", "Manny Korchman", "Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets. You may begin.", "John Kim", "Thank you. You accomplished 43% of your full year Manhattan leasing target in the first quarter alone. I'm just wondering, if there was any particular tipping point in the market or change in your strategy that basically open the flood gate?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, any change in strategy, I don't think there was a change in strategy, I think that there were a number of things that came together for us in some cases early, in some cases accelerated in future years. Credit Suisse, exercising renewal options for 170,000 somewhat square feet at 11 Madison was unexpected and not modeled than a huge boost, I think a positive sentiment on the market, huge boost for the asset, and I think it really cements exactly the reason why we think 11 Madison is as great as it is. And we had a very significant pipeline going into the first quarter. You heard me say that on the last call and a lot of it converted. And see if I don't know at least \u2013 no change in strategy per say just pre-leasing.", "Unidentified Participant", "No. Not at all. I think that's the point. We had a very full pipeline of not just perspective tenants. But since the fourth quarter of last year, we've had a significant number of leases that have either been ready for execution or have been in advanced stage of negation. And the stars aligned and we ended up converting a bunch of those transactions over and the good news behind that is that even with those conversions we've been able to refill that pipeline.", "John Kim", "There were some local reports that asking rents had declined in certain buildings, does that help you cause at all?", "Marc Holliday", "I don't think that had anything to do with Q1. There are two buildings or three buildings where we had pushed rents extremely hard, Tower 46, 10 East 53rd, and in those projects, we probably brought those back to $10 or so. So, well ahead of underwriting, but you don't really know where the market settles unless you push and then if you find you pushed a little too far than you recalibrate. That is excellent activity on those two projects, but I don't think that had anything to do with Q1.", "Unidentified Participant", "Yeah. And just to clarify some of that, the \u2013 where we adjusted some rents on those spaces that we had pushed rates ahead of \u2013 arguably ahead of the market, those adjustments were done on a select handful of spaces on only a few buildings. So, it was not all buildings and not all spaces by any special imaginations, in fact at the same times we had that we moderated some, we'd actually increased the rents on some of our other space. So, it's certainly got \u2013 that back out lost in the mix.", "John Kim", "Got it. And my second question is on One Vanderbilt and if you've seen evidence of increase in construction cost, that seems like it's permeating throughout the city and if there is a risk that cost will elevate above a $1,000 per square foot that we put the....?", "Marc Holliday", "Where are you hearing increase in construction costs permeating throughout city?", "John Kim", "Various sources across all of asset types?", "Marc Holliday", "I would say to the contrary, our experience had been increased in construction costs leading up to let's say, middle or end of 2015. My expectation is, you're going to see a leveling off or in certain of the trades possibly a slight decrease in construction costs relative to what we had projected because anything for One Vanderbilt, we took kind of a trend line of increases, which was substantial and then like added 5% a year compounders on top of that and then significant contingency on top of that.", "So I mean, no, we're kind of set for whatever the market may bring, but I think that the reality maybe that we may catch or break here along with others building during this time period and over the next few years of possibly pricing that we hope we'll be right on target and maybe we can bring it inside. So, no, we don't see that.", "John, you have to remember, most of our vertical construction here is in 2018 and 2019, and I think if you sort of survey the trades now, there's a little bit of concern about how much of a backlog they're going to have for 2018 and 2019, whereas, they're very busy, very engaged now building out a lot of residential projects. There is some concern that on the backend to that, there may some excess capacity which we intent to take advantage of on pricing.", "John Kim", "Thanks.", "Marc Holliday", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from David Toti with BB&T. You may begin.", "David Toti", "Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just broadly, can you walk us through the acceleration of the 388 Greenwich deal and why that was moved up early, was that really sort of the buyer driving that or was it more of a call on the forward market conditions?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I would say that it was \u2013 the buyer probably had more of a desire than we did. From our perspective, the deal was inked, and whether it closed next year or this year and we collect the earnings now or over time. I think, we were somewhat indifferent. I think we had heard a message from certain shareholders that now better than later, the economics make sense. But I would say that we were equally happy or really to go along with the mid-year, end of year closer as scheduled. So I would say more or less there were certain advantages probably for the buyer in this case, which drove the transaction for us. It worked out [Technical Difficulty]", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, please remain on your line, your conference call will resume momentarily. Once again, please remain on your line, your conference call will resume momentarily. Thank you.", "David Toti", "Does this mean I get to ask an extra question?", "Operator", "Once again, ladies and gentlemen, please remain on your line, you conference call will resume momentarily. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, please remain on your line, you conference call will resume momentarily.", "You may begin.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. David, did we cover your question there or we've got dropped \u2013 the line dropped.", "David Toti", "You did. I was sort of hoping again an extra question though.", "Marc Holliday", "No. So, follow-up the question.", "David Toti", "Just one more actually, which is more of a strategic question for you Marc, and obviously you're still pretty bullish on Metro New York City and confident about the market fundamentals. If we were to go into a weaker market conditions and we can sort of leave that open ended. How would your capital recycling strategy changed in the context of maybe lower rent growth or less sort of investor demand, would we seek significant shifts in activity?", "Marc Holliday", "It's hard to say, Dave. I mean, we are the most active capital recyclers, right, by far. We sell, certainly, by number of properties more in a year than any of our re-peers. So, I guess the question is, if the market outlook worsens, how would that affect sale? I guess, to the extent, the market for sale is still there, but our outlook is worse than other investors, then you would continue to sell. I mean, that would be the natural inclination.", "If everyone is on the same issue, then it becomes harder to sell, so your sales volume may take a pause until the margin gets better. So, we typically look at things when a property is ready for sale. We feel it's matured to a level that it's right to be harvested. It doesn't have any further strategic value for us or the ability to drive NOI over a five-year to 10-year period is below the average trend line for the portfolio. We will be much more readily desirous of either selling or JV-ing that asset, and we do that constantly. I mean, we do it annually and we do it inside.", "So, I think if \u2013 we'll continue to do that. I guess the answer to your question would be, we'll continue to do it provided the market is there to do it, sometimes, the market isn't there. But right now, it's excellent. There's a lot of demand for New York assets. I'd say, as much demand is there was last year, the demand has just shifted as I said in my remarks. I think it's a little more discerning. I think it's really focused in highly on quality and income producing assets. It's in our sweet spot. So, we are actively pursuing sale and JV opportunities.", "David Toti", "Okay. Thanks for the detail today.", "Marc Holliday", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. You may begin.", "Anthony Paolone", "All right. Thanks. Good afternoon and nice quarter. First question is, with regards to the proceeds from the city sale, should we think about that as a permanent reduction in debt, as we start to think about 2017 estimates, now that this will have a full impact on next year or will these proceeds be used to make other investments. How do you think about it?", "Matthew DiLiberto", "Hey, Tony. It's Matt. So, we are going to use the proceeds from the sale for debt reduction unequivocally. In the interim, we are going to pay down our revolving credit facility and then in November, we are going to repay the $450 million mortgage on Lexington, which opens up for a repayment in November, that's a 5.6% debt position. So, it is going to use it for debt reduction.", "Anthony Paolone", "Okay. Thanks. And then I guess, second question for you. If I just look at your first quarter, the buck 85 times or 740 high and apples-to-apples, you've guided $7, I know relative to arm or you kind of beat us on almost every line item, like what roles are off in the next few quarters here?", "Matthew DiLiberto", "Yeah. In the first quarter Tony, we had $0.12 from write-off of that that was in the first quarter, that's not replicable in the second quarter, third quarter or fourth quarter, $0.07 from the repayment of the debt position. We would recognize that $0.07 over the course of the year, it was accelerated in the first quarter. We also had $0.05 of \u2013 one of our favorite topic says $1.41 income, of a 11 Madison that's attributable to 2015 that was in our guidance number, but again, it comes during the first quarter not for the remainder.", "And as I look through other line items, lease termination income of $3.6 million is a couple of million dollars higher than you otherwise project for each coming quarter. So based on that, we said $0.05 given only three months of activity so far is a pretty healthy race and that's where we ended up.", "Anthony Paolone", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. You may begin.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Hey, good afternoon. Two questions, first Mark, in your opening comments, I think talked about you guys focused on relentlessly growing earnings at the same time closing the NAV gap. Given the demand in the market that you spoke about, what's your appetite for maybe sacrificing earnings growth in favor of selling or crystallizing some of that NAV discount?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I think that's what you're seeing in this first quarter and probably for most of the second half of last year, was the continued illumination of value typically at prices that we see are well ahead of analysts and shareholder models, that bear out I think the NAVs that, I think are intuitive to people, we show it in December investor what the implied NAV looks like at market cap rates. You folks on the sell side have your own NAVs which average about a $135 per share. Through your models and many of our investors are at that level and higher.", "So I think that we continue to illuminate that value through sales and we'll do that often. I think we've shown an extraordinary ability to one, recycle that capital into a very profitable undertakings and two, at this point in time, the recycling is less necessary because we have so much extraordinary embedded growth in the remainder of the growth portfolio in our retail portfolio and just through mark-to-market of our stabilized office portfolio. You don't need to do a lot of investing, if you are marking to market on a cash rent basis, well into the double-digit and you're leasing up retail assets like we did with Armani, like we did with McDonalds, like we did with Nordstrom at rents that are in X percent higher, their multiples higher 2 times, 3 times , 4 times what the expiring rent was.", "So, we have that kind of embedded earnings velocity that will carry us through 2016 and 2017 and beyond without incremental investment, but obviously, we are \u2013 we do look for an incremental investments from time to time.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Then Marc, if I understand you though. So, you are saying that if you guys accelerate disposition, the embedded growth in the mark-to-market in the growth portfolio is enough that you guys could still have positive FFO growth even if you sell more assets than you plan?", "Marc Holliday", "Yeah. I think the answer is generally yes because we've done it almost every year. But I don't want to make any statements now about 2017 because we don't have 2017 guidance out on the street. But I think you can sort of look back to the history of the company over last 19 years and draw your own conclusion from that. But we are not making now statements about 2017 or beyond, we'll do that later in the year.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay. Second question is for Durels.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. Go on.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay. So, you guys leased about 850,000 square feet in the first quarter versus 2.5 all last year. The beginning of this year, the market sentiment was that everyone was on the sidelines pause given the volatility in the capital markets and yet obviously, leasing was very strong. So can you just help us understand the disconnect that sometimes we hear capital markets are upset and therefore tenants are on the sidelines not leasing space and yet clearly they were out leasing space in the midst of some pretty rough capital market activity?", "Steven Durels", "Well, I'm not certain there is a correlation between the capital markets and the fundamentals of the leasing market per se, but the \u2013 just to start with couple of data points. One is we've said for the last couple of quarters that we've had a very full pipeline of transactions. Two that pipeline had a great deal of diversity in the types of tenants that we were talking about. Three the feedback that we get from our tenants and perspective tenants as to how they view the health of their business and the hiring prospects and therefore, the rents \u2013 the space demands have really not moderated at all over the past year, even as we sit here today, which would explain why even in the face of doing 800,000 square feet we've been able to then replenish the pipeline.", "So I sort of think that there is a \u2013 there was a lot of uncertainty in the market that people hadn't thought we're in the future health, but the reality is our tenants are still feeling very strong about where their business is, how it's performing, where their hiring is and therefore how much space they need.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. You may begin.", "Steve Sakwa", "Thanks. I guess first question to follow up on the leasing. Maybe Steve, could you talk a little bit about price points, and just where you're seeing the activity, my understanding is that the really, really high end of the market has really kind of taken a pause, maybe north of a $125 a foot. I'm just wondering if you could comment on kind of where your pipeline sits today in terms of price point, and have you experienced that \u2013 that same thing. And then I just I wanted to follow up on the mezz book, when you're finished?", "Steven Durels", "No, I really haven't seen any \u2013 any moderation on the deal volume on \u2013 on the high price point part of the market or any other part of the market quite frankly. And maybe the best example of that. Although I don't have a lot of products that have currently have a vacancy at a $125 or above, but I do have a plenty of product that's $80, $90, $100 kind of space, and maybe the two best examples of that, and where we're seeing transactional volumes, 10 East 53rd Street and Tower 46. 10 East 53rd Street, I'm \u2013 I'm enthusiastic as I said to Marc and Andrew yesterday. Yesterday alone, we converted five tenants over to leases out.", "So all of a sudden that building, which is a $80 to $90 to a $100 kind of product is like on fire. And Tower 46, which is the Side Street, great quality product with side street location. Although, we haven't a signed a lot of deals there yet, we have a tremendous amount of perspective tenants coming through and are trading term sheets, with a number of very significant tenants at big rents in the mid $90 to a $100 price point. So we're feeling very bullish about the prospects for that building. And I think those are two very good parameters about the strength of the overall market, even at the very high price point.", "Steve Sakwa", "Okay. And I guess, I noticed that the mezz book did come down by several hundred million dollars. And I'm just wondering, is there a strategy at all to try and take that book down? I know there's been some investors that have been a big concerned about that. And well, I think it can be a lumpy quarter-to-quarter, but just kind of what your thoughts on making new investments there and how you think about payoffs and maybe shrinking that book?", "Steven Durels", "It's definitely, it's more quarter-to-quarter movements than any kind of strategy to reduce the book. To the contrary, we have a very active pipeline right now of investments. We did sell and syndicate a bunch of investments in the first quarter, so that brought it down and \u2013 but, not representative to any sort of a broader corporate strategy. We're still very dedicated to that business.", "Steve Sakwa", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from John Guinee with Stifel. You may begin.", "John Guinee", "Great. Thank you. In 11 Madison Avenue, I think you bought that about a year ago, you had a while until it got to be stabilized. I think you've partitioned it into some candid and common positions, so that you may or may not be able to monetize a sellout a JV position? Where you are on 11 Madison?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, 11 is \u2013 we've owned it now, I think for about nine months. The Sony work is done and the tenant has moved in. I mentioned earlier, Credit Suisse exercised its renewals for the two floors that we could have got back, won't be getting back, that represented a very substantial mark-to-market. There is I think one space remaining about half a floor, if I'm correct, that we have significant activity on, and I would hoping in the next \u2013 in the near term, we'll go to lease on that vacant space, at which point the building will be basically fully leased at rents that average like $70 a foot in a market that is north $90 foot. So it's worked out excellent, it's got long-term debt in place. We will talk to investors that was something we had talked about setting up a JV for future years, stabilization of that meaning full rent paying is still about, I would say plus or minus 18 months to 24 months off.", "So I think the maximum execution for something like that could be end of this year, maybe next year. In that regard, it's not part of our guidance, but it's there as a store house of cash and liquidities we can monetize, in the future to use for either for debt repayment or new acquisitions in the future. And by doing so, there is a little to no tax gain, the way we structured by selling that JV interest so that is one of those sort of well-structured deals and a deal that will be a little bit more opportunistic in our timing for generating those funds and redeploying those funds or for paying down debt.", "John Guinee", "Great. And then a follow-up question for Steve Durels, the headline is 39% rental rate increase $71 number. I guess, that means is coming off to $50 base. Can you give a little more color as to how, how sausage is made, what sort of a OpEx reset you'd have or base year reset you have? And what $71 would look like on a net basis? And then what sort of leasing commissions you should factor into that equation?", "Steven Durels", "So to just make sure we got the question, John. The question is on a $71 gross rent and just so I'm clear, where does the $71 come from? That's what...", "Marc Holliday", "Average starting rent.", "Steven Durels", "Average starting rent.", "John Guinee", "Average starting rate in place for the portfolio or no?", "Steven Durels", "No.", "Marc Holliday", "No.", "Steven Durels", "No. For the quarter.", "John Guinee", "For the quarter?", "Steven Durels", "Yeah.", "John Guinee", "Okay. And then of that $71, how much is \u2013 what kind of expenses and taxes go against that?", "Andrew Mathias", "Well, what's happening here is you're going from $51 full service to $71, your operating expenses are moving around in that equation. And I'm curious as to what the \u2013 is that rent is going from where to where and then also...", "Matthew DiLiberto", "Just \u2013 hey, John. Yeah, Andrew makes the point, the $51, we don't \u2013 other people quote like the nominal rent.", "John Guinee", "Yeah.", "Matthew DiLiberto", "We don't do that.", "John Guinee", "Okay.", "Matthew DiLiberto", "The $51 is as escalated.", "John Guinee", "Okay.", "Matthew DiLiberto", "So the $51 is base rent plus OpEx plus real estate tax. And when we say the rent is going from, I'm just using your numbers, can I have those in front of me, $51 to $71, that $20 increase is bottom-line. There is no expenses against the $20 because whatever Ops and taxes against it are in the $51, the $71 is the new rent, the cash mark-to-market is $20, that's all bottom-line stuff Matt, yes?", "Andrew Mathias", "Yes.", "Marc Holliday", "So that to be clear, we don't mark new rents to old base rents in which case you have to ask the question you just asked, this is better and more transparent, we're using fully escalated rents and then marking against that.", "Matthew DiLiberto", "And then the $71 generally comes with base year operating and taxes, starting roughly this year. So you pick up right where you left off in terms of escalate.", "Marc Holliday", "Right. So we're completely inflation protected on the $71 going forward.", "John Guinee", "Is it too much of a stretch to say going from 51 to 71 is a $20 increase in net rents or a $15 increase in net rents?", "Matthew DiLiberto", "I think, it's $20.", "John Guinee", "Fair enough. Thanks.", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Jamey Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may begin.", "Jamie Feldman", "Thank you. I'm hoping to just get more color on the transaction market. Mark, you had commented that pricings are holding firm. Can you just provide some more anecdotal evidence of what's going on out there in terms of deals we may see in the market in pricing or buyers that are lining up?", "Marc Holliday", "Sure. And I think, you saw 1285 sixth then the 787 Seventh close, so those were the two large transactions sort of from the end of fourth quarter. And then, there are a number of assets, an asset went to contract earlier this week on Wall Street that was market rate residential, that cap rate has a free handle on it, that's to the U.S opportunity fund. We've had a number of retail assets that are in the market that are drawing very strong bids, one of which on Fifth Avenue was reportedly under contract. So, that's not and I don't think, it's been publically announced yet.", "Matthew DiLiberto", "Yeah. There is probably in total about $6 billion to $8 billion worth of assets on the market now, some of those are going to be straight trades of office building, some large recaps both in midtown and downtown.", "Marc Holliday", "And then you saw in Brooklyn the watch tower portfolio go under contract, that's a large tract of land and an off commercial building, which is a complete redevelopment from sort of industrial space to office space as a plan, that drew very wide competition in pricing that pushed up to a level that I think exceeded the initial expectations in the market.", "Matthew DiLiberto", "Right.", "Jamie Feldman", "Okay. And then in terms of the buyers and their financing, is it still a more equity buyers, are you seeing leverage, what are the capital sources?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I mean CMBS has come back and AAA spreads are in the $130s now from a wide of I'll call it $170s. So, I think CMBS is viable again. And there are a bunch of a CMBS deals are getting done currently in the city, but the bank market continues to be very active both syndicated loans, and bridge and bridge transitional loans. So it's a \u2013 it's a mix, I would say.", "Jamie Feldman", "Okay. And then my second question for Steve Durels, a couple of years ago you made the comment that there would be a premium for large blocks of the market, can you talk about what you're seeing today? And as we are seeing more blocks come in the market, just sensing your perspective on whether do you think that's a risk to the market or do you think that there is a still a premium for those kinds of space?", "Steven Durels", "I think there is a still a premium in all reality because if you're a tenant who goes out, looking for a couple of hundred thousand square feet and you need that space, relatively a reasonable timeline is the next 12 months to 18 months, 24 months. Your availabilities, your selections are pretty thin because not all of the blocks are created equal either because of geographic or space quality or price point or delivery timeline, whatever it maybe. So if you \u2013 if a tenant try to lease lot of these type of blocks as opposed to the landlord turnaround, saying I'm going to lease it floor by floor. I think \u2013 I think I would still expect to see a premium on the \u2013 on the bigger block.", "Jamie Feldman", "Okay. And then do you see heightened risk of sub-lease base going on the market here?", "Steven Durels", "No, I don't. And if you look statically, we're at the low end historically of sub-lease availability, even the most recent stats that have come out from various brokerage houses, I think it's like a 1.7% or something like that. It's \u2013 it's not very, very modest and quite frankly with the phenomenon of densification in the market, even if we were to hit a rocky point, where tenants laid off employees, it becomes very difficult for a tenant, they then put space on the sub-lease market because they've had so many people into their spaces. So I don't see it near term, and I'm \u2013 don't see any indictors to suggest that is an issue to worry about for the balance of this year.", "Jamie Feldman", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Ross Nussbaum with UBS. You may begin.", "Ross Nussbaum", "Hey, good afternoon. [Indiscernible]. Marc, can you talk about one of your goals, or actually I think it was two of your goals from the Investor Day last December, were relating to acquisitions of both office and retail, and I think in total you had over a billion combined of office and retail acquisitions in the goal category for this year, now that we're almost four months through the year, how do you feel about that goal, I guess in relation to the current state affairs in New York and the volatility that we're seeing in the capital markets?", "Marc Holliday", "I didn't listen that last piece you said, given the volatility of the capital markets?", "Ross Nussbaum", "Yeah, I'm just curious of the state of affairs in the world over the last four months, have they shifted the goalposts for those original goals that you put out?", "Marc Holliday", "Got you. Okay. So, we just clarify one thing upfront on the acquisition targets, which we said on the last call and said in December Investor Day, I want to say it again now. Those goals that were originally set forth as we \u2013 as they always are when we put those goals forth, our growth targets. So, it doesn't account for deals we do in joint venture. So I can give you an example, there is a residential asset that we're looking at in pipeline, very good off market kind of situation, where we might be anywhere between call it roughly a third to half the asset, if that thing turns out and not \u2013 I remember \u2013 well, won't. That would be a gross value even though, A, our share, it would be for less and B, joint ventures tend to have secured debts, so the equity component of the JV of an asset tends to be quite small.", "So when people hear a $1 billion, $1.5 billion of investment activity in equity and that's the wrong way to think. The equity component that a $1 billion, $1.5 billion is far, far less, that's A. B, I would say four months into the year, the office goal is probably something we'll reassess the year possibly downward because we certainly don't have a pipeline now that comes anywhere close to that number but the way these things go, the assets in New York are big, a deal could pop up second half of the year or towards the end of the year, that might be of a size to make some kind of dent nickel, but it's not \u2013 right now our focus has really been on the things we've talked about, which is consummation of the city deal that's done, certain sales in JV s that we are out there in the market, which then have made good progress with today and we'll continue to work on that through the balance of the year. There is a pipeline of some retail resi and office asset that could or could not come together between now and the end of the year. If we do, they will be deals that we think are going to be highly accretive to value in earnings in the future or else in a market like this, we would \u2013 we would be more discerning as our other investors. So we're only looking for deals that we think have high value-add for somebody like us in this market.", "But I would say the office component is probably something that could come in less than originally budgeted. The retail, too early to say, it's only April, I won't even make any assessments there. Because the number for resi REIT I think was $500 million in total. So $500 million in total, if the $50 million JV, it's $250 million if delivered, that's a hundred and some odd million dollars of investment. You could do that like \u2013 you could do that in December. I couldn't sit here in April and predict it, but I can say there is nothing near-term in pipeline that would have us reaching those goals anytime in the next quarter.", "Nick Yulico", "Hi, hey, it's Nick. I just had a question on the Omnicom renewal. So I guess, there is still over 300,000 square feet that Omnicom did not renew. Could you remind us where in the building those floors are and what are your plans there, there was some talk I guess there was an article the other day about, how you're exploring selling a condo interest in that \u2013 in that space, could you just give us an update on what's going on there?", "Marc Holliday", "Sure, the article was a little premature, but the reality is that we're in very advanced discussions in negotiation of a transaction with a tenant for a leasehold condominium. So it's not a sale of a condominium perpetuity, it's a leasehold condominium which has a finite life toward of 30 years. And that transaction is expected to close in the next several months, it's really just subject to a couple of outstanding approvals. But that will take care of the lion share of the Omnicom space which is over 300,000 square feet.", "I think the second thing to note about that is that \u2013 and it's a good segue into the following fact which is of that 300,000 square feet that will knock off a big chunk of our 2017 lease expirations of which we've already signed almost 460,000 square feet of leases for 2017 and have another 500,000 square feet including in this deal we just talked about in active negotiation. So we're way-way ahead as far as being able to knock down our 2017 expirations.", "Nick Yulico", "That's helpful. And just quickly I mean and understanding you may now want to give sort of full economics. But how do you \u2013 how do we sort of think about the sort of economic impact here?", "Marc Holliday", "Nick, we're going to have to move on from that question, we're not in a position to discuss more than what Steve just said on the phone. Unfortunately. But...", "Nick Yulico", "Okay. Thanks.", "Marc Holliday", "...hopefully by next quarter...", "Nick Yulico", "Soon enough.", "Marc Holliday", "...soon up. Yeah. Hopefully. Sorry.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Jon Petersen with Jefferies. You may begin.", "Jon Petersen", "Great. Thank you. I'm just curious if you can talk about the \u2013 obviously the leasing in the quarter was very strong, 850,000 square feet. I believe at the \u2013 in our Investor Day guidance was for 2.2 million square feet for the rest of the year. So, I was just hoping to get a little more context on, I know you didn't update your full year leasing guidance, but how should we think about this quarter and kind of what it implies for the remaining three quarters of the year?", "Matthew DiLiberto", "Well, it was a very \u2013 is an excellent start to the year. Obviously, we're trending ahead. We'll reevaluate probably at the next call and if there is any cause for guidance shift. I think we'll evaluate then. We certainly don't do it quarter-to-quarter and we'll see how thing bare out, but obviously I did mention there is a $1.3 million of pipeline. So, if we have a great second quarter and convert very high ratio of that $1.3 million, then we may have to look at that stat for upward revision.", "Jon Petersen", "All right.", "Matthew DiLiberto", "The goal would be the \u2013 $2.0 million to be declared.", "Jon Petersen", "Oh, $2.0 million. Okay. Then you are even closer. So, and just one other question, I mean we touched a little bit on retail. I'm curious what your thoughts are on rent industry retail in Manhattan, especially in the major corridors, Fifth Avenue, Times Square. Just kind of what your thoughts are on the durability in the growth of those over the next couple of years?", "Marc Holliday", "What we're seeing and experiencing is durability for sure. I think growth in retail rent has moderated in certain submarket Fifth Avenue and I would say Time Square as well. That's after multiple, multiple years of very significant compounded growth in those rents.", "So, they are sort of leveled off, I would say, in those submarket, but then there are other submarkets in the city, Soho and Downtown particularly where we continue to see increases in rents.", "Jon Petersen", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. You may begin.", "Vincent Chao", "Hey, good afternoon, everyone. I think last quarter when you're talking about the pipeline of leasing, you noted that the mark-to-markets were pretty strong. I was just curious so that you can comment on a little bit on the pipeline, in terms of what kind of rental rates you're seeing in that pipeline, as well as the composition by industry and between new and renewal?", "Marc Holliday", "All I would say is, it's very healthy mark-to-market for the pipeline rents, in excess of our guidance, which I think was around 15% thereabouts. I would say that, incrementally that pipeline exceeds that mark-to-market. I would also say, it's not 39%. So, something in between.", "Vincent Chao", "Got it. And in terms of the \u2013 and sort of between new and renewal?", "Marc Holliday", "I'm sorry.", "Vincent Chao", "The sort out between new and renewal?", "Marc Holliday", "I don't know.", "Matthew DiLiberto", "On the mark-to-market.", "Marc Holliday", "I've had it in the past, I don't have that today. I think we got to get back to you on that, no, not on mark-to-market, just on pipeline.", "Vincent Chao", "All right.", "Marc Holliday", "How much is renewed, how much new? Give us a minute, we'll get it, we do have it and we'll come back to you. Okay?", "Vincent Chao", "Okay. And just maybe one other one if I could. I mean, it's a little bit maybe an odds with the contrary earlier about the type of the investor demand that you're seeing this year versus last. But you've sold a couple of suburban assets recently and it seems like the fundamentals there, have done pretty well, or looked pretty good for the last couple of quarters? I'm just curious, if there's an opportunity to do something larger?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I mean, there's opportunities to do something large. I don't know that it's a strategic goal of ours to do something larger. The market is good for the better suburban assets. We \u2013 the guys in white planes have done extraordinary job of bringing that portfolio to a level that's far in excess of the market. Those suburban markets are highly impaired generally in the Tristate area with 20% vacancy rates and our occupancy levels far better than that and our average rent levels far better than that.", "So, I think it's better for us as a company to take those assets sort of one-by-one and optimize and sell, there's no pressure, there's no, I don't see any pressure to something, I think, we should hold up a large size unless, unless we made extraordinary sense, but we like having that portfolio there to create longer term value with and continue to monetize and harvest as time goes on. I think, we've done an excellent job of stewardship on that portfolio as have the guys up in planes, and I think, we're reaping the awards for that now on some of these sales which had been occurring in 2015 and 2016.", "Matthew DiLiberto", "I'll just \u2013 just answer the first question of leases that we already have out for either signature or that are in active negotiation. The 650,000 square feet of new leases in negotiation and a 160,000 square feet of renewals. And then, I don't have the breakdown on the term sheets.", "Vincent Chao", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. You may begin.", "Blaine Heck", "Great. Thanks. So just following up on 388-390, I think, around the time, the city lease renewal was announced in early 2014, you guys estimated a 9.7% levered IRR for your holding period assuming that purchase option was executed in the period establish, so, I was wondering if you guys have run the math again, whether this early purchase agreement had any significant effect on that IRR?", "Matthew DiLiberto", "Yeah. The answer is yes. The 9%, 7%, or whatever the number you recorded, that was actually what I'll call yield towards which was an exercise at the end of 2020, I guess [indiscernible].", "Andrew Mathias", "Sometime in 2020. So by \u2013 so the way the deal is going down with an early exercise and the other components of that deal, the total IRR over, I think it's a nine-year period. So it's a nine-year annual compounded IRR of 10.9%.", "Blaine Heck", "Okay. Great. And then can you just give any update with regards to 1745 Broadway, last quarter it seemed as if though you might have something to announce by now?", "Matthew DiLiberto", "No, I mean, I think the \u2013 we continue to entertain offers on the asset, but nothing to announce \u2013 nothing to announce at this time and it's one of a number of assets we're exploring selling, but we're trying to optimize in terms of what we want to transacting or not.", "Blaine Heck", "Okay. Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question...", "Marc Holliday", "We're going to have to \u2013 operator, I think we'll go to 03:15 because usually, we try to keep these to an hour. It's a courtesy to our shareholders and analysts. So we'll take another maybe seven or eight minutes of questions.", "Operator", "Okay. Our next question is from Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. You may begin.", "Craig Mailman", "Hi, guys. Just curious Marc with the updated kind of first quarter numbers here, if your view of market rent growth in Manhattan has changed at all relative to kind of where you're trending on the 4Q call?", "Marc Holliday", "No. I think the call that I had last time, we had said the rent spike that people were putting 5%, 7%, 10%, we thought that the second half of the year you might see something more in the single digits. And I think I said something along the lines of 2%, 3%. And I think at least from a underwriting perspective that's what we're going to continue to use and broadcast just for the second half of this year. We have given no guidance for 2017 and beyond. I could see a scenario where is the market settles and this job growth continues a pace that you could get into growth rates higher than that beyond this year, sort of, I could see that definitely occurring, but we're not making that call now, I would say pretty much no change in guidance for a back half of the year in the kind of 2% and 3% up in rents.", "So, good with the emphasis being on up. I think there was again a misinterpretation by some on the last call that we had said down, there is no down, there is only up in our guidance and the question is up by how much?", "Craig Mailman", "Okay. That's helpful. Then, just secondly, I noticed the lease term is obviously went up from the leases in the first quarter, but anything else driving the rise in TIs this quarter?", "Marc Holliday", "I think the lease term probably went up as a result of the Credit Suisse.", "Matthew DiLiberto", "Yeah. 20-year...", "Marc Holliday", "The Credit Suisse is a 20-year lease.", "Matthew DiLiberto", "Yeah.", "Marc Holliday", "It's a function of \u2013 the ratio of how many leases that we do that are for new. First generation tenant is coming in to the portfolio as opposed to renewal deals. And frequently whether those \u2013 the length of the lease as opposed to whether it's a 15-year deal, 10-year deal, 5-year deal, that can drive the concession. So, there is no shift as far as the market goes. It's more function of \u2013 its variables of those specific transactions.", "Craig Mailman", "But I guess we're just looking TIs, look like they spiked the renewals kind of where the lion's share here. So, I'm just trying to reconcile those...", "Matthew DiLiberto", "So, when you say spike, let's just use exact number. So...", "Craig Mailman", "Well, you guys were \u2013 you guys were in the 50s on TIs this quarter, I think you were $17 last quarter.", "Matthew DiLiberto", "Yeah.", "Craig Mailman", "So Matt, can we look at that 10 points in deals, which is the bulk of the 50?", "Matthew DiLiberto", "Yeah, both. And we were 50 a couple quarters ago and 50 before that, I mean, it varies quarter-to-quarter and it's dependent on what buildings, at what rents or what term we're leasing space, so I think that's a pretty consistent trend across.", "If I look at one large \u2013 one large renewal that had a full package because it's a 20 year renewal is the CSP Eleven Madison. So, while it is considered a renewal because [indiscernible]", "Craig Mailman", "Okay.", "Matthew DiLiberto", "... 20 year, actually 21 year because that goes up to 2037, so they get a full package with that and that's 180,000 square feet.", "Marc Holliday", "Yeah. Just to be clear, that was pursuant to contractual option, not that \u2013 it was negotiated by us that way. Their renewal provides no downtime and a significant mark-to-market, but their option also provided for a TI package because it is a 20 year lease to somebody like Credit Suisse making a 20 year commitment to 180,000 feet is going to want to refresh this space, so I don't see that as a \u2013 it's not a shift in market trend because it was embedded within the lease document.", "Craig Mailman", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Brad Burke with Goldman Sachs. You may begin.", "Brad Burke", "Hi. Thanks for taking the question. And I wanted to ask on the big run, mark-to-market for the quarter. At your Investor Day, you brought up the embedded rent for the Credit Suisse space at $42 and you thought to normalized market rate for that space would be $87, so as we look at your lease spreads for the quarter, is it fair to say that, that was the big driver of the outsized result that you had?", "Marc Holliday", "No, no. This was really broad based. Matt can probably give you few other besides that one.", "Matthew DiLiberto", "Yeah. So, in addition to the Eleven Madison, mark-to-market. The Omnicom renewal at 220 East 42nd Street, about 167,000 square feet, had a mark-to-market even higher than that, north of 70%. And we also did a renewal at 100 Park, with a material mark-to-market, north of 30% there as well. So, it was very broad based. And even without those deals, that was a \u2013 we would be at approaching 20% mark-to-market, even excluding those three big ones [indiscernible].", "Marc Holliday", "Yeah. I don't think we \u2013 I don't think we did more than 20,000 square feet or 30,000 square feet of deals out of that 800,000 square feet that had a negative mark-to-market. Every other of the 800,000 square feet, every other transaction was positive mark-to-market in many \u2013 in most cases, obviously very, very substantial.", "Brad Burke", "Okay. So...", "Marc Holliday", "So, I think \u2013 do you have anything else, Brad?", "Brad Burke", "Yeah. And I guess, just the second one on the guidance, you're increasing it $0.05 per portfolio NOI and interest expense savings and I would assume that the interest expense savings is going to be more than $0.05, just by virtue of what you're going to be paying down over the course of the year. So, I was just hoping for better clarity on your expectations for property NOI, specifically versus the original guidance you gave in December?", "Marc Holliday", "That is much more property NOI than interest expense, if you look at what we're paying down in the short-term that is probably our lowest cost of debt capital because we're going to take the proceeds from 388 and repay our revolving our credit facility. We won't be repaying the \u2013 more expensive debt, the mortgage at 45 Lex until November or December. So, that benefit will really reap it's rewards in 2017.", "Brad Burke", "Okay. Thank you.", "Marc Holliday", "Thanks. We'll take one more \u2013 one last question, operator.", "Operator", "Our last question is from Joe Reagan with Green Street Advisors. You may begin.", "Joseph Reagan", "Thanks guys. And I think you've talked about getting debt to EBITDA down to about 7.5 times, 7.6 times, I believe perform of the city sale. I'm just wondering if that's still the right betting line for at the end of this year. And then, can you talk about your longer term debt to EBITDA target as we look out to 2017 and 2018?", "Marc Holliday", "Yeah. So, we are still on track for 7.6 times by year end as your first question. And that I think, on the math we've run is about a 30% \u2013 somewhere between the 35% to 37% debt to value on a consolidated basis, low 40s on a combined basis. And right within the strike zone of all the rating agencies. So, I think we will probably wind up taking it down further just based on \u2013 just based on \u2013 just based on how we're modeling not just the year, but some of our long-term plans going into next year and beyond and application of funds and while still keeping our early momentum.", "And I think it will allow us to reduce that further. Although I would say, when you get into that 7%, 7.5% range, we view the portfolio as a pretty much completely de-risked and de-levered, especially given the cap rate environment we operate at, which is typically between 3.5% and 4.5% cap rate environment. Debt to EBITDA, I think, is not the best model to use. I know you guys use it and that's the one you like.", "But there is also a notion of equity or embedded equity, which is more of a loan to value concept. And I think because New York is a very liquid market with anywhere between $40 billion to $70 billion year of transactions, you can't get a pretty good handle on the NAV, I know you guys carry a pretty high NAV for the company relative to where the stock price is. And if you look at the debt on a \u2013 debt to, I'll call it your NAV as opposed to debt to EBITDA, I think we would be sort of right in the middle or possibly even below peer average.", "Joseph Reagan", "Okay, thanks. And Steve it sounds like you're seeing pretty good broad-based leasing demand out there today, but just wondering if there is any submarkets or industries or tenant sizes that really stand out and seeing particularly good amount of activity?", "Steven Durels", "Well, the TAMI sector whether it's in our portfolio or in the overall market continues to be a big driver. But Marc in his opening comments I think spoke a little bit about the diversity of tenants and if you break it down of the deals that we have in pipeline, it's composed of TAMI being the leader, healthcare being a big chunk of it, financial services being a significant player, legal services and then general business services and even government to a certain extent are the five or six major industries. But the top four being TAMI, healthcare, financial services and legal. And I don't think that's really different today than what we were seeing through most of last year, quite frankly. And I think we take a lot of comfort from seeing that kind of diversity.", "Joseph Reagan", "And any submarkets stand out as particularly strong or soft?", "Steven Durels", "No. I think there is a lot of questions that we get about the West side meaning Midtown West, meaning Sixth Avenue in particular. And like a couple of years ago when Sixth Avenue had a bunch of vacancy. Sixth Avenue right now has probably got some of the biggest deals that are in negotiation. One of the big headline deals that's over there is the $0.5 million square feet going to Major League Baseball. So Midtown proper is a very active part of the marketplace and I think it's active on both East and west in all parts of Midtown. So I think Midtown is more active than Downtown right now, quite frankly. So I mean \u2013 and we're certainly feeling it in our portfolio.", "Joseph Reagan", "Great. I appreciate the color guys.", "Steven Durels", "Thank you.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. Thank you, everyone for whoever is left on the call and we're happy to have shared this great quarter with everybody and look forward to speaking again in three months\u2019 time.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

We're pleased that all of you have joined us on this gorgeous day in New York City and we're even happier that we were able to put out yet another quarter of strong operating results and market-leading capital transactions. Our second quarter results continue a trend in 2016 of surprising to the upside in leasing velocity and rental achievement. We executed another 620,000 square feet of Manhattan office leases highlighted by the recently announced expansion of Bloomberg in 919 Third Avenue and the renewal and expansion of New York Life at Graybar Building. In fact, SL Green was responsible for three of the eight largest leases transacted in the second quarter in midtown, Bloomberg, New York Life and Wells Fargo at 100 Park Avenue.", "The mark to market on the second quarter Manhattan leases was a robust 16% bringing first-half 2016 average rental increases on replacement leases to 28%. And that is on about 1.5 million square feet of leasing during six months. I think it speaks for itself as an extraordinary accomplishment. Velocity continues even into the month of July with another 84,000 square feet of leasing in office in Manhattan and just the past three weeks at an 18% mark-to-market inclusive of the recent Omnicom renewal at 220 East 42nd Street. In terms of forecasting these leasing trends for the remainder of the year, I would not that the best indicator of what those results are likely to trend towards would be our current leasing pipeline. That current pipeline stands today at about 1.6 million square feet, the vast majority of which is comprised of leases pending or leases out for signature and notably the mark to market on all of this pipeline deals exceeds 20%.", "So, fortunately for shareholders and unfortunately for Steve Durels and his leasing team, we must and are increasing our full-year guidance for completed Manhattan office leases to 2.6 million square feet for the full year and mark to market on those leases which are replacement leases to 22% mark to market. So, numbers that in each case are fairly significantly ahead of where we were in December. That sound you just heard was Steve hitting the floor. You can pick yourself up, Steve. Let's just put the best face on it and go forward, okay? And this manner we provide additional motivation and encouragement to our leasing and operations team to execute at the highest level of consistence with this Firm's culture of hard work and outperformance.", "These leasing results in our projection of second half performance is driven by continual demand for high-quality, well located, reasonably priced office space which descriptively, is the sweet spot of our entire portfolio. Midtown space continues to be in high demand as the vacancy rate decreased 10 basis points to 9.2% and sublease space in midtown stands at only 2.9 million square feet, near historical lows over the past eight or nine years for its sublease space -- very important barometer. We haven't talked about that on the last few conference calls, but we're talking about sublease space midtown that is about 1.1% of total inventory.", "So very, very low. Job creation in the financial security sector is roughly flat for the year, I think contrary to market perspective that there has been some substantial contraction in this sector, it is actually I think only down about 1,000 jobs year to date which on that job basis is essentially zero. But interestingly the fire sector, finance, insurance, real estate, is accounting for much of the first half leasing activity in midtown and elsewhere. Healthcare is also making a reasonably good showing, but I would say Financial Services had an above average showing in the first half of the year. That activity, whether it is the fire sector, healthcare or otherwise, is driven by jobs and job creation. Unfortunately the June New York City job numbers are not out yet, they are going to be out imminently. We would have hoped to have had them for the call but we don't. But if it is any indicator the national numbers that came out from Bureau of Labor Statistics for June were quite strong relative to May and earlier.", "And we're hopeful that the New York City numbers will follow in form the national numbers. In part it is almost self-fulfilling because the end of the Verizon strike in and of itself will probably put back on the roles of the city I think 3,000 plus jobs in June. So we're just hoping that -- and more growth on top of that. But we will see shortly. So that is a quick snapshot of the leasing picture. I'm sure you guys will have questions as we go forward. But I also want to make sure we touch upon the investment side of the portfolio. We did complete some important divestitures during the quarter including the Citigroup headquarters building sale, 33 Beekman sale and sales of a suburban property in Greenwich. ", "The proceeds of the significant capital transactions went to pay down debt and invest in certain new opportunities including a 20% stake in a recently completed residential product on the west side known as Sky and additional investment in the debt and preferred equity portfolio. On the topic of DPE, we're still on track reaffirm our December guidance that for year end balances we'll be just shy of $2 billion, about $1.95 billion of balance and contribution for the year should be on the order of about $200 million of gross revenues from that book of business. We have sizable identified pipeline of deals that we expect to close during the second half of the year carrying retained spreads of approximately 9.9% for that pipeline book of business which is higher than first half's achievement. But when blended will certainly exceed the 8.5% that was used in our earnings guidance back in December and then our earnings revision at the first quarter.", "So that is a very I would say positive story and a good market for us to be conducting our business with on the lending side as well as on the equity owned real estate side. We have been market leaders in the provision of subordinate debt capital for large and small New York City commercial projects for years and years. We established that position by being the most active lender in that market I guess for nearly 20 years. So there is a reputation and franchise and knowledge of the business which I think you will see has been paying off over the years and will be a shining example through the balance of this year.", "With excellent visibility at this point into our remaining 2016 production and performance, given there is only 5.5 months to go, our focus will naturally turn to 2017 and beyond. In order to meet our stated objective of delivering market-leading recurring earnings growth and sector leading total return to shareholder growth we have positioned our investment portfolio to generate substantial increases in NOI through leasing up the remainder of the growth portfolio and taking advantage of the embedded rental mark to market in our stabilized office and retail portfolios. These engines of growth should enable us to continue to deliver sector leading increases in FFO over the next three to five years and this is before accounting for the earnings contributions from 1 Vanderbilt.", "Speaking of 1 Vanderbilt, we're on track with this iconic development project with the site now almost 100% cleared of the four older buildings that formally occupied the site. Heavy equipment has rolled in to complete the removal of the last two floors and in three weeks we will have a clean site ready to be excavated and foundations poured. Extraordinary amount of credit goes to our construction and operations team for undertaking over the past year what we believe to be the largest surgical demolition of commercial buildings in decades and it was done on time, on budget and in a safe manner and New York City is better for it.", "There is barely a day that goes by where I don't get a comment from somebody who sees how that site is now being transformed in a way to upgrade the appreciation you have of these great landmark properties that surround the site like Grand Central and Chrysler and Lincoln and others. By allowing what will replace those buildings, the new building having setbacks to the property line and a tapered form to let and maximum light and air -- enormous benefit to the city, to the skyline and to this Company by adding this extraordinary building to our portfolio.", "Our financing arrangements for that $1.5 billion construction loan are on track as we've signed a final term sheet with a consortium of five lenders and we will look to have the loan fully committed and closed by the end of the third quarter. You also saw we took advantage of interest rates by entering into a $300 million swap, a seven-year term swap. And what is interesting to note is that in the past two Decembers Andrew Mathias quick write up on the screen, another engine of earnings growth which I think doesn't get the proper amount of due which is not top-line revenue growth but bottom-line debt service savings.", "And we showed that there was an extraordinary amount of mark-to-market savings that we could achieve over the next three to five years in our debt to book by having rates just basically stay roughly where they were when we went through that analysis in December. In fact, rates have fallen since then, so I would imagine the opportunity for us at this moment exceeds the $30 million or $40 million per year annually that we have forecasted at that point. And these swaps are just one point of evidence of how we can take advantage of that because the rate we locked in for seven years is actually lower than the floating rate we had forecasted for the year. Recall we always model LIBOR curve plus 50 basis points. And Matt, what was it 1.13%?", "Matt DiLiberto", "1.14%.", "Marc Holiday", "1.14% we locked in for seven years is actually below that floating rate amount and now locked in for seven years. So clearly we're going to be intensely focused on these kinds of opportunities with the rest of our debt portfolio to take advantage of rates, lock in these sort of historical lows where we can and where it is prudent to do so. And wind up hopefully creating a fourth measure of earnings growth on the debt service expense savings side.", "So, I feel like we're firing on all cylinders, I said that last quarter. I feel like the cylinders are still properly functioning. I feel very good about our positioning in the market for the present and for the future. Our same-store portfolio is 97.4% leased, our leverage levels are the lowest in the Company's history and getting better. Our liquidity exceeds $1.5 billion.", "We expect to have little or no line of credit balance outstanding by year end based on projections for balance of year. We have substantial store houses of growth embedded in the portfolio which I mentioned. And we're on track to develop the greatest building in New York City. So with that I would like to open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of David Toti with BB&T. Your line is open.", "David Toti", "Just want to touch on the sort of tenant mindset from your perspective. You have got a bunch of big leases expiring in the next year or two and the market has been a little bit jittery. Have you noticed any change in attitude in renewal conversations or new tenant conversations in the last quarter or two?", "Marc Holiday", "Steve will address the tenant mindset and/or mood. But I would want to go back to the supplemental while Steve is answering. I think we have very little in the way of not even large expirations, very little in the way of expirations in the next -- for the balance of this year and next year. So, something we have done and we have done with like a single minded focus is to do a lot of not just current leasing but forward leasing. The only way we could lease 2.6 million square feet this year when we only had like 1 or 1.2 million square feet rolling is by putting to bed what could be either exposure opportunity in 2016, 2017, 2018. So we will look back. Just I want to make sure we're clear. We have very little in the way of rollover exposure for the balance of this year and next year. But with that said, Steve, what is the thought?", "Steve Durels", "I think that the feedback we're getting from tenants today is no different than what we were getting a year ago. The general mood from the tenants that we speak to is they feel good about their businesses, they think they are in a healthy position. I think it depends on the type of industry you are talking about as to how bullish they are. But most people are still in the mindset of expanding their businesses, making capital commitments as far as restacking or rebuilding and changing how they like to use their space and I don't think that is ever going to go away for the next several years to come because it is a bit of a cultural thing.", "And tenants -- we have continued to see tenants that in 2017/2018 expirations, a willingness to engage in early renewals. And as Marc touched on, a lot of the sort of outperformance on the leasing velocity within our portfolio is a combination of filling vacancy but also tenants' willingness to step up and do early renewals. And in the 1.6 million square feet that is in our pipeline there are some very meaty deals inside that pipeline which we hope to have success on before the end of the year.", "David Toti", "And if I could just follow up with a quick follow up. I know we have asked -- Marc, we have asked you this before about the presence of we work in the New York City market now occupying close to 3 million square feet by some estimates and recently demonstrating some weakness in revenues or in profits. Does that concern you at all as that member gets larger and larger in the market? And I'm thinking back to the late 1990s when we saw a number of sort of WeWork-like tenants kind of disappeared during periods of economic weakness. Does that present incremental risk in the market in your mind?", "Marc Holiday", "Yes. I don't know that it is accurate to compare WeWork to the other tenants you mentioned -- I forget what period you mentioned, but I guess maybe 2000 or whatever. What was that?", "Matt DiLiberto", "Late 1990s.", "Marc Holiday", "Late 1990s, 2000.", "David Toti", "Yes, I'm old enough to remember that far back at this point.", "Marc Holiday", "Yes and we were there too. So it is a different company with a different model, a very successful model and a model that is attracting an enormous amount of financial support. So to me the difference between companies -- not just for actual office companies or full service communities like WeWork that do their business, but really any Company to write there any period downturn is simply -- well not simply -- but is in large part capacity and liquidity.", "So I think that if any of these companies are capitalized properly and WeWork looks to be like they are, then these downturns in New York tend to be short-lived. Downturn doesn't mean things like go to zero. Downturns in York may just be marginal rent reductions of 10%, 15%, 20%. I think that the model we have seen them execute in this market is sort of best of class and I think that is generally perceived to be such when you look at the landlords that are doing business looking to WeWork is sort of in many cases a prime tenant.", "So it doesn't give us concerned, 3 million square feet for any tenant on a 400 million square foot inventory; I don't want to be too dismissive but it is not like 3 million square feet in a 100 million square foot market. This market is four times that size. And therefore we don't -- it is not something that keeps us up at night.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "John Kim", "So the Brexit vote happened, that was a surprise to many. Has your business changed at all on the leasing or the investment side since the vote?", "Marc Holiday", "As a result of Brexit has it changed on the leasing or investment? Not that I have seen.", "Steve Durels", "No, I haven't seen it on the leasing side and I haven't gotten any kind of feedback either from the brokerage community or tenants that -- maybe a year or two from now we will see something but there is nothing in today's conversation.", "Andrew Mathias", "I would say on the investment side we haven't seen any change. There is some expectation that New York will draw even more capital interest as London is less attractive for foreign investment. It's still too early to tell on that front. We're monitoring the deals that are in the market now and certainly values are holding up or even taking another step forward. But it is too early to sort of tie that to Brexit or not.", "John Kim", "Okay and my second question is on your leasing pipeline. I was wondering if 1 Vanderbilt was a component of that and if so how much?", "Steve Durels", "No, in that 1.6 million nothing is directly connected to 1 Vanderbilt, nor would we expect it to be. We're 4 plus years out before we're delivering the building. And although we're actively presenting the building, we're early to the game. And we have got a stretch goal for the Company to do some leasing this year of about 200,000 square feet. But like in every year, we have a list of goals and then we have stretch goals because we push ourselves to outperform and we're working hard at it, but nothing to announce yet.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Vincent Chao", "Just wondering on the leasing activity that you have done for the quarter here, you guys have posted some very good results here in the first half. The pipeline actually I think is a little bit bigger than what you talked about last quarter. But that seems a little bit at odds with some of the market reports that we see. I'm just curious if you had any thoughts on why you are performing so much more than the overall market.", "Marc Holiday", "Well, I would ask you the question why should we only perform at the market? I mean we're better at this [Technical Difficulty]. I hope that doesn't sound boastful but--.", "Andrew Mathias", "97 plus occupied in a market that is 91% occupied.", "Marc Holiday", "Yes so I mean, I think it sort of speaks for itself. We like to think of ourselves as having among the best platforms in New York City in executing these kind of deals. So there is a wide disparity of buildings and ownership groups that comprise the 400 million square feet of inventory in the city. I hope we're, if not the best, among the best, but I like to think we're the best. And as a result we I think have an unusual scale and footprint in the city, almost 30 million square feet of real estate.", "So, we're able kind of leverage position to maximize our relationships with tenants, partners, lenders and vendors to keep this portfolio 97.5% leased. Maximize our rents. Keep our TIs, leasing concessions low. I don't think anybody mentioned that, but I think it is worthy of mentioning. I think we were about $26 a foot or $30 a foot, thereabout, for the quarter. So quite efficient I think in terms of how we executed the business. And that is our calling card.", "Steve Durels", "Let me just add to it. I think the market is better than those reports are actually indicating as well. A lot of the market reports that get printed are lag reality. And we're in a better market than statistically that is being reported as evidenced by some of the deals that we're working on that we think are going to close in the third quarter as evidenced by some of the deals that closed at the very end of the second quarter. So we're ahead of the market, we're doing well, but I think the market is better than what's actually in those reports.", "Vincent Chao", "And then just maybe going back to the Brexit question just in a different angle. I'm being I guess it is still very early days in terms of what is going on and what the impacts might look like. But I guess does this pique your interest at all in looking at London again?", "Marc Holiday", "I think it sort of reinforces our strategy which is questioned from time to time, of wanting to be sort of the sharpshooter in one market. I think we attempted to not just -- it wasn't it by accident we chose to do $25 billion of business in one market, it was designed to be done in what we thought was the market that had the best liquidity, stability, transparency, depth of market participants, Fortune 500 tenants. London I think exhibits many of those trades, but I think New York is a better market going in. ", "And I don't think there is any more desire on our part to diversify into that market or other markets which we would almost deem as like adverse diversification. So there is plenty for us to do in this city both in office, retail, multi, debt and preferred equity. We have got actually quite a full plate. And while there may be some good opportunities in London that emerge, my guess is that will be taken advantage of by people who have or groups that have significant footprints in that market.", "So, I wouldn't think so, but not something we have looked at all that closely at the moment. Shareholders start asking us to take a look at it, maybe we will become more focused, but it is not a topic.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lewis with SunTrust. Your line is open.", "Michael Lewis", "So, whether it is the reports from the brokers or Street FFO estimates, you topped expectations in the second quarter. And I'm just curious about your guidance for the full year. Are you expecting -- I guess I could back up. Was this better than your expectations for 2Q? And then do you expect any kind of slow down the rest of the year?", "Matt DiLiberto", "So the quarter was on expectations maybe slightly better, it was a really solid quarter, solid first six months of the year. We obviously always want to be accurate in our guidance, conservative and prudent. And as we look out over the balance of the year and where we reset guidance only three months ago which was pretty unusual only three months into the year to adjust. Feel-good with the range, you have to keep an eye on a couple things that we have out there, not the least of which is the potential impact of the Aeropostale situation at 1515 Broadway which has not yet resolved itself, that may have an impact. And so at this point we felt it was prudent to keep the FFO guidance for the moment unchanged.", "Michael Lewis", "Okay. And then my follow-up, I'm not sure how much you could say on this, but on 1 Vanderbilt, the decision to JV or not sell a JV interest and then kind of the timing of that, how do you think about the risk/reward of mitigating some of the lease up risk? Maybe you JV early, maybe you wait and try to get a better pricing as it is closer to stabilization? Or is it still too early to talk about that?", "Marc Holiday", "Well, what we said in December and reiterated on the last call and I guess I will say again now, just as a refresher, all focus right now is on closing out that loan, as I think it should be. I think the first order of business and an important part of the overall capitalization of this project is to get a properly structured priced $1.5 billion construction loan facility closed which we've been working intensely hard on for several months now. And it looks like we're nearing the conclusion point and hope to have that closed in the next 60 to 75 days.", "So I think along the way we have begun to have conversations with equity investors, I would say all of which have gone exceedingly well in terms of receptivity of these various institutional players who have the capacity to fund a deal like this and have the desire to be a part of development projects which are kind of best building, best market, best location. With that said there are certain signals from our shareholders and analysts about trying to expedite, do it rapidly. We're not on that approach. It is a bad approach, we don't want to -- I think. I mean it is just there's no exact right or wrong, but we think that for a project like this we should see the whole market and there is going to be a lot of different opportunities out there, different structures, different amounts, different kind of the yield enhancements available to this Company.", "We're working very closely with Heinz in this regard. I would say by the end of this year we will have covered -- I don't know, maybe 40 of the top domestic and foreign investors in the world for a project like this. And then we will try and zero in and grind it down to the right partner for a project like this. You don't want the wrong partner. You want to make sure this is the absolute right partner, shares a long term vision, has the capacity to fund side-by-side all the way through the project. And has a real deep love and affection for this project. I'm confident we will get there as I was confident we would find the -- pull together the debt financing. It is not -- this is not like an urgent track, it is not on a fast track. It is on what I would call kind of a responsible track for a project like this.", "Remember there is very little money spend right now, I keep reinforcing the fact that most of the money spend begins middle of 2017 when you start going vertical in the project. We have kind of fully -- the site is unencumbered, we have no partners, we will be funding whatever remains in demo and excavation just out of cash flow between now and year end. And then we get to do some initial loan draws where our expectation is we will be able to do initial loan draws on the loan facility to basically prime the pump for 2017.", "So we have time, we think the market is coming our way because as rates drop and you have things like Brexit which take a fairly attractive and competitive market and maybe puts it on the sidelines for a year or two, I think we will be the beneficiary of seeing, at least temporarily if not permanently, some excess investment dollars searching for projects like 1 Vanderbilt. And I think it is our job to take advantage of that. So, we're proceeding apace and we will definitely keep you apprised. But I have said I didn't expect much in the way of announceable events on the JV side in 2016, I would probably reiterate that at this point.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neil. Your line is open.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Marc, maybe just following up on 1 Vande. On the closing of the loan what is left to be done? And then in the loan are there pre-leasing hurdles or do they -- do the lenders have a say on who the JV partner is?", "Marc Holiday", "You know what, out of respect for the lenders they were kind enough to let us give you guys a glimpse to the fact that -- how far along we were and the fact that we selected the lenders and we signed the term sheet. We're not at this point at liberty to get into any terms of the deal nor would we until it is closed. So hopefully on the next call which I guess is October, we will be able to share with you at that point the answer to that question, we will make note of that and put it in the prepared remarks, Matt, please.", "And other questions I'm sure you will have at that point. I would say suffice it to say we look at it as a very good piece of financing that is in all respects equal or -- well, really consistent with our business plan in all respects, not just in pricing but in things as it relates to funding and etc. So we're going to just get that done and then hopefully on the next call we will be able to share with you some details.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay, but Marc, can you just at least say are the still things that you -- like documents that you still have to go over with the lenders? Or is it just a matter of lawyers going over the loan document before it is signed in 60 days?", "Marc Holiday", "I'm not sure. We're documenting the deal, so I mean that is the whole 60, 75 and we're at the point of a term sheet. And now the term sheet has -- not you document and close. So that is where we're. It is not like documents are in escrow. But it is [indiscernible] fairly customary.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "And then the second question is there was the article in the Post this morning on 650 Fifth and the court stopping the seizure or at least on part of the building. How does this impact you guys?", "Marc Holiday", "We do not see any impact to our leasehold position there which was fully approved at the time we signed the lease by the party who is now contesting the government's claim.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay, so you guys still have 100% control with your JV partner on the retail part?", "Marc Holiday", "Correct.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open.", "Manny Korchman", "Maybe if we just think about the investment environment in New York City overall. Have you seen buyer pools or buyer appetites change to date? I know, Marc, you talked about Brexit potentially driving more money towards New York. But have you seen any of the opposite given sort of the turbulence in the stock markets?", "Andrew Mathias", "I think it is still a little bit too early to tell. I mean we're seeing values hold up to take a step forward even in certain cases. But it is too early to tell whether those buyers are sort of forum shopping and would have otherwise been investing in London but are now investing in New York or if it is just the natural flows of capital we have been talking about consistently which are really -- continue to drive values in New York. So just not sure if it is situational or if it is more just the overall trend we have been tracking.", "Manny Korchman", "And then if you think about just rents at 1 Vanderbilt, I know it is early, I know you are not under the gun to get leasing done today. If you think about rents went you first announced the project you first thought about the project to where they are now to where they will be when you sign, what has the trajectory of those been?", "Marc Holiday", "Well, we put rents up in December and our whole approach was to price the building in 2021 at rents that are consistent with what the best buildings are getting in the city today. So we viewed that very conservatively because our pro formas are based on I guess what you would say no growth in those rents over five or six years off of today's best rents. Even though this building will as a physical -- as physical space and infrastructure, sustainability and views and ceiling heights and column free nature will be far in excess of most of those buildings considered their best buildings. We just kind of priced it based off of today's rents and those rents are going to go up and down over the next five, six years.", "We mentioned earlier the bulk of the leasing we expect to occur I guess probably 2018 and beyond. So the real question is, what is the market then? We feel very good about the project's positioning and the rent positioning of the project where we sit today, not just where we sat in December. And we might be conservative, we might not be, but I don't think we're aggressive and the returns are such that even if the rents are 3% to 5% off, the deal returns for a development site of this quality are still far, far in excess of baseline returns.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Jamie Feldman", "Can you talk more about the D&PE pipeline? It looks like you are trending kind of in-line with your guidance midway through the year. We haven't seen a slowdown in transaction activity this year. Just maybe help us understand what is in the pipeline and what gives you guys comfort you will hit your numbers?", "Marc Holiday", "I'm trying to think how we can -- we certainly are not going to advertise for our competitors the deals where in pipe. What kind of information could we give you other than the volume of that pipeline?", "Jamie Feldman", "Well, I guess just thinking through maybe how the balance could end up in the third quarter and fourth quarter. I think you are trending down the first two quarters of the year from the fourth quarter run rate.", "Marc Holiday", "It's very hard, what if something closes like a day after the third quarter ends? It is very hard to predict sort of daily closings. It is easier over a six-month period. If you are saying, hey, what is going to close in September because not much will be this summer I would expect. How much would you expect sort of--?", "Matt DiLiberto", "I think the balances should be I think up for the next quarter. I don't think they will be down; they are likely to be up and possibly up meaningfully in the next quarter.", "Jamie Feldman", "I guess another way to ask it is like just thinking about where you were at the Investor Day and the pipeline you had then. Is it pretty much the same pipeline or has the market changed and you are finding different opportunities?", "Marc Holiday", "The pipeline stage is like weekly, monthly. There are deals on the sheet none of which existed in December of 2015. Financing deals are not like real -- real estate deals can take anywhere -- they can take one, two, three years to ferment. Transactional activity financings are typically -- have a three to four month shelf life kind of thing. So none of this was an pipe in December, this is all brand-new product. That which we projected to close in first half we closed already. You saw we sold a lot of product because if we don't syndicate then we're going to be far in excess of our balances at year end.", "So we may originate over the second half of the year well over $1 billion. But the real issue is not what are we going to close, it is what are we going to retain. We control that, Jamie. So that is how we could be highly confident of hitting our goals. When we have a pipeline that might be $1 billion to $1.5 billion and we're only looking to originate and retain maybe $600 million, $700 million, $800 million between now and then at most.", "So we control the brake and accelerator on our decision, how much and when to syndicate. We could syndicate less. But I think the issue we will have is not your issue of, hey, are we going to be able to originate the business? It is going to be, syndicating ferociously to keep the balance within and below the $2 billion mark, that I would say is more of a challenge.", "Jamie Feldman", "Okay. And then what about the quality of the deals? Are you saying you have to get more aggressive here given fewer transactions in the market?", "Marc Holiday", "Less aggressive. The competition is less right now. When the competition is less you have got your pick of the deals.", "Andrew Mathias", "As we outlined last quarter, the syndicated bank market has backed up this year so they are not as aggressive. CMBS took a pause, it is coming back -- the market is coming back now strong, but that gave us an opportunity to lock up some very attractive originations with great risk return profile for us we feel.", "Jamie Feldman", "Okay. And then can you give an update on Aeropostale, just where things stand today?", "Andrew Mathias", "They filed bankruptcy, we're in bankruptcy court obviously making claims for the rent we're owed and we're marketing the space.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Your line is open.", "Steve Sakwa", "Marc, could you just comment a little bit more about the leveraging? I know at one point you had a number of assets on the market for sale. So just trying to think through as you grow the loan book, but also want to try and take leverage down. Just kind of help us think through sources and uses over the back half of the year, please.", "Marc Holiday", "The sales at least as part of what we talked about in December have been completed. So with the completion of Citigroup and 33 and West Putnam.", "Andrew Mathias", "Lipstick closed earlier.", "Marc Holiday", "And Lipstick -- and there were other closings earlier in the year, the three that just closed in this quarter. So that now is -- brings us on a pro forma basis to about 7.5 times debt to EBITDA by year end. And that forecast of 7.5 for yearend already had incorporated in it the growing of the portfolio by $150 million from 1.8 last year to 1.950 this year. So that $150 million of incremental growth was part of the forecast that gets us to the 7.5. So it is all still on plan. By the way, $150 million here doesn't move the needle like a 10th of a basis point. But it is in there just to answer your question directly, it is accounted for. And so, where it looks like as we sit now we're right where we hope to be at year end.", "Steve Sakwa", "Okay and then I guess for Matt, just to be clear on the guidance. I mean I know you are not changing numbers, but if we take your six-month figures and we back off some of the one times in the quarter including the promote, you are kind of around $1.70 run rate. A, I just want to make sure that that kind of jives with your number. And that I guess if you were to kind of look at the six-month numbers and begin to back off some of the one time and take the $1.70 as a run rate you are kind of in that $7 range. Does that math kind of make sense?", "Matt DiLiberto", "Yes, the $7 is squarely the midpoint of our normalized guidance, the second quarter had big one timers in it, it also had 2.5 months of Citi because we didn't close that deal until June 10. There are a couple of things we had 1515 Broadway's percentage rent for $3 million and it is a low expense quarter as every second quarter is, but it is better than we expected. So you run all that through and you get to a run rate that gets you to that $7 midpoint and [Technical Difficulty].", "Steve Sakwa", "Okay, so you would say that the $1.69 is kind of a clean run rate as we kind of move into the back half of the year?", "Matt DiLiberto", "Again, adjusting for you add $0.16 of Citi contribution into one -- I will call it [Technical Difficulty] that's obviously gone away for the third and fourth quarters.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel. Your line is open.", "John Guinee", "Just a quick clean-up question, then a leasing question. It looks like you had booked a $206 million gain on 388, 390, but then your gain on sale of real estate and discontinued ops is about $197 million. Is there a gap there for any reason or is there some complexities I just don't understand?", "Matt DiLiberto", "I wouldn't say there are complexities that you don't understand. But obviously there are other items beside just that one gain that we have to run through that line item, so it just comes through adjustments.", "John Guinee", "And any losses on any sales recently or not?", "Matt DiLiberto", "The 500 West Putnam sale is noted in the depreciable real estate reserves, that is that number -- I think it is around $10 million.", "John Guinee", "And then I guess for Steve just a little nuance on the world of leasing. You are quoting sort of a full-year 22% cash mark to market -- maybe this is Matt's question. What does the math look like if you did a GAAP mark to market for the year? And then what does the mark to market look like on a net rent basis versus a gross rent basis? Do you guys have any sense for those kind of escalations?", "Matt DiLiberto", "Well okay, I want to make sure -- that was like four questions so I've got to ? we're all busily writing here. The first one is GAAP, right?", "John Guinee", "Yes.", "Matt DiLiberto", "The question is if 22% is cash do we know what GAAP is. So I guess we always, we can maybe formulate that, I don't think we have it, John. We always look at the best representative of spot market -- spot market increase is the current cash rent versus the immediately preceding escalated cash rent. That to us is the increase. Now if you then take it over time which is I guess the GAAP, if we did a 10 year deal and it had an average of 2% a year increases plus a midyear bump -- a midterm bump every five years. Then that is going to be I think wildly in excess of the 22% because you are going to be comparing sort of the -- average to the spot rent. And it is going to be -- we could calc it, but it will be definitionally higher than the 22%.", "Steve Durels", "It would be a misleading number for people I think because as Andrew was saying, the mark to market compares starting rent to the ending rent. And if you did it against GAAP you would be--.", "Andrew Mathias", "On both sides. The ending rent would be lower because you would be --.", "Marc Holiday", "It would be like a -- so look, we will play around with it for a couple of leases and see what the results look like. But then I would just want to think through the implication of that metric once we have it. The second thing -- the difference between gross and net.", "Matt DiLiberto", "I think it was net effect. You were talking about net effect net of concessions or gross and net?", "John Guinee", "Well, just if you -- the quick math is let's say you have a $75 rent and a $25 OpEx and that is $50 net. Or $75 rent goes up by 22% while your OpEx stays constant, your cash rent, your net rent is going up much more than 22% unless of course you have got a big OpEx increase factored in. And I'm just trying to sense if you guys do that math or not.", "Marc Holiday", "Yes, that is right because it is 22% gross to gross which would be higher if you went net to net. I think that is right. Yes, I think that is right. But I guess what we're looking at is within our NOI at any given point in time you have the net, so the question is how much contribution are you getting to the NOI. Which you already -- remember NOI has already taken out the expenses. So the contribution is the differential in gross rent. So if the NOI of the building is $10 million and we sign a new lease and the gross rent goes from $75 to $80 we have got $5 a foot more is going to drop to that bottom line to the NOI because expenses don't go up when you sign a lease. Your point is that increase on a net basis is probably more than 22%. I think that is right. So we can take a look at that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS. Your line is open.", "Nick Yulico", "Just going back to the new 22% mark-to-market guidance for this year. Is that because -- which is higher than your prior guidance. Is that because of getting better rents on a lot of space or is it because of one or two big leases moving into the pipeline this year affecting those numbers.", "Steve Durels", "It is not driven by -- it is all over the board as far as one particular deal up and down. But if you -- if we shared with you the pipeline, the vast majority of the deals that we're working on all have positive mark to market. And then it is a question of just some having more than others. It is not disproportionately dependent upon a single deal.", "Marc Holiday", "I think it is -- well in some cases the opposite. I'm thinking of Bloomberg. Bloomberg was only a 14% deal, so the quarter would have been almost 150 basis points higher. But the tendency, Nick, is for the larger leases, the outlier leases may not get quite as much mark to market. Your point is, hey, the bigger leases have that biggest mark to market and drive the deals. That is not usually our experience in this market, it is the opposite. By number of deals, the number of deals we have big, big mark to market. But then you get some larger deals where you don't always have the exact same price as ours. And you may have to take a lower amount. But whether it is 16% or it is 28% or 22%, I mean these are big numbers you are talking about.", "Matt DiLiberto", "In terms of guidance, as Steve starts the year he doesn't know which 17, 18, 19 leases he is going to pull forward into the year and renew early call it. So I think we have had -- we have probably renewed some leases that were big mark to markets early.", "Steve Durels", "Yes.", "Matt DiLiberto", "Which is driving that guidance.", "Steve Durels", "And I think that speaks to the health of the market right now because we're not in a defensive position. We're in a point of view where tenants are coming to us and are doing -- willing to do early renewals and they are paying for it. I think that is where obviously we want to be and the market is on our side right now.", "Nick Yulico", "Yes. No, that is helpful. I guess the follow up then has to go -- goes to the idea of the kind of overall market, whether you think given that the vacancy rate in the overall market hasn't come down much, business uncertainties may be a little bit higher.", "Marc, you talked about earlier this year worried about kind of the job growth slowing and maybe some of that impact would be in the back half of the year. Is New York City still a market where you could see some positive rent growth? Not that you necessarily need it, but is -- or is things going to sort of flatten out from here you think?", "Marc Holiday", "Well, I have to look at our own portfolio and our own facts. We have got 1.6 million in pipe with a 20% mark to market. So I couldn't sit here and say I think rents are going down because of that evidence, you know what I'm saying? I mean we could look out into the future and sort of speculate as to what the longer term trends might look like, but we're busily at work trying to close out that 1.6 million fairly substantial rental increases.", "So I guess I would have to answer that question by saying it looks like we're going to get those increases. The other way of saying that is I wouldn't raise the guidance 22% if I didn't feel pretty good about that. So I did see earlier at the outset that it has surprised us to the upside. I didn't expect the second half of the year to be quite as good as it looks like it is panning out to be. In response to someone's earlier question, maybe we're outperforming the market. So you could have a situation where both things are true -- and that is okay for us which is maybe the market is slowing a bit and rental growth is slowing a bit. But if our portfolio is still full speed ahead then I don't want to like question it, I want to go with that and do more of that and keep going and differentiate ourselves from the market. That is what you look for I think in top companies in any industry is that kind of differentiation. We're not bigger than the market but we can certainly do better than the market. And I think we have and will. ", "So I think both could be true. But we see a very good environment over the next six months to conduct our business and finish out our year and hit these sort of sector leading numbers. Then towards the end of the year we're going to give you our view of 2017 which I think it is a little too early because I would like to see a few more months of jobs numbers before I even go there. Let's see June, July, August and the balance of the year and see where those job numbers go. Because if the private sector job numbers and [indiscernible] job numbers are up and still not up as much of last year and years prior but in the range of 50,000 new jobs plus. And 15,000 plus are office using jobs, then we're still in a good market. But I want to see that data.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Market. Your line is open.", "Craig Mailman", "Just wanted to go back to some earlier comments on the leasing side. Steve, I know you said that tenants in general are kind of in an expansionary mode. I'm just curious, are you seeing the pendulum swing back at all on tenants trying to get more efficient with space?", "Steve Durels", "Are they getting more efficient? I think every tenant continues to try to maximize efficiency. You have heard me say in the years pass, I don't think that is a trend that ever goes away. It is just a function of what people are willing to do through a combination of technology and ultimately allocations of square footage per person.", "But yes, everybody once to either use their space differently and that can be sort of like just cultural. And others as do they want to use it differently and that goes to how much space per employee. So, but I don't think we're seeing anything different today than we saw last year or 18 months ago or even 2.5 years ago.", "Craig Mailman", "Okay, so no one's -- so you're?", "Steve Durels", "Is it coming back the other way? Are you saying are they coming back--", "Craig Mailman", "Yes, are people kind of loosening up trying to get more efficient?", "Steve Durels", "I get you. So we have heard sound bites of that, yes. But I can't say that there is -- anybody has found the absolute perfect solution for themselves. There have been a number of examples where tenants have gone out and tried to be overly aggressive as to the small amount of allocation of square footage per person and then had to come back and adjust it because it was operationally too taxing on their employees. But I think those are exceptions to the rule.", "Craig Mailman", "Okay and are you seeing -- I'm just curious about what tenants are doing on the contraction side at this point in the cycle if anything.", "Marc Holiday", "Nothing of note. I mean we if we saw contraction in this market, A, we would tell you, B, we would have a different tone on this call. There is no sublease space, that is the first sign of contraction. Shadow vacant space doesn't really exist. All the big financial firms that might have had to sublet space in the past, Craig, they all own their buildings now. Goldman owns their own building --.", "Andrew Mathias", "Citi owns their own building.", "Marc Holiday", "Citi owns their own building. Those buildings are not going to be for the most part multi-tenanted. JPMorgan owns their own building at 270. I don't think they are subletting the building. I don't think they are going to like shed space and take in and go multi-tenant at 270 Park. So it is a different market today. And it is good, it is more balanced, more diverse, a lot of these big financials own their own facilities for safety and security and control reasons which is probably smart. That puts less in -- more tenants competing for less inventory because that space is not on the market -- on the direct or sublet market. So, where I hear the nature of the questions, we're just not seeing it right now which is why we're upping our guidance on different levels. If we saw that we would probably hold tighter or decrease.", "Craig Mailman", "And just separately, there is not a lot of talk about joint venturing 1 Vanderbilt.", "Marc Holiday", "Craig, we like to hold these for like an hour out of respect because I know people start to drop off after an hour. We have got six people in the queue. Can you just sort of come back around with that question?", "Craig Mailman", "Sure, no problem.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Blaine Heck", "Matt, on same-store NOI, sorry if I missed this, but last year you guys had the termination fee associated with 919 Third. Did that have any effect on same-store NOI growth this quarter? Were there any other kind of one-time items? And what would the normalized result be if you adjusted for any of that?", "Matt DiLiberto", "It didn't have any effect on same-store cash NOI, the termination fee we received last year at 919 is paid out over time, so it is included in GAAP NOI but not in cash NOI. So if you are looking at pure cash termination fees we received second quarter of last year would be about $2.2 million as against about $1.4 million we received in the second quarter of this year. So it did affect GAAP NOI but not cash NOI.", "Blaine Heck", "And then can you guys talk a little bit about the Omnicon extension you guys recently signed? I think that reduces their expiration in 2017 to close to 225,000 to 250,000 square feet. So what is the plan for the rest of that space? I think there had been some talk about selling a condo interest in the 300,000 square feet that they had expiring when we talked about it last quarter. So is there any update on what is going on there?", "Steve Durels", "So, the Omnicon story is a great story on many fronts. When their lease was originally scheduled to expire we had zero expectation that they would be renewing any portion of the space because they have got a big portfolio in town and they were making other plans. But we have a free good relationship with them and their business needs changed, they came back around the horn, did a big deal with us at the beginning of the year.", "Thought they were put to bed and then this most recent renewal is a function of them growing their body count and wanting to do business with one of their preferred vendors. So, we picked up another 64,000 square feet. We have got a large lease that we're -- a large transaction that we're working on for a big chunk of what is remaining, but it is premature to announce.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Just looking at all the leasing that you have done last year and especially the first half has been really strong. If you were to look out past 2016 into 2017 and obviously you won't provide guidance, but I'm assuming all this bodes really well for same-store cash NOI going into next year. If there was a very high-level objective or even a trajectory you could provide us with, that would be really helpful.", "Matt DiLiberto", "It is Matt. Certainly it sets us up nicely because of the benefit the leasing that we do this year generally flows through 12 months later. You are right, we're not going to give any guidance at this point. We'll touch on that in December. But it is certainly putting us on a good trajectory. Bear in mind, of course, that we had very strong growth last year of like 4.5% and we're going to be north of 6% this year. So we're growing off a big base but Steve is setting us up nicely.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.", "Jed Reagan", "I know you said on prior calls that riskier lower quality assets in New York might be repriced downward this year. Have you seen that actually coming to fruition? And if so, maybe what kind of magnitude of impact are you seeing on a percentage basis?", "Andrew Mathias", "Yes, I think it sort of depends on the building, the situation. I mean there is a building now on Ninth Avenue trading which I think would have fit in that category and it happens to be drawing a very strong bid so I think that building is sort of un-impacted or not really dimensional in terms of value. And then there is other side street really inferior assets that because of the change in financing costs have maybe backed up 3% to 5%, nothing major.", "Operator", "Thank you and I would not like to turn the call back to Mr. Holiday for closing remarks.", "Marc Holiday", "Thank you very much. Sorry we ran a little late on the call, but I guess there was a lot to cover. And hopefully we addressed all the key items for the quarter and the market. And we look forward to speaking with you folks after the summer. Have a great summer and we will speak again in October.

This conference call is being recorded.", "At this time, the company would like to remind listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from the forward-looking statements that management may make today. Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the company\u2019s Form 10-K and other reports filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "Also during today\u2019s conference call, the company may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC Regulation G, the GAAP financial measures most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure discussed and the reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on the company\u2019s website at www.slgreen.com, by selecting the press release regarding the company\u2019s fourth quarter 2016 earnings.", "Before turning the call over to Marc Holliday, Chief Executive Officer of SL Green Realty Corp., I ask that those of you participating in the Q&A portion of the call, please limit your questions to two per person. Thank you.", "I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. Let me begin by thanking all of you who attended our investor presentation on December 5th. By all accounts, it was enormously successful and proud day for our company where we got to showcase our achievements for the year, we provided a strategic framework for 2017, goals, objectives and market expectations. I think we had a record crowd of investors and analysts who attended and that for us is always sort of a crowning event for the company, for the year and we covered a lot of ground so, I\u2019ll keep my comments relatively brief at the outset here so it\u2019s not too duplicate a lot of our thoughts and where we\u2019re headed for the year. But I will try to go into some updates about what has transpired since then.", "It\u2019s only been about seven weeks that have elapsed since the investor conference, but in that time we\u2019ve begun to implement our plans and I think it\u2019s evident that even at this very early stage we are making great progress towards another year of sector leading operating and financial performance. We actually wound up exceeding the high-end of our guidance range by $0.04 thanks impart to lower interest expense, operating expenses cost controls in the real-estate portfolio and higher net interest margin in the debt and preferred equity structured finance portfolio. Also during those seven weeks, we leased another 205,000 square feet of Manhattan office space exceeding our already elevated goal for 2016 and chipping away at 2017 Manhattan office lease expirations which as we stand today, those remaining expirations are less than 900,000 square feet throughout the entire portfolio.", "Given that we are executing at such a very high level on the leasing front, the available inventory of what we have to lease is obviously reduced and it should come as no surprise that SLG\u2019s quarterly leasing volumes will be below previous amounts when we have much more growth portfolio space and lease rollovers to attend to. This should not be mistaken by what I sometimes hear and read about, as a slowdown. In fact, as we sit today, we have a pipeline of over 630,000 square feet which has actually increased from our last Q3 earnings call by about 5% or more, even though we have less place to lease as we sit today and therefore we remain very confident that we will meet or exceed our stating leasing goals for the year.", "At this point, given the high degree of occupancy in the portfolio, our focus shifts away from sheer volume of leasing and towards maintaining market leading occupancy of 97% or greater while achieving mid-teens or higher mark-to-market on expiring leases. This of course will be enhanced as we acquire or develop new inventory to drive future growth. This best in class operational performance reinforces the fact that high quality, well located and reasonably priced office space is still in high demand and we will utilize our enviable portfolio and market positioning to drive the best lease economics possible.", "Before opening up the call for questions, I want to take a few moments to discuss a milestone achievement for the company that we announced this morning regarding the recapitalization of the One Vanderbilt Avenue development project. This morning\u2019s announcement of the completion of the joint venture with NPS and Hines brings to a successful conclusion our capitalization goals for the project that we set forth on this call one year ago. I can\u2019t tell you how excited we are to partner with NPS and Hines on this extraordinary development of what would become the single best commercial building in Manhattan.", "After a global exploratory process conducted jointly by SL Green and Hines, we were fortunate enough to find a partner who shares our commitment and vision for developing, owning and operating this iconic property. Through its $525 million minimum commitment into the project, NPS and Hines will be providing the majority of the development equity capital left to fund over the next 3.5 years. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate all the men and women at NPS, Hines and Green who have worked diligently and of course tirelessly on this project for the better part of the last four months in order to bring it to fruition this morning.", "In particular, the effort was led internally by Isaac Zion, Robert Schiffer and Andy Levine who made it their priority to close this transaction within this stated timeframes we laid out to everyone on this call 12 months ago. I can\u2019t be happier with the outcome which strikes the right balance between reducing SL Green\u2019s overall capital commitment to the project while still maintaining 71% ownership for the future. We thank our shareholders for having the confidence in us to put together this best in class of construction financing that we announced I think on the last call, $1.5 billion of construction financing along with this new venture ownership structure. You will all be substantially rewarded for this as the project moves forward towards its next phase of construction and lease-up which will unfold over the next several years.", "So with that, I\u2019d like to open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Market. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "John Kim", "Thank you. Since the Presidential election, there\u2019s been enormous optimism on the bank stocks and I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re seeing any of that optimism reflected in lease markets from financial institutions?", "Marc Holliday ", "I think I can speak to seeing it reflected in a vibe and a confidence with all of the different counterparties we meet, whether it\u2019s bankers, potential partners, tenants, people in the financial community, brokers. I would say clearly, the vibe, the confidence, the psychology has become much more enthusiastic, much more positive, much more optimistic in terms of what everyone perceives to be the opportunities for growth and incentives, lower taxes and possibly with \u2013 regulation and whatever else is driving that enthusiasm, we definitely see it. In terms of translating that into signed lease deals, I guess over the past month or two, I don\u2019t know if you could point to it directly although may be Steve could shed some light on the experience we\u2019re having at 280 Park which is as good as an example of a financial oriented commercial asset as we have in the portfolio as any and I would say the experience there the last couple of months has actually been surprisingly robust. So Steve\u2026", "Steven Durels", "Yeah I think that\u2019s spot on. The end of last year and most of last year, financial services came back into the market in a material relative to the other business sectors. And post-election, we certainly saw bump in activity, tour activity, proposal activity and leases that are being negotiated 280 Park Avenue in particular. We have a number of transactions that are pending over there, reminding ourselves we don\u2019t have a lot of space left in the building at this point, but we\u2019re on track to basically knock off of the square footage in that building. And every deal that we\u2019re negotiating right now is a financial services tenant. We\u2019ve also seen some increased activity at 10 East 53rd Street, also dominated by financial services. So, it feels like that sector is back in the market, they\u2019ve got some new enthusiasm and we\u2019re hopeful that we\u2019re going to see more activity throughout the year.", "John Kim", "And then conversely as far as policy changes or potential changes, how concerned are you about a potential 1031 exchange \u2013 especially being one of the most active REITs as far as \u2013 capital.", "Marc Holliday ", "1031 is something that we\u2019ve utilized in the past as a mechanism for like-like exchanges and we\u2019re first and foremost optimistic that the new administration will continue to recognize the benefits to the country as a whole in terms of allowing like-for-like without - taxation. If it does happen, I don\u2019t see that being all that impactful to the way we operate. We have certainly demonstrated an ability to sell [indiscernible] assets, monetize assets in ways other than 1031 but still comply with all regulations for, not triggering current gains but rather differing gains this position and there\u2019s always other elements that are available to us such as dividend out the cash or timing sales for when you have excess shield in depreciation so that we can time these events to minimize or eliminate the tax burden if any.", "I think we\u2019ve done that as good as anyone in the sector over the 20 years because we\u2019ve been sort of the highest net disposer of assets or interest in assets. I think Matt and Maggie and Mike and the team has done an extraordinarily good, thorough and logical job at guiding us through all of the various requirements for maximizing retain cash for shareholders and minimizing tax impact. We\u2019ll keep our eye on 1031, but I would say it\u2019s not something that we look at as having as much of an effect on a company like us as it might have on other parts of the community particularly individual owners who look to get out of projects with low bases into other projects that are more secure and have long-term cash flow nature. It\u2019s part of the state planning, it should remain that way into the future, but we\u2019ll just have to see what happens.", "John Kim", "Okay, thanks for the color.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Great. Thank you. So, I guess Steve, just following up on your commentary obviously seeing pretty optimistic and have heard similar from one of the other REIT landlords. But when we speak to the brokers, they seem a little bit more subdue, they talk about increase of concession, sort of black market why would anyone pay hike north of $100 rent. So just -- is it a matter of it\u2019s a difference between landlords talking about specific buildings whereas when people are looking at the overall market, the overall market is still slow or is it that I\u2019m just trying to reconcile the two of \u2013 the building specific stuff or there are some trends in the market that are slowly building, they haven\u2019t gone through the full city yet, but given your commentary you\u2019d expect that we\u2019d start to see that ripple through the rest of the market over the course of this year.", "Steven Durels", "Right. Well with all due respect to the brokers\u2019 community, they frequently have a point of view that\u2019s either in their research reports that are trailing statistics - statistics were trailed with what\u2019s happening in the field and the broker feedback is sort of just of the moment reflective of whatever their current activity level is. The owners I think are better source of insight because we have a good visibility as to the deals that are actually getting signed, term sheets that we\u2019re considering versus other, one deal versus another and how the broader perspective as to the types of businesses that are coming through our door, whether it\u2019d be tour activity, proposal activity or actual leases that we\u2019re signing. So not surprised to hear you say that but in my travels, I think most brokers are fairly optimistic right now, I don\u2019t get a lot of negativity back from them over the past 30-45 days. So we\u2019ll see how the year unfolds but we\u2019re still feeling very strong.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "And as far as the One Vanderbilt JV announcement, sort of a two part; one, just curious the involvement of Hines, I thought you already had \u2013 as a construction manager and you guys seemed to hire a dedicated team internally. And then the other part of that is the equity commitment of not less than $525 million, does that mean the JV partners haven\u2019t paid you guys cash yet, they\u2019re just committed to fund the rest of the equity component of it and therefore SL Green has no more equity that needs to be funded in One Vandy?", "Marc Holliday ", "I would -- and again, I think we diagramed this out in December that our money was in I forget the number that we flashed up December, I want to say $894 million was left to fund and we\u2019ll be funding that alongside of our JV partners over the balance of the field in our respective ratios. But that was the way we\u2019ve always described it and the way we went out to the market. So maybe that\u2019s just a clarification, but we\u2019ve always shown it as such in whatever we put up there publicly. What was the other question? Hines? Well Hines is -- Hines has been there with us from the outset, so they\u2019re not new to the table, they\u2019ve been --", "Unidentified Company Representative", "[Indiscernible] involvement in partnership.", "Marc Holliday", "Yeah. They\u2019ve been a co-development manager in this project I think since 2012. So the only thing that\u2019s changed now is the Hines principles have invested significant amount of their own personal cash into the deal alongside NPS which sometimes they do and I think sometimes they don\u2019t. So we took it as an enormous vote of confidence from Gerry Hines and Tommy Craig and Chris Hughes and the whole team who sort of wanted as much as they could get, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m overstating it in saying that, but this is what we felt made sense. We could have gone deeper, but I think what I said in my opening remarks is we should try to strike a balance between bringing a sizeable amount of equity capital to defray future funding obligations while not selling off too much upside too early and may be there\u2019s no exact number but this one felt to be just right. And that\u2019s how we came to this 71-29 venture.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay. Thanks, Marc.", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Jamie Feldman", "Great. Thank you. Can you provide some color on the transaction market and foreign flows and what you\u2019ve seen since I know the Investor Day was shortly after the election, but just any changes on where capital is coming from and interesting assets in New York City?", "Andrew Mathias", "Jamie, it\u2019s Andrew. I think it\u2019s been status quo which is to say an enormous amount of foreign interest. Obviously we announced the Korean deal this morning, so that\u2019s one data point. You still have a lot of the assets on the market that we spoke about on Investor Day, people are actively touring and so we\u2019re getting rid to bid on those assets. And we\u2019ve also closed several financings in the interim between investor conference and now and some of those financings have come from notable foreign capital sources. So, I think -- we haven\u2019t seen any change in terms of foreign demand since the election.", "Jamie Feldman", "Is there any shift in underwriting or change in underwriting outlooks? And is there a shift in the type like where money is coming from versus may be where the interest has been in the last couple of years?", "Marc Holliday", "Not that I\u2019ve seen. I mean Isaac anything -- in terms of the brokers\u2019 guidance from their conversation, I think it\u2019s still the same pool of suspects and targets.", "Isaac Zion ", "Yes, I agree.", "Marc Holliday", "And in terms of underwriting, people haven\u2019t modified their year.", "Isaac Zion", "You\u2019ll see a little bit more activity from the newer players and we sort of mentioned that at the end of the year as well like Japanese are a little more active. Clearly, the Koreans are a little more active, so still the larger players from around the world are still actively engaged in trying to find [indiscernible]", "Jamie Feldman", "Okay. And then we\u2019re hearing there\u2019s just going to be fewer assets on the market this year than the last couple of years, just more in the hands of long-term holders. How should we think about what that means for your debt and preferred equity business and the opportunity set if \u2013 deals?", "Marc Holliday ", "I don\u2019t know I don\u2019t want to take that as a presumption. I don\u2019t know that we agree there\u2019s going to be less fields I\u2019m not quite sure who\u2019s saying that. I mean we see a fairly significant pipeline of deals Isaac do you have any\u2026", "Isaac Zion ", "Right. Well right now in terms of what we\u2019re tracking, there\u2019s close to $20 billion of assets on the market, there\u2019s already been a $1 billion trade this year and there\u2019s another three or four that are actively being talked about now, they\u2019re actively being toured.", "Marc Holliday ", "Yeah and that billion includes the NPS deal this morning?", "Isaac Zion", "No, no.", "Marc Holliday", "So, I\u2019m not \u2013 I guess I would start by saying, I don\u2019t think we see necessarily a slowdown clearly from \u201815 that was kind of a peak year, \u201816 levels sort of reset themselves in the second half of the year but I don\u2019t see why \u201817 wouldn\u2019t be as on par with if not slightly ahead of second half of \u201816. I would actually say to you that\u2019s our expectation I would further say that on the heels of successfully concluding a major, major re-cap of 11 Madison I don\u2019t want to forget that one, that wasn\u2019t too long ago I know the memory here is sometimes quite short, but that was surely within the past six months domestic partner on the $2.6 billion transaction for 40% of that deal. Now we\u2019ve got One Vanderbilt re-cap behind us, you should expect will contribute certainly probably another big sale or re-cap to the market as they\u2019re both simultaneously out there looking very actively for new deals.", "Jamie Feldman", "Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Manny Korchman", "Good afternoon everyone. Marc, may be Steve, can you talk more about the relationship between pushing rents and maintaining occupancy if those are sort of both your goal? And how do you think about retention in that context?", "Steven Durels", "Well, I think our ability to push rents \u2013 let\u2019s just talk about the market overall. Our mark-to-market is going to stay healthy this year, so that\u2019s one measure of unlocking the embedded value in the portfolio. The overall ability to push rents is obviously a function of the health of the market and if leasing stays on paced with last year, then there should be pretty good absorption, less supply therefore there\u2019s good opportunity that rents will continue to increase this year. And we have the portfolio that\u2019s sort of in the sweet spot of the market to take advantage of that. The majority of our portfolio is in that sort of value play price point kind of the $60 to $80 price point and that\u2019s where a lot of the activity has been most recently. Reminding ourselves of last year\u2019s 2.5 million square feet of net absorption in the market, so if that supply comes off, there should be some pricing pressure. And as far as retention renewals, Marc started off by reminding you that there\u2019s less than 900,000 square feet of roll and that is clearly a function of a lot of hard years in advance of attending to early renewals which is always and has been and continues to be a top priority for the firm.", "Marc Holliday ", "Yeah, so I mean I think generally, better leased you are, the more you can try to drive economics to the point at which you feel you optimize them and the difference between crossing the finish line or not, I mean we tend to cross the finish line than anybody else, but clearly we have our goals set out for ourselves in our budget and if our net effectives don\u2019t lend where we think they can or should, then we\u2019ll hold our rents and take a little more vacancy and wait to make our rents, but more often than not, I think we have as good a barometer of anyone that fine line where supply and demand meet and where to make a deal and maximize our net effectives while keeping occupancy at 97.", "Steven Durels", "The other thing to add to that is with our high level of occupancy and low rollover, these are the times that we put a lot of emphasis on making sure that we\u2019re trying to uptick the quality of our credit within the portfolio. So, as we have tenants that are rolling out that are weaker credit, we use this as an opportunity to call some of that out.", "Manny Korchman", "Great. And then on the One Vanderbilt JV, could you just talk about how the partners would share in any cost savings or cost overruns? So for example, if cost came in $100 million less than you thought, would the equity check be smaller, would they get a larger share of the project, how would that sort of pan out?", "Marc Holliday ", "I would just look as it\u2019s a pro rata JV I mean there\u2019s no preps\u2026", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Side by side, overruns and JV.", "Manny Korchman", "Got it. Thank you.", "Marc Holliday", "Otherwise there\u2019s no opportunity for the partners to rise above 29%.", "Manny Korchman", "Got it. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lewis with SunTrust. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Michael Lewis", "Thank you. A couple of weeks back there was an article about the 625 Madison and I believe Andrew was even quoted in the article, so I don\u2019t need him to repeat everything that was said there. But I\u2019m wondering if what you think about the potential for significant mark-up signing ground leases and are there any that are close that may be you have negotiations already?? I know the 626 Madison won\u2019t start till 2021 so maybe that\u2019s a little further out, but is there anything that might be a surprise there?", "Andrew Mathias", "It\u2019s Andrew. I don\u2019t think -- there\u2019s a nature tension there obviously between fee holder and lease holder. That situation is only unique because we do own a fee interest across the street from 625 and the leaseholder on that property is the fee owner on 625. So, we have sort of the exact inverse position and we\u2019re going to do our best to try to affect a good outcome there. We\u2019re very cautious in terms of the leasehold positions. We take on and we\u2019ve been through probably more revaluations than any other firm in the city. So we understand the way appraisers look at these calculations when they\u2019re set. I don\u2019t think across our portfolio there\u2019s any other situation which should get that higher level of concern, 625 is probably the biggest pending revaluation we have. We have successfully revalued leasehold positions at 420 Lexington, The Graybar Building, 711 Third Avenue and many of our other assets. So it\u2019s sort of part of ongoing business here in New York.", "Michael Lewis", "Perfect. Thanks. My second question is as we all kind of evaluate the new administration in Washington and what that means, obviously a lot of the financial stocks have run - people have asked about that already on this call. How do you think about potential upside from your tenants for example, if the fiduciary rule doesn\u2019t go through, is that kind of a -- do you think that\u2019s a game changer in your space for demand or corporate tax rates get rolled back, does that dramatically kind of change your outlook?", "Marc Holliday", "I don\u2019t know if we can quantify bank profits, bank demand to the roll back or modification of the fiduciary rule or not, obviously it\u2019s sort of binary, it would appear to be helpful if it was repealed or at least certain aspects of it were reformed. But I don\u2019t know if we can quantify it as to what it would mean. I think that \u2013 we look at these things a little bit more generally in terms of the psychology of tenants who are making lease commitments into what they think are going to be a positive three to five years forward, always want to air on the side making sure they allow for enough growth and opportunity so they don\u2019t get themselves boxed in by making a long-term 10 or 15 year deal and calling their growth and their space incorrectly.", "So I think that looking at that along with whole host of other economic reforms that are likely to impact not just the finance sector but legal sector and otherwise, we think that on balance, tenants will be a little bit more aggressive or should say defensive, would be a little more defensive when it comes to their own space and making sure, A, they\u2019re acting early to lock in rents now as opposed to what they might be increasing to in the next few years; B, making sure they have some growth space to accommodate positive economic conditions; C, flexibility so that if things don\u2019t pan out the way they wanted to, they have the ability to sublease, assign or small shedding rights. That will just unbalance we think tip tenants more towards an active market for this year and we\u2019re starting to see that sentiment take place now.", "I know there\u2019s been couple of questions now on finance sector which is important because it\u2019s over 30% of our market, but I wouldn\u2019t overlook the substantial amount of dollars that might come into New York as part of any kind of major infrastructure spending bill because there are a number of shovel ready projects throughout New York that are kind of well-defined whether it would be the Gateway project, the tubes under the Hudson or Second Avenue Subway line extension now that the first part of the Second Avenue Subway is complete or continue funding to complete East side access, bringing LIRR into Grand Central or the major, major redevelopment projects that will be taking place at LaGuardia and JFK. So that\u2019s just to name a few and that\u2019s like -- it\u2019s probably $50 billion of projects plus or minus and that\u2019s not comprehensive. So that kind of excess activity, that kind of financial inflow could affect a lot more than just the financial sector, obviously we\u2019ll just have to wait and see what of that comes to fruition, how much New York is able to allocate towards it projects relative to the rest of the country and how quickly it happens.", "Michael Lewis", "Interesting times. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Thank you. Good afternoon. So just to get a little more clarity on the last point about the broader market, just in terms of your pipeline, if I remember correctly, may be three to six months ago you had mentioned that financial formed a very small part of the pipeline. Can you give us a bit more color on sort of what makes up the pipeline by price point and end market today?", "Steven Durels", "Here\u2019s a good statistic to answer that, of the leases that we have out right now, 45% of the square footage are leases with financial services businesses. And of the deals that are term sheet proposals, probably a smaller percentage but still a very meaningful portion of the pipeline. And I think if any of our percentage of deals done sort of trail away from financial services, it\u2019s probably going to be more of a function of the type of products that we are starting to lease up and we\u2019re going to run out of that inventory and therefore, it won\u2019t be -- financial services means we won\u2019t have the right space for them. But for the inventory we\u2019ve got right now, it\u2019s a very meaningful part of the deal flow.", "Vikram Malhotra", "And it\u2019s still in that sort of $70 midpoint range?", "Steven Durels", "Or higher, or materially higher quite frankly.", "Vikram Malhotra", "And just so my second question, given that you\u2019ve done so much forward leasing and you\u2019ve taken down so much of the space still left to do this year. Does this sort of allow you to focus may be even more, put more resources towards One Vanderbilt and does this any way change your timeline that you had shared with us at the Investor Day in terms of lease-up?", "Marc Holliday", "I would say with the announcement of the JV today that probably is directionally devoting less resources to One Vanderbilt. Our resources in the One Vanderbilt are fixed if we\u2019re talking about monetary resources. If we\u2019re talking about human resources, there is a completely up and running team that\u2019s kind of designated separate, it\u2019s marketing, it\u2019s building every day. So that\u2019s not going up or down depending on what happens to the rest of portfolio. I think what it means is that what we do best developing or redeveloping all these buildings, we\u2019re going to take a hard look first at our internal portfolio and see what\u2019s the next great redevelopment project that we can execute over the next couple of years like we did at 100 Park, 10 East 53rd, 3 Columbus etcetera, etcetera, I mean on and on and on, I mean that\u2019s our bread and butter stock and trade. And trying to lift those rents up whatever they are $10, $15, $20 put post-redevelopment. So we actually have one or two projects in our sites now for that purpose, just lending themselves for considerations due to some lease roll in \u201818 and \u201819 that would make that favorable. And also as Isaac said earlier there is $20 billion of -- so we hope to get our fair share of looks and opportunities within that portfolio, some of those are on market, some of those are off market within that $20 billion is proprietary, that\u2019s not $20 billion total brokered. So that\u2019s our tracking list and we would fully expect to convert some opportunities there to create more opportunity for leasing as we max out the portfolio. But that\u2019s just basically what we always do and have been doing. So that\u2019s where I\u2019d see the focus shift for \u201817.", "Isaac Zion", "The other thing to add to that on One Vanderbilt, the lease up timeline there is not a function of resources or tenant demand, that\u2019s really a function of construction timeline. We\u2019re still roughly four years out before we deliver it and being realistic about when tenants are going to make decisions that really needs to be more within the 20-24 months timeline before going to delivery as to when tenants are going to pull the trigger on those decisions. So that\u2019s why 2018 is really more of the target date for significant lease up.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Great. Thank you for the color.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Nick Yulico", "Thanks. Just following up on One Vanderbilt, Steve, could you may be talk about some of the latest types of lease discussions you have in there, types of tenant size? And it sounds like you have some good activity there yet you are saying 2018 is more likely to get some announced, but wondering what are the chances of actually getting a lease done at some point this year because the demand is good?", "Marc Holliday", "I mean Steve will answer, but again, Nick, it would be no different than the same we\u2019re sitting here now working on our 2021 expirations. We\u2019re just not. It\u2019s too far out. Every year and you know as well as anybody, we work on expirations current year, a year out and then maybe we\u2019ll knock off some 2019s. Four tenants that are anywhere between that 50,000 foot to 250,000 foot range, that not just what I\u2019ll call customary, it\u2019s almost exclusive that the leasing activity we do in that size range really won\u2019t \u2013 sitting here at the beginning of \u201817 won\u2019t really extend beyond \u201819 certainly nothing in \u201820 or \u201821.", "So that\u2019s the same analogy of saying hey, you\u2019re going to get One Vandy lease up or at least cut this year. We might, because it\u2019s not unprecedented, that we could do some early leasing in \u201820 and \u201821 but if you back over our 20 year history, it\u2019s just not how the market moves. It\u2019s not a statement about the market, it\u2019s not a statement about the building to the contrary the receptivity of tenants have been I would term extraordinary and the same degree of confidence we had in getting it financed, finding our equity partner, we have been getting it fully leased up at best in market range, but I would just cautionary - realistic to the timeframes when those side tenants will make commitments because typically you\u2019re looking one to two to may be \u2013 years out for physical occupancy. So with that, Steve.", "Steven Durels", "I think you really need to look at the lease up at One Vanderbilt as a marathon, right? This is not a sprint, it\u2019s a marathon. The efforts that are being invested today are really just to educate the brokers\u2019 community, get the word out so people understand what the product is, we\u2019re doing a good number of tenant presentations, but again, it\u2019s very early in those tenants\u2019 decision timelines. And it\u2019s not a one presentation, get a proposal, make a deal kind of exercise, it\u2019s a \u2013 you make a presentation and if you\u2019re talking to one tenant, it ultimately gets through a term sheet, you\u2019re probably making five or six or seven presentations as you sort of work up the corporate hierarchy inside an organization to build consensus on a long-term decision like this. But it\u2019s a lot of hard work, a lot of time and we\u2019re at very early stages.", "Nick Yulico", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then Marc, just going back to your comments before about looking for some more opportunity in your market or in your own portfolio and thinking about over the last year you\u2019ve reduced your leverage, you have managed your expiration scheduling, you\u2019re trying to keep occupancy high. And so now it sounds like you\u2019ve may be become a little bit more optimistic about doing projects or may be the market I mean what\u2019s kind of shifted in that thinking?", "Marc Holliday", "I don\u2019t know that I did really clarify the shift I\u2019d say in most years, 7 out of 10 were the most acquisitive in the markets. So I would say last year if nothing else, One Vandy did take a lot of attention I think appropriately so. We settled litigation, with construction financing in place, we\u2019ve got the JV equity in place, the project is now almost 80% bought which is extraordinary at numbers we\u2019ll sort of be able to give you guys better update on come our April call, but I feel very good about the numbers we presented in December and may be there\u2019ll be savings for those numbers. There was a moment in time, we\u2019ve got the 11 Mad JV done, we did how much 3 million square feet lease \u2013 something, so I would just say that was the right thing at the moment and right now, it\u2019s not that there\u2019s any shift I would say, it\u2019s what we would traditionally do is go out there and hunt typically off market deals where we think we can go in, bring our value add brand and approach to anything in midtown Manhattan or South to 23rd Downtown and create value, I\u2019d say for us it\u2019s almost like a formula, it\u2019s a recipe. I\u2019m confident we can do it. We have an extraordinary amount of capacity right now to do it which will even be enhanced because as I said earlier I think we\u2019re also going to be looking to roll out one other big project, let\u2019s say in 2017 on the heels of One Vanderbilt or JV. So there will be -- hopefully this will be a year of opportunity, but consistent with other years, think back to growth portfolio 1O and 2O those were laden with opportunities and I think we will have our share of that this year.", "Nick Yulico", "Appreciate it.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "John Guinee", "Thank you. Marc in an effort to just to get to a current valuation of One Vanderbilt, is it possible to provide how much total cash needs to be spent, someone can then plug in their expectation of gross value and subtract out construction spend over the next three or four years to come out to a current value today?", "Marc Holliday", "We put \u2013 I\u2019d rather than do \u2013 we can do those calculations, I don\u2019t know if have it here, we can \u2013 let me refer back to the numbers in December. We put the wholesome budget up there, this \u2013 what do you got there Matt? So it\u2019s about call it \u2013 at least the sources news we put up in December, amounted to $3.2 billion of which $1.5 billion was the construction financing, the balance is equity either funded to-date or remaining to fund. I think at the time we said it was $895 million left to fund, so that is what\u2019s left to fund. So the project is about $3.2 billion of total cost with I guess \u2013 commission everything else it probably gets up to a number of close to 3.3 in change that\u2019s the basis upon which NPS and Hines bought into the deal, it\u2019s not obviously not reflective of our basis and we put those numbers in December, but that\u2019s the magnitude of the project, that\u2019s the amount of debt financing for the project, the balance is equity and of what\u2019s left to fund $525 million we put [indiscernible] partners.", "John Guinee", "So overly simplistic if people think that the asset is worth $3.3 billion and that you have $2.4 billion remaining to be spent, a fair valuation as of today is roughly $900 million. If someone thinks that this assets were 2,500 a foot or $4 billion at stabilization, you have $2.4 billion left to spend the quick math is it\u2019s worth $1.6 billion. So I\u2019m just trying to get to a very simple way to put it in people\u2019s NAV.", "Marc Holliday", "So what it\u2019s worth depends on what you think is worth at residual. I think and again, I\u2019m doing this little bit by memory, so I want to have my proper \u2013 disclaimer. I think we put like around $200 million or so of stabilized NOI I don\u2019t know if we have that number here. So I think John it will come to I don\u2019t know what cap rates you want to apply to that and then you can sort of back into on a present basis what the value is you want to put in \u2013 by the way, the value is extraordinary, whatever, I mean you can make an argument for sub - cap because it will be I think the best building in Manhattan, you can argue for a forcap[ph] you want to be highly conservative I guess four in a quarter, four in half, I mean that\u2019s in the eye of the holder. So I\u2019m looking here $198 million of NOI base case rented 155 foot average in $2,028. So that\u2019s -- I don\u2019t want to put a number out there because there is no singular number, it\u2019s how do you want to value $200 million to stabilize NOI for this kind of building which I would say will be the trophy of trophies in Manhattan upon completion.", "John Guinee", "Great. Okay.", "Marc Holliday", "And therefore I think the number is very substantial.", "John Guinee", "Okay, perfect. Then the next thing is I was looking at I guess for Matt, I look at page one which sorry page 21 on your sup which looks like you\u2019re on about an $840 million cash NOI $210 million in the fourth quarter times four gets you about $840 million. But then looking at your cash NOI assumptions in your Investor Day, they add up to that $900 million. Is there a bridge between the fourth quarter reported on page 21 and your Investor Day numbers?", "Matthew DiLiberto", "Yeah that is in large part the 3.2 million of square feet of leasing for what hasn\u2019t commenced yet rolling through the numbers. So we have in total a million square feet of leases that have signed and not yet been commenced about 350,000 square feet of which is vacant space. So that will contribute the bulk of the growth in the portfolio over the course of 2017. Of course, offsetting that is a little bit of roll off, we said we have vacancy coming at 45 Lex and 220 is 42nd. But that leasing has a 6 to 12 month lag on it that Steve did in 2016 rolling through 2017 that are the bulk of that bridge John.", "John Guinee", "Great. Thank you very much. Talk to you in a quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Jed Reagan", "Hi, good afternoon guys. It looks like leasing cost in your portfolio picked up quite a bit in the fourth quarter and would you say those levels are representative of where the market concessions are now? And may be just if you could comment generally on the trends you\u2019re seeing across the market in terms of leasing cost?", "Matthew DiLiberto", "Just so we\u2019re clear, define picked up quite a bit, what are we talking about?", "Marc Holliday", "I think the TIs were up modestly I didn\u2019t see \u2013 which large increase you\u2019re referring to?", "Jed Reagan", "Just in terms of concessions as a percent of first year rent so it\u2019s like\u2026", "Marc Holliday", "No, I got it just want to get to the number, I have Matt looking at the numbers.", "Matthew DiLiberto", "So Jed, you clear you\u2019re looking at the $48 of TI compared to $40 last quarter?", "Marc Holliday ", "Is that what you\u2019re referring to or is there something more than that? We\u2019re not hearing you Jed. That wasn\u2019t us, we didn\u2019t cut you off Jed.", "Matthew DiLiberto", "Jed we\u2019re not hearing you but Steve\u2019s going to answer your question\u2026", "Marc Holliday ", "So let me answer the question, I would first say if we\u2019re talking about TI, I think there was sort of a modest increase which I think that\u2019s just sort of fluctuation specific leases, month to month. Why don\u2019t you address that?", "Steven Durels", "So it\u2019s really driven by a number of deals where the higher rent price point deals and they carried the higher TI allowances rather us doing a build to \u2013 toward giving a greater amount of cash contributions. Something that you\u2019ve seen in the market before, but I think there\u2019s this perception that it\u2019s up across the entire market, not really true. It\u2019s really the high priced point of the market. So in our case, we had a number of deals that were signed in the fourth quarter that were rents in the 85-95 plus kind of range and not surprisingly, those carry a bigger contribution. And if that was a bigger part of our leasing for that particular quarter, it averaged up. So, I think we expect to see a more moderate level in the first quarter of this year.", "Marc Holliday", "Jed, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re still with us, but if you are, we looked at 17 budgeted concessions which we feel pretty good about versus 16 concessions, that\u2019s all new leases for \u201816 versus all new leases for \u201817. We actually have TIs and free rent as a total concession package flat to down year-over-year from 17 to 16. So again, I\u2019m not exactly sure where the increases are coming from which you\u2019re referring to but I think A, we see them as relatively steady for the bulk of the market other \u2013 they may be the very high end of Steve Durels just referred to and also more importantly from my perspective is I think we budgeted properly before that in 2017 so that we still should be right on the numbers of what we showed everybody in December. Alright. I guess that is it. We\u2019ll check if there are no more questions in queue. Jed?", "Jed Reagan", "Thanks for that color. Just one more if I may, with respect to the planned observation deck, does the pro forma forecast you guys laid out last month, does that assume there\u2019ll be a fifth observation deck at the Hudson yard? And do you think that deck opens before One Vanderbilt\u2019s?", "Marc Holliday", "Yeah, no that was \u2013 we\u2019ve had two or three different firms do studies. Those studies obviously look at existing but also look at future proposed and then they come up with expected market share for each. I think what --", "Matthew DiLiberto", "Both those -- are well aware of the plan deck of the Hudson Yard.", "Marc Holliday", "So the answer is yes, it incorporates it. Even with that, I think the numbers they came up to which we showed you in that \u2013 in December it was I think 1.9 million visitors a year if I\u2019m not wrong plus or minus. Capacity for the deck will be closer to 2.5-2.6 million, we think it will be much closer to capacity than it will be towards the kind of fair share projected because we do think it will be sort of an extraordinary best class up deck, but if you sort of look at them as all equal, that\u2019s the kind of numbers we flashed up in December. We\u2019ll take one more question operator, then we\u2019re going to wrap up.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Craig Mailman", "Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just curious your thoughts here on direction of cap rates, if long-term and short-term rates continue to migrate higher and that effect has kind of remain under pressure.", "Matthew DiLiberto", "I think \u2013 interest rates obviously we can\u2019t predict, but we have seen debt providers continue to be very aggressive and we see spreads I would say steady to even compressing as rates rise which often happens because you have bond buyers often target to an all yield as opposed to spread the treasuries. So, the cost of financing I think it\u2019s held barely stable and we don\u2019t project any big movement in cap rates, that notwithstanding we\u2019re looking at the curve of interest rates like everybody else and if something should dramatically exceed expectations in the curve, we wouldn\u2019t rule out the impact that could have on cap rates. But we think that that\u2019s unlikely this year and as we said that that demand which is really a lot of factors underlying it but a safe haven demand, currency demand and overall sort of growth expectation of New York, we find to be very fairly isolated from interest rates and we don\u2019t expect to see any big moves based on it.", "Marc Holliday", "Hey Craig, thank you for the question and I want to make sure for everyone who is still listening, we make sure not to let pass by the opportunity to celebrate the moment where just prior to this call, there was a press release as I understand from S&P that hit the wires just before the call started, upgrading the outlook for SL Green to positive from stable so obviously a step towards a ratings upgrade we would certainly hope in the future. This is the first important step so we now have two different agencies Fitch and S&P that have come out with outlook increases I think in the past 45 to 60 days or so which I think is a testament to the extraordinary job we and in particular Matt and Maggie and the team have done shepherding the balance sheet to probably the lowest levels of leverage, highest levels of debt service coverage and capacity we\u2019ve had as a company I think ever. So A, congratulations; B, all this means is that we\u2019re now going to have to relook at our goals for the year as we had talked about two upgrades, may be we\u2019ll have to talk about three upgrades based on the next call. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll get into that, but we\u2019re certainly very happy with S&P\u2019s affirmation today and Fitch\u2019s affirmation a month or two ago. So thank you everyone and look forward to speaking to you on the next call.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference.

This conference call is being recorded.", "At this time, the Company would like to remind listeners that during the call, Management may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from the forward-looking statements that Management may make today. Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the Company's Form 10-K and other reports filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "Also during today's conference call, the Company may also discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G, the GAAP financial measures most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure discussed and the reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on the Company's website at www.slgreen.com, by selecting the press release regarding the Company's first quarter 2017 earnings.", "Before turning the call over to Marc Holliday, Chief Executive Officer of SL Green Realty Corp., I ask that those of you participating in the Q&A portion of the call, please limit yourself to two questions per person. Thank you.", "I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.", "Marc Holliday", "Good afternoon, all, and thank you calling in today. It's hard to believe that the book is already closed on the first quarter. More typical let down in activity we often see in the winter months was certainly not appearing this year as we had a very active quarter with solid results. I\u2019ll hit some highlights and convey to you some observations on how our markets are performing, before opening up the phone for questions.", "On the demand front, our leasing performance was ahead of budget and we remain on track to meet or exceed our leasing goals for the year. We concluded leases for nearly 350,000 square feet of Manhattan office space within the portfolio having a 21% mark-to-market, supporting our December projections of market activity in Midtown.", "Since the end of the quarter, we signed another 70,000 square feet of deals and our current pipeline is actually expanded from the last quarter to a total of 665,000 square of leases and term sheets currently in negotiation. This pipeline represents over 50 transactions almost entirely made up of deals for space that are 50,000 square feet and under reflecting the highly lease nature of our portfolio.", "At this point, we are really just filling in pockets of space around the portfolio and renewing our bigger exposures which are scheduled to be happening in the future generally occurring within the next 24 to 34 months so that we keep maintaining our industry-leading average lease terms of 10-years plus and we keep our near-term rollovers for the balance of 2017, 2018 and then into 2019 at very, very low levels relative to the total portfolio size of about 28 million square feet.", "A particular note, we're generating this leasing activity while still holding the line on tenant concessions. Our average TI for renewal deals was just under $20 per square foot for the quarter and just around $63 per square feet for new deals. This represents levels well below what we incurred throughout all of 2016 which makes our rental achievements for the quarter I believe that much more impressive.", "We certainly read the reports and we\u2019re aware of certain deals will take a different approach and buy up the rents with outsize TI packages. While these occurrences are infrequent in terms of you know number of deals in the market where we see that occurring, they often do get a lot of scrutiny enough variety and I think that elevates to a level that indicates a trend which really we don't see within our portfolio but our philosophy is to lease at the market and hold the line on tenant concessions and we encourage shareholders to take note of the varying approaches to leasing, none being right or wrong different.", "On the retail leasing front, certainly our success is we're not limited to office as we carry out our business plan to re-let substantially all of the space vacated by arrow style last year and to do so it rents that will ultimately result in a 30% mark-to-market relative to the old arrow rent.", "The lease we previously announced with the Korean technology giant, LINE FRIENDS, combined with a just recently announced retail leased to Viacom is certainly further proof of SL Green's ability to outperform the market with respect to retail, as well as office. In fact, we currently only have two spaces available within our high street retail portfolio with limited explorations to 2018 and in those limited instances we believe we will have the opportunity to substantially increase our rents due to the below-market nature of what's rolling.", "While there are fewer retailers in the market at the moment, we certainly have a different retail story to tell as our high street portfolio continues to be a source of extraordinary earnings growth and profitability and I think this was crystallized in our recent announcement yesterday regarding one or two Green Street where we entered into an agreement to sell a 90% interest in the property and an attractive valuations to the Company due to the expectations of our ability to lease that space and favorable market rates in the near-term.", "So these balance leasing markets both in the office and retail sides of the equation are supported continued high property valuations and I think this is evidenced on the largest of the sales with the sale 245 Park Avenue which trophy asset that traded hands to a Chinese purchaser with several others including ourselves in pursuit.", "This transaction shows that private institutional demand in contrast to public read equity markets is still significant with what seems like literally amount of equity capital searching for high quality deals in Manhattan.", "I\u2019ll sort of wrap this with a discussion of some of our achievements relating to our One Vanderbilt development project in the first quarter and then we\u2019ll take some questions. There's a lot that went on in the first quarter, I\u2019m happy to say that we are really starting to feel the excitement and the enthusiasm of this development project as we complete our excavation, we begun our foundation walls, we will be laying our first deal in June and by the end of this year, we would expect to have five or six floors of steel rising from base level of the project.", "In furtherance of that, Tishman construction has signed the GMP with us for the entire construction cost of the project and I'm happy to say that that GMP was signed below the low-end of our what we call the goalpost, the low end of our goalpost budget. So we have experienced some savings to date with our 80% procurement and we expect to be able to deliver the other 20% of procurement at or below budget as well and you know essentially a big element of risk in the project has now been assumed by Tishman not just for construction costs but also milestone scheduling all of which I believe will lead us to a very well executed development that will be delivered both on time and under budget.", "So we were happy to report that and that was done in conjunction within a matter of days of having received from the city of New York our building permit. So it's good to know that we can actually go forward and officially build this project. We've cleared, we took about six or nine months of hurdles with the city to submit all the plans and go through all the requisite, inspections and meet all the different requirements to be eligible for this permit. We now have it so we are completely green light to go in that regard.", "Obviously we talked about previously in the first quarter of closing of our joint venture for approximately 29% of the equity with the Korean pension fund service and with Hines investors. And that obviously 71% of the project with us but with $525 million equity commitment that we now have in the project combined with the $1.5 billion of construction financing which is locked and loaded, our future equity commitment to the project between now and 2020 is less than $100 million a year and we feel that this project is now extraordinarily well-capitalized and able to be completed so that really all focus at this point can be put on marketing and leasing at this space while the construction group carries out the construction project.", "And to that end, in furtherance of our marketing efforts, I would say we achieved a sort of a pivotal moment and the deal where we were able to partner with one of the most renowned chefs and restaurant tours in the country perhaps in the world Daniel Boulud. And we are extremely happy to have announced just days ago our partnership with Daniel to construct and operate a 11,000 square-foot restaurant on the second floor of One Vanderbilt, I think really marking a point of, not just fine dining which is certainly will be but really a whole rebirth of great restaurants in this Midtown area.", "This restaurant I think in particular will be leading the way not only for the local business folks and in residents and tourists but also for tenants of this building this will be an extraordinary amenity in terms of the food offerings that will be made available to tenants in a number of different ways throughout the building.", "So, all in all great progress in three months happy to report that, and it really I think sets up well for a hope will continue to be very successful 12 to 18 month marketing efforts as we continue to meet with tenants on our path towards being able to sign-up some leases which we know had rolled out. Our expectations for that both last December again January a lot of that happening towards the middle and end of 2018. So, that's the report on One Vanderbilt and the quarter.", "With that operator why don\u2019t we open up the calls for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets.", "John Kim", "Thank you. Marc I wanted to ask if you can elaborate on your views on the pricing of 245 Park Avenue, do you think this is a high watermark as far as price per square foot for the size and how will this impact pricing for properties like Worldwide Plaza and 1515 Broadway if at all?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, let me first speak about 245. I don\u2019t really see it as a higher watermark, I mean it's about 1240 foot or so depending on I guess, you know, what foot you're using, but let's call it right around 1200, 1250 foot. That I think for trophy asset and quality location is somewhere between average, maybe even below-average. I think the best building in New York today have commanded and I think will continue to command $1500 a square feet and higher, the best building new construction 1800 square feet to 2000 feet.", "So that to me - if you want to add high watermarks, they'd be looking at 1800, 2000 feet for that's the construction in new - in best locations 1200 a foot, I think is unto itself unremarkable I would look at the yields going in cap rate on that, its reportedly somewhere around between 4.8% and 5% again depending on exactly how you would go about measuring that.", "And I think when - most importantly the proper for measurement is what kind of expected returns would a investor be able to see a project like that and I think is very consistent with returns where they've been marked for assets sold in '15 and '16 and beginning of '17, I would say unlevered IRRs approaching 6% and levered IRRs is of depending on how much leverage you put on to 8% and 8.5%.", "So I think you heard on these calls before 6%, 8%. 6% unlevered, 8% levered for trophy assets completely in line and I think completely understandable in an environment where borrowing costs are 4% or less for conventional level of financing. It's an excellent asset and I trust the buyer will be quite happy with this particular purchase over the long haul.", "John Kim", "Can you provide an update on 1515 Broadway and what the potential use of proceeds going to be?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, an update in terms of that's one of the assets that we currently are in discussions with certain larger investors for potential JV in the property. So I can't update you rather than to say, I would have said you looking for, we're in discussions and I think we are having good discussions. But, that\u2019s the update.", "In terms of the later expect the use of proceeds, you know, everything is front of our business plan. We saw our goals for the year when we met in December, I presume that we had acquisition goals, we have the potential for increased levels of structured finance.", "We have a stock repurchase program that's up on the - that\u2019s been allocated and approved and we could always choose to further de-lever although sitting here on an NAV basis below 37% loan-to-value, that, you know, I don't think is necessarily the highest and best use of those proceeds but it is a possible use of proceeds. I would point you towards those and possibly others. Thank you.", "John Kim", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Good afternoon. Just first, on the New York REIT, the stock position was there something - presumably this was something legacy for many guys were in the hunt for it or was this transaction that was after you guys were pursuing that company?", "Matthew DiLiberto", "Alex, this is Matt. So that position we divided in the second half of '16 and then sold out in the first quarter.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay, cool. And then, maybe for Steve Durels. In some of the broker commentary you were highlighting - and Marc you talked about it but the increase of concessions out there in the marketplace. How do the tenants look at it, are the tenants swayed by, you know, there is one landlord that\u2019s offering a huge amount of concessions that high base rents versus other one, someone else is more on effective basis.", "Are the tenants really swayed by that or is it something where we are going to see more of this comment and more appropriate commentary about concessions especially as step on the far west delivers?", "Matthew DiLiberto", "I don\u2019t think there is a consistent way that tenants look at, it has a truth. Everybody manages their business from a different point of view. Some are all about capital preservation, others are about occupancy, savings, so it really depends on who you talking to. You could sort of bucket a little bit by industry sometimes but, having said that, it's very hard to partial that.", "I mean we deals with tenants where they want the turnkey installation and they want to pay a premium rent, it will put the capital into the space. We have other tenants who come to us to say, hi, we are sitting on capital, we are willing to put in the space, we would like to net down our rents.", "And, you know, from the management of our portfolio we have the flexibility to address each of those desires.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay. But, you have never seen - but it sounds like in general, you don\u2019t see tenants unless or like to maybe a small looking for pre-built, it doesn\u2019t sound like you have tenants who are readily swayed because one person is offering significant concessions first and other there, sounds like they look at pretty much the effective?", "Matthew DiLiberto", "No, no, I think just the opposite. Some tenants look at it net effective but I think the driver could be one young person looking in and saying, I want to lower my occupancy cost and therefore net out some concessions. Others will look out and say, I want to preserve my capital and I\u2019m going to pay higher rents.", "So, it really is great tenant specific. Clearly, you have seen some landlords going to the market, and it's sort of a new phenomenon I can tell you, certainly in my career where landlords who generally have a short terms investment horizon or willing to spend extraordinary amount of capital to buy out the rents, because they expect to exit other buildings in the near future.", "But, that kind of new to the game but, and I think it's part of it is driven by the fact that interest rates remain low.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America.", "Jamie Feldman", "Great thank you I guess Steve sticking with you in the leasing market can you just give us a little more color on kind of trends you saw during the quarter I know you still come toward the 1.6 million square foot target, but thinking about how much you did in the first quarter look at your comfort keeping that level?", "Steven Durels", "Well I tell you the big difference is that in some of the buildings that we were challenged with last year even though we had good velocity and buildings we had portions of certain buildings that were challenged.", "First example being 10 East 53rd Street where we did a lot of leasing but it was on the top half of the building and this year we've been able to knock off a good portion of the base of the building which are, the larger four place relative to a small building, but don\u2019t upgrade lying there and different price point.", "But last year it was hard pressed to even generate proposals and this year we've already signed two leases we\u2019re about to already sign a third floor we\u2019re trading paper for the balance. So that building is well on a path to be fully backed by third quarter I would say.", "Tower 46, same story and that went down to the last 145,000 square feet of space over there. We're about ready to sign a full floor lease. We got a lease out in one of our pre-builds, tour activity has picked up partly because I think you know once the building was fully introduced to the marketplace we started to see more tenants come through. Once the first tenant occupies the building and the doors were open for business that generated a level of activity.", "So I feel very good about that. And the fact that quite frankly we don't have any big blocks of current vacancies to speak of - we've got pieces and parts that were backfilling in us as Marc spoke about. So we\u2019ve got good velocity and \u2013 a lot of deals to meet the leasing target because we don't have that big block in the B sort of two or three big monsters that ramped it up for us.", "Jamie Feldman", "Okay. And can you remind us what are you next big blocks that you\u2019re working on or that you have available now?", "Steven Durels", "Well I\u2019ve got a Tower 46 to start 146,000 square feet remaining. 45 Lexington's got 200,000 square feet and the news building the 220 still has gone a 124,000 square feet. After that the largest I know but those are not contiguous blocks those are just availabilities after that our largest availability in the portfolio drops down to more like 67,000 square feet.", "Jamie Feldman", "Okay. And then your next big expiration?", "Steven Durels", "Would be 100,000 square feet of small spaces rolling in Graybar so the largest unit of being about 20,000 square feet and another 70,000 square feet of 45.", "Jamie Feldman", "Okay. All right, thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi.", "Manny Korchman", "Good afternoon. Steve just while you\u2019re earn on if I'm thinking about tenants renewing and whether they think about renewal timing and also rate. Are they more willing to sign with you now sort of 24 months ahead of expiration are they willing to roll a dice and see how sort of momentum of rental rate and availability goes over the next calls to off to 24 months?", "Steven Durels", "Again it\u2019s not a hard and fast rule with that it\u2019s generally driven by size of requirement so the bigger tenants have a longer time horizon where they'll make a decision earlier to the game the smaller guys went away to the last minute, most tenants I think are influenced by or many tenants are influenced by their point of view as whether they think the economy and the marketplace is headed.", "But, you\u2019ve seen us over the past several years we\u2019re able to get ahead of our lease roll because we\u2019re actively out there encouraging tenants to do early renewals. And that\u2019s benefited us through our market cycles and as we sit here today with a beneficiary, with a low rollover of both 2017 and 2018. So we can weather wherever storms comes our way.", "Manny Korchman", "Great and then on March it\u2019s going impact anyway RT appreciate the timing comes from that but maybe you could provide us some more behind your thought process of both buying and deposition and selling it more recently?", "Steven Durels", "So I think in terms buy into it we underwrite and we pursue New York City assets so I don\u2019t think we\u2019re particularly driven by weather it\u2019s owned in public or private entity I mean you should assume I would think at all times that any large deal New York City-based asset \u2013 office asset offerings will have significant interest in and from time-to-time take a division. What was the second part of the question?", "Manny Korchman", "Why sell now?", "Steven Durels", "Well when you say sell now I think we sold now I think we sold \u2013 a few months ago as I recall but we sold it right after the announced plan of liquidation. So I think just right at or when we plan a liquidation it was either done or in our minds was headed towards absolutely being dumb we decided that was the right context in investment for us so that was it.", "Manny Korchman", "Right thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Lewis with SunTrust.", "Michael Lewis", "Thanks not to beat New York REIT to debt but were you initially interested in finding the security or the company \u2013 because if it was security why not just buy shares of SL Green which also traded at this now?", "Steven Durels", "Can you ask that Michael I am not sure I understood that?", "Michael Lewis", "I am just wondering if you were interested in you sort undervalue at security or if the interest initially was really to own the assets or the company and if it was the security why by that instead of buying your own stuff?", "Steven Durels", "Look I mean I don\u2019t look at it as either/or so that\u2019s I think those are your words. We buy assets routinely I guess you can make a question why do we buy any assets. This was a stock purchase I think we\u2019ve got industry-leading knowledge of New York City assets. We thought it was a prudent investment we made at that time I think it turned out we were right but I think we made money on it.", "So I'm not sure how 4.5 million to us a share of purchase or whatever you know thereabouts has any bearing or relation to everything or anything else we do in the company. I wouldn't set it up as a either/or scenario, I think we invest lots of money every year sometimes in fiscal year ability to more or some years less. And we\u2019re always looking to try and get the best risk-adjusted returns we can and cover all the ground we possibly can in New York City. And so I think that you\u2019re already saying job well done, so thank you. Anyway, next question.", "Michael Lewis", "My second question this largest mezzanine position in your book is that 666 Fifth Avenue and if it has given it\u2019s been in the news quite a bit lately, how do you kind of view your position there?", "Steven Durels", "Yes, I think first of all what is your largest position.", "Matthew DiLiberto", "It is not 666.", "Steven Durels", "I mean we don\u2019t disclose - our position specifically \u2013 we don\u2019t disclose specifically\u2026", "Matthew DiLiberto", "We don\u2019t disclose our position specifically but it is not typically.", "Michael Lewis", "Do you have a loan on 666 Fifth or you can\u2019t disclose that either?", "Steven Durels", "No, I mean we never have - I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying yes or no because it\u2019s.", "Andrew Mathias", "We don\u2019t disclose specific mezzanine investment.", "Steven Durels", "I think this supplemental to-date has given just about as robust our disclosures as we can short of actually pinpointing particular locations we do that really for borrowers who otherwise are in a custom to that type of discrete note I disclosure of the capital stacks when they borrow traditionally from banks other forms of lenders. So but I think we put just about everything else in terms of type of loans, exposure, rate, term and everything so it\u2019s all in there, but no you asked about the large exposure it\u2019s not 666.", "Michael Lewis", "Okay. The largest one it\u2019s look like the last dollar per square foot is almost $1,200 is there anything to talk about there then?", "Andrew Mathias", "Yes, it\u2019s an asset with a significant retail components so I think the asset yeah.", "Michael Lewis", "Understood okay.", "Andrew Mathias", "About 1,200 north of book.", "Steven Durels", "It is short of get to may be more of the hardware what you\u2019re asking we are extremely confident that that book is money growth. If that\u2019s the question I am just not sure of the question. But if the question is hey you got a big loan at \u20ac1,200 a square foot do you think what do we think of that and others. This portfolio on average we think is about 65%, 70% loan-to-value just like our value.", "Often our borrowers value, appraised value, market value tend to be a little higher but in our internal values we\u2019re at around 65% to 70% less dollar there is nothing in the portfolio approaching you know anything that would be over 100 or probably not even over 90 or 80.", "So it's an extremely good collection of New York City collateral almost entirely made up of office and retail, maybe some multifamily and maybe a couple bridge loans. I want to say almost completely devoid if not entirely of luxury condo loans, development or otherwise and its yielding somewhere between 9% and 10% my guess.", "So this is a program we've been doing for about 20 years extremely profitable you know losses are infrequent almost not for two I would say nonexistent and dating back on this over a decade ago and you know it's still a very good market for us to be originator and syndicator of that paper which we did inside in the first quarter. I want to say over $450 million worth of so of new originations.", "Michael Lewis", "Okay. I appreciate it thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Thanks. Just on One Vanderbilt the partnerships that you announced can you give us anymore color on sort of what the economics of this partnership is this sort of template on model let me be used for other retail restaurant deals in the building?", "Steven Durels", "No I think to the contrary because this is not a template to roll floor this is very what I would call special situation I mean we have many restaurants, tenants and leases and some very excellent and high-performing - World number one restaurant just voted this year 11 Madison soon to becoming Four Seasons 280 Park legendary forces with 280 Park it\u2019s very high performing lava over say 25 Madison we have excellent tenants and restaurant tenants and we have ones that are very profitable in the space.", "But this is, I think you have to look at this much differently this is a part of the fabric of the building because of the interconnectivity of the importance of creating a restaurant that is both a destination a quality of food offering that are going to be consistent with the extraordinary high quality of the building itself and the location itself.", "And the kind of amenities that it can provide to our tenants of the building which is something that we want to be a part of quite frankly and having the opportunity to partner with the Chef Daniel Boulud to look as extraordinarily honest and real happy to do it and the economics are pretty much straight up. I mean we\u2019re going to all be investors.", "We\u2019re going to our joint venture consisting of us and our partners they are going to put up the lion share of the capital. But Daniel has a real money invested and I can\u2019t speak the cost or any details yet because this restaurant now will be first design and costed, but we are confident that it will be squarely within our budget because we have a within our three point whatever billion dollar budget.", "There is - obviously ample dollars that have been allocated for restaurant and amenity space and op deck et cetera. So it will fit squarely within that and the profitability we hope will be in excess of what would have achieved as a leasing results because we've got some really special things that were working on together that we think will be quite successful and quite rewarding in monetary sense. So we\u2019re really looking forward to it. Thanks for the question.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Okay. And then just on the back on the leasing pipeline I am just trying to get a sense versus the last quarter we\u2019ve been tossed back and forth on different ways, verticals in the financial segment in terms of easing. I am just wondering in your own pipeline have you seen that the composition change anyway are financials now a bigger part smaller part and any interesting trend by price point?", "Steven Durels", "There is no double that the pipeline of both leases out and term sheets been negotiated are heavily weighted towards the fire sector right now within our portfolio. No comments about the overall market per se but I think that\u2019s a function of the product that we currently have available are the type of buildings that appeal to that profile tenant you, but within the leases out probably half the square footage that we have leases out right now are with our fire sector tenants and the good third of the leases that we have in term sheet negotiation are in the fire sector as well.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.", "Steve Sakwa", "Thanks, good afternoon. Steve I was just wondering if you could spend a little more time on the leasing and just maybe give us a sense for the types of tenants and their desire to expand are these new deals, are these kind of movements within the city, are these new tenants to Manhattan just trying to get a sense for you know how many are taking expansion space, how many contracting and maybe if there is any kind of flavor around the industries?", "Steven Durels", "Well first remember that with the leasing that we've done to-date and with the leases that we are asked right now there's no monster deals right it has been a lot of mid to small type leases because of \u2013 while we stop right now.", "But generally speaking it certainly not new initiatives moving into the city its tenants that are making decisions to either go into a different quality building or different quality of space. They\u2019re restacking they want to use the space differently a bunch of them have been driven by expansion, but maybe I think it\u2019s different tack on it.", "One of the things for instance that is \u2013 that\u2019s kind of notable right now I think if you look at 280 Park Avenue, 280 Park has been on fire this year. And we had more space we have more deals for that building and all the financial services most of them have an expansion component. And if we signed all the leases that are out right now we\u2019ll be down to 1% vacancy in that building.", "So that building is put away when you look at tenants over 10 East 53rd Street pretty wide diversity of type of businesses both financial services, luxury goods, fashion tenants are driven by largely by needing to restack and pick up expansion space. And then if you look at Tower 46 I think that\u2019s been a pure track to percent who want upgrade for the quality of the space.", "Steve Sakwa", "Okay, thanks. That\u2019s it from me.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Craig Mailman", "Just on One Vanderbilt I know you\u2019ve kind of recent expectation can\u2019t expect leasing until next year, but one of the financial service tenant that importantly looking at your buildings also now importantly looking at the west side. Just curious if those requirements would be the same or if they\u2019re kind of different and they could take space at both spots?", "Steven Durels", "Well I tell you know what any big tenant of size is coming through our doors there is no doubt about it. We still are you three and a half to four years out on time horizon so that\u2019s our biggest challenge to-date, but you know whether they come our way or they go to the west side it confirms one thing very clearly which is that New York City is start for new construction.", "And if our building were being delivered sooner than we would have a very active leasing pipeline right now. And I feel very good about that based upon the presentations that we begin with the tenants and feedback that we\u2019re getting from both the brokerage community and the tenants that we sit with.", "Craig Mailman", "And on the pricing has that I think you guys need around 150ish average, is that price point and receptive to people I know it's very early in the process but just to explain to that?", "Steven Durels", "We don\u2019t need 150 - 150 you\u2019ll remember we put up on the screen with a 7.1% development yield which is fairly extraordinary for a building of this quality and size. So I would just \u2013 lead is funny word I mean that's our expectation, Mike I hope you guys can hear me at the other end otherwise I will be doing a lot of talking and no one been hearing. That\u2019s our expectation of where the market will be with rents at the base of the building, taking some below that and rents above middle of the building, somewhat higher than that.", "But I thought we put up on the screen around December a deal at a $135 a foot which still yielded something in excess of like 6%, or right at 6%, just in excess of 6% which is still actually quite high. So you our expectation of pricing averages about 150 for the building.", "We feel very good about that price level based on all the conversations we've had up to this point and where it falls in relative to the other significant and most attractive Midtown properties around town where those leases are being done here. They were many, many deals done at levels of a 125 foot and higher over the past 12 months, it just not the million square foot deal now we are not targeting the big million square foot plus financial user for this building and we said.", "So and you know that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not going to have those discussions, doesn't mean it couldn't happen, doesn\u2019t mean it couldn't work great, it just means that this is a very you know we\u2019ve spoken from two building that is designed for value users and kind of the base and mid-session of the building and very high end users at the top of the building who are very focused on location, amenities, design, space, infrastructure, and the like.", "And within that regard I\u2019d say we feel very good about where the rents will come out in $20, $22 or something like that as we talking about rents four or five years from now.", "Marc Holiday", "Just to add to add that the presentations that we've been asked to give to tenants have been with users that have been everything from as small as 35,000 square feet to obviously the very large tenants but the majority of them are for a large tenant and this generally in the 150 to 250,000 square foot range. And we think you know likely what will happen is will land one or two tenants like that and the balance of the building. We will be one and two, four tenants at a time.", "Craig Mailman", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with UBS.", "Nick Yulico", "Thanks. Summing your total a bit about the West side and how it relates to the rest of Midtown I mean sounds like there are some leases in the works that are going to get related Hudson yards some more even further leased up. Brookfield, sounds like has a good interest and starting to hear stories about tenants actually being turned away from West side looking for space because they can\u2019t be tolerated.", "And so I\u2019m wondering how much does that are you seeing that helping traditional Midtown yet and what you're trying to lease in One Vanderbilt I mean have some has that activity picked up and that tenants just can't be accommodate over there and increasingly working EBITDA?", "Steven Durels", "Yes, you\u2019re correct. New construction five Manhattan less in particularly they\u2019ve got two deals pending it left one or two tenants on the side line because they would slightly pull the trigger. Does bode well for us maybe but I think they\u2019re going to deliver this space immediately. Our is still off in the time horizon but it tells you one thing and I keep saying and I think it\u2019s an important which is that tenants want new construction and One Vanderbilt being the only new construction to be delivered in Midtown, is the place where tenants are going to come once we're in this - in the sweet spot of timing.", "Nick Yulico", "Okay. And then I guess just on the tenant preferred equity investment activity I'm wondering if you could remind us at what at what level you\u2019re comfortable providing financing. If you look it for example 245 Park there looking for it looks like about an 80% overall loan-to-value on their financing I mean can you just remind us kind of where you\u2019re willing to land up to on that and where is sort of pricing in the market right now for that type of mez for those types of investments?", "Andrew Mathias", "It\u2019s Andrew Nick and we definitely do not have a hard stop anywhere in the capital structure so we are risk adjusted return investors which means we\u2019ll judge the risk of any given position, but what we think is the appropriate return on it and that sort of where we\u2019ll provide capital that goes for equity preferred equity junior mez, senior mez the note, a note mortgage whatever part of the capital structure it is that\u2019s the platform we filled and that\u2019s why we are so successful at generating above market returns.", "So because we are one of the only guys in New York City if not the only guy in New York City that can do that so we've seen areas of the capital stock compress for sure. There is a very active senior mezzanine paid right now I think you\u2019ve seen us sell pieces of debt we\u2019ve originated into that market. So you\u2019ve seen ourselves senior mezzanine positions on several of the loan origination we\u2019ve done over the last six months. The CMBS market is near its post 2007 lows so AAA spreads they were at 75 to 80 over swaps.", "So the CMBS market aggressive, the debt markets in general there is a very active senior b.i.d. which creates great market conditions for us to generate above average returns in the junior portion.", "Nick Yulico", "Thanks everyone.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.", "Vincent Chao", "Good afternoon, everyone. All of my questions have already been answered here, but maybe just sticking with a DP portfolio I know there is not a lot that\u2019s going off of the balance of the year but I guess is anything notable in terms of timing of the ex Greece scores are practically radical?", "Matthew DiLiberto", "It\u2019s Matt I mean it\u2019s pretty radical I mean there is nothing really to your point there is not much left to expire for the year or to mature for the year, but nothing significant any one giving quarter and t much like you saw in the first quarter are expectations are that the originations that David and his team do at least equal if not exceed whatever mature at any one given course.", "Vincent Chao", "Got it okay and then just maybe a cleanup question again maybe on the account side here you mentioned the deconsolidation of position at [indiscernible] Third. Can you just talk about how that\u2019s going to sort impact the reported numbers going forward?", "Matthew DiLiberto", "Sure yeah we got hung up in accounting no man\u2019s land when we sold the asset last year about February at which point we had to keep the real estate asset on our books and $135 million debt position that we originated couldn\u2019t be shown and we couldn\u2019t record income on it.", "The buyer of the asset the current owner refinanced the mortgage in April which means starting with the second quarter we won't have to keep the real estate assets that we actually don\u2019t own any more on our books any longer and we can start to pick up the income on the debt position that was $135 million position and about 5.75% yield.", "We will start recording income on that here in the second quarter and that is consistent with what our expectations were when we put out guidance as we did expect the current owner to refinance the mortgage this year.", "Vincent Chao", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo.", "Blaine Heck", "Thanks. Matt sticking with you it\u2019s look like the spend related to Viacom at 1515 Broadway was relatively modest this quarter which was a positive to cash flow. Can you remind us where you are with respect to the total spend there and whether we should expect that to go away this year?", "Matthew DiLiberto", "Originally I think when we did a lease we said we would expect to go away like two years ago so it's a bit beyond our control is really money that allocate to Viacom to use at their discretion and they have taken quite a long time to use it. So I want to say we have you call it $50 million or so less to fund them I think our expectations are that happens this year but really no way to tell.", "Blaine Heck", "Okay. And that's been a pretty big drag on cash flow the last couple of years or so and I guess once you guys have done sending on that you'll be seeing higher cash flows so do you think that\u2019s going to have any direct affect on your thoughts on the dividend?", "Matthew DiLiberto", "Dividends get evaluated at the end of every year as we look forward to the next. Our expectations are we payout a 100% of taxable income we\u2019ll continue to do so whether I don\u2019t think Viacom contrary to your point I don\u2019t think has been necessarily a big drag on cash flow. Every year we have leasing capital we need to spend that's just one lease that had high capital spend for the last few years. But with income increasing cash flow increasing you would expect a dividend to increase.", "Blaine Heck", "Fair enough, thanks.", "Marc Holliday", "Yes I think we have time for two more questions please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jed Reagand with Green Street Advisors.", "Jed Reagand", "Good afternoon, guys. You mentioned that GMP with Tishman and how that was set at the low end of the budget range. Just curious if that crystallizes savings versus the kind of $3.2 billion total budget you guys have laid out for One Vanderbilt if so what that new budget is?", "Marc Holliday", "I think we\u2019ll revisit that a little later Jed I mean I did say in December and also to reiterate now our goal unlike I think of lot of other people's goals when we set out on a project like this is, God I hope we need budget. We want to realize hopefully significant savings to this budget that we presented to you in the past, but there\u2019s still a long way to go, there is still a lot of unknowns and the GMP is a giant step forward in terms of realizing upon, you know not just the savings at the time of GMP, but also with respect to all the contingency we have in this deal to the extent unused by the end would represent additional areas of significant savings.", "So I think it's too early for us to start to quantify that and as we go forward we'll have an opportunity to do that but it does feel good sitting in the position we are now not only to be able to identify those areas of savings right at this early stage before it pieces still and put into the ground just based on purchases we\u2019ve contracted for but also the milestone dates look like we pulled the project forward so far about a month.", "And whether a month sounds like a lot to you or it doesn\u2019t sound like a lot to you, in project of this size 30-days forward from what was expected to be in August day to go vertical now in July big, big difference. So it's early and we hope to have continued success as we go forward with the construction but so far things look pretty good.", "Jed Reagand", "Okay, that's helpful. And then have you guys seen any kind of noticeable changes in values for the street retail market, Manhattan, I guess where would you ballpark cap rates for kind of stabilized retail at this point and investor retail in the city?", "Marc Holliday", "I think the first part of the question no I think the values they\u2019re still a lot of demand for retail properties no better indication and our trade on one or two green we announced today. And then in terms of stabilized cap rates we always looked between 4 and 4.25 on a stabilized cap rate basis.", "Obviously most of our street level retail as part of the prime portfolio has rents that are significantly below market, so we\u2019ve used lower cap rates in terms of expressing the value of those assets. But when they're sort of stabilized and marked at current market 4 and 4.25 cap I think is a good indicator.", "Jed Reagand", "Okay. Could you guys see yourselves being net investors or net sellers in that business over the next year or two?", "Marc Holliday", "I think it totally depends on the opportunities. We\u2019re watching the market carefully. There is some interesting situations in terms of properties on the market and tenancy situation. So we'll continue to monitor that is just be totally based on opportunity but certainly not an area of investment we would shy away from.", "Jed Reagand", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Guinee with Stifel.", "John Guinee", "Great, thank you. Matt real quick, depreciable real estate reserve charge of 56 million, can you explain that if you haven\u2019t already. And then second changing over a little bit multi-family, any place on the island on Manhattan where landlords have pricing power in terms of the rent residential and then do you have an opinion on the pricing or the valuation of the condominium market.", "Marc Holliday", "Where is the net expected rent of John, common, we're prepared for the first time.", "John Guinee", "You know there were 24 of those already I think.", "Matthew DiLiberto", "I think the first one is for me right John, so depreciable real estate reserves when you put assets out for sale like we have, exactly likely growth under contract in Sanford Towers which is out being marketed, you need to take the potential losses on those ahead of actually closing on them.", "John Guinee", "Okay. So suburban market, okay.", "Matthew DiLiberto", "You got it.", "Marc Holliday", "On the multi-family question, I think we're seeing good lease up statistic continually to skies, so when I would and say on the far west side of 42nd street, we continue to see good absorption in that building and that's increasing net effective rents so I guess it say there is pricing power there although we are leasing the top of that building as we go up.", "So the rents per foot for the higher apartments and I think Manhattan in general multi-family is a relatively balanced market. But I think for new product with great amenities like building like sky, there is pricing power. Residential condominiums I don\u2019t think anybody in this room has any view of.", "John Guinee", "Great. Thank you.", "Marc Holliday", "That would do it for today. Thank you everyone and look forward to speaking again sometime this summer.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's presentation.

The results for the third quarter were very consistent with our prior guidance and commentary throughout the year. The results are reflective of a healthy market, one in which a new supply has been met with increasing demand associated with private sector job growth that is already exceeded last year\u2019s totals.", "The level of uninterrupted job growth is record-setting in New York City and is a major contributor to the tick up in the third quarter leasing activity that is keeping overall vacancy between 9% and 10%. Leasing market conditions strengthened in the third quarter as Midtown experienced its highest amount of quarterly leasing activity in the past two years.", "The October leasing reports, which are just coming out show that the quarterly net absorption registered about 1.5 million square feet of net absorption on total leasing activity of approximately 5 million square feet in Midtown, that\u2019s reflective of a 19% increase in the trailing five-year quarterly averages, primarily this activity was driven by financial services leasing activity, and we see that within our own portfolio.", "Total citywide year-to-date leasing activity has topped 21 million square feet and the pipeline for big lease transaction in the fourth quarter looks sizable. So taking that down a level two within our own portfolio, we\u2019ve been able to sign year-to-date nearly 1.2 million square feet of commercial office leases in the Manhattan office portfolio, 489,000 square feet of which was done in Q3 alone. And our same-store net operating income increase of 1.9% trended up from the prior two quarters of the year and we expect that trend to continue.", "Our leasing pipeline remains strong at 840,000 square feet, of which leases out for signature and a negotiation account for over 350,000 such square feet, and we have about a 0.5 million square feet of deals in term sheet \u2013 credible term sheet beyond that, that would more or less be deals for Q1 of 2018. This pipeline, the 840,000 square feet is larger than it was in early September, I think, when we last spoke about our pipeline results and this is continuing to build.", "The mark-to-market on the deals we hope to close in the fourth quarter is approximately 11%, which would be within the range of our guidance for the year and consistent volumetrically with the goal of 1.6 million square feet of total leases signed. And this notwithstanding that the 1.6 million square foot stretch goal, that volume was double the amount of square footage that we had expiring in all of 2017.", "While mark-to-market compressed in the second-half of the year, we hope to see this trend reverse itself, as leasing volumes increase consistent with the demand that I spoke of that was evident in Q3 and availability is a new construction on the West Side is reduced as that space leases up.", "I also want to mention that yesterday, we closed on our acquisition of a joint venture interest in Worldwide Plaza. It\u2019s a trophy asset with attractive going in returns and excellent tenant roster. The relatively low price per square foot and significant future upside due to average in-place rents that are well below market made this opportunity highly appealing to us. It was also obviously highly financeable given the sub-4% interest rate for a 10-year fixed rate financing that we closed simultaneously with the acquisition.", "So we are very pleased to be partnering on this asset with our longtime friends and business partners at RXR and with NYRT with whom we\u2019ve been in dialogue for quite some time now. And I think the Worldwide Plaza venture that you saw us close yesterday is definitely an outgrowth of that continuous dialogue we had with management and with the Board of NYRT over that period of time.", "The asset provides us with a greater presence in an area of town we have done quite well with as in other investments, such as 3 Columbus and 1745 Broadway, and we look forward to having Worldwide Plaza be a part of our portfolio. Additionally, on the investments front, we continue to use our investment capital to buy back shares of stock in the company, something we consider to be an extremely attractive investment proposition that will yield benefits to shareholders in the near and long-term.", "We\u2019ve taken a disciplined approach to the stock repurchases by funding this activity with proceeds of asset sales and internal cash flow and not through debt. I believe we saw the markets appreciation of that approach last week when we issued $500 million of corporate bonds at a 0.75% interest rate for a five-year term.", "Our return to the unsecured bond market is the culmination of many years of deliberate efforts to position ourselves within the bondholder community for ready access to the bond market at attractive and competitive rates.", "Before opening this up to Q&A, I want to turn it over to Matt, who will spend a few minutes discussing our quarterly earnings results, results that were highly consistent with the guidance we\u2019ve given throughout the year and at the beginning of the year. But guidance that I think was characterized in some cases as of below what expectations were. And I think, Matt will go through in detail exactly where our earnings were, why we\u2019re on track and why some of the consensus numbers out there were probably just wrong.", "Matthew DiLiberto", "Thanks, Marc. And we do want to get to your questions, so rather than click through all of the income statement line items, I\u2019m just going to hit the high points. Last night, we reported FFO per share of $1.49, which as Marc said, was below the street estimates, but is actually ahead of our internal estimates for the quarter by about $0.02 a share. Obviously, we don\u2019t provide quarterly guidance and we don\u2019t have any plans to, so one would think there must have been something off from street\u2019s numbers.", "Important to note that these results are net of a $0.04 write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the refinancing of 280 Park at the non-recurring item. In NOI, from a GAAP perspective, our properties continue to perform on plan for the first nine months of the year.", "Looking specifically at the third quarter, we saw a reduction in rental revenues of about $5 million relative to the second quarter, primarily from $1.9 million of percentage rent at 1515 Broadway, which is recognized only in the second quarter of the year, when it is received as per the lease.", "We also recognized about $2 million of FAS 141 income at 187 Broadway in the second quarter upon the commencement of our redevelopment. We also sold Sanford Towers, which closed in the third quarter. That reduced rental revenues by about $2 million versus last quarter.", "This telegraphed reduction in rental revenue quarter-over-quarter was coupled with the normal increase in operating expenses that we see in the third quarter of every year, as real estate taxes reset on July 1, and there is the customary seasonality of utility expenses, which tend to be the highest in the third quarter and increased by $5 million over the second quarter of this year.", "From a cash NOI perspective, our same-store cash NOI performance improved as expected during the quarter, bringing us to a 1.3% increase for the first nine months, or 1.9% excluding lease termination income. The 20 years lease termination income has been a very reliable source of revenue. And as a result, we\u2019ve always provided same-store cash NOI guidance, including that revenue stream.", "This year, unfortunately has been different. Against the projection of $8 million of lease terminations income for the year, that\u2019s our historical average, we\u2019ve recorded only $2.5 million so far and we don\u2019t see much of any terminations income coming in the fourth quarter. This potential $5.5 million shortfall is a good news, bad news story.", "The good news is that the tenants are still in place and occupancy is maintained. The bad news is that the shortfall weighs on earnings and same-store results such that we do not expect to hit our 2% to 3% same-store cash NOI guidance. However, excluding the effect of lease termination income, the customary way companies look at same-store performance, we expect to be within that range.", "So we\u2019re taking a serious look at whether we should provide guidance going forward, excluding lease termination income since it\u2019s previously reliable revenue stream can obviously be unpredictable, and we do not want it to mask the underlying performance of the portfolio.", "In the debt and preferred equity portfolio, the $51.5 million of investment income we recorded in the third quarter, inclusive of the investment income that runs to the JV income statement puts us well on track to achieve our $200 million target, as the portfolio performs in line with our expectations.", "Relative to the second quarter, investment income dropped as a result of the $9 million of previously unrecognized interest income we recorded in the second quarter on a preferred equity investment at 885 Third. There was also $4 million less income recorded on our investments in 2 Herald Square in the third quarter, as they were put on non-accrual status in early August. All in all, the debt business remains healthy and completely scalable as we continue to find opportunities to invest at attractive returns in New York City.", "With regard to guidance, back on September 21, we issued an 8-K where we again reiterated our full-year FFO guidance of 640 to 650 per share, as well as highlighting the charge we\u2019re going to take on the 280 Park refinancing and the placement of 2 Herald on non-accrualstatus, still not sure that everyone saw that filing or adjusted their numbers as a result as I look at the first call numbers.", "Nothing in our third quarter results or our view of the fourth quarter necessitates us adjusting our guidance range at this time. Certainly, we would like to wrap up the year at the upper-end of the range. And I guess, everybody would, but with a shortfall in termination income of over $5 million, and $5 million that we projected to receive upon the repayment of a debt investment after the sponsors sold the property, which is now on hold, while we are maintaining our guidance range, we would now expect to be closer to the midpoint of the range versus the upper-end.", "With that, we can open it up to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Mailman with KeyBanc.", "Craig Mailman", "Hey, guys. Just curious if you could give us an update maybe on the status of the 1515 Broadway sale, or any other deals you may have out in the market?", "Andrew Mathias", "Sure, it\u2019s Andrew. 1515, it continues to be in negotiation as we indicated on last call, sale of JV interests are a lot more complex than the sale of real estate. So I think you saw us close 16 Court Street and several suburban sales in the quarter, 1515 still on track, but taking its time based on the complexity of the transaction we\u2019re doing that.", "Craig Mailman", "That\u2019s helpful. And then, Marc, of the 350,000 square feet out for signature, I mean, is that what you guys are kind of anticipating could close by quarter-end at this point?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I mean, in addition to that, there\u2019s about a 0.5 million square feet in term sheet and some of that term sheet will migrate to close deals also. So our goal is typically to always hope to close just about all that\u2019s negotiating lease documents out for signature plus some portion of that term sheet.", "So that\u2019ll put us right around the 1.6, we could be 50 high, 50 low. But at least as it sits provided everything in that in the lease out category makes and traditionally that\u2019s got a pretty high percentage attached to it. It would be 350 plus some portion of the $0.5 million of term sheet deals so far in third quarter.", "Craig Mailman", "And could you comment if any of that includes One Vanderbilt?", "Marc Holliday", "No, I can\u2019t really go into any detail on the composition of deals that we\u2019re kind of negotiating and chasing whether it\u2019s One Vanderbilt or any other building. I mean, that\u2019s this is a competitive market. We sign 250 leases a year. I think, we like to keep sort of illumination around any of those deals with regards to any of the buildings under wraps until \u2013 and when and until leases are finalized.", "Craig Mailman", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.", "John Kim", "Good afternoon. I was wondering on the 4% cash re-leasing spread achieved this quarter, it\u2019s below what you indicated as far as mark-to-market for the rest of the year. But I was curious what the vintage was of the leases that were expiring this quarter that led to be relatively low re-lease spreads this quarter?", "Marc Holliday", "I think, we have to look, as I\u2019m not sure, if you\u2019re talking about vintage like when were the leases signed relative to now that we\u2019re being replaced. I mean, our average lease term is 10 years, but that\u2019s not sufficient to say, well, they\u2019re probably 10-year deals. We have to, I guess, take a look. We don\u2019t necessarily look at it in that context, but we certainly can.", "But I\u2019d say, in general, they\u2019re probably 10-year plus deals, but that are rolling off. In some cases, maybe five to seven, in other cases, maybe longer. But we have to pull that together, Matt. Do we have anything close to that?", "Matthew DiLiberto", "Not, not on my fingertips. I just want to make clear, I mean, the one quarter that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s all based on the leasing activity in any one quarter. So we had said early in the year, we\u2019re well exceeding our expectations, but as the pipeline had mark-to-market that was lower. And we had maintained for the full-year our 11% to 14% mark-to-market objective. And we said at 11% through nine months and Marc highlighted that the fourth quarter deals that we expect to sign are in the 11s as well. So we\u2019re sticking to that a 11% to 14% for the full-year when focused too much on a 4% quarter.", "Stephen Green", "Let me just to add to it to give you a little bit of color on it. It was \u2013 if you look at all the deals that we\u2019ve signed across the portfolio the majority of the buildings had a mark-to-market that was in line or better than what our guidance was. And the weighted average was really skewed by just two buildings. So if you look whole portfolio, the mark-to-market was well above 4% well in line of where our 11 plus guidance was. If not for those two buildings where we had a couple of high rent deals that had burned off.", "John Kim", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then also on One Vanderbilt, can you just discuss the leasing achieved this quarter with the German banks and whether or not that fell into your underwriting range of 130 to 150 per square foot?", "Marc Holliday", "Stephen?", "Stephen Green", "It was safely within our underwrite assumptions.", "Marc Holliday", "I think it exceeded it.", "Stephen Green", "It did exceed it.", "Marc Holliday", "I think it exceeded. It\u2019s slightly exceeded underwriting. It was \u2013 certainly, within all the parameters, it was early. So I mean, in that respect, we didn\u2019t expect to sign anything in 2017, but the opportunity rose and there were a terrific institution and banking organization with whom we\u2019re happy welcome to One Vanderbilt, and we welcome them ahead of our schedule and so we have underwrite.", "John Kim", "When you say exceeded, I mean, above that range or just exceeded relative to where the floors were \u2013 floors that was leased at?", "Stephen Green", "So, obviously, we have underwrite rents for different portions of the building. And we\u2019ve been at weighted average for the entire building. And for the floor that was leased, that lease exceeded the underwriting.", "John Kim", "Got it. Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Hi, good afternoon. The first question is on Worldwide Plaza, can you guys just sort of walk us through how you think about that investment from a return of yield perspective, if Cravath renews and if they don\u2019t, if they \u2013 meaning that, you have to go out and relet that space?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I\u2019ll start David here you can sort of chime in. I mean, I think the going in cap rate in the deal was upwards of 4.7% \u2013 4.75% obviously got some very efficient financing that we put in place, so those yields are increased, it\u2019s lease now \u2013 the overall, because Nomura is way below market. The average rent overall for the building is well below market, but long dated.", "We think Cravath is a terrific tenant and they occupy some of the primaries of that building and there will be opportunities down the road with those tenants and others to \u2013 we think be able to tap into the embedded rent opportunity to create a value, which will be evidenced with some kind of value creation maybe recapitalize event three to five years down the road.", "Leverage return should be certainly in the position we\u2019re in, because we only took 25% of the deal and our returns are fee enhanced double-digit returns. I don\u2019t know, David, you want anything to add or.", "David Schonbraun", "I think, it\u2019s a high cash on cash going in yield. I think, Cravath has seven years of term left. Nomura has more. As Marc said, it\u2019s a below market transactions, so I think there\u2019s a lot of upside and we have a lot of time to kind of work with the tenants and optimize the deal.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "But I mean, David, if you have to go and if they don\u2019t \u2013 if they choose to go elsewhere, presumably they\u2019re going to give you a few years ahead in advance. So just curious what your yields would be if you have to go backfill that space, just curious the impact from your underwriting on the transaction?", "Matthew DiLiberto", "I think we\u2019re comfortable with the rents that are in place and the market, so they\u2019re consistent.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay. And the next question is for Matt. Matt, on the \u2013 sorry to bug you on guidance, but it sort of of imply sort of like a 1.61 on the fourth quarter. Are there any particular areas where we\u2019re going to see, whether it\u2019s increase in either seasonal income or maybe any sort of one-time items or operating expense or something that\u2019s going to drive this sort of $0.12 increase from where we are at \u2013 in the third quarter?", "Matthew DiLiberto", "Sure. Two big things. First, there was a $0.04 charge in the third quarter, so you just add that right back. And then seasonality is another probably $5 million to $6 million just at the property level, and then you have another couple million dollars or so of leases kicking in at various properties. So it\u2019s primarily property-driven and then the $0.04 charge non-recurring that we took in the quarter, third quarter.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay. Thank you.", "Matthew DiLiberto", "Sure.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi.", "Michael Bilerman", "It\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Manny. Marc, I\u2019m curious how you think about the cadence you\u2019ll have going forward either on the acquisition front of either buildings or of your stock relative to disposition volumes and bringing those in line? And I recognize, you\u2019re still negotiating 1515 and 600 Lexington is on the market, I\u2019m sure some other things that you have teed up. But how should investors think about when those decisions would be announced to the market to when you have the confidence to go out and put additional capital to work before those are done?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, Michael, we\u2019ve been doing this for a long time. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any shift here in cadence or otherwise in terms of how we approach the business, which is typically harvesting gains and reinvesting in high-quality opportunities. I think, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to do. We sold 16 Court closed on that deal, regenerated those proceeds into Worldwide Plaza. We think it\u2019s an uptick in returns and in asset quality, 16 Court is a very good building.", "And hopefully, the guys will do well with the building, but it\u2019s always for us about trying to lift same-store NOI CAGR, trying to lift portfolio value, trying to lift total returns. And the way we do \u2013 have done it historically, I think, we\u2019ll continue to do that is through a very measured, balanced approach of selling assets and using those proceeds generally tax efficiently to make new acquisitions and, of late, also looking at our stock, as you know, one additional, but attractive opportunity, which also would get a lot of attention for use of investment proceeds.", "So I think, you\u2019ll see, as I said on the last call, when the question was asked, we\u2019d be doing stock buybacks and asset acquisitions, when we think the opportunities sort of check all the boxes from our standpoint with compelling returns being a big component of that.", "Michael Bilerman", "Should we expect sales in the fourth quarter at this point in terms of proceeds generated?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I think, Andrew just answered that question, one or two questions ago about somebody. I mean, if you\u2019re calling a sale, a partial interest sale, I thought Andrew said, we\u2019re on track to try and complete 1515 by year-end. So, if that\u2019s the case and I have to say, yes, that we would expect to close more in this quarter.", "Michael Bilerman", "Okay. And then just a comment, I would agree providing same-store NOI without and with lease term fees, or just breakout lease term fees would be something that, I think would be very good. And then I know you won\u2019t provide quarterly guidance. But I do think providing any one-time items, clearly the entire analytical community was significantly higher than what you reported. So calling out any one-timers that may impact the quarter, I think will help not get some of these negative reactions when the numbers come out?", "Marc Holliday", "Yes. I\u2019m not sure, I would agree with the characterization of lease term fees as one-timers. We probably have 20 years of history where the lease terminations fees were fairly well projectable and recurring to the extent that I think to refer to them as one-timers is \u2013 could be misleading as\u2026", "Michael Bilerman", "I wasn\u2019t referring to\u2026", "Marc Holliday", "I don\u2019t want to debate it. It\u2019s under. It\u2019s under review, we\u2019ll take a look at it, whether we put it in, take it out, instead of 8 million, it\u2019s 4 million, we\u2019ll talk about that in December.", "But I think, when you look at our track record year-after-year-after-year of projecting guidance and meeting that guidance, it\u2019s as good as \u2013 well, I\u2019m going to say, it\u2019s better than almost anybody on the street in terms of meeting our goals. And in many years, we are able to move up, in many years, we\u2019re within, very few, if any, years that we\u2019re down. so I think we do a very good job there. But thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Lewis with SunTrust.", "Michael Lewis", "Thanks. I just wanted to come back to Worldwide Plaza. There\u2019s a pretty sizable capital reserve there and New York REIT apparently thinks that, that building could be much more valuable, call it, two years when they intend to sell the other half of it. Given that it\u2019s well leased on long-term leases. I mean, do you see the same kind of opportunity? And what kind of is that capital spend going to be, or what are you going to spend it on?", "Marc Holliday", "You know what, I don\u2019t want to \u2013 it\u2019s really \u2013 NYRT\u2019s approach to the asset, I think, you really have to ask them about it. We believe it\u2019s a great asset with a great return profile, with embedded rents that are below market, great tenant roster. And we think we\u2019ll be able to create value, because that\u2019s what we do, us and along with Scott, I think, we both have a track record of figuring out ways even when the assets been sort of well cared for in prior hands.", "It\u2019s our job to step into the situation, improve the asset maybe physically, maybe in other ways, maybe through some strategic leasing objectives that we\u2019re going to develop together and roll out over the years. I can\u2019t \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t want to sit here right now and sort of get into their business plan, their whole period whether it\u2019s achievable or not. I mean, we just spent $108 million to close the transaction yesterday that we think will have significant upside. And I think, generally, we\u2019ve proven that to be true.", "So, generally are always, I\u2019m going to say in terms of assets that we\u2019ve come full circle on and those that we hold in portfolio. So we\u2019re very excited to be working with Scott and with NYRT. We will certainly move heaven and earth to try and \u2013 in the near-term, they view it as two. I referenced earlier three to five. I think, that\u2019s semantics. The point is in the near-term, let\u2019s create some value and then let\u2019s try and capitalize on the value.", "Michael Lewis", "Okay, great. My second question is about the debt and preferred equity book. It was a little less active this quarter. And I was wondering if that was just a function of the opportunities you just had in the quarter, which is a small time period, or it looks like also maybe the size of that book has gotten up maybe towards your upper limit as you\u2019d like to see that as a percentage of asset. So just curious there if the activity is due to either of those two things?", "David Schonbraun", "It\u2019s Dave. Now, look, as we\u2019ve said, it\u2019s a scalable business, I think, we\u2019ve said we\u2019re going to keep it to certain levels and we\u2019re at those levels right now. We actually have a large pipeline, there are some assets we sold in the last quarter. But it\u2019s not for lack of a pipeline, we have a large pipeline for the fourth quarter. But obviously, without growing the book significantly either we have to syndicate a lot of it or either sell other positions or have payoffs, or you\u2019re going to see lower origination volumes, or at least growth in asset.", "Michael Lewis", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Nick Yulico with UBS.", "Nick Yulico", "Thanks. I think there has been two focal points of negativity on the New York City office market of late. First, talk \u2013 the net effective rents are down by some amount over the past year because of higher concessions? And secondly, the investment sales market is down meaningfully year-over-year. So somehow, I think the question is, does this mean that the New York City office market is just not as attractive as it was in recent years? I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on that?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, let\u2019s say \u2013 there\u2019s two questions there. One has to deal with leasing concessions, one investment sales. Why don\u2019t we hit investment sales first. Andrew?", "Andrew Mathias", "I should go first. I think the volumes, obviously, are down year-over-year. I think a lot of that is reflective of the attractiveness of financing markets. And I also think you\u2019ve seen a lot of velocity in the very recent past with our trade of 16 Court, the trade of 685 Third on Third Avenue, which was a very positive trade for the market with a Japanese buyer, and the trades, which were announced at the NYRT assets, the Twitter and Red Bull buildings and the 36 and 38 Street buildings, the West Side collection, all of which were done at very strong pricing.", "So I think the pricing has not been impacted. The velocity has been impacted, because of the attractiveness of that financing market and obviously the volumes do reflect it. But there is there\u2019s a healthy amount of transaction activity in the market. So I think you\u2019re missing some of the very large [indiscernible] like or other bellwether trades of some of the last couple of years, but there\u2019s still a healthy amount of velocity out there.", "Isaac Zion", "And just to add on, I think last year was the second largest year in terms of volume in the last decade. And in the last month or so about $3 billion to $4 billion worth of assets have actually hit the marketplace. This is Isaac, by the way", "Marc Holliday", "And then Steve on net effect, so a net effect is, I think is a real concession [Multiple Speakers]", "Stephen Green", "So we measure net effect is obviously relative to our budget so specific to our portfolio. And how the net effect is returning to the rest of the market, I don\u2019t think is as important commentary. But I can tell you that the net effect is on the 1.15 million square feet on year-to-date are actually up over budgets. Yes, concessions are higher than originally budget, but offset by higher rents. So, and I think that\u2019s further evidenced to what we keep trying to reemphasize the people that the market is better than some people sentiment.", "Marc Holliday", "Yes, and I would just \u2013 you shouldn\u2019t look at TIs much differently than other forms of expenses or even revenues. They will rise over time generally just due to the natural results of cost of construction. I mean, that\u2019s ultimately what you\u2019re getting at is what is a cost to build out space to a level that\u2019s acceptable for a level of rent. Over the years, that those construction costs are rising, hence the TIs rise, hence we budget for that.", "We\u2019re probably right on budget in terms of our TIs. You guys see the numbers, they were \u2013 they\u2019re pretty much in line with the prior quarter and really the entire year. So if the answer \u2013 if the question is, are they higher? Yes, materially no. Is it in line with our budget? yes, or maybe, we\u2019ll do a little better. And is it offset by higher rents, which we are also achieving? Yes, and net effect as I guess on portfolio-wide they\u2019re up for us.", "So it\u2019s in very hot markets, you can drive those concessions down, and in bad markets, you may have to \u2013 you see them spike. But in general markets like we have now, which are relatively balanced, it\u2019s typically in amount required to deliver a certain level of finish that is acceptable and customary for the kinds of tenants that are renting at these levels.", "Nick Yulico", "Okay. It\u2019s helpful. Just one of the question, you talked about the mark-to-market on a lease signings. If I look at the mark-to-market on commenced leases of 2% in the quarter number seemed low since you\u2019ve been over double-digit in the past year. So I\u2019m just wondering if there was some \u2013 single lease that that drove that commenced number well? Thanks.", "Matthew DiLiberto", "Joe, it\u2019s Matt. It\u2019s all a matter of timing. So, yes, there\u2019s probably something in there that drove the lower and then there will be something in the future quarter that drives it back to a normalized level, but it\u2019s all timing.", "Marc Holliday", "It\u2019s still the same pool of leases. [Multiple Speakers]", "Nick Yulico", "Yes, it\u2019s a matter of when...", "Marc Holliday", "[Multiple Speakers] is just leasing commenced, but\u2026", "Nick Yulico", "Yes we know\u2026", "Marc Holliday", "That will \u2013 the commenced leases were previously announced signed leases and today signed leases will be showing up as commenced next year. So I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s any \u2013 shouldn\u2019t be any real difference. I mean it\u2019s the same pool of leases eventually.", "Nick Yulico", "Okay. Well\u2026.", "Marc Holliday", "Next question on.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from James Feldman with Bank of America.", "James Feldman", "Great, thank you. I know you talked about earlier a good pipeline of large financial leasing activity is scheduled for the fourth quarter. I guess, Steve, can you just give more color on kind of just the tone and sentiment in the leasing market coming out of the summer and now that we\u2019re squarely into fall and looking ahead to fourth quarter and into next year, what seems like you might be changing or is it more of the same?", "Stephen Green", "Well, I think if you look at many of the brokerage reports who are just hitting the street now, what you\u2019re seeing is, third quarter was a very strong year, we\u2019re on track for market wise to have a very strong year through third quarter of 2017 there\u2019s been 24.5 million square feet of leases signed, by comparison to 2016 where there was just under 30 million signed for the entire year. You could sort of extrapolate that and say, okay we\u2019re going to have a very good year by historical terms.", "A lot of our leasing that we\u2019ve seen in the portfolio in third quarter were dominated by financial services, legal and TAMI. And in the deals that we\u2019re negotiating now, it\u2019s primarily financial and legal less TAMI and that\u2019s not a function of less TAMI demand, it\u2019s more a function of the product that we have available right now.", "So we\u2019ve got a wide diversity of tenant demand across the portfolio. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been any real change from what we said about the overall depth of the market either in price point or product cost, it\u2019s more of the same from what we\u2019ve been saying all year other than where we think that we\u2019re in a safe place to meet our targets.", "James Feldman", "Okay thanks. And then can you guys talk about just foreign capital any shifts there? Who \u2013 which country seem to be stepping up, who is pulling back and what that means for that transaction that might be on the market?", "Marc Holliday", "I think European and Japanese stepping up, China clearly pausing pending some of the outcomes of the meeting they\u2019re having now. And still a lot of interest on the debt side from Korean capital, they\u2019re fueling a lot of the deals out there and steady interest from Canadians.", "James Feldman", "And any change in underwriting assumptions?", "Marc Holliday", "No, no, I think people are still that both the debt submissions we\u2019re getting and the indications we\u2019re getting from the brokers as the people are pretty static in terms of underwriting assumptions still underwriting similar growth et cetera.", "James Feldman", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Nick Stelzner with Morgan Stanley.", "Nicholas Stelzner", "Taking the questions, on same-store NOI growth you said that you expect to hit the 2% to 3% range if you exclude termination income. You got 1.9% today, so just curious what the big ticket items are there \u2013 that will get you there through the end of the year?", "Matthew DiLiberto", "Well, I mean to get the 2% you kind of just need to maintain the 1.9 we achieved for the quarter, although we do expect to be slightly better in the fourth due in part to some of things I highlighted earlier, the property portfolio, seasonality that happens in the third quarter, so fourth quarter is definitionally better. And you will have some leases kick in in the fourth quarter and then we expect that trajectory to continue beyond the fourth quarter.", "Nicholas Stelzner", "Okay, great. And then just one other one on One Vanderbilt, how you characterize the tenant activity there? Also I know it\u2019s early and you discussed the lease systems on already, but in your conversation with tenants at One Vanderbilt, how do the rents and lease terms compare to what you originally expected?", "Stephen Green", "We\u2019re seeing we\u2019re doing a lot of tenant presentations and we are seeing a good strong enthusiasm from both the brokerage and the tenants that we\u2019re presenting to. So that\u2019s why we think we\u2019re right on plan as far as expectations and the dialogue that we\u2019re having with prospective tenants.", "Nicholas Stelzner", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.", "Steve Sakwa", "Thanks, I know you guys are going to be hosting in Investor Day in a month or so, so I don\u2019t want to jump too far ahead to 2018. But when I look at page 46 and I look at the lease expiration schedule, it looks like I\u2019m assuming that your current sort of average asking rent per foot is an updated kind of thought process on where the market is today. You\u2019ve got almost a 20% uplift on the consolidated and a slightly larger roll down on the unconsolidated or JV asset. Can you just maybe talk about what\u2019s going on in both of those buckets?", "Matthew DiLiberto", "Yes Steve it\u2019s Matt, so important to think about that\u2019s schedule and it includes retail. So it\u2019s not just office there. I think on the consolidated side the 20% up is probably influenced by retail. On the JV side, I think we have a couple of leases similar to what we saw in the third quarter here, where you have some maybe older-vintage leases with escalations that have pumped up the in-place rents. But nothing \u2013 we\u2019ll obviously give you much more guidance when we come out on December 4 with a view of 2018, but \u2013 and we\u2019ll do a lot more leasing beyond what you see expiring in that schedule. But that\u2019s the gist of what\u2019s going on in those numbers at this point.", "Steve Sakwa", "Okay. And then I guess, Marc, just going back to kind of capital deployment. I mean, I can appreciate you trying to sort of play in all thee buckets: Acquisitions, the DPE business and share buybacks. Just when you think about kind of the returns, how do they sort of stack up to one another? And, I mean, is there a spread or a difference that you want in sort of an acquisition versus the hare buyback versus the DPE? I\u2019m just sort of thinking about how you guys sort of look at it mechanically?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, the answer is, there is, but their risk-adjusted returns, obviously, is not just line up the returns.", "Andrew Mathias", "There\u2019s also tax considerations.", "Marc Holliday", "And tax considerations as well, and there\u2019s also platform considerations. A purchase of a building might incrementally at a moment in time be, let\u2019s call it, a lower IRR than a stock buyback. But the ability to scale up the platform, control more tenants, have more options to do the creative deals we do, which are sometimes multi-tenant deals, in order to unlock embedded rent growth or other ways we use our presence and scale in the city and relationship with these tenants to our overall portfolio advantage. It\u2019s not just \u2013 you won\u2019t get that with a stock buyback.", "That stock buyback is literally more of a financial exercise, if you will, if something is trading cheap enough and you own it, you want to own more of it. And that\u2019s pretty compelling, it\u2019s also pretty \u2013 not risky, because you already own the asset. There\u2019s a lot of economic and strategic reasons why we will look to increase our asset portfolio particularly in parts of the market, where we may be underrepresented and want to be \u2013 have a great representation. And on the DPE, it\u2019s kind of a funny situation. Some people look at that as a risky form of business. We look at it as the only form of the \u2013 the only one of those three buckets that had significant equity subordination.", "So with DPE, you\u2019re not left without a risk. We typically have approximately a 30% equity cushion on average, because we\u2019re 70% less dollar and yet we\u2019re still making 9%, 9.5%, in that range, sometimes 10%. So on a risk-adjusted basis, you could argue, that\u2019s one of the champions for the three buckets because of that equity subordination.", "However, it also doesn\u2019t necessarily provide the scale and presence in an equity sense unless you\u2019re able to consensually use that DPE bucket to create pipeline, which obviously, we\u2019ve done successfully in the past. So there are qualitative reasons. There are quantitative reasons, all of them are kind of double-digit exercises. So, I mean, that goes without saying. But among the three buckets, we usually pick opportunities as they relate to themselves, which are the best equity deals? And when do we feel is the best time to buy stock? And I think right now, we are deploying into those three buckets on a very rational basis. Thanks.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors.", "Jed Reagan", "Good morning, guys. I think you guys had put an acquisition target of $650 million or more for the year. I\u2019m just curious if you expect to reach that number. And then I was just interested on the comment you made about other parts of the market, where you feel like, you might be underrepresented. So just curious if you can talk a little bit about what those areas might be and why you like them?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, on the $650 million, that\u2019s always a gross target, that\u2019s not net equity never has been. So my instinct is, we\u2019re somewhere between very close or in excess, as we said, I guess, 25% Worldwide, so that would.", "Matthew DiLiberto", "Of course. Yes.", "Marc Holliday", "It doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have more in pipeline. So we\u2019re working on some active pipeline right now. And whether those deals are fourth quarter deals or beginning of 2018, that seems a little too early to tell right now. But we\u2019re pretty much where we want to be on the acquisition front and on the disposition front.", "As it relates to other parts of the market, we are obviously very invested in and have a major presence in the East Midtown market in particular. And one of the areas, as an example, that we think has great supply and demand metrics, low availability, almost nonexistent to big lots is Midtown South.", "So I\u2019d say that\u2019s one of our real preferred areas of acquisition. Our last big acquisition prior to Worldwide was the One Madison in that area. We own One Madison. We own 304 Park Avenue South and two buildings on on Sixth Ave. And we\u2019re constantly scouring for more in that area, because we think the demand profile there, the types of tenants and the types of opportunities, which are somewhat limited given the inventory down there are particularly appealing.", "So we\u2019ll try and do deals like that, even extrapolating that a little further downtown to 110 Greene, which we did about year-and-a-half ago. Those kinds of deals, which that has a significant office component at 110 Greene Street is our attempt to gain exposure in high-quality buildings in those submarkets, where we think there\u2019s relatively good demand.", "Jed Reagan", "Okay, I appreciate that. And then just curious what you guys are seeing on the ground in terms of the street retail environment, fundamentals-wise and cap rate trends, any changes there? And do you kind of given that, do you feel comfortable with your current positioning in that space?", "Marc Holliday", "I think we feel comfortable with our current position, because we\u2019re generally very well leased across our portfolio. There is definitely submarkets, where there\u2019s quite a bit of vacancy right now given sort of a lack of tenant demand, some combination of lack of tenant demand and slowness to adjust to asking price on rents. So there are definitely some markets with vacancy that are sort of shaking out.", "We\u2019ve seen that type of shakeout before in various markets, Upper Madison, specifically Other submarkets come to mind. We\u2019re somewhat insulated from that, again, because we\u2019re generally pretty well leased on the retail side and we have good remaining term on our leases. And I think we feel comfortable with our positioning in the submarkets we\u2019re in.", "Jed Reagan", "And do you have a view on where kind of where cap rates are today for sort of stabilized street retail product?", "Andrew Mathias", "It\u2019s tough to tell, because it\u2019s so asset specific. You have in-place rents below market, at market, above market, remaining lease term short, long, medium. So there haven\u2019t been a lot of retail trades this year that give a lot of visibility into where cap rates are.", "So I\u2019d hesitate to \u2013 I think there\u2019s an asset on the market now in SoHo that is now a major lease, which is fairly long in term, be curious to see where that trade prints. 522 Fifth was on the market. That asset hasn\u2019t cleared, but that would be another sort of an indicative trade. So it\u2019s sort of tough to peg exactly where cap rates are right now on the retail side.", "Jed Reagan", "Okay, fair enough. Thanks for the color.", "Andrew Mathias", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And I\u2019m not showing any further question at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to our host.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay, great. Thank you for the questions today. We look forward to seeing everyone about a month-and-a-half on December 4 for the investor meeting, which is going to be starting at 9:00 AM as we did last year. We promise it will be informative, as it always is, but also lively spirited. And hopefully, we\u2019ll have a lot of good things to talk about for the upcoming year and beyond. So we look forward to seeing everybody. Thanks.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this dose conclude today\u2019s presentation.

This conference call is being recorded. At this time, the company would like to remind listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements.

", "Before turning the call over to Marc Holliday, Chief Executive Officer of SL Green Realty Corp., I ask that those of you participating in the Q&A portion of the call, please limit your questions to 2 per person. I'll now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. Thank you to everyone for joining us for SL Green's Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. Before we open the line to questions, I wanted to briefly note some of the important things that have occurred since our Investor Day in December and update our outlook for 2018. First, as context for today's discussion, let's go back to our Investor Day to set the scene. In December, we presented strong 2017 company operating performance underscored by having met the majority of our stretch goals, and we presented an optimistic outlook for 2018. We talked about the strong underlying fundamentals of the New York City economy, demand for office space exceeding new commercial development pipeline and SL Green's asset value compared to stock price driving our strategy to continue and even increase the share buyback program we've put in place last year.", "Everything that has happened in the ensuing 7 weeks has only reinforced our outlook on the market and the company moving into 2018. This week, the city of New York released its preliminary end-of-year jobs numbers for 2017, and the news continues to be quite good. The private sector added 70,000 total new jobs in 2017, with office-using jobs up by 25,000. Job growth exceeded expectations from this time last year with strong acceleration in the fourth quarter and notable growth in the FIRE sector, which accounted for half of those new office-using jobs. We expect similar positive news when the year-end tourism numbers are tallied and released, confirming that New York City is still a magnet for domestic and foreign visitors. ", "The bottom line is that New York City's economy, the bedrock of our business, continues to thrive. And as I noted at our Investor Day, the high level of office-using job growth will continue to provide sufficient demand for new space that outstrips the new construction supply coming online. This is especially true as we've seen the densification of office space begin to plateau and efficiencies reach their natural limits, evidenced by the number of tenants now looking for expansion space and planning for growth.", "For SL Green, there are also a number of positive indicators and opportunities that have emerged over the past 7 weeks that are still too early to quantify but that lead us to be even more optimistic about what lies ahead in 2018. Asset pricing is holding up for well-located office properties. There is an enormous amount of institutional capital looking for deals in Manhattan. Also, there is not a lot of product in the market right now for 100% asset acquisitions, creating somewhat of a scarcity value for good investment opportunities. ", "Most deals that you see in the market right now are for partial, passive, LP, minority interest capital. We've done some of those deals, and you'll see more getting done in 2018. But for investors who want full building control, full building capitalization, there really are not that many good opportunities in the market. Now we expect more to come, but we expect it to be balanced with the amount of debt and equity capital that is in the market for those kinds of transactions. ", "So while overall transaction volumes may continue at 2017 levels, supply being down and demand for product is high, I expect prices to remain stable throughout the year. And I think even the most recent deals that have been announced, 1700 Broadway, the deal at One Liberty, it's all further evidence of a very balanced market with a lot of demand being met by good asset pricing. We will, of course, continue to take advantage of this market dynamic by selling mature assets and joint venturing value-add assets in order to generate proceeds for reinvestment and leverage neutral stock buyback. ", "We are not fearful of the recent modest increase in the 10-year treasury. The vast majority of our long-duration liabilities is fixed at attractive rates, and the recent rise in the treasury is generally indicative of improving economic conditions. With vacancy rates below 10% and unemployment in New York City below 4%, continued economic improvement in New York City should result in 2018 being a better year than 2017. ", "As stated in December, we've been buying back our stock with funding sources playing out as projected, notably the closing of 600 Lex and the pending second-stage closing of 1515 Broadway. Our leasing pipeline is now approaching 1.2 million square feet, which is already up from December's pipeline. We're fielding numerous inbound inquiries for JV partners and asset sales and are being very selective on what to monetize in the portfolio to fund our 2018 business plan. That plan looked attractive in December and looks even better in light of current market conditions. ", "Notwithstanding our solid quarterly performance and positive outlook, there are, of course, external factors that influence our share price. As recently reported, the entire REIT sector has gotten off to a slow start this year in trading, and our share price has not been immune to that. The main driver seems to have little to do with underlying REIT performance and more to do with the view that other industries stand to benefit greatly from the federal tax changes and capital has started to flow aggressively in that direction. The irony is that the factors that are driving capital to the other business sectors will serve to greatly enhance the bottom lines of those companies, which are largely our tenant base in New York City, which bodes extremely well for our portfolio. ", "So we'll obviously field questions about the earnings release we put out yesterday. But before we do that, Matt DiLiberto has a bit of an update on guidance.", "Matthew DiLiberto", "Yes. Thanks, Marc. Last night, we reported FFO for the fourth quarter and the full year 2017 right on top of our expectations that we laid out in December. That said, there were a couple of items in those results that we didn't include in our initial expectations that were highlighted in the press release. On the expense side, all the awards for our 2014 outperformace plan were forfeited. That has resulted in us taking a $4.1 million charge in the fourth quarter for the unamortized accounting expense related to the plan, which expired completely valueless to the recipients. That amount's included in G&A. The charge was offset by a $3.2 million real estate tax refund that we received at our property up in Rye Brook, following a successful appeal. Kudos to all those who were involved in that process. That amount is included in other income. ", "Otherwise, the quarter was pretty clean. No real unusual items. And of course, we had the customary accounting cleanups that happen at the end of every year, like you saw in the transaction cost line. With regard to 2018, we've increased our FFO guidance range by $0.05 per share to $6.70 to $6.80 with a midpoint of $6.75. This increase is primarily the result of the $4.1 million charge we took in the fourth quarter related to the 2014 OPP awards that were forfeited. Our initial 2018 guidance had assumed that we would take that charge between January and August of 2018, which was the final vesting period for the awards.", "But in addition, as we look out over the balance of the year, we're definitely seeing opportunities to generate further incremental earnings that could put us above our midpoint and at the upper end of our new guidance range. Obviously, it's still very early in the year so we need to see those things play out a bit. But to be here in January increasing guidance and to already be looking at further positives in our sector-leading FFO per share numbers is certainly a nice place to be. ", "With that, I guess we can open it up for questions.", "Marc Holliday", "Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.", "John Kim", "I just wanted to follow up on some of your comments, Marc, on your opening commentary on -- especially regarding tax reform and the impact it's had in Manhattan leasing. It seems like many companies have already announced plans to increase hiring but not necessarily in New York, and maybe you saw it as a bit of a turnoff for some. But I was wondering if you could just elaborate on what discussions are like right now.", "Marc Holliday", "Yes. I don't know that, that's accurate that those plans don't include New York City. I think, Steve Durels, you could probably address, in general terms, maybe sectors or specific tenants, I mean I'm not sure, that are out there with expansion, either the deals we've done within the portfolio or deals that are pending, not by name, where they contain expansion elements. But I think we've continued to see a very positive and forward position amongst most of the industry groups within our sector that had, over the past 10 or 15 years, gone through some level of densification and tried to take advantage of best practices for creating efficiencies. But having cycled through 10 or almost 15 years of that, we see most of those tenants, as I said earlier, reaching those natural limits. And the combination of bottom line profitability and not much further opportunity to densify is leading towards current-day expansion or much more planning for expansion in leases. Whatever the effects of tax reform will be, that, we probably won't see for maybe another 12 months or so. I think what we're seeing now is just the benefit of corporate profitability in a very strong New York City economy that we've had over the past several years. Steve?", "Steven Durels", "To answer that, of the pipeline of almost 1.2 million, inside that number was almost 400,000 square feet of new tenant leases being negotiated. And I know specifically that at least 1/4 of that square footage is being driven by tenants with expansion needs. I can't speak to whether or not the expansion and the hiring of new employees is currently being driven by tax reform, but I can tell you it certainly reinforced the overall business climate and enthusiasm that our tenants have about the confidence of their business. And that's what's leading to new hires and the leasing velocity that we're seeing.", "John Kim", "Okay. And my second question is on the rising interest rate environment. How do you feel about increasing your DPE portfolio both from an interest rate hedging and an opportunity perspective?", "Marc Holliday", "I think our guidance for the year is roughly flat on balances, which entails a lot of origination because we have a lot of payoff scheduled. We're still seeing good opportunities in the DPE market. And I would say a liquid financing market benefits us and our ability to generate above-average returns. I just think, right now, rather than increasing balances, we're seeing the stock buyback program as a better place to deploy our capital.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.", "Michael Bilerman", "I was wondering -- maybe, Steve, you can just give us an update on One Vanderbilt. Seven weeks ago, at Investor Day, you talked about exchanging paperwork, I think it was on 4 or 6 floors. I'm just curious sort of where things stand today both in terms of those leases that you were negotiating but other incremental demand that may have come in.", "Marc Holliday", "Well, Steve will address sort of incremental demand, if you will, and give you a sense for how things are going. And they're going -- they were going well 7 weeks ago, and I think they're still going well to date. But we'll give you that 7-week update. But as it relates to the leasing that Andrew had put up on the screen, I think they were several deals in several floors that we had shown a high degree of confidence of making throughout the year. We have signed one of those leases, and that is in the quarter-to-date statistics, which I don't think I went through on the call. But we've signed about 190,000 or 200,000 square feet to date in multiple leases, which includes a deal over at One Vanderbilt. We'll be able to share some details of that with everyone very, very shortly, imminently, but not on the call. Beyond that, we've had other good leasing volume throughout the first part of this year. And if you want to add what's incremental to whatever Andrew was -- what we've talked about with...", "Steven Durels", "Yes. We're actively trading proposals back and forth with 4 tenants right now. Sizes vary. They're all for multiple floor type tenancies. The tour activity, the request for proposals, the sort of accelerated advancements of dialogue with prospective tenants is more feverish today than it was 6 months ago and, certainly, more than it was a year ago. So we're very active with tenants. And all of the economics that we're trading back and forth with people are well within our underwriting expectations.", "Michael Bilerman", "Great. Marc, just as a second question, in your opening comments, you've made mention of things that would make you even more optimistic relative to Investor Day, and I wasn't sure what sort of things you are referring to, whether that was leasing that was done, acquisitions that you are targeting, dispositions that you were doing, financing. I just didn't know what categories we should be mindful of that are making you...", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I would put probably high on the list -- I mean I can think of a few examples. But I think the tax bill is something that was formulated and passed after our meeting, and I think the expectation is certainly in the near term, the foreseeable near term, that, that could have a very stimulative effect on the financial community here in New York City but also just the general business community. And you're starting to hear about the reports of hiring. And we're starting to -- we're speaking with our tenants about their plans, and it just -- there will be money to be spent. And how it gets spent, where it gets spent, when it gets spent, we'll see. But it looks like that, that is certainly a positive development for our business tenant base and something that I think is not lost on investors.", "Michael Bilerman", "So it was more sort of the market rather than something specific that you were working on or getting close to?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, I'm not sure. I mean, the leasing pipeline is significant and has grown, so I put that down as a significant factor. We're buying back our stock at prices that were even lower than projected. And while we don't like to see the REIT sector get off to the start that it's gotten off to, just in a pure mathematical sense, that's been -- that translates into more accretion -- earnings and value accretion for the company. The inbound increase that I referenced in my opening comments about just sort of -- which is a gauge of investor demand, worldwide and domestic investor demand, is quite high. And I think you want to go into a year of seeing plentiful debt capital, equity capital, keeping values high, leasing pipeline strong, a tax bill which the business community has translated into potential for job growth. These are all things taken together that I think bode quite well for '18 and probably on the margins, better than where we stood 7 weeks ago.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc.", "Craig Mailman", "Marc, in your opening commentary, I thought your comments about the transaction market were helpful. I'm just curious, as you kind of look across Midtown, are you seeing any significant differences in neighborhoods from a value or demand perspective?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, maybe be a little more specific? I mean, Midtown is already a specific, defined generally as Third Avenue on over the Seventh or Eighth, and -- but the statistics probably do include leasing over on the West Side Yards. So the Midtown -- I think demand for Midtown assets and Downtown -- One Liberty was a pretty -- was a very robust price if you measure price by price per foot. I think that showed strong support for Downtown on that transaction. I think that, certainly, the 1700 Broadway on the West Side, very strong deal, our deal for Worldwide Plaza, our sale of 1515 Broadway, also Times Square. 600 Lex, so coming all the way over to the East side, was a sale that we felt was very good for this company. So I don't think it's limited or targeted in any way by neighborhood per se. I think it's pretty broad-based. Certainly, throughout Midtown, Midtown South continues to be highly attractive, just not a lot of product for sale because it's only a 60 million square foot market to begin with. And Downtown, where the trades have generally been at lower price points, there's been a couple of good deals down there, too. So I'd say broad-based.", "Craig Mailman", "Great. That's helpful. Secondly, can you just give us an update maybe on how you guys are seeing concessions this year and if you've had any early conversations with tenants about maybe kind of the burden they want to take on now with the tax changes versus what landlord build-out would be?", "Steven Durels", "Over the last two years, we've all seen concessions go up, particularly for new tenants' leases. But as we ended 2017 and as we started '18, our experience and my sense personally is that TIs have stabilized as far concessions go, still fairly rich relative to the rents but have stabilized. Face rents have increased over the past 12 months, and I think there's even been a little bit of a pullback on some of the free rent demand. So hopefully, we're at that moment where the concession increases are over, and we're in a place where they've plateaued.", "Craig Mailman", "I guess I was getting more at the improvement side of things. I misspoke with concessions. Just from a build-out and what tenants are going to finance now with the changes versus what landlords typically give, I just was curious if there's any shift in what they'd want to finance versus you guys...", "Steven Durels", "You know what, I don't have a good answer to that because I think every company has a different set of priorities as to how much they want to finance. And are they willing to pay a higher rent and have the landlord finance it? Do they manage more towards a lower occupancy cost and, therefore, they're putting their own capital? I don't think there's a clear, single answer to that question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Two questions. First, Andrew, just going back to the debt and preferred equity book. Can you just talk a little bit about your guys' ability to maintain the spread? As short-term rates rise, do you anticipate being able to maintain spreads, so the absolute rate that you're average charging folks will rise? Or do you think we'll see compression on the spread that you guys earn?", "Andrew Mathias", "I think we've seen gradual but steady spread compression over the last 18, 24 months in the market. Again, with our program, a lot -- we're originating whole loans and then selling into the senior loan market at those tighter spreads. So we've been able to maintain our spread. I don't -- we don't project being able to generate higher yields on our book based on rising indexes like LIBOR and the 10-year. We're sort of looking to hold those steady in the earnings guidance we've given thus far, and we haven't really found an ability to drive higher all-in rates based on rising rates to date mostly because of that spread compression in the market.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay. And then the second question is on the buyback program. I mean, it's awesome to see you guys buying back in the quantity that you have and at the NAV discount. But it looks like you have about $500 million left, and on the Investor Day, disposition, you have about $500 million or $600 million of additional planned. So once you exhaust the current program, is it fair to assume that you guys will reload it and that, therefore, we can see disposition volume rise? Or is that not a good assumption?", "Marc Holliday", "I don't know that you can assume that. I think the plan that we have in place now takes us through roughly most of the way through the first half of the year. Whether that's May, June, July, I don't know, but somewhere in that time frame, dependent on certain things happening prerequisite. So it's not -- it's just not scientific, but that's -- we feel very good like we're on track for that. And then we'll take stock of where we are at that point. I mean I think that with any decision to continue that program, the factors that exist now would have to exist then or better. And I guess, if that were true, then it will get a hard look, that's for sure. But four, five months is a long time in this market.", "A lot of things can change, hopefully for the better. Stock prices can rebound, and we can't just sit here today and, with any level of certainty, predict what we would do then. But we like the factors as they lay out right now. We think that the deleveraging that we've gone through, along with the shrinking of the balance sheet and stock buybacks done very accretively and the sales that we've done, which enabled those first two things, we've done very smartly. So all in all, very good track, and we'll just take stock again. If not on the next conference call, certainly by midsummer's call, we'll have a much better feel and sense for that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS.", "Nicholas Yulico", "Marc, just going back to some of your comments earlier about 2018 should be better than 2017 and the tax plan helping office tenants. Does that mean you expect improved rent growth or better net absorption this year for the overall market? Because your stock price appears to reflect some worries that leasing fundamentals in New York are set to get worse and not better, so I'd love to hear your thoughts.", "Marc Holliday", "Yes. I mean, I don't know. I hear that, and everyone tries to tag what it is that's causing the stock price to be what it's been. Maybe it's leasing concerns, maybe it's some of the things I mentioned earlier about more attractive business sectors. I think we've actually outperformed year-to-date. That's only been 25 days. But -- so I don't know that it can be tagged to a New York City leasing market concern. ", "I think the sector right now certainly seems to be out of favor. And we are caught up in that as are many of our peers, and we certainly hope that changes. But the leasing market to me, it's a very -- it's a deep market. There's a lot of data points, and I don't look to the stock market as a predictor of how that market is. I look to job growth. I look to tenant demand. I look to the pipeline that we have and the terms that we're seeing. Our portfolio is 95.5% leased roughly, and that's very high. We don't have big blocks of space around the portfolio of existing space to lease. I think we have a pocket of space over at 220. We have a pocket of space over at 45 Lex and a little bit more to go with Tower 46. I mean, that's like it. So the portfolio is very tight. We're trying to obviously retain those tenants in a way where we're still driving mark to market and keeping concessions at a reasonable level. ", "And I think the factors that I set out earlier, to specifically address your question, do I think it will cause rising rates? I don't know that you're going to see rates rise, but I think, to what Steve said earlier, you're going to see concession packages hopefully plateau or maybe even shrink towards the end of the year if demand stays healthy. We are still competing against new competition generally. So as the inventory grows, landlords are out there competing for tenants. That growth is pretty much in balance and has been, as evidenced by the fact that the vacancy rate is still around 9%, 9.5%, and it's been that way for the last couple of years. So there is an equilibrium that has been met. But with improvement in '18, that equilibrium could shift a little bit more in favor of landlords and maybe those concession packages will plateau or begin to come back in our direction. Steve?", "Steven Durels", "So let me just add to that because the sense of the -- that there's some level of weakness in the leasing market, I think is betrayed by the facts. People -- we came off 2016 with new leases of over 30 million square feet, which is 16% of leasing velocity over the prior year. Midtown by itself was 18 million square feet of new leasing, which was 9% ahead of leasing velocity over the 5-year average. And the fourth quarter was the best quarter since the second quarter of 2015. So you -- in the light of that and then what we see in our pipeline, we have more -- a bigger pipeline today than we did in January of 2017, and we have a wide diversity of sizes and types of tenants in that pipeline. So I'm feeling very good and I think the rest of us are feeling very good about where we stand right now.", "Nicholas Yulico", "That's helpful. Just a follow-up. I mean, can you dig in a little bit to the higher-end price point in the market and whether that's where there is more aggressive concession packages being offered by other landlords? Or are there any signs of face asking rents getting reduced at the high end of the market?", "Marc Holliday", "Hold on, Nick. We're getting a ruling on the two questions.", "Matthew DiLiberto", "That was 2.5 or 3 questions.", "Marc Holliday", "Okay. Well, let's...", "Steven Durels", "The high end of the market like One Vanderbilt?", "Nicholas Yulico", "Yes, that's right. Yes.", "Steven Durels", "Yes. Well, I think Marc mentioned that One Vanderbilt has got an announcement imminent. So the high end of the market is very healthy. There was tremendous number of $100-plus rents signed last year. And I think what's most important is that in that $100 market, the size of the average tenants have increased dramatically. The number of buildings that are getting $100 rents and the size of leases being signed at $100 rents is growing, and that is a very good signal about that part of the marketplace. As a matter of fact, the average $100 rent last year was 25,000 square foot leases.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "James Feldman", "Can you guys talk about your Emerge212 platform and just kind of your general take on co-working and what you think it means for the market, both in the coming year and longer term?", "Marc Holliday", "Sure. Emerge has three locations right now at 3 Columbus, 125 Park and 1185 Sixth. 1185 Sixth is a relatively new facility, so we're in lease-up phase on that facility. The other two facilities are stabilized. We've seen a very healthy demand in that sector. I would say we appeal to a more corporate fractional office user, and that's why we have a lot of tenants that graduate into our portfolio as longer-term space tenants from Emerge. We don't appeal to like a tech, very informal sort of open-benching type environment. So the business has been healthy and, I would say, is trending with profit margins pretty stable to where they've been historically. We don't forecast any explosive growth with the co-working trends as they're evolving.", "James Feldman", "Okay. I mean, do you expect to convert more space into that platform?", "Marc Holliday", "We're always evaluating additional spaces. The spaces that we have are profitable and the space works well for the business, but we don't have anything budgeted this year because we're still on lease-up on 1185.", "James Feldman", "Okay. And then you guys mentioned in the press release that you expect to -- at 2 Herald Square, you expect a transaction later this year. Can you talk more about that, the foreclosure?", "Matthew DiLiberto", "So we're in the foreclosure process, which is a time line that we don't necessarily control and...", "Marc Holliday", "We can't really comment.", "Matthew DiLiberto", "That's all we can say on it, yes.", "James Feldman", "Okay. Do I get one more question or that's it?", "Marc Holliday", "We're a foreclosing lender, and that's it.", "James Feldman", "Okay. Then for my second question, can you just talk about your plans at 1185 Sixth? I see it's now under construction.", "Steven Durels", "Yes. So you're talking specifically on the leasing front. So we're in a redevelopment program there that entails a new lobby, elevator cabs, new entrance to the building. That's in anticipation of roll that comes to us of about 170,000 square feet in August of '18 and another 170,000 square feet at the end of 2020. The good news on that story is that we have a number of leases out right now, sizable leases ranging between 50,000 and 100,000 square feet, that will start to knock off some of that early roll. So before it ever goes dark, we're already actively negotiating leases and term sheets for pre-letting a big chunk of the space.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lewis with SunTrust.", "Michael Lewis", "You started to address this question in your answer to a previous question, but one of the things investors ask me often is, what type of space is mostly impacted by new supply in Manhattan? Is it high price point because that's in direct competition with Hudson Yards? Is it lower-quality space because now that there finally is some new space, tenants start to move up the quality spectrum? Are there certain areas of the city that are more at risk? So rather than me continue to struggle to answer the question, I thought I'd pose it to the experts.", "Marc Holliday", "So the question is, within our portfolio, which of our space competes most directly against new construction space?", "Michael Lewis", "New York hasn't had a lot of brand-new supply like this at once. So when there is new supply like this in Manhattan, what space is most at risk from the competition?", "Marc Holliday", "Yes. Okay. So again, the amount of space that is going to be delivered annually over the next five years, I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I thought it was net of about 2.5 million square feet or so and more than what we're accustomed to because we're accustomed to like 0 on a 400 million square foot inventory. And without all the subsidies, new construction was very hard to get done except in isolated instances. So the Hudson Yards opened up an ability to bring on, I think, ultimately 20 million feet but that's over a very long period of time, 2 million to 3 million square feet a year against what, I think, Steve, you said earlier, last year's total was 28 million square feet of leasing.", "Steven Durels", "30 million.", "Marc Holliday", "30 million square feet of leasing. So I know it gets a lot of headlines, and we'll answer the question for sure, but also recognize we signed about 250 leases a year, one every business day. The vast majority of those are not competing against the new construction projects. I would say out of the 250 leases in any given year, maybe 5 or 10 at most might be looking at new construction as an alternative, whereas, generally, the competition is other built space in the submarket the tenant wants to be in. So that's a -- we're talking about a very small fraction. So I would say, generally, new construction is going to compete with new construction. Our existing portfolio generally is competing with these Midtown, but there are exceptions. I guess 1185 Sixth, we have 1 or 2 tenants that are going to -- that are sort of West and will be -- 1 tenant that will be going further West. But you're talking about a couple out of hundreds. So it's not something we encounter on a daily, weekly, monthly basis. We're generally competing against other landlords within our submarket.", "Michael Lewis", "That's helpful. My second question, I just wanted to ask about this Navillus bankruptcy. I don't know if I'm saying that right. But from everything I read, it sounds like they're working as if nothing's happening. But is there potential that maybe that could cause some delays in the time line at One Vanderbilt?", "Marc Holliday", "No, we have that, I think, completely ringfenced. I mean, with Liberty now standing behind Navillus, I think they're one of the strongest contractors out there. So what we were able to negotiate and I think has been presented to the bankruptcy court is an appropriate set of protections for the project with their surety standing behind them. And work has continued uninterrupted. And most importantly, I think there's an alignment that both Navillus, the surety and even the creditors want to see those union jobs continue to be in place through the balance of the project. And we've had -- there's been no disruption nor do we expect it. And if there would be, we have contingency plans.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Rob Simone with Evercore ISI.", "Robert Simone", "I have a follow-up on the earlier question on buyback. Let's assume just hypothetically that you guys -- in your judgment, conditions are right for additional buybacks once the existing authorization is fully expended, and you thought it made sense to sell a couple -- sell or JV a couple of additional assets. What's like in your mind -- or could you discuss, in your mind, the theoretical limit to doing that? Like how far would you take that asset disposition program vis-\u00e0-vis like just your overall portfolio size?", "Marc Holliday", "Yes. I mean, that's really -- it's a board-level matter when it comes to these buyback programs. We have not played out a scenario of -- that kind of what-if scenario so I just can't answer it. I understand the question. I just -- I can't answer it because I don't know and we haven't projected for that eventuality. I mean, when we approve the buyback programs, they're in a certain amount of share, certain amount of dollars, and everything is generally tied to a plan of a funding. So we look at it in terms of funding plan, buyback plan, and we take it very incrementally but in large incremental steps.", "First one was $1 billion. Second one was $0.5 billion. So I think when we will next discuss, it will be a discussion with respect to the next increment without necessarily taking that future trip all the way to what could it possibly be. If everything stays the same as today because -- as we all know, things don't stay the same. Everything changes. Markets change. Stock price change. Funding sources change. So I think these plans -- or strategies are best planned for in increments of 6 to 12 months, where you have relatively good visibility. Even then, it's not perfect, but let's just call it relatively good visibility. And that's -- these programs are generally executed within that kind of time frame. But beyond that, we'll just sort of take it as it comes. And as I said earlier, when we have more on that, you guys will certainly be the first to know.", "Robert Simone", "Marc, that's really -- the color is really helpful. And then, Steve, I just have one quick follow-up on One Vanderbilt. You mentioned that your discussions are kind of following within your underwriting. Would you guys still kind of stick to your prior comments that '18 is really the year where you'd like to see some meaningful progress on leasing? Or has there been any kind of like slippage on timing into '19?", "Steven Durels", "Yes. We think we'll be on plan with our projection. We're off to a good start with a nice sized lease that you'll hear about shortly. And as we sit in January, we've got a pipeline of transactions that we're chasing. So if those come to fruition, then we feel that we'll hit our targets for the year.", "Operator", "Our next one comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Just had a question on sort of expected mark-to-market cadence over the year and into '19. I know you've said sort of 6% to 9% for Manhattan. If we look at sort of the breakout, it seems like you have a nice mark to market in the first quarter but then it sort of really decelerates. Just wondering -- obviously, there are different levers in there, but just wondering if there's any quarter where we, at least theoretically, could see flat to maybe negative mark to market over the next, say, 12, 18 months?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, we've only forecasted out through year-end, I would only look out 4 more quarters. I can't speak to 5 or 6 or more than that. And I would caution that trying to -- the leasing may sound mechanical. The leasing -- and we may even not give enough credit at -- due credit at times to the leasing group and make it mechanical, but the reality is the leasing is tough. And it can trip by a week, a day, a month, and it goes from what we thought would be in March is April and then trips quarters and everything changes. I really would urge everyone to look at it annually and not read too much into any quarter's results, whether it's volume, whether it's mark to market. I feel confident within -- over the next 11.5 months or 11 months, we'll be in that 6% to 9% range because that's the guidance we've given. When you start breaking it down to quarters, I feel like it's rife for misses that are -- misses without a distinction. With that said, Matt, I assume we are expecting some of the early pipeline to be higher than the 6% to 9% range; and the back half of the year, lower than 6% to 9% range.", "Matthew DiLiberto", "Yes, that's right.", "Marc Holliday", "I can't speak to whether it goes negative in any quarter. We're not projecting that. It could. And if it does, it doesn't mean the 6% to 9% is any less credible. It's just things have a way of working out timing-wise. But I guess it would be fair to say we've got some bigger leases rolling, bigger expected to be transacted that have lesser mark to market in the back half of the year.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Got it. And then just on the street retail environment, maybe just give us some updated thoughts on where are we in the correction process and if you can give us an update on 719. I think it sounded like you were imminently going to announce the lease there at the Investor Day. So any color would be helpful.", "Marc Holliday", "Sure. 719 is still in process. The deal's been a challenge. We acknowledge it was more of a challenge than we expected. And I think we're still in sort of a discovery phase in terms of the market block by block. So we're still definitely showing a lot of tenant space. There's still good activity. There are very few vacancies that we have, but I would say we need some more price discovery in the market in terms of taking rents and values to really assess where we stand at this point.", "Vikram Malhotra", "So just to clarify, just timing-wise on 719, is it tough to say right now? Or could it be first half or second? Any color?", "Marc Holliday", "It's tough to say right now.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.", "Vincent Chao", "Marc, I just want to go back to something you said pretty early in your comments just in regards to the transaction market maybe having a flattish volumes here in 2018 but still seeing good demand for the quality assets and a lack of supply keeping prices relatively strong. Just curious what your thoughts are and why the supply would be constrained if the market conditions are pretty good. Just curious why volumes would be flat.", "Marc Holliday", "Well, you've heard me talk about in the past how this market every year gets incrementally more and more securitized, more product in the hands of a concentrated group of landlords. Top 15 is what I traditionally referred to, and I think the top 15 in New York own about half the inventory thereabouts. And that number has been growing. And owners like us and others are just far more judicious in terms of when we feel an asset has -- especially a very valuable, well-located asset, has met its true sort of level of maturity, where it's time to monetize. And very often, even with deals that we have put through a cycle of redevelopment leasing, we still see upside often, as certainly was the case with a deal like 1515 Broadway and others. So in those cases, we go out and bring in a JV partner for maybe, in the case of One Vanderbilt, 27% of the deal; in the case of 1515, 49% of the deal -- or 43% of the deal, sorry.", "And a lot of the top landlords also do the same type of strategy. So what you have are much more of the product is kind of bespoke transactions. They're not just marketed bid deals. They're longer-term negotiations with domestic and foreign capital partners, where chemistry and terms are much more important or as important as price, and you're creating a partnership that will last years, 5, 10, 15 years or more. So those deals for the bigger assets especially take away from the supply of what would otherwise be available for 100% sale on a bid basis. So when I look at that pipeline, I'd say half of the pipeline we see right now are kind of these 50% interest kind of deals, and they're very interesting. We did one on Worldwide Plaza. It was a very good deal. Us -- RXR and NYRT did a deal just like that on Worldwide, and we did one on -- as I said, on 1515. And Brookfield did one on One Liberty and on and on. I'm not going to belabor all of them.", "They're out there. But there'll be a lot more of those. And what those kinds of deals do is they shrink the supply of just outright sales. And you have a lot of capital out there. For every one JV partner, there's maybe 100 other investors who want to be a JV partner or a buyer. And they have their own goals and objectives to acquire product in the best market. New York is still considered right among the top of those markets. And it's very hard to buy in New York, especially, I think, in today's environment, where a lot of assets are only partially for sale.", "Vincent Chao", "Okay. And second question, sorry if I missed it earlier, we've been talking about the leasing pipeline quite a bit on the call, but did you guys share the stats in terms of what the size of the pipeline is today and then the breakdown between new and renewal? And then maybe within renewal, how much of that is 2018 expiration versus beyond 2018?", "Steven Durels", "Well, maybe a little more granular that I've got, but I'll share this with you. Of the 1,200,000 square feet, we've got over 500,000 square feet of leases that are in negotiation. There's almost 650,000 square feet of term sheets that we think have a high probability of being converted over to leases. The general tenant makeup of the tenants that are -- the leases out for negotiation -- I'm sorry, of the total pipeline, there's over 500,000 square feet that are financial-related firms. There's about 190,000 square feet of TAMI-type tenants. And then the balance of the tenant profiles are everything from engineering to automotive to general business services, so a very wide group of types of tenants. Of the leases that are -- the 500,000 square feet of leases that are in negotiation as opposed to term sheets, 400,000 square feet of that are new tenants coming into the portfolio. So hopefully, that helps.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel.", "John Guinee", "SL Green is trading just stunningly inexpensive on a per pound basis, which leaves me to believe that there's a lot of OpEx or tax increases recently. Is that going to -- is that accurate, one? And is that going to abate anytime soon?", "Marc Holliday", "Well, in terms of OpEx increases, there's been -- other than real estate taxes, it's been quite contained. I think our -- Ed and his whole operations team managing a 28 million square foot portfolio gets the most efficiency we can out of this portfolio. And I think our increase year-over-year is generally around 2% for everything, including insurance. But for real estate taxes, which, even our -- the best of our teams and outside counsel were subject to the vagaries of a very outdated and really quite unfair system, where commercial properties and owners like us are bearing the lion's share of the -- of a heavily increasing tax burden that far outstrips any notion of kind of rate of inflation or appropriate rate of increase. If we're 2% on OpEx, we might be anywhere from 6% to 8% on real estate taxes.", "And over a period of years, it really is something that warrants a lot of scrutiny by the current administration, which I know has taken it up as something that they will look at during the second term of this administration. So I would say, generally, we are excellent at containing those costs. And that certainly gives rise in part to why we've been able to create such extraordinary value in the portfolio, which, as you point out, John, is wildly disconnected from the stock price.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors.", "Joseph Reagan", "A question for Steve. Steve, you mentioned that face rents have increased over the past 12 months in Manhattan. Just curious if you can talk about the order of magnitude increases you've seen and maybe which submarkets have shown more strength than others.", "Steven Durels", "Well, the overall Manhattan rents went up modestly. They were up -- I think most of the reports would say they were up in the -- around 3% year-over-year. Concessions went up. So net effect is we're sort of flat over the year. And I think that we're seeing better than -- better execution on many of our transactions than where we budgeted deals. So I think we're just kind of on a trend line to see some additional modest rent appreciation as we go into 2018 as well.", "Joseph Reagan", "Any sense of kind of which submarkets are doing better than others?", "Steven Durels", "Well, a lot of the demand in the Midtown market, and Midtown was a very active market in Manhattan in 2017. Grand Central was particularly active in the fourth quarter. Sixth Avenue Rock Center was the single most active market in the fourth quarter. But for the entire year, Grand Central was extremely active. And I think you've seen good rent appreciation on the commodity, kind of value part of the market. But then at the very high end of the market on new construction, as evidenced by sort of the later-stage leasing being done over Hudson Yards, you've seen huge rent acceleration, right? The most recent deals that were done over in Hudson Yards, some of those buildings get to the end of their lease-up program where rents are in the $120, $130 price point. And I'm quite certain that those numbers well exceed the developer's underwritten number.", "Joseph Reagan", "Great. That's helpful. And then just one other quick one. It looks like your third-largest tenant, Ralph Lauren, has an expiration next year at 625 Madison. Any visibility at this point into what their plans are? And is there a roll-up opportunity at that space?", "Steven Durels", "Not a lot of visibility from what they've told us. They've really been focused on other leases that were expiring in their portfolio, some in Manhattan, many of it -- much of it in New Jersey. We're -- we've had some preliminary conversations with them. Obviously, our goal is to keep them. It's a very rent-attractive opportunity for them to save rent by staying. So we're -- we hope to be in front of them with a very aggressive proposal shortly.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from the line of Jon Petersen with Jefferies.", "Jonathan Petersen", "Just one for me. So the leasing volumes this quarter fell a little short of your 2017 guidance. You guys mentioned it in the press release and said it was because some leases slipped to 2018. So I was curious for some more details on that. You keep talking about a large and pending lease, I think, at One Vanderbilt. Is that one of the ones that slipped? And also, just kind of a follow-up. Because some of the stuff shifted over into 2018, does that mean your leasing guidance in 2018 is more like 1.7 million square feet instead of the 1.6 million you laid out at your Investor Day?", "Marc Holliday", "Yes. I would say that the -- some of the leasing that occurred in the first part of January was on account of what we expected to have at the end of December. So I guess we could hold Steve responsible for that 2 weeks, and you'll have to -- there'll be a reckoning for that later on but.", "Steven Durels", "This is where the unappreciated part of lease is.", "Marc Holliday", "But I guess, certainly, it was not part -- you would say that the guidance for the year is probably up 100 because it would include that which slipped, yes. ", "Okay. And operator, I think that's what we have time for. So thank you very much for all the questions and for dialing in today. And we look forward to speaking to you on the next round.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.
